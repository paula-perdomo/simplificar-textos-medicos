Mental health promotion, prevention, and treatments for mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and post\\u2010traumatic stress disorder may work differently in these groups of people than for the general population. This overview of systematic reviews summarises the characteristics of reviews available on this topic, to help us determine which research questions are the most important to address in future Cochrane reviews. \\nWe searched for systematic reviews and protocols of systematic reviews on mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental health problems for refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Mental health promotion may, for example, involve a classroom\\u2010based well\\u2010being intervention for children. An example of prevention is trauma\\u2010focused therapy to prevent post\\u2010traumatic stress disorder. Treatment may, for example, include psychological therapy for depression. We found 23 systematic reviews and 15 protocols of reviews in progress. Together the 23 published systematic reviews included 336 references, 175 of which were unique studies. Reviews more commonly included refugees and asylum seekers than internally displaced persons, and were more frequently focused on adults than children. There was more attention on the treatment of post\\u2010traumatic stress disorder than there was for mental health promotion or prevention, or for the treatment of depression or anxiety. Studies of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, and integrative and interpersonal therapies were most likely to be included in reviews. \\nThe quality of reviews was limited by a range of issues, many of which related to poor reporting of the review methodology. \\nThe evidence available from systematic reviews may not match the need for evidence\\u2010based interventions for the mental health of involuntary migrants. Review authors should consider relevant groups such as internally displaced persons, children, and people with depression or anxiety, and relevant interventions such as those for mental health promotion or prevention, and treatments other than psychological therapy. \\n\",\n          \"What surgical procedure works best to slow the progression of keratoconus (an eye disease)? \\nWhy is this question important?Keratoconus is a disease that affects the thin, clear outer layer of the eye, known as the cornea. Normally, the cornea is dome\\u2010shaped. In people with keratoconus, the cornea slowly thins, and a cone\\u2010shaped bulge develops in the center of the cornea. The disease usually begins between the ages of teens and 40, and persists throughout life. It causes blurry or distorted vision that may not be improved by wearing glasses and may result in perforation of the cornea and other visual problems. \\nTreatments such as glasses and contact lenses can be used to improve the vision of people with keratoconus. However, these do not slow the progression of the disease. The only treatment known to slow disease progression is \\u2018corneal collagen crosslinking\\u2019 (CXL). \\nCXL is a surgical procedure that aims to strengthen the cornea and prevent further thinning. It involves shining ultraviolet A (invisible) light rays onto eyes that have been treated with eye drops containing riboflavin (a vitamin). When the light rays meet the riboflavin, new links form between the fibers that make up the cornea. \\nThere are two types of CXL. One type requires the removal of the cells on surface of the cornea, to make it easier for the riboflavin to reach the cornea. This procedure is called \\u2018epithelium\\u2010off CXL\\u2019. The other type does not require the removal of these cells. This procedure is called \\u2018transepithelial CXL\\u2019. Surgeons who carry out this procedure can use chemicals to help riboflavin penetrate the cells on the surface of the cornea. They can also deliver riboflavin to the cornea using a small electrical current (iontophoresis). \\nEpithelium\\u2010off CXL is the more commonly used procedure. However, transepithelial CXL could have advantages, such as faster healing and less patient discomfort. We reviewed the evidence to find out which of these two procedures is more beneficial and less risky for people with keratoconus. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched the medical literature for studies that compared epithelium\\u2010off CXL against transepithelial CXL. Then we compared the results and summarized the evidence from all the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. \\nWhat did we find?We found 13 studies with a total of 567 people. The studies took place in Europe, the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The shortest studies lasted six months, and the longest study lasted more than three years. Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis against epithelium\\u2010off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis against epithelium\\u2010off CXL. \\nTransepithelial CXL without iontophoresis compared to epithelium\\u2010off CXL \\nWe do not know if one procedure is better than the other for preventing progression of keratoconus or visual loss because too few robust studies have compared the effects of these two CXL methods. \\nEvidence from four studies suggests that corneal hazing (clouding of the cornea) or scarring are probably more common with epithelium\\u2010off CXL. \\nTransepithelial CXL with iontophoresis compared to epithelium\\u2010off CXL \\nEvidence from two studies suggests that there may be little to no difference between the two procedures in changes to vision clarity. We do not know if one procedure is better than the other to prevent progression of keratoconus because two few robust studies have compared the two methods. \\nThe evidence does not suggest that one procedure leads to more unwanted events than the other. However, our confidence in this evidence is low, because it is based on three studies that did not use robust methods. \\nWhat does this mean?Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if epithelium\\u2010off CXL or transepithelial CXL is better for slowing keratoconus progression. \\nAdverse events such as corneal hazing or scarring are probably more common with epithelium\\u2010off CXL than with transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis. \\nWe need more and larger studies to strengthen the evidence. These should compare the benefits and the risks of different CXL procedures. Studies should aim to follow patients for more than 12 months, so that long\\u2010term effects can be compared as it can take at least that much time for corneal tissue to heal from any procedure. \\nHow\\u2010up\\u2010to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to January 2020. \\n\",\n          \"Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions \\nWhy is this review important? \\nMore than one in ten children and adolescents have long\\u2010term physical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems like anxiety or depression. Treating these problems early can prevent difficulties with family life, school, and future mental health problems. It is currently unclear whether psychological therapies (talking therapies) designed for children and adolescents without medical issues are appropriate for use with this population. \\nWho will be interested in this review? \\nThis review will be of interest to mental and medical healthcare providers, service users, and service commissioners. \\nWhat questions does this review aim to answer? \\nThis review aims to answer the following questions: 1) Are psychological therapies better than a range of other therapies in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions? and 2) Are psychological therapies acceptable to this audience? \\nWhich studies were included in the review? \\nWe searched a number of databases to find all high\\u2010quality trials of psychological therapies for anxiety or depression in children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with long\\u2010term physical conditions and symptoms of anxiety or depression, published from 1970 to September 2018. We included twenty\\u2010nine studies with a total of 1349 people in the review and rated the overall quality of the studies as 'low to moderate'. \\nWhat does the evidence from the review tell us? \\nA handful of psychological therapies have been researched in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions. Most of these were developed for use with children and adolescents who do not have long\\u2010term physical conditions. Some of these, particularly those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and therapies specifically designed to treat depression or anxiety, are effective at reducing mild symptoms of these conditions in the short term. There is limited evidence that such therapies are acceptable to young people and that they can improve quality of life and symptoms of long\\u2010term physical conditions. There is currently a lack of therapies for addressing health\\u2010related anxiety in this population. \\nWhat should happen next? \\nFurther research should be undertaken to develop more effective psychological therapies to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## Help for Migrants' Mental Health\\n\\n### Rationale\\n\\nMany people must leave their homes. They are called involuntary migrants. This group includes refugees, asylum seekers, and those forced to move within their own country. This move can be very hard. People often feel sad, worried, or scared. They may have been through bad events. These feelings can lead to mental health problems. Examples are sadness (depression), worry (anxiety), and stress after trauma (PTSD).\\n\\nIt is important to help these people. We want to find the best ways to keep them well. We also want to stop mental health problems from starting. And we want to treat problems when they happen. What works for others might not work for migrants. This is why we need special studies. This study helps us see what we know and what we still need to learn. It helps us plan future research. We want to find the most helpful treatments for migrants.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\n\\nThis study looked at other studies. It is like a study of studies. We searched for many papers. These papers were about mental health help for migrants. We looked for studies that brought together results from many smaller studies. These are called systematic reviews. We also looked for plans for new studies. These plans are called protocols.\\n\\nWe looked at different types of help. This included ways to keep people healthy. An example is teaching children about well-being in school. We also looked at ways to stop problems. An example is therapy to prevent PTSD. We also looked at ways to treat problems. An example is therapy for sadness. We included migrants of all ages. We looked at people who had been forced to leave their homes. The study did not involve new patients. It reviewed existing research.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe found many studies. We found 23 completed studies. We also found 15 plans for new studies. The 23 studies looked at 336 other research papers. From these, 175 were new studies not seen before.\\n\\nMost studies looked at refugees and asylum seekers. Fewer studies looked at people moved within their own country. More studies focused on adults than on children. Many studies looked at treating PTSD. Fewer studies looked at keeping people well or preventing problems. There were also fewer studies on sadness or worry. Some types of talk therapy were often studied. These included Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Narrative Exposure Therapy.\\n\\nWe found that these studies were good, but they could be better. They sometimes did not explain how they did their research very well. This makes it harder to trust their findings completely.\\n\\nWe still need more research. The help available might not meet all the needs of migrants. Future studies should include more groups. These include children and people with sadness or worry. They should also look at new ways to help. This includes keeping people well and preventing problems. We also need to look at treatments other than just talk therapy. This will help us find the best ways to help all migrants.\",\n          \"## Plain Language Summary: Eye Disease Treatment Study\\n\\n### Plain Title\\n\\nWhich Eye Surgery Works Best for a Thin Cornea?\\n\\n### Rationale\\n\\nYour eye has a clear front layer called the cornea. It is shaped like a dome. A disease called keratoconus makes your cornea thin out. It then bulges into a cone shape. This disease starts in your teens or early 40s. It stays with you your whole life.\\n\\nKeratoconus makes your vision blurry. Glasses may not help. It can also harm your eye in other ways. Glasses and contact lenses can help you see better. But they do not stop the disease from getting worse.\\n\\nOnly one treatment can slow the disease. It is called corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL). This surgery makes your cornea stronger. It stops it from getting thinner.\\n\\nCXL uses special eye drops and light. The drops have a vitamin called riboflavin. The light is an invisible type called ultraviolet A. When the light hits the riboflavin, new links form in your cornea. These links make your cornea stronger.\\n\\nThere are two main types of CXL. One type removes the top layer of cells from your cornea. This helps the riboflavin get into your eye. It is called \\\"epithelium-off CXL.\\\" The other type does not remove these cells. It is called \\\"transepithelial CXL.\\\"\\n\\nSurgeons can use chemicals to help the riboflavin get into your eye for transepithelial CXL. They can also use a small electric current. This is called iontophoresis.\\n\\nEpithelium-off CXL is used more often. But transepithelial CXL might be better. It could mean faster healing. It might also cause less pain. We wanted to find out which surgery works best. We also wanted to know which one is safer for people with keratoconus.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\n\\nWe looked at studies that compared the two types of CXL surgery. We wanted to see if epithelium-off CXL was better than transepithelial CXL. We checked studies where the top layer of cells was removed versus not removed. We also looked at studies where an electric current was used to help the riboflavin.\\n\\nWe searched medical journals for these studies. We then put all the results together. We looked at how strong the studies were. We checked how they were done. We also looked at how many people were in each study. We made sure the results were similar across studies. This helped us trust the information more.\\n\\nWe found 13 studies to look at. A total of 567 people were in these studies. The studies took place in many parts of the world. Some were in Europe. Others were in the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The shortest studies lasted for six months. The longest study followed people for over three years. This helped us see long-term effects.\\n\\nEleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without the electric current to epithelium-off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with the electric current to epithelium-off CXL.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe found some important things. We do not know if one surgery is better than the other. This is for stopping keratoconus from getting worse. We also do not know which one is better for keeping your vision. There were not enough strong studies to tell us this for sure.\\n\\nHowever, four studies showed something key. It seems that epithelium-off CXL causes more clouding or scars on the cornea. This is compared to transepithelial CXL without the electric current.\\n\\nFor transepithelial CXL with the electric current, two studies gave us some clues. They suggest there is little change in how clear your vision is with either surgery. Again, we do not know if one works better to stop the disease. There were not enough strong studies.\\n\\nThe studies did not show one surgery caused more bad events than the other. But we are not very sure about this. This is because these three studies were not very strong.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we need more studies. These studies need to be larger and stronger. We need to compare the good and bad parts of both CXL surgeries. Studies should follow people for more than a year. This is so we can see how the eyes heal over time. It can take that long for the eye to get better. This review used information up to January 2020.\",\n          \"**Plain Title:** Helping Kids with Long-Term Illness Feel Better\\n\\n**Rationale**\\n\\nMany kids and teens have long-term health problems. These include things like asthma, diabetes, or cancer. When kids have these issues, they often feel sad or worried. They might get problems like anxiety or depression. These feelings can make life hard. It can affect school and family. It can also cause problems with their mental health later on.\\n\\nWe wanted to know if \\\"talk therapy\\\" could help these kids. Talk therapy helps people learn to cope. It helps them feel better about their thoughts and feelings. We needed to see if these therapies, often used for kids without long-term illnesses, would work for kids with health problems too. We also wanted to know if kids would be okay with this kind of therapy.\\n\\n**Trial Design**\\n\\nWe looked at many studies. These studies were about talk therapy. We looked for studies on kids and teens. These young people were 18 years old or younger. They all had a long-term health problem. They also felt anxious or sad.\\n\\nWe searched studies from 1970 to 2018. We found 29 studies that fit our needs. A total of 1349 people were in these studies. We checked how good the studies were. Most studies were of low to medium quality.\\n\\n**Results**\\n\\nWe found some talk therapies that helped. These therapies worked for kids with long-term health problems. Many of these therapies used a method called CBT. CBT helps people change their thinking patterns. It helps them deal with tough feelings.\\n\\nThese therapies were good at making mild sadness and worry go away. This help lasted for a short time. We also saw that kids seemed to like these therapies. They may also help kids feel better about their lives. The therapies might even help with their physical health problems.\\n\\nHowever, there are not many therapies for health-related worry. This is worry about the illness itself. We need more studies. We need to find even better ways to help these kids. We want to find therapies made just for them. These new therapies should help kids with long-term health problems feel their best.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Mental health promotion, prevention, and treatments for mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and post\\u2010traumatic stress disorder may work differently in these groups of people than for the general population. This overview of systematic reviews summarises the characteristics of reviews available on this topic, to help us determine which research questions are the most important to address in future Cochrane reviews. \\nWe searched for systematic reviews and protocols of systematic reviews on mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental health problems for refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Mental health promotion may, for example, involve a classroom\\u2010based well\\u2010being intervention for children. An example of prevention is trauma\\u2010focused therapy to prevent post\\u2010traumatic stress disorder. Treatment may, for example, include psychological therapy for depression. We found 23 systematic reviews and 15 protocols of reviews in progress. Together the 23 published systematic reviews included 336 references, 175 of which were unique studies. Reviews more commonly included refugees and asylum seekers than internally displaced persons, and were more frequently focused on adults than children. There was more attention on the treatment of post\\u2010traumatic stress disorder than there was for mental health promotion or prevention, or for the treatment of depression or anxiety. Studies of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, and integrative and interpersonal therapies were most likely to be included in reviews. \\nThe quality of reviews was limited by a range of issues, many of which related to poor reporting of the review methodology. \\nThe evidence available from systematic reviews may not match the need for evidence\\u2010based interventions for the mental health of involuntary migrants. Review authors should consider relevant groups such as internally displaced persons, children, and people with depression or anxiety, and relevant interventions such as those for mental health promotion or prevention, and treatments other than psychological therapy. \\n\",\n          \"What surgical procedure works best to slow the progression of keratoconus (an eye disease)? \\nWhy is this question important?Keratoconus is a disease that affects the thin, clear outer layer of the eye, known as the cornea. Normally, the cornea is dome\\u2010shaped. In people with keratoconus, the cornea slowly thins, and a cone\\u2010shaped bulge develops in the center of the cornea. The disease usually begins between the ages of teens and 40, and persists throughout life. It causes blurry or distorted vision that may not be improved by wearing glasses and may result in perforation of the cornea and other visual problems. \\nTreatments such as glasses and contact lenses can be used to improve the vision of people with keratoconus. However, these do not slow the progression of the disease. The only treatment known to slow disease progression is \\u2018corneal collagen crosslinking\\u2019 (CXL). \\nCXL is a surgical procedure that aims to strengthen the cornea and prevent further thinning. It involves shining ultraviolet A (invisible) light rays onto eyes that have been treated with eye drops containing riboflavin (a vitamin). When the light rays meet the riboflavin, new links form between the fibers that make up the cornea. \\nThere are two types of CXL. One type requires the removal of the cells on surface of the cornea, to make it easier for the riboflavin to reach the cornea. This procedure is called \\u2018epithelium\\u2010off CXL\\u2019. The other type does not require the removal of these cells. This procedure is called \\u2018transepithelial CXL\\u2019. Surgeons who carry out this procedure can use chemicals to help riboflavin penetrate the cells on the surface of the cornea. They can also deliver riboflavin to the cornea using a small electrical current (iontophoresis). \\nEpithelium\\u2010off CXL is the more commonly used procedure. However, transepithelial CXL could have advantages, such as faster healing and less patient discomfort. We reviewed the evidence to find out which of these two procedures is more beneficial and less risky for people with keratoconus. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched the medical literature for studies that compared epithelium\\u2010off CXL against transepithelial CXL. Then we compared the results and summarized the evidence from all the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. \\nWhat did we find?We found 13 studies with a total of 567 people. The studies took place in Europe, the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The shortest studies lasted six months, and the longest study lasted more than three years. Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis against epithelium\\u2010off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis against epithelium\\u2010off CXL. \\nTransepithelial CXL without iontophoresis compared to epithelium\\u2010off CXL \\nWe do not know if one procedure is better than the other for preventing progression of keratoconus or visual loss because too few robust studies have compared the effects of these two CXL methods. \\nEvidence from four studies suggests that corneal hazing (clouding of the cornea) or scarring are probably more common with epithelium\\u2010off CXL. \\nTransepithelial CXL with iontophoresis compared to epithelium\\u2010off CXL \\nEvidence from two studies suggests that there may be little to no difference between the two procedures in changes to vision clarity. We do not know if one procedure is better than the other to prevent progression of keratoconus because two few robust studies have compared the two methods. \\nThe evidence does not suggest that one procedure leads to more unwanted events than the other. However, our confidence in this evidence is low, because it is based on three studies that did not use robust methods. \\nWhat does this mean?Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if epithelium\\u2010off CXL or transepithelial CXL is better for slowing keratoconus progression. \\nAdverse events such as corneal hazing or scarring are probably more common with epithelium\\u2010off CXL than with transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis. \\nWe need more and larger studies to strengthen the evidence. These should compare the benefits and the risks of different CXL procedures. Studies should aim to follow patients for more than 12 months, so that long\\u2010term effects can be compared as it can take at least that much time for corneal tissue to heal from any procedure. \\nHow\\u2010up\\u2010to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to January 2020. \\n\",\n          \"Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions \\nWhy is this review important? \\nMore than one in ten children and adolescents have long\\u2010term physical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems like anxiety or depression. Treating these problems early can prevent difficulties with family life, school, and future mental health problems. It is currently unclear whether psychological therapies (talking therapies) designed for children and adolescents without medical issues are appropriate for use with this population. \\nWho will be interested in this review? \\nThis review will be of interest to mental and medical healthcare providers, service users, and service commissioners. \\nWhat questions does this review aim to answer? \\nThis review aims to answer the following questions: 1) Are psychological therapies better than a range of other therapies in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions? and 2) Are psychological therapies acceptable to this audience? \\nWhich studies were included in the review? \\nWe searched a number of databases to find all high\\u2010quality trials of psychological therapies for anxiety or depression in children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with long\\u2010term physical conditions and symptoms of anxiety or depression, published from 1970 to September 2018. We included twenty\\u2010nine studies with a total of 1349 people in the review and rated the overall quality of the studies as 'low to moderate'. \\nWhat does the evidence from the review tell us? \\nA handful of psychological therapies have been researched in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions. Most of these were developed for use with children and adolescents who do not have long\\u2010term physical conditions. Some of these, particularly those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and therapies specifically designed to treat depression or anxiety, are effective at reducing mild symptoms of these conditions in the short term. There is limited evidence that such therapies are acceptable to young people and that they can improve quality of life and symptoms of long\\u2010term physical conditions. There is currently a lack of therapies for addressing health\\u2010related anxiety in this population. \\nWhat should happen next? \\nFurther research should be undertaken to develop more effective psychological therapies to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## Help for Migrants' Mental Health\\n\\n### Rationale\\n\\nMany people must leave their homes. They are called involuntary migrants. This group includes refugees, asylum seekers, and those forced to move within their own country. This move can be very hard. People often feel sad, worried, or scared. They may have been through bad events. These feelings can lead to mental health problems. Examples are sadness (depression), worry (anxiety), and stress after trauma (PTSD).\\n\\nIt is important to help these people. We want to find the best ways to keep them well. We also want to stop mental health problems from starting. And we want to treat problems when they happen. What works for others might not work for migrants. This is why we need special studies. This study helps us see what we know and what we still need to learn. It helps us plan future research. We want to find the most helpful treatments for migrants.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\n\\nThis study looked at other studies. It is like a study of studies. We searched for many papers. These papers were about mental health help for migrants. We looked for studies that brought together results from many smaller studies. These are called systematic reviews. We also looked for plans for new studies. These plans are called protocols.\\n\\nWe looked at different types of help. This included ways to keep people healthy. An example is teaching children about well-being in school. We also looked at ways to stop problems. An example is therapy to prevent PTSD. We also looked at ways to treat problems. An example is therapy for sadness. We included migrants of all ages. We looked at people who had been forced to leave their homes. The study did not involve new patients. It reviewed existing research.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe found many studies. We found 23 completed studies. We also found 15 plans for new studies. The 23 studies looked at 336 other research papers. From these, 175 were new studies not seen before.\\n\\nMost studies looked at refugees and asylum seekers. Fewer studies looked at people moved within their own country. More studies focused on adults than on children. Many studies looked at treating PTSD. Fewer studies looked at keeping people well or preventing problems. There were also fewer studies on sadness or worry. Some types of talk therapy were often studied. These included Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Narrative Exposure Therapy.\\n\\nWe found that these studies were good, but they could be better. They sometimes did not explain how they did their research very well. This makes it harder to trust their findings completely.\\n\\nWe still need more research. The help available might not meet all the needs of migrants. Future studies should include more groups. These include children and people with sadness or worry. They should also look at new ways to help. This includes keeping people well and preventing problems. We also need to look at treatments other than just talk therapy. This will help us find the best ways to help all migrants.\",\n          \"## Plain Language Summary: Eye Disease Treatment Study\\n\\n### Plain Title\\n\\nWhich Eye Surgery Works Best for a Thin Cornea?\\n\\n### Rationale\\n\\nYour eye has a clear front layer called the cornea. It is shaped like a dome. A disease called keratoconus makes your cornea thin out. It then bulges into a cone shape. This disease starts in your teens or early 40s. It stays with you your whole life.\\n\\nKeratoconus makes your vision blurry. Glasses may not help. It can also harm your eye in other ways. Glasses and contact lenses can help you see better. But they do not stop the disease from getting worse.\\n\\nOnly one treatment can slow the disease. It is called corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL). This surgery makes your cornea stronger. It stops it from getting thinner.\\n\\nCXL uses special eye drops and light. The drops have a vitamin called riboflavin. The light is an invisible type called ultraviolet A. When the light hits the riboflavin, new links form in your cornea. These links make your cornea stronger.\\n\\nThere are two main types of CXL. One type removes the top layer of cells from your cornea. This helps the riboflavin get into your eye. It is called \\\"epithelium-off CXL.\\\" The other type does not remove these cells. It is called \\\"transepithelial CXL.\\\"\\n\\nSurgeons can use chemicals to help the riboflavin get into your eye for transepithelial CXL. They can also use a small electric current. This is called iontophoresis.\\n\\nEpithelium-off CXL is used more often. But transepithelial CXL might be better. It could mean faster healing. It might also cause less pain. We wanted to find out which surgery works best. We also wanted to know which one is safer for people with keratoconus.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\n\\nWe looked at studies that compared the two types of CXL surgery. We wanted to see if epithelium-off CXL was better than transepithelial CXL. We checked studies where the top layer of cells was removed versus not removed. We also looked at studies where an electric current was used to help the riboflavin.\\n\\nWe searched medical journals for these studies. We then put all the results together. We looked at how strong the studies were. We checked how they were done. We also looked at how many people were in each study. We made sure the results were similar across studies. This helped us trust the information more.\\n\\nWe found 13 studies to look at. A total of 567 people were in these studies. The studies took place in many parts of the world. Some were in Europe. Others were in the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The shortest studies lasted for six months. The longest study followed people for over three years. This helped us see long-term effects.\\n\\nEleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without the electric current to epithelium-off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with the electric current to epithelium-off CXL.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe found some important things. We do not know if one surgery is better than the other. This is for stopping keratoconus from getting worse. We also do not know which one is better for keeping your vision. There were not enough strong studies to tell us this for sure.\\n\\nHowever, four studies showed something key. It seems that epithelium-off CXL causes more clouding or scars on the cornea. This is compared to transepithelial CXL without the electric current.\\n\\nFor transepithelial CXL with the electric current, two studies gave us some clues. They suggest there is little change in how clear your vision is with either surgery. Again, we do not know if one works better to stop the disease. There were not enough strong studies.\\n\\nThe studies did not show one surgery caused more bad events than the other. But we are not very sure about this. This is because these three studies were not very strong.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we need more studies. These studies need to be larger and stronger. We need to compare the good and bad parts of both CXL surgeries. Studies should follow people for more than a year. This is so we can see how the eyes heal over time. It can take that long for the eye to get better. This review used information up to January 2020.\",\n          \"**Plain Title:** Helping Kids with Long-Term Illness Feel Better\\n\\n**Rationale**\\n\\nMany kids and teens have long-term health problems. These include things like asthma, diabetes, or cancer. When kids have these issues, they often feel sad or worried. They might get problems like anxiety or depression. These feelings can make life hard. It can affect school and family. It can also cause problems with their mental health later on.\\n\\nWe wanted to know if \\\"talk therapy\\\" could help these kids. Talk therapy helps people learn to cope. It helps them feel better about their thoughts and feelings. We needed to see if these therapies, often used for kids without long-term illnesses, would work for kids with health problems too. We also wanted to know if kids would be okay with this kind of therapy.\\n\\n**Trial Design**\\n\\nWe looked at many studies. These studies were about talk therapy. We looked for studies on kids and teens. These young people were 18 years old or younger. They all had a long-term health problem. They also felt anxious or sad.\\n\\nWe searched studies from 1970 to 2018. We found 29 studies that fit our needs. A total of 1349 people were in these studies. We checked how good the studies were. Most studies were of low to medium quality.\\n\\n**Results**\\n\\nWe found some talk therapies that helped. These therapies worked for kids with long-term health problems. Many of these therapies used a method called CBT. CBT helps people change their thinking patterns. It helps them deal with tough feelings.\\n\\nThese therapies were good at making mild sadness and worry go away. This help lasted for a short time. We also saw that kids seemed to like these therapies. They may also help kids feel better about their lives. The therapies might even help with their physical health problems.\\n\\nHowever, there are not many therapies for health-related worry. This is worry about the illness itself. We need more studies. We need to find even better ways to help these kids. We want to find therapies made just for them. These new therapies should help kids with long-term health problems feel their best.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.028000061019855686,\n        \"min\": 0.8020634651184082,\n        \"max\": 0.8676682114601135,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8020634651184082,\n          0.8676682114601135,\n          0.8101405501365662\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Mental health promotion, prevention, and treatments for mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and post\\u2010traumatic stress disorder may work differently in these groups of people than for the general population. This overview of systematic reviews summarises the characteristics of reviews available on this topic, to help us determine which research questions are the most important to address in future Cochrane reviews. \\nWe searched for systematic reviews and protocols of systematic reviews on mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental health problems for refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Mental health promotion may, for example, involve a classroom\\u2010based well\\u2010being intervention for children. An example of prevention is trauma\\u2010focused therapy to prevent post\\u2010traumatic stress disorder. Treatment may, for example, include psychological therapy for depression. We found 23 systematic reviews and 15 protocols of reviews in progress. Together the 23 published systematic reviews included 336 references, 175 of which were unique studies. Reviews more commonly included refugees and asylum seekers than internally displaced persons, and were more frequently focused on adults than children. There was more attention on the treatment of post\\u2010traumatic stress disorder than there was for mental health promotion or prevention, or for the treatment of depression or anxiety. Studies of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, and integrative and interpersonal therapies were most likely to be included in reviews. \\nThe quality of reviews was limited by a range of issues, many of which related to poor reporting of the review methodology. \\nThe evidence available from systematic reviews may not match the need for evidence\\u2010based interventions for the mental health of involuntary migrants. Review authors should consider relevant groups such as internally displaced persons, children, and people with depression or anxiety, and relevant interventions such as those for mental health promotion or prevention, and treatments other than psychological therapy. \\n\",\n          \"What surgical procedure works best to slow the progression of keratoconus (an eye disease)? \\nWhy is this question important?Keratoconus is a disease that affects the thin, clear outer layer of the eye, known as the cornea. Normally, the cornea is dome\\u2010shaped. In people with keratoconus, the cornea slowly thins, and a cone\\u2010shaped bulge develops in the center of the cornea. The disease usually begins between the ages of teens and 40, and persists throughout life. It causes blurry or distorted vision that may not be improved by wearing glasses and may result in perforation of the cornea and other visual problems. \\nTreatments such as glasses and contact lenses can be used to improve the vision of people with keratoconus. However, these do not slow the progression of the disease. The only treatment known to slow disease progression is \\u2018corneal collagen crosslinking\\u2019 (CXL). \\nCXL is a surgical procedure that aims to strengthen the cornea and prevent further thinning. It involves shining ultraviolet A (invisible) light rays onto eyes that have been treated with eye drops containing riboflavin (a vitamin). When the light rays meet the riboflavin, new links form between the fibers that make up the cornea. \\nThere are two types of CXL. One type requires the removal of the cells on surface of the cornea, to make it easier for the riboflavin to reach the cornea. This procedure is called \\u2018epithelium\\u2010off CXL\\u2019. The other type does not require the removal of these cells. This procedure is called \\u2018transepithelial CXL\\u2019. Surgeons who carry out this procedure can use chemicals to help riboflavin penetrate the cells on the surface of the cornea. They can also deliver riboflavin to the cornea using a small electrical current (iontophoresis). \\nEpithelium\\u2010off CXL is the more commonly used procedure. However, transepithelial CXL could have advantages, such as faster healing and less patient discomfort. We reviewed the evidence to find out which of these two procedures is more beneficial and less risky for people with keratoconus. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched the medical literature for studies that compared epithelium\\u2010off CXL against transepithelial CXL. Then we compared the results and summarized the evidence from all the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. \\nWhat did we find?We found 13 studies with a total of 567 people. The studies took place in Europe, the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The shortest studies lasted six months, and the longest study lasted more than three years. Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis against epithelium\\u2010off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis against epithelium\\u2010off CXL. \\nTransepithelial CXL without iontophoresis compared to epithelium\\u2010off CXL \\nWe do not know if one procedure is better than the other for preventing progression of keratoconus or visual loss because too few robust studies have compared the effects of these two CXL methods. \\nEvidence from four studies suggests that corneal hazing (clouding of the cornea) or scarring are probably more common with epithelium\\u2010off CXL. \\nTransepithelial CXL with iontophoresis compared to epithelium\\u2010off CXL \\nEvidence from two studies suggests that there may be little to no difference between the two procedures in changes to vision clarity. We do not know if one procedure is better than the other to prevent progression of keratoconus because two few robust studies have compared the two methods. \\nThe evidence does not suggest that one procedure leads to more unwanted events than the other. However, our confidence in this evidence is low, because it is based on three studies that did not use robust methods. \\nWhat does this mean?Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if epithelium\\u2010off CXL or transepithelial CXL is better for slowing keratoconus progression. \\nAdverse events such as corneal hazing or scarring are probably more common with epithelium\\u2010off CXL than with transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis. \\nWe need more and larger studies to strengthen the evidence. These should compare the benefits and the risks of different CXL procedures. Studies should aim to follow patients for more than 12 months, so that long\\u2010term effects can be compared as it can take at least that much time for corneal tissue to heal from any procedure. \\nHow\\u2010up\\u2010to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to January 2020. \\n\",\n          \"Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions \\nWhy is this review important? \\nMore than one in ten children and adolescents have long\\u2010term physical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems like anxiety or depression. Treating these problems early can prevent difficulties with family life, school, and future mental health problems. It is currently unclear whether psychological therapies (talking therapies) designed for children and adolescents without medical issues are appropriate for use with this population. \\nWho will be interested in this review? \\nThis review will be of interest to mental and medical healthcare providers, service users, and service commissioners. \\nWhat questions does this review aim to answer? \\nThis review aims to answer the following questions: 1) Are psychological therapies better than a range of other therapies in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions? and 2) Are psychological therapies acceptable to this audience? \\nWhich studies were included in the review? \\nWe searched a number of databases to find all high\\u2010quality trials of psychological therapies for anxiety or depression in children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with long\\u2010term physical conditions and symptoms of anxiety or depression, published from 1970 to September 2018. We included twenty\\u2010nine studies with a total of 1349 people in the review and rated the overall quality of the studies as 'low to moderate'. \\nWhat does the evidence from the review tell us? \\nA handful of psychological therapies have been researched in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions. Most of these were developed for use with children and adolescents who do not have long\\u2010term physical conditions. Some of these, particularly those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and therapies specifically designed to treat depression or anxiety, are effective at reducing mild symptoms of these conditions in the short term. There is limited evidence that such therapies are acceptable to young people and that they can improve quality of life and symptoms of long\\u2010term physical conditions. There is currently a lack of therapies for addressing health\\u2010related anxiety in this population. \\nWhat should happen next? \\nFurther research should be undertaken to develop more effective psychological therapies to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## Help for Migrants' Mental Health\\n\\n### Rationale\\n\\nMany people must leave their homes.

People often feel sad, worried, or scared. They may have been through bad events. These feelings can lead to mental health problems. Examples are sadness (depression), worry (anxiety), and stress after trauma (PTSD).\\n\\nIt is important to help these people. We want to find the best ways to keep them well. We also want to stop mental health problems from starting. And we want to treat problems when they happen. What works for others might not work for migrants. This is why we need special studies. This study helps us see what we know and what we still need to learn. It helps us plan future research. We want to find the most helpful treatments for migrants.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\n\\nThis study looked at other studies. It is like a study of studies. We searched for many papers. These papers were about mental health help for migrants. We looked for studies that brought together results from many smaller studies. These are called systematic reviews. We also looked for plans for new studies. These plans are called protocols.\\n\\nWe looked at different types of help. This included ways to keep people healthy. An example is teaching children about well-being in school. We also looked at ways to stop problems. An example is therapy to prevent PTSD. We also looked at ways to treat problems. An example is therapy for sadness. We included migrants of all ages. We looked at people who had been forced to leave their homes. The study did not involve new patients. It reviewed existing research.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe found many studies. We found 23 completed studies. We also found 15 plans for new studies. The 23 studies looked at 336 other research papers. From these, 175 were new studies not seen before.\\n\\nMost studies looked at refugees and asylum seekers. Fewer studies looked at people moved within their own country. More studies focused on adults than on children. Many studies looked at treating PTSD. Fewer studies looked at keeping people well or preventing problems. There were also fewer studies on sadness or worry. Some types of talk therapy were often studied. These included Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Narrative Exposure Therapy.\\n\\nWe found that these studies were good, but they could be better. They sometimes did not explain how they did their research very well. This makes it harder to trust their findings completely.\\n\\nWe still need more research. The help available might not meet all the needs of migrants. Future studies should include more groups. These include children and people with sadness or worry. They should also look at new ways to help. This includes keeping people well and preventing problems. We also need to look at treatments other than just talk therapy. This will help us find the best ways to help all migrants.\",\n          \"## Plain Language Summary: Eye Disease Treatment Study\\n\\n### Plain Title\\n\\nWhich Eye Surgery Works Best for a Thin Cornea?\\n\\n### Rationale\\n\\nYour eye has a clear front layer called the cornea. It is shaped like a dome. A disease called keratoconus makes your cornea thin out. It then bulges into a cone shape. This disease starts in your teens or early 40s. It stays with you your whole life.\\n\\nKeratoconus makes your vision blurry. Glasses may not help. It can also harm your eye in other ways. Glasses and contact lenses can help you see better. But they do not stop the disease from getting worse.\\n\\nOnly one treatment can slow the disease. It is called corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL). This surgery makes your cornea stronger. It stops it from getting thinner.\\n\\nCXL uses special eye drops and light. The drops have a vitamin called riboflavin. The light is an invisible type called ultraviolet A. When the light hits the riboflavin, new links form in your cornea. These links make your cornea stronger.\\n\\nThere are two main types of CXL. One type removes the top layer of cells from your cornea. This helps the riboflavin get into your eye. It is called \\\"epithelium-off CXL.\\\" The other type does not remove these cells. It is called \\\"transepithelial CXL.\\\"\\n\\nSurgeons can use chemicals to help the riboflavin get into your eye for transepithelial CXL. They can also use a small electric current. This is called iontophoresis.\\n\\nEpithelium-off CXL is used more often. But transepithelial CXL might be better. It could mean faster healing. It might also cause less pain. We wanted to find out which surgery works best. We also wanted to know which one is safer for people with keratoconus.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\n\\nWe looked at studies that compared the two types of CXL surgery. We wanted to see if epithelium-off CXL was better than transepithelial CXL. We checked studies where the top layer of cells was removed versus not removed. We also looked at studies where an electric current was used to help the riboflavin.\\n\\nWe searched medical journals for these studies. We then put all the results together. We looked at how strong the studies were. We checked how they were done. We also looked at how many people were in each study. We made sure the results were similar across studies. This helped us trust the information more.\\n\\nWe found 13 studies to look at. A total of 567 people were in these studies. The studies took place in many parts of the world. Some were in Europe. Others were in the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The shortest studies lasted for six months. The longest study followed people for over three years. This helped us see long-term effects.\\n\\nEleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without the electric current to epithelium-off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with the electric current to epithelium-off CXL.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe found some important things. We do not know if one surgery is better than the other. This is for stopping keratoconus from getting worse. We also do not know which one is better for keeping your vision. There were not enough strong studies to tell us this for sure.\\n\\nHowever, four studies showed something key. It seems that epithelium-off CXL causes more clouding or scars on the cornea. This is compared to transepithelial CXL without the electric current.\\n\\nFor transepithelial CXL with the electric current, two studies gave us some clues. They suggest there is little change in how clear your vision is with either surgery. Again, we do not know if one works better to stop the disease. There were not enough strong studies.\\n\\nThe studies did not show one surgery caused more bad events than the other. But we are not very sure about this. This is because these three studies were not very strong.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we need more studies. These studies need to be larger and stronger. We need to compare the good and bad parts of both CXL surgeries. Studies should follow people for more than a year. This is so we can see how the eyes heal over time. It can take that long for the eye to get better. This review used information up to January 2020.\",\n          \"**Plain Title:** Helping Kids with Long-Term Illness Feel Better\\n\\n**Rationale**\\n\\nMany kids and teens have long-term health problems. These include things like asthma, diabetes, or cancer. When kids have these issues, they often feel sad or worried. They might get problems like anxiety or depression. These feelings can make life hard. It can affect school and family. It can also cause problems with their mental health later on.\\n\\nWe wanted to know if \\\"talk therapy\\\" could help these kids. Talk therapy helps people learn to cope. It helps them feel better about their thoughts and feelings. We needed to see if these therapies, often used for kids without long-term illnesses, would work for kids with health problems too. We also wanted to know if kids would be okay with this kind of therapy.\\n\\n**Trial Design**\\n\\nWe looked at many studies. These studies were about talk therapy. We looked for studies on kids and teens. These young people were 18 years old or younger. They all had a long-term health problem. They also felt anxious or sad.\\n\\nWe searched studies from 1970 to 2018. We found 29 studies that fit our needs. A total of 1349 people were in these studies. We checked how good the studies were. Most studies were of low to medium quality.\\n\\n**Results**\\n\\nWe found some talk therapies that helped. These therapies worked for kids with long-term health problems. Many of these therapies used a method called CBT. CBT helps people change their thinking patterns. It helps them deal with tough feelings.\\n\\nThese therapies were good at making mild sadness and worry go away. This help lasted for a short time. We also saw that kids seemed to like these therapies. They may also help kids feel better about their lives. The therapies might even help with their physical health problems.\\n\\nHowever, there are not many therapies for health-related worry. This is worry about the illness itself. We need more studies. We need to find even better ways to help these kids. We want to find therapies made just for them. These new therapies should help kids with long-term health problems feel their best.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.028000061019855686,\n        \"min\": 0.8020634651184082,\n        \"max\": 0.8676682114601135,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8020634651184082,\n          0.8676682114601135,\n          0.8101405501365662\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"alignscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.08065995105276207,\n        \"min\": 0.4930691421031952,\n        \"max\": 0.7049410939216614,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4930691421031952,\n          0.6615166068077087,\n          0.6340270638465881\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Mental health promotion, prevention, and treatments for mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and post\\u2010traumatic stress disorder may work differently in these groups of people than for the general population. This overview of systematic reviews summarises the characteristics of reviews available on this topic, to help us determine which research questions are the most important to address in future Cochrane reviews. \\nWe searched for systematic reviews and protocols of systematic reviews on mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental health problems for refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Mental health promotion may, for example, involve a classroom\\u2010based well\\u2010being intervention for children. An example of prevention is trauma\\u2010focused therapy to prevent post\\u2010traumatic stress disorder. Treatment may, for example, include psychological therapy for depression. We found 23 systematic reviews and 15 protocols of reviews in progress. Together the 23 published systematic reviews included 336 references, 175 of which were unique studies. Reviews more commonly included refugees and asylum seekers than internally displaced persons, and were more frequently focused on adults than children. There was more attention on the treatment of post\\u2010traumatic stress disorder than there was for mental health promotion or prevention, or for the treatment of depression or anxiety. Studies of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, and integrative and interpersonal therapies were most likely to be included in reviews. \\nThe quality of reviews was limited by a range of issues, many of which related to poor reporting of the review methodology. \\nThe evidence available from systematic reviews may not match the need for evidence\\u2010based interventions for the mental health of involuntary migrants. Review authors should consider relevant groups such as internally displaced persons, children, and people with depression or anxiety, and relevant interventions such as those for mental health promotion or prevention, and treatments other than psychological therapy. \\n\",\n          \"What surgical procedure works best to slow the progression of keratoconus (an eye disease)? \\nWhy is this question important?Keratoconus is a disease that affects the thin, clear outer layer of the eye, known as the cornea. Normally, the cornea is dome\\u2010shaped. In people with keratoconus, the cornea slowly thins, and a cone\\u2010shaped bulge develops in the center of the cornea. The disease usually begins between the ages of teens and 40, and persists throughout life. It causes blurry or distorted vision that may not be improved by wearing glasses and may result in perforation of the cornea and other visual problems. \\nTreatments such as glasses and contact lenses can be used to improve the vision of people with keratoconus. However, these do not slow the progression of the disease. The only treatment known to slow disease progression is \\u2018corneal collagen crosslinking\\u2019 (CXL). \\nCXL is a surgical procedure that aims to strengthen the cornea and prevent further thinning. It involves shining ultraviolet A (invisible) light rays onto eyes that have been treated with eye drops containing riboflavin (a vitamin). When the light rays meet the riboflavin, new links form between the fibers that make up the cornea. \\nThere are two types of CXL. One type requires the removal of the cells on surface of the cornea, to make it easier for the riboflavin to reach the cornea. This procedure is called \\u2018epithelium\\u2010off CXL\\u2019. The other type does not require the removal of these cells. This procedure is called \\u2018transepithelial CXL\\u2019. Surgeons who carry out this procedure can use chemicals to help riboflavin penetrate the cells on the surface of the cornea. They can also deliver riboflavin to the cornea using a small electrical current (iontophoresis). \\nEpithelium\\u2010off CXL is the more commonly used procedure. However, transepithelial CXL could have advantages, such as faster healing and less patient discomfort. We reviewed the evidence to find out which of these two procedures is more beneficial and less risky for people with keratoconus. \\nHow did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched the medical literature for studies that compared epithelium\\u2010off CXL against transepithelial CXL. Then we compared the results and summarized the evidence from all the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. \\nWhat did we find?We found 13 studies with a total of 567 people. The studies took place in Europe, the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The shortest studies lasted six months, and the longest study lasted more than three years. Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis against epithelium\\u2010off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis against epithelium\\u2010off CXL. \\nTransepithelial CXL without iontophoresis compared to epithelium\\u2010off CXL \\nWe do not know if one procedure is better than the other for preventing progression of keratoconus or visual loss because too few robust studies have compared the effects of these two CXL methods. \\nEvidence from four studies suggests that corneal hazing (clouding of the cornea) or scarring are probably more common with epithelium\\u2010off CXL. \\nTransepithelial CXL with iontophoresis compared to epithelium\\u2010off CXL \\nEvidence from two studies suggests that there may be little to no difference between the two procedures in changes to vision clarity. We do not know if one procedure is better than the other to prevent progression of keratoconus because two few robust studies have compared the two methods. \\nThe evidence does not suggest that one procedure leads to more unwanted events than the other. However, our confidence in this evidence is low, because it is based on three studies that did not use robust methods. \\nWhat does this mean?Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if epithelium\\u2010off CXL or transepithelial CXL is better for slowing keratoconus progression. \\nAdverse events such as corneal hazing or scarring are probably more common with epithelium\\u2010off CXL than with transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis. \\nWe need more and larger studies to strengthen the evidence. These should compare the benefits and the risks of different CXL procedures. Studies should aim to follow patients for more than 12 months, so that long\\u2010term effects can be compared as it can take at least that much time for corneal tissue to heal from any procedure. \\nHow\\u2010up\\u2010to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to January 2020. \\n\",\n          \"Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions \\nWhy is this review important? \\nMore than one in ten children and adolescents have long\\u2010term physical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems like anxiety or depression. Treating these problems early can prevent difficulties with family life, school, and future mental health problems. It is currently unclear whether psychological therapies (talking therapies) designed for children and adolescents without medical issues are appropriate for use with this population. \\nWho will be interested in this review? \\nThis review will be of interest to mental and medical healthcare providers, service users, and service commissioners. \\nWhat questions does this review aim to answer? \\nThis review aims to answer the following questions: 1) Are psychological therapies better than a range of other therapies in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions? and 2) Are psychological therapies acceptable to this audience? \\nWhich studies were included in the review? \\nWe searched a number of databases to find all high\\u2010quality trials of psychological therapies for anxiety or depression in children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with long\\u2010term physical conditions and symptoms of anxiety or depression, published from 1970 to September 2018. We included twenty\\u2010nine studies with a total of 1349 people in the review and rated the overall quality of the studies as 'low to moderate'. \\nWhat does the evidence from the review tell us? \\nA handful of psychological therapies have been researched in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions. Most of these were developed for use with children and adolescents who do not have long\\u2010term physical conditions. Some of these, particularly those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and therapies specifically designed to treat depression or anxiety, are effective at reducing mild symptoms of these conditions in the short term. There is limited evidence that such therapies are acceptable to young people and that they can improve quality of life and symptoms of long\\u2010term physical conditions. There is currently a lack of therapies for addressing health\\u2010related anxiety in this population. \\nWhat should happen next? \\nFurther research should be undertaken to develop more effective psychological therapies to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long\\u2010term physical conditions. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"simplified_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## Help for Migrants' Mental Health\\n\\n### Rationale\\n\\nMany people must leave their homes. They are called involuntary migrants. This group includes refugees, asylum seekers, and those forced to move within their own country. This move can be very hard. People often feel sad, worried, or scared. They may have been through bad events. These feelings can lead to mental health problems. Examples are sadness (depression), worry (anxiety), and stress after trauma (PTSD).\\n\\nIt is important to help these people. We want to find the best ways to keep them well. We also want to stop mental health problems from starting. And we want to treat problems when they happen. What works for others might not work for migrants. This is why we need special studies. This study helps us see what we know and what we still need to learn. It helps us plan future research. We want to find the most helpful treatments for migrants.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\n\\nThis study looked at other studies. It is like a study of studies. We searched for many papers. These papers were about mental health help for migrants. We looked for studies that brought together results from many smaller studies. These are called systematic reviews. We also looked for plans for new studies. These plans are called protocols.\\n\\nWe looked at different types of help. This included ways to keep people healthy. An example is teaching children about well-being in school. We also looked at ways to stop problems. An example is therapy to prevent PTSD. We also looked at ways to treat problems. An example is therapy for sadness. We included migrants of all ages. We looked at people who had been forced to leave their homes. The study did not involve new patients. It reviewed existing research.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe found many studies. We found 23 completed studies. We also found 15 plans for new studies. The 23 studies looked at 336 other research papers. From these, 175 were new studies not seen before.\\n\\nMost studies looked at refugees and asylum seekers. Fewer studies looked at people moved within their own country. More studies focused on adults than on children. Many studies looked at treating PTSD. Fewer studies looked at keeping people well or preventing problems. There were also fewer studies on sadness or worry. Some types of talk therapy were often studied. These included Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Narrative Exposure Therapy.\\n\\nWe found that these studies were good, but they could be better. They sometimes did not explain how they did their research very well. This makes it harder to trust their findings completely.\\n\\nWe still need more research. The help available might not meet all the needs of migrants. Future studies should include more groups. These include children and people with sadness or worry. They should also look at new ways to help. This includes keeping people well and preventing problems. We also need to look at treatments other than just talk therapy. This will help us find the best ways to help all migrants.\",\n          \"## Plain Language Summary: Eye Disease Treatment Study\\n\\n### Plain Title\\n\\nWhich Eye Surgery Works Best for a Thin Cornea?\\n\\n### Rationale\\n\\nYour eye has a clear front layer called the cornea. It is shaped like a dome. A disease called keratoconus makes your cornea thin out. It then bulges into a cone shape. This disease starts in your teens or early 40s. It stays with you your whole life.\\n\\nKeratoconus makes your vision blurry. Glasses may not help. It can also harm your eye in other ways. Glasses and contact lenses can help you see better. But they do not stop the disease from getting worse.\\n\\nOnly one treatment can slow the disease. It is called corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL). This surgery makes your cornea stronger. It stops it from getting thinner.\\n\\nCXL uses special eye drops and light. The drops have a vitamin called riboflavin. The light is an invisible type called ultraviolet A. When the light hits the riboflavin, new links form in your cornea. These links make your cornea stronger.\\n\\nThere are two main types of CXL. One type removes the top layer of cells from your cornea. This helps the riboflavin get into your eye. It is called \\\"epithelium-off CXL.\\\" The other type does not remove these cells. It is called \\\"transepithelial CXL.\\\"\\n\\nSurgeons can use chemicals to help the riboflavin get into your eye for transepithelial CXL. They can also use a small electric current. This is called iontophoresis.\\n\\nEpithelium-off CXL is used more often. But transepithelial CXL might be better. It could mean faster healing. It might also cause less pain. We wanted to find out which surgery works best. We also wanted to know which one is safer for people with keratoconus.\\n\\n### Trial Design\\n\\nWe looked at studies that compared the two types of CXL surgery. We wanted to see if epithelium-off CXL was better than transepithelial CXL. We checked studies where the top layer of cells was removed versus not removed. We also looked at studies where an electric current was used to help the riboflavin.\\n\\nWe searched medical journals for these studies. We then put all the results together. We looked at how strong the studies were. We checked how they were done. We also looked at how many people were in each study. We made sure the results were similar across studies. This helped us trust the information more.\\n\\nWe found 13 studies to look at. A total of 567 people were in these studies. The studies took place in many parts of the world. Some were in Europe. Others were in the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The shortest studies lasted for six months. The longest study followed people for over three years. This helped us see long-term effects.\\n\\nEleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without the electric current to epithelium-off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with the electric current to epithelium-off CXL.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWe found some important things. We do not know if one surgery is better than the other. This is for stopping keratoconus from getting worse. We also do not know which one is better for keeping your vision. There were not enough strong studies to tell us this for sure.\\n\\nHowever, four studies showed something key. It seems that epithelium-off CXL causes more clouding or scars on the cornea. This is compared to transepithelial CXL without the electric current.\\n\\nFor transepithelial CXL with the electric current, two studies gave us some clues. They suggest there is little change in how clear your vision is with either surgery. Again, we do not know if one works better to stop the disease. There were not enough strong studies.\\n\\nThe studies did not show one surgery caused more bad events than the other. But we are not very sure about this. This is because these three studies were not very strong.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we need more studies. These studies need to be larger and stronger. We need to compare the good and bad parts of both CXL surgeries. Studies should follow people for more than a year. This is so we can see how the eyes heal over time. It can take that long for the eye to get better. This review used information up to January 2020.\",\n          \"**Plain Title:** Helping Kids with Long-Term Illness Feel Better\\n\\n**Rationale**\\n\\nMany kids and teens have long-term health problems. These include things like asthma, diabetes, or cancer. When kids have these issues, they often feel sad or worried. They might get problems like anxiety or depression. These feelings can make life hard. It can affect school and family. It can also cause problems with their mental health later on.\\n\\nWe wanted to know if \\\"talk therapy\\\" could help these kids. Talk therapy helps people learn to cope. It helps them feel better about their thoughts and feelings. We needed to see if these therapies, often used for kids without long-term illnesses, would work for kids with health problems too. We also wanted to know if kids would be okay with this kind of therapy.\\n\\n**Trial Design**\\n\\nWe looked at many studies. These studies were about talk therapy. We looked for studies on kids and teens. These young people were 18 years old or younger. They all had a long-term health problem. They also felt anxious or sad.\\n\\nWe searched studies from 1970 to 2018. We found 29 studies that fit our needs. A total of 1349 people were in these studies. We checked how good the studies were. Most studies were of low to medium quality.\\n\\n**Results**\\n\\nWe found some talk therapies that helped. These therapies worked for kids with long-term health problems. Many of these therapies used a method called CBT. CBT helps people change their thinking patterns. It helps them deal with tough feelings.\\n\\nThese therapies were good at making mild sadness and worry go away. This help lasted for a short time. We also saw that kids seemed to like these therapies. They may also help kids feel better about their lives. The therapies might even help with their physical health problems.\\n\\nHowever, there are not many therapies for health-related worry. This is worry about the illness itself. We need more studies. We need to find even better ways to help these kids. We want to find therapies made just for them.
