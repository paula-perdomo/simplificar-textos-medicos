0,10.1002-14651858.CD014257.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Functional constipation is defined as chronic constipation with no identifiable underlying cause. It is a significant cause of morbidity in children, accounting for up to 25% of visits to paediatric gastroenterologists. Probiotic preparations may sufficiently alter the gut microbiome and promote normal gut physiology in a way that helps relieve functional constipation. Several studies have sought to address this hypothesis, as well as the role of probiotics in other functional gut disorders. Therefore, it is important to have a focused review to assess the evidence to date. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the management of chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children. 
Search methods
On 28 June 2021, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, WHO ICTR, and ClinicalTrials.gov, with no language, date, publication status, or document type limitations. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed probiotic preparations (including synbiotics) compared to placebo, no treatment or any other interventional preparation in people aged between 0 and 18 years old with a diagnosis of functional constipation according to consensus criteria (such as Rome IV). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 14 studies (1127 randomised participants): 12 studies assessed probiotics in the treatment of functional constipation, whilst two studies investigated synbiotic preparations. 
Three studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to the frequency of defecation at study end, but we did not pool them as there was very significant unexplained heterogeneity. Four studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to treatment success. There may be no difference in global improvement/treatment success (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.26; 313 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Five studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to withdrawals due to adverse events, with the pooled effect suggesting there may be no difference (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.95; 357 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
The pooled estimate from three studies that compared probiotics plus an osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone found there may be no difference in frequency of defecation (MD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.57 to 0.56; 268 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Two studies compared probiotics plus an osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone in relation to global improvement/treatment success, and found there may be no difference between the treatments (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.15; 139 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Three studies compared probiotics plus osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone in relation to withdrawals due to adverse events, but it is unclear if there is a difference between them (RR 2.86, 95% CI 0.12 to 68.35; 268 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Two studies compared probiotics versus magnesium oxide. It is unclear if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD 0.28, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 1.14; 36 participants), treatment success (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.57; 36 participants) or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.04; 77 participants). The certainty of the evidence is very low for these outcomes. 
One study assessed the role of a synbiotic preparation in comparison to placebo. There may be higher treatment success in favour of synbiotics compared to placebo (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.47; 155 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. 
One study assessed a synbiotic plus paraffin compared to paraffin alone. It is uncertain if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD 0.74, 95% CI ‐0.96, 2.44; 66 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), or treatment success (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.17; 66 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. 
One study compared a synbiotic preparation to paraffin. It is uncertain if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD ‐1.53, 95% CI ‐3.00, ‐0.06; 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or in treatment success (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.65, 1.13; 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. 
All secondary outcomes were either not reported or reported in a way that did not allow for analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether probiotics are efficacious in successfully treating chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children or changing the frequency of defecation, or whether there is a difference in withdrawals due to adverse events when compared with placebo. There is limited evidence from one study to suggest a synbiotic preparation may be more likely than placebo to lead to treatment success, with no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. 
There is insufficient evidence to draw efficacy or safety conclusions about the use of probiotics in combination with or in comparison to any of the other interventions reported. The majority of the studies that presented data on serious adverse events reported that no events occurred. Two studies did not report this outcome. 
Future studies are needed to confirm efficacy, but the research community requires guidance on the best context for probiotics in such studies, considering where they should be best considered in a potential treatment hierarchy and should align with core outcome sets to support future interpretation of findings. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Probiotics for Treating Constipation in Children

## Plain Title
Do probiotics help children with long-term constipation that has no physical cause?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some children have long-term constipation with no physical cause. Doctors call this ""functional constipation."" These children have trouble pooping regularly, even though tests show nothing is wrong with their body. This problem is very common. Up to 1 in 4 visits to children's gut doctors are because of this issue. It causes a lot of discomfort and worry for children and their families.

**Why was this study needed?**

Our gut contains tiny living things called bacteria. These bacteria help our body work properly. Probiotics are ""good"" bacteria that people can take as pills or drinks. Scientists think probiotics might help change the mix of bacteria in the gut. This could help the gut work better and make pooping easier.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if probiotics are safe and helpful for children with long-term constipation. They looked at whether probiotics could help children poop more often and feel better overall.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at 14 different studies that other scientists had done. They combined the results to see what the evidence shows.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 1,127 children total. All children were between 0 and 18 years old. All had functional constipation, meaning they had trouble pooping but had no physical problem causing it.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies tested different things:
- Some compared probiotics to fake pills (called placebo)
- Some compared probiotics plus laxatives to laxatives alone
- Some compared probiotics to other treatments like magnesium oxide
- Two studies tested synbiotics (probiotics mixed with special fiber)

Laxatives are medicines that help make pooping easier.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time varied across different studies.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The results were mixed and unclear:

**Probiotics compared to fake pills:**
- We cannot tell if probiotics help children poop more often
- Probiotics may not help children feel better overall
- Probiotics may not cause more side effects than fake pills

**Probiotics plus laxatives compared to laxatives alone:**
- Adding probiotics to laxatives may not help children poop more often
- Adding probiotics may not help children feel better overall
- We are very unsure if adding probiotics causes more side effects

**Probiotics compared to magnesium oxide:**
- We are very unsure if there is any difference between these treatments
- We are very unsure about side effects

**Synbiotics (probiotics with special fiber):**
- One study found synbiotics may help more children feel better compared to fake pills
- No children stopped treatment because of side effects
- When compared to paraffin (a type of laxative), we are very unsure if synbiotics work differently

**Why are we unsure?**

The studies were small. They tested different types of probiotics. They measured results in different ways. This makes it hard to know what the true answer is.

**What about safety?**

Most studies said no serious problems happened. This is good news. But we need more research to be sure probiotics are safe.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, we do not have enough proof to say whether probiotics help children with constipation. One study suggests synbiotics might help, but we need more research to be sure.

**What happens next?**

Scientists need to do more studies. These studies should be larger. They should test the same types of probiotics. They should measure results the same way. This will help us know if probiotics really work for children with constipation.",10.1002-14651858.CD014257,"Probiotics for treatment of chronic constipation in children
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether probiotics can be used to treat chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children (aged 0 to 18 years). 
We analysed data from 14 studies to answer this question.
Key messages 
We were unable to draw conclusions when comparing probiotics to placebo for frequency of defecation in children treated for chronic constipation without a physical explanation. There may be no difference in treatment success between the two groups. 
There may not be a difference in frequency of defecation or treatment success when comparing probiotics and laxatives to using laxatives alone. 
We were unable to draw conclusions when comparing probiotics to magnesium oxide for frequency of defecation or treatment success. 
There may be a higher frequency of defecation in children treated with synbiotic preparations compared to placebo. 
There may not be a difference in participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse events when comparing probiotic preparations to placebo. 
We were unable to draw conclusions on the safety of any of the other comparisons due to the low number of people who withdrew from the studies. 
What was studied in the review? 
Children often suffer from constipation for long periods of time, and when there is no underlying physical cause that can be found we call it 'functional constipation'. 
It has been suggested that probiotic and synbiotic preparations might help improve symptoms in these children. Probiotics are preparations that contain living bacteria that have been proposed to be beneficial to the digestive system. Synbiotics also include food substances that support the growth of these bacteria. 
There is currently no consensus about whether this is the case, or how these preparations are best used. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing any probiotic or synbiotic treatment with any other treatment (such as dummy/placebo treatments) in children with chronic constipation without a physical explanation. We found 14 trials including a total of 1127 participants who were aged under 18. We made the following conclusions.• There may be no difference in treatment success when comparing probiotics to placebo.• We were unable to draw conclusions on whether there is a difference in the frequency of defecation.• There may be no difference in treatment success when comparing probiotics and laxatives to laxatives alone.• We were unable to draw conclusions on frequency of defecation or treatment success when comparing probiotics to magnesium oxide.• Synbiotics may be better than placebo in improving the frequency of defection.• There may be no difference in how many people withdrew from the trials because of side effects when comparing probiotics to placebo, or probiotics and laxative to laxative alone.• We have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies only included a small number of children, and due to lack of detail on some of the methods used. 
All analyses were limited due to differences in the specific probiotics or the treatments they were compared with, low numbers of children included in the studies and, most importantly, the use of a range of different measures of success. This meant that combining studies was difficult, so the overall ability of this review to answer its core questions was limited. 
What next? 
Future studies are needed to find out how helpful probiotics are for childhood constipation. Researchers need to agree whether probiotics should be a first option therapy, an add‐on to other therapies, a second option after other therapies have failed, or a combination of all the above. 
Future research should measure the same items (known as a core outcome set) to ensure these results can support future reviews. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review is current to June 2021.

Although corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid‐induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Methotrexate for Treatment of Active Treatment Resistant Crohn's Disease

## Plain Title
Does methotrexate help people with Crohn's disease that is hard to treat?

## Rationale

**What is Crohn's disease?**
Crohn's disease is a long-term health problem. It causes swelling in the gut. This can lead to pain, diarrhea, and feeling very tired. People with Crohn's disease often feel very sick.

**Current treatment problems**
Doctors often use steroid drugs to treat Crohn's disease. Steroids can help at first. But many patients get sick again when they stop taking steroids. Some patients need to take steroids all the time. This is called steroid dependent. Steroids can cause bad side effects when used for a long time.

**Why study methotrexate?**
Methotrexate is a drug that calms down the body's defense system. Doctors wanted to know if methotrexate could help patients with Crohn's disease. They wanted to see if it could help patients stop taking steroids. This would reduce the bad side effects from steroids.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers needed to find out if methotrexate really works. They wanted to know the best dose. They also wanted to know if it was safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at seven different studies. These studies tested methotrexate in different ways. A total of 495 people took part in all the studies combined.

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included adults with Crohn's disease. These patients had disease that was hard to treat. Regular treatments had not worked well for them.

**What did the studies test?**
Some studies tested methotrexate shots given into the muscle. The dose was 25 mg each week. Other studies tested methotrexate pills taken by mouth. The dose was lower, between 12.5 and 15 mg each week. Some studies compared methotrexate to fake pills with no medicine. Some studies compared methotrexate to other drugs.

**How long did the studies last?**
The main study lasted 16 weeks. Different studies had different lengths.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**High dose methotrexate shots work**
One large study showed good results. Patients got methotrexate shots of 25 mg each week. The shots went into the muscle. After 16 weeks, these patients got better. Their disease went into remission. This means their symptoms went away. These patients were also able to stop taking steroids completely.

**Benefits for patients**
This is good news for patients. Methotrexate may help control Crohn's disease. It may help patients stop using steroids. This means fewer side effects from steroids. Patients may feel better overall.

**Low dose methotrexate pills do not work as well**
Studies tested lower doses of methotrexate. These were pills taken by mouth. The dose was 12.5 to 15 mg each week. These lower doses did not seem to help much. They did not work better than fake pills. But these studies were small. More research may be needed.

**Methotrexate with other drugs**
Two studies looked at using methotrexate with infliximab. Infliximab is another drug for Crohn's disease. Adding methotrexate to infliximab did not seem to help more. But these studies were small. More research is needed.

**Side effects**
Methotrexate can cause side effects. Common side effects include feeling sick to your stomach, throwing up, belly pain, loose stools, skin rash, and headache. These side effects happen more with higher doses. But no serious side effects were seen in these studies.

**What do these results mean?**
High dose methotrexate shots may help people with hard-to-treat Crohn's disease. It may help them get better and stop taking steroids. This could improve their quality of life. The drug appears to be safe when used this way. More research is needed on lower doses and combining it with other drugs.",10.1002-14651858.CD003459,"Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease

Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. In a previous Cochrane Review we found that supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone compared to no vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and low birthweight and may increase the risk of preterm births if it is combined with calcium. However the effects of different vitamin D regimens are not yet clear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety of different regimens of vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins, minerals or nutrients during pregnancy, specifically doses of 601 international units per day (IU/d) or more versus 600 IU/d or less; and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (12 July 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (dose, frequency, duration, and time of commencement of supplementation during pregnancy), alone or in combination with other nutrients on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. We only included trials that compared 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. We did not include in the analysis groups that received no vitamin D, as that comparison is assessed in another Cochrane Review. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently: i) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria; ii) extracted data from included studies, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Our primary maternal outcomes were: pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and any adverse effects; our primary infant outcomes were preterm birth and low birthweight. Data were checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
In this review, we included data from 30 trials involving 7289 women. We excluded 11 trials, identified 16 ongoing/unpublished trials and two trials are awaiting classification. Overall risk of bias for the trials was mixed. 
Comparison 1. 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient (19 trials; 5214 participants) 
Supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.42); 5 trials; 1553 participants,low‐certainty evidence), may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86; 5 trials; 1846 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), may make little or no difference to the risk of preterm birth (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.69; 4 trials; 2294 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference to the risk of low birthweight (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 4 trials; 1550 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. 
Comparison 2. 4000 IU or more versus 3999 IU or less of vitamin D alone (15 trials; 4763 participants) 
Supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of: pre‐eclampsia (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.22; 4 trials, 1903 participants, low‐certainty evidence); gestational diabetes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.42; 5 trials, 2276 participants; low‐certainty evidence); preterm birth (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.12; 6 trials, 2948 participants, low‐certainty evidence); and low birthweight (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.70; 2 trials; 1099 participants; low‐certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. 
Adverse events (such as hypercalcaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypercalciuria, and hypovitaminosis D) were reported differently in most trials; however, in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. 
Authors' conclusions
Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, preterm birth and low birthweight. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. In general, the GRADE was considered low certainty for most of the primary outcomes due to serious risk of bias and imprecision of results. With respect to safety, it appears that vitamin D supplementation is a safe intervention during pregnancy, although the parameters used to determine this were either not reported or not consistent between trials. Future trials should be consistent in their reports of adverse events. There are 16 ongoing trials that when published, will increase the body of knowledge. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Different Amounts of Vitamin D During Pregnancy

## Plain Title
Comparing Higher and Lower Doses of Vitamin D Supplements for Pregnant Women

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Many pregnant women do not get enough vitamin D. Vitamin D is a nutrient that helps keep bones strong and supports the body in other ways. When pregnant women lack vitamin D, they face higher risks of serious health problems.

These problems include:
- Pre-eclampsia (very high blood pressure during pregnancy that can be dangerous)
- Gestational diabetes (high blood sugar that starts during pregnancy)
- Preterm birth (having the baby too early)
- Low birthweight (baby born weighing too little)

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors already know that giving vitamin D to pregnant women may help prevent some of these problems. However, they do not know what amount works best. Some women take small amounts of vitamin D. Others take larger amounts. Researchers needed to find out which dose is safest and most helpful.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to compare different amounts of vitamin D. They looked at two main comparisons:
- Taking 601 units per day or more compared to 600 units per day or less
- Taking 4000 units per day or more compared to 3999 units per day or less

They wanted to see which dose better prevents pregnancy problems.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 30 different studies that other scientists had already done. They combined the results to see the bigger picture.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 7,289 pregnant women total. The women took different amounts of vitamin D during their pregnancies. Some took it alone. Others took it with calcium or other nutrients.

**How long did the studies last?**

Women took vitamin D throughout their pregnancies. The exact time varied by study. Most women took it for several months.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at these main outcomes:
- Pre-eclampsia (dangerous high blood pressure)
- Gestational diabetes (pregnancy-related high blood sugar)
- Preterm birth (baby born too early)
- Low birthweight (baby weighing too little at birth)
- Side effects or safety problems

## Results

**What did the study find?**

**For doses of 601 units per day or more versus 600 or less:**

Taking more than 601 units per day may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes. For other outcomes, taking the higher dose made little or no difference:
- Pre-eclampsia risk stayed about the same
- Preterm birth risk stayed about the same
- Low birthweight risk stayed about the same

**For doses of 4000 units per day or more versus 3999 or less:**

Taking 4000 units or more per day made little or no difference for any outcome measured:
- Pre-eclampsia risk stayed about the same
- Gestational diabetes risk stayed about the same
- Preterm birth risk stayed about the same
- Low birthweight risk stayed about the same

**Was vitamin D safe?**

Vitamin D appeared safe during pregnancy. Few women had side effects. The side effects were similar whether women took higher or lower doses. However, different studies measured safety in different ways. This made it hard to compare.

**What do these results mean?**

Taking more vitamin D than currently recommended may help prevent gestational diabetes. However, higher doses do not seem to help with other pregnancy problems. The good news is that higher doses appear safe. They do not cause more problems.

**What are the limitations?**

The quality of evidence was low to moderate for most outcomes. This means we cannot be completely certain about the results. More research would help confirm these findings.

**What happens next?**

Sixteen more studies are currently happening. When those finish, doctors will know even more about the best vitamin D dose for pregnant women.",10.1002-14651858.CD013446,"Regimens of vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy
What is the issue? 
This review evaluated if there are beneficial effects of supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation (200 international units/day (IU/d) to 600 IU/d) on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes and to evaluate if there are negative health effects when using more than the current upper limit recommendation (4000 IU/d). 
Why is this important? 
Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy compared to no supplementation appears to decrease the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight and may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage. However, it is not clear if doses greater than the currently recommended level are needed to observe these health benefits, and if giving more than the upper limit is related to adverse events. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review included trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (doses, frequencies, duration, and times of commencement) to compare the effects of 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less, of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. 
What evidence did we find? 
Evidence from 19 trials involving 5214 women suggest that supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes but may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. 
Evidence from 15 trials involving 4763 women suggests that supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. 
Adverse events were reported differently in most trials; in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. 
What does this mean? 
Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference in the risk of the other outcomes. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. Vitamin D supplementation appears to be safe.

Hypoglycaemia is a common occurrence in people with diabetes but can also result from an imbalance in glucose homeostasis in the absence of diabetes. The best enteral route for glucose administration for suspected hypoglycaemia in a first aid situation is unknown. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of first aid glucose administration by any route appropriate for use by first‐aid providers (buccal, sublingual, oral, rectal) for symptomatic hypoglycaemia. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL as well as grey literature (records identified in the WHO ICTRP Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov and the EU Clinical Trials Register) up to July 2018. We searched reference lists of included studies retrieved by the above searches. 
Selection criteria
We included studies involving adults and children with documented or suspected hypoglycaemia as well as healthy volunteers, in which glucose was administered by any enteral route appropriate for use by first‐aid providers. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, extracted data and evaluated trials for overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess the risk of bias in the randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and the 'risk of bias In non‐randomised studies of interventions' (ROBINS‐I) tool, in addition to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions recommendations on cross‐over studies, for the non‐RCTs. We reported continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs. All data on glucose concentrations were converted to mg/dL. We contacted authors of included studies to obtain missing data. 
Main results
From 6394 references, we included four studies evaluating 77 participants, including two RCTs, studying children and adults with hypoglycaemia, respectively, and two non‐RCTs with healthy volunteers. The studies included three different routes of glucose administration (sublingual, buccal and a combination of oral and buccal administration). All studies had a high risk of bias in one or more 'Risk of bias' domain. 
Glucose administration by the sublingual route, in the form of table sugar under the tongue, resulted in a higher blood glucose concentration after 20 minutes compared with the oral route in the very specific setting of children with hypoglycaemia and symptoms of concomitant malaria or respiratory tract infection (MD 17 mg/dL, 95% CI 4.4 to 29.6; P = 0.008; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Resolution of hypoglycaemia at 80 minutes may favour sublingual administration (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.54; P = 0.006; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but no substantial difference could be demonstrated at 20 minutes (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.74; P = 0.16; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A decrease in the time to resolution of hypoglycaemia was found in favour of sublingual administration (MD ‐51.5 min, 95% CI ‐58 to ‐45; P < 0.001; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported in either group. No data were available for resolution of symptoms and time to resolution of symptoms, and treatment delay. 
Glucose administered by the buccal route in one study resulted in a lower plasma glucose concentration after 20 minutes compared with oral administration (MD ‐14.4 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐17.5 to ‐11.4 for an imputed within‐participants correlation coefficient of 0.9; P < 0.001; 1 trial; 16 participants; very low‐quality evidence). In another study there were fewer participants with increased blood glucose at 20 minutes favouring oral glucose (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.98; P = 0.05; 1 study; 7 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No data were available for resolution of symptoms and time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia and time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. 
For the combined oral and buccal mucosal route (in the form of a dextrose gel) the MD was ‐15.3 mg/dL, 95%CI ‐33.6 to 3; P = 0.09; 1 study; 18 participants; very low‐quality evidence . No improvement was identified for either route in the resolution of symptoms at 20 minutes or less following glucose administration (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.14; P = 0.08; 1 study; 18 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No data were available for time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia and time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. 
Authors' conclusions
When providing first aid to individuals with hypoglycaemia, oral glucose administration results in a higher blood glucose concentrations after 20 minutes when compared with buccal administration of glucose. A difference in plasma glucose concentration could not be demonstrated, when administering a dextrose gel, defined as “a combined oral and buccal mucosal route” compared to oral administration of a glucose tablet or solution. In the specific population of children with concomitant malaria and respiratory illness, sublingual sugar results in a higher blood glucose concentration after 20 minutes when compared with oral administration.These results need to be interpreted cautiously because our confidence in the body of evidence is very low due to the low number of participants and studies as well as methodological deficiencies in the included studies. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Best Way to Give Sugar to People with Low Blood Sugar

## Plain Title
What is the best way to give sugar to people who have low blood sugar in a first aid situation?

## Rationale

**What is low blood sugar?**

Low blood sugar (also called hypoglycemia) happens when the sugar level in the blood drops too low. This most often happens in people with diabetes. But it can also happen in people without diabetes when their body cannot keep blood sugar balanced.

**Why is this a problem?**

Low blood sugar can make people feel very unwell. They may feel dizzy, confused, shaky, or weak. If not treated quickly, low blood sugar can be dangerous.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

When someone has low blood sugar, they need sugar quickly. First aid helpers can give sugar in different ways:
- By mouth (swallowing)
- Under the tongue
- Inside the cheek
- Through the rectum

Researchers wanted to find out which way works best in a first aid situation. They wanted to know which way raises blood sugar fastest and helps people feel better quickly.

**Why is this study needed?**

First aid helpers need to know the best way to give sugar to someone with low blood sugar. The right method could help people recover faster and stay safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at many past studies. They searched medical databases and found 6,394 reports. From these, they picked 4 studies that tested different ways to give sugar.

**Who was in the studies?**

The 4 studies included 77 people total:
- Some studies tested children and adults who had low blood sugar
- Some studies tested healthy adults who did not have low blood sugar

**What did the studies test?**

The studies compared different ways to give sugar:
- Under the tongue (using table sugar)
- Inside the cheek (using sugar gel)
- By mouth (swallowing sugar tablets or liquid)
- A mix of by mouth and inside the cheek (using sugar gel)

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies measured blood sugar levels at different times. Most checked blood sugar after 20 minutes. Some checked again at 80 minutes.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found different results for different methods:

**Sugar under the tongue:**
One study tested children who had low blood sugar and were also sick with malaria or lung infections. Sugar placed under the tongue worked better than swallowing sugar. After 20 minutes, blood sugar was higher. The children also got better faster (about 51 minutes sooner).

**Sugar inside the cheek:**
Two studies tested sugar gel placed inside the cheek. This method did not work as well as swallowing sugar. After 20 minutes, blood sugar was lower with the cheek method.

**Mix of by mouth and inside the cheek:**
One study tested sugar gel that could be swallowed or absorbed in the cheek. This method did not show clear differences compared to swallowing sugar tablets.

**Were there any problems?**

The studies did not report any bad effects from any method.

**What does this mean?**

For most people with low blood sugar, giving sugar by mouth (to swallow) seems to work best. It raises blood sugar more after 20 minutes than putting sugar inside the cheek.

For children who are also sick with malaria or lung infections, putting table sugar under the tongue may work better than swallowing it.

**Important notes:**

These results may not be fully reliable. The researchers found several problems:
- Only 4 small studies were available
- The studies only included 77 people total
- The studies had some quality problems
- More research is needed

**What do researchers conclude?**

When helping someone with low blood sugar, giving sugar by mouth to swallow appears to be the best first aid method in most cases. However, more and better studies are needed to be sure.",10.1002-14651858.CD013283,"First aid glucose administration routes for symptomatic hypoglycaemia
Review question 
We examined the effects of various routes of glucose administration as a first‐aid treatment in people with suspected or symptomatic hypoglycaemia. 
Background 
Hypoglycaemia, or having low blood sugar levels, is a common occurrence in people with diabetes but may also occur in other persons due to an imbalance in blood sugar regulation. Symptoms of mild or moderate hypoglycaemia are for example, shakiness, dizziness, sweating or nervousness, First aid for this condition is usually self‐administered but is often provided by family or friends, and glucose tablets compared with dietary forms of sugar such as juice, candies or dried fruit strips have shown to result in a better resolution of symptoms. Glucose can be given orally (swallowed), but also inside the cheek against the buccal mucosa (‘buccal administration’), under the tongue (‘sublingual administration’) or via the rectal route. In the latter three ways of treatment, the glucose is not being swallowed as with the oral route. 
Study characteristics 
We identified four studies. One randomised study (clinical trials where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) compared sublingual glucose administration, in the form of table sugar, with an oral administration in 42 hypoglycaemic children between one and 15 years old. Two non‐randomised studies compared buccal glucose administration with oral administration in 23 adult healthy fasting volunteers. One randomised study compared a dextrose gel with oral administration of glucose in 18 people with type 1 diabetes and hypoglycaemia. 
Key results 
Providing sugar under the tongue (sublingual) resulted in a greater rise in blood glucose after 20 minutes than giving the sugar orally, but this was in a specific setting including children with hypoglycaemia and symptoms of concomitant malaria or respiratory tract infection. On the other hand, giving glucose by the buccal mucosa route resulted in a lower plasma glucose concentration than with the oral route. For dextrose gel (where uptake of the glucose occurs through a combination of oral swallowing and via the buccal mucosa), no clear benefit was shown compared to oral glucose administration (glucose tablets or glucose solutions). Most studies did not report on time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia as defined by blood glucose levels above a certain threshold, time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The evidence is of very low certainty due to limitations in study design, few studies and small number of participants in the studies, and because half of the studies were performed with healthy volunteers rather than in people with characteristic hypoglycaemia.

Cataract surgery is the most common incisional surgical procedure in ophthalmology and is important in ophthalmic graduate medical education. Although most ophthalmology training programs in the United States (US) include virtual reality (VR) training for cataract surgery, comprehensive reviews that detail the impact of VR training on ophthalmology trainee performance are lacking. 
Objectives
To assess the impact of VR training for cataract surgery on the operating performance of postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, measured by operating time, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, supervising physician ratings, and VR simulator task ratings. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 June 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing VR training to any other method of training, including non‐VR simulation training (e.g., wet laboratory training), didactics training, or no supplementary training in postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were operating times in the operating room and intraoperative complications. Secondary outcomes were operating times in simulated settings, simulator task ratings, and supervising physician ratings, either in the operating room or simulated settings. 
Main results
We included six RCTs with a total of 151 postgraduate ophthalmology trainees ranging from 12 to 60 participants in each study. The included studies varied widely in terms of geography: two in the US, and one study each in China, Germany, India, and Morocco. Three studies compared VR training for phacoemulsification cataract surgery on the Eyesi simulator (VRmagic, Mannheim, Germany) with wet laboratory training and two studies compared VR training with no supplementary training. One study compared trainees who received VR training with those who received conventional training for manual small incision cataract surgery on the HelpMeSee simulator (HelpMeSee, New York, NY). Industry financially supported two studies. All studies had at least three domains judged at high or unclear risks of bias. We did not conduct a meta‐analysis due to insufficient data (i.e., lack of precision measurements, or studies reported only P values). All evidence was very low‐certainty, meaning that any estimates were unreliable. 
The evidence for the benefits of VR training for trainees was very uncertain for primary outcomes. VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had shorter operating times (mean difference [MD] −17 minutes, 95% confidence interval [CI] −21.62 to −12.38; 1 study, n = 12; very low‐certainty evidence). Results for operating time were inconsistent when comparing VR and wet laboratory training: one study found that VR relative to wet laboratory training was associated with longer operating times (P = 0.038); the other reported that two training groups had similar operating times (P = 0.14). One study reported that VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had fewer intraoperative complications (P < 0.001); in another study, VR and conventionally trained trainees had similar intraoperative complication rates (MD −8.31, 95% CI −22.78 to 6.16; 1 study, n = 19; very low‐certainty evidence). 
For secondary outcomes, VR training may have similar impact on trainee performance compared to wet laboratory and greater impact compared to no supplementary training, but the evidence was very uncertain. One study reported VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had significantly reduced operating time in simulated settings (P = 0.0013). Another study reported that VR‐trained relative to wet laboratory‐trained trainees had shorter operating times in VR settings (MD −1.40 minutes, 95% CI −1.96 to −0.84; 1 study, n = 60) and similar times in wet laboratory settings (MD 0.16 minutes, 95% CI −0.50 to 0.82; 1 study, n = 60). This study also found the VR‐trained trainees had higher VR simulator ratings (MD 5.17, 95% CI 0.61 to 9.73; 1 study, n = 60). Results for supervising physician ratings in the operating room were inconsistent: one study reported that VR‐ and wet laboratory‐trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings for cataract surgery (P = 0.608); another study reported that VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training were less likely to receive poor ratings by supervising physicians for capsulorhexis construction (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57). In wet laboratory settings, VR‐trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings compared with wet laboratory‐trained trainees (MD −1.50, 95% CI −6.77 to 3.77; n = 60) and higher supervising physician ratings compared with trainees without supplementary training (P < 0.0001). However, the results for all secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution because of very low‐certainty evidence.  
Authors' conclusions
Current research suggests that VR training may be more effective than no supplementary training in improving trainee performance in the operating room and simulated settings for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence comparing VR with conventional or wet laboratory training was less consistent.

## Plain Title
Does Virtual Reality Training Help Eye Doctors Learn Cataract Surgery Better?

## Rationale

**What is cataract surgery and why is it important?**

Cataracts happen when the lens of the eye becomes cloudy. This makes it hard to see. Cataract surgery is the most common eye operation. Doctors remove the cloudy lens and replace it with a clear one. This surgery helps people see better.

**Why do eye doctors need training?**

Eye doctors in training must learn how to do cataract surgery safely. This is a key part of their education. Good training helps them perform surgery faster and with fewer mistakes. This means better care for patients.

**What is virtual reality training?**

Virtual reality (VR) training uses computer programs to create a pretend surgery. Doctors in training can practice on this computer system. They can make mistakes and learn without risk to real patients. Many eye doctor training programs in the United States now use VR training.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if VR training really helps. They wanted to compare VR training to other ways of learning. Other methods include practicing on animal eyes in a lab (called wet lab training) or just learning from books and lectures. No one had carefully reviewed all the research on this topic before.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of other studies. Researchers looked for studies that compared different training methods. They only included studies that randomly assigned trainees to different groups. This type of study gives the most reliable results.

**Who was in these studies?**

The review included six studies. These studies had 151 eye doctors in training. Each study had between 12 and 60 trainees. The studies took place in different countries: two in the United States, and one each in China, Germany, India, and Morocco.

**What did the studies compare?**

Three studies compared VR training to wet lab training. Two studies compared VR training to no extra training. One study compared VR training to regular training for a different type of cataract surgery.

**What did researchers measure?**

They looked at several things:
- How long surgery took
- How many problems happened during surgery
- How well trainees did on practice tasks
- How supervising doctors rated the trainees

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The evidence was very uncertain. This means we cannot be sure about the results. All studies had problems with how they were done. This made the findings less reliable.

**Comparing VR training to no extra training:**

Trainees with VR training may have done better than those with no extra training. They finished surgeries faster (17 minutes faster in one study). They had fewer problems during surgery in one study. Supervising doctors gave them better ratings. But again, the evidence was very uncertain.

**Comparing VR training to wet lab training:**

Results were mixed. One study found VR-trained doctors took longer to do surgery. Another study found no difference in surgery time. VR-trained doctors did better on VR practice tasks. But they did about the same on wet lab practice tasks. Supervising doctors gave similar ratings to both groups.

**Why was the evidence uncertain?**

All studies had issues that made results less trustworthy. Some studies were very small. Some did not measure things in the best way. Some were paid for by companies that make VR training systems. This could affect the results.

**What does this mean?**

VR training might help eye doctors in training learn cataract surgery better than no extra training. But we need better studies to be sure. We are less certain whether VR training is better than wet lab training. More research with larger groups and better methods is needed.

**Conclusions:**

Current research suggests VR training may help trainees learn cataract surgery. It may work better than no extra training. But the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. Doctors and training programs should know that more research is needed before making big changes to how they train.",10.1002-14651858.CD014953,"Can virtual reality training for cataract surgery supplement or replace other training methods for ophthalmology trainees? 
Key messagesWe did not find enough evidence to show that virtual reality (VR) training improves cataract surgery performance among ophthalmology trainees compared to wet lab or conventional training. 
What is virtual reality training?VR training uses computer technology to simulate a three‐dimensional interactive environment. 
How does cataract surgery training work in ophthalmology trainees?Most postgraduate ophthalmology trainees in the United States (US) transition gradually from performing specific cataract surgery (replacing the cloudy lens inside the eye with an artificial one) steps in a wet laboratory (practicing on cadaver or artificial tissues) or using VR simulators to performing cataract surgery in the operating room. 
Why is this question important?VR training is becoming increasingly common in postgraduate ophthalmology training, but comprehensive reviews of the impact of VR training on trainees’ cataract surgery performance are lacking. 
What did we want to find out?The primary aim of this review was to determine whether VR training improved operating room performance (measured by operating time in the operating room, intraoperative [during the operation] complications, or postoperative [after the operation] complications) in cataract surgery for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. The secondary aim was to identify the impact of VR training on operating time in simulated settings, supervising physician ratings in the operating room or simulator settings, or VR simulation task ratings. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched for studies that compared VR training to other training methods such as traditional wet laboratory training or no supplementary training in a postgraduate ophthalmology trainee population. 
What did we find?VR relative to conventional or wet laboratory training did not impact operating times, the rate of intraoperative complications, or supervising physician ratings in the operating room. However, compared to trainees without supplementary training, VR‐trained trainees received higher supervising physician ratings in the operating room. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. 
What does this mean?VR training is a promising intervention for teaching cataract surgery, but more rigorous, evidence‐based studies are needed to gauge its impact on key outcomes such as intraoperative and postoperative complications.  
How up‐to‐date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 14 June 2021.

5,10.1002-14651858.CD015397-abstract.txt,"Background
With the emergence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in late 2019, governments worldwide implemented a multitude of non‐pharmaceutical interventions in order to control the spread of the virus. Most countries have implemented measures within the school setting in order to reopen schools or keep them open whilst aiming to contain the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. For informed decision‐making on implementation, adaptation, or suspension of such measures, it is not only crucial to evaluate their effectiveness with regard to SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission, but also to assess their unintended consequences. 
Objectives
To comprehensively identify and map the evidence on the unintended health and societal consequences of school‐based measures to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. We aimed to generate a descriptive overview of the range of unintended (beneficial or harmful) consequences reported as well as the study designs that were employed to assess these outcomes. This review was designed to complement an existing Cochrane Review on the effectiveness of these measures by synthesising evidence on the implications of the broader system‐level implications of school measures beyond their effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, four non‐health databases, and two COVID‐19 reference collections on 26 March 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and Google searches. 
Selection criteria
We included quantitative (including mathematical modelling), qualitative, and mixed‐methods studies of any design that provided evidence on any unintended consequences of measures implemented in the school setting to contain the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. Studies had to report on at least one unintended consequence, whether beneficial or harmful, of one or more relevant measures, as conceptualised in a logic model.  
Data collection and analysis
We screened the titles/abstracts and subsequently full texts in duplicate, with any discrepancies between review authors resolved through discussion. One review author extracted data for all included studies, with a second review author reviewing the data extraction for accuracy. The evidence was summarised narratively and graphically across four prespecified intervention categories and six prespecified categories of unintended consequences; findings were described as deriving from quantitative, qualitative, or mixed‐method studies. 
Main results
Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 13 used quantitative methods (3 experimental/quasi‐experimental; 5 observational; 5 modelling); four used qualitative methods; and one used mixed methods. Studies looked at effects in different population groups, mainly in children and teachers. The identified interventions were assigned to four broad categories: 14 studies assessed measures to make contacts safer; four studies looked at measures to reduce contacts; six studies assessed surveillance and response measures; and one study examined multiple measures combined. Studies addressed a wide range of unintended consequences, most of them considered harmful. Eleven studies investigated educational consequences. Seven studies reported on psychosocial outcomes. Three studies each provided information on physical health and health behaviour outcomes beyond COVID‐19 and environmental consequences. Two studies reported on socio‐economic consequences, and no studies reported on equity and equality consequences. 
Authors' conclusions
We identified a heterogeneous evidence base on unintended consequences of measures implemented in the school setting to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2, and summarised the available study data narratively and graphically. Primary research better focused on specific measures and various unintended outcomes is needed to fill knowledge gaps and give a broader picture of the diverse unintended consequences of school‐based measures before a more thorough evidence synthesis is warranted. The most notable lack of evidence we found was regarding psychosocial, equity, and equality outcomes. We also found a lack of research on interventions that aim to reduce the opportunity for contacts. Additionally, study investigators should provide sufficient data on contextual factors and demographics in order to ensure analyses of such are feasible, thus assisting stakeholders in making appropriate, informed decisions for their specific circumstances. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
What Are the Unintended Effects of School Safety Measures Used During COVID-19?

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
In late 2019, a new virus called SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19. This virus spread quickly around the world. Governments tried many ways to stop the virus from spreading.

### Why did researchers do this study?
Schools are important places where children learn and grow. During the pandemic, many schools closed or changed how they worked. Governments created new rules to keep schools open safely. These rules included things like wearing masks, keeping distance between students, and testing for the virus.

Researchers wanted to know if these school rules had other effects beyond stopping the virus. Some effects might be helpful. Some effects might be harmful. For example, school rules might affect how well children learn. They might affect how children feel. They might change how families spend money.

### Why was this study needed?
Leaders need to know all the effects of school rules, not just whether they stop the virus. This helps them make better choices about which rules to use. This study looked at what other researchers found about these unintended effects. The goal was to create a map of all the different effects that have been studied.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not a study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at other studies that had already been done. They searched for studies published up to March 2021.

The researchers looked for studies about school rules during COVID-19. These rules had to be meant to stop the virus from spreading. The studies had to report on unintended effects of these rules.

The researchers grouped the school rules into four types:
- Rules to make contact safer (like wearing masks)
- Rules to reduce contact (like closing schools)
- Rules to watch and respond (like testing students)
- Multiple rules used together

They also grouped the unintended effects into six types:
- Effects on learning
- Effects on mental health and social life
- Effects on physical health
- Effects on money and jobs
- Effects on fairness between different groups
- Effects on the environment

The researchers read all the studies they found. They organized the information to see what had been studied and what was still unknown.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers found 18 studies. These studies used different methods. Some counted and measured things. Some asked people about their experiences. One study used both approaches.

Most studies looked at effects on children and teachers. The studies examined many different school rules. Most looked at rules to make contact safer, like wearing masks or cleaning more often.

### What unintended effects were found?
The studies reported many different unintended effects:
- Eleven studies looked at effects on learning
- Seven studies looked at mental health and social effects
- Three studies looked at physical health effects
- Three studies looked at environmental effects
- Two studies looked at money and job effects
- No studies looked at fairness between different groups

Most of the effects studied were considered harmful rather than helpful.

### What do the results mean?
The researchers found that many different unintended effects have been studied. However, the studies were very different from each other. This makes it hard to combine their findings.

There are important gaps in what we know. Very few studies looked at mental health effects. No studies looked at whether school rules affected different groups fairly. Few studies looked at rules that reduce contact between people.

### What happens next?
More research is needed. Future studies should focus on specific school rules. They should look at many different unintended effects. Researchers should provide more details about the schools and students they study. This will help leaders make better decisions about school rules in their own communities.",10.1002-14651858.CD015397,"Unintended consequences of school‐based measures to manage the COVID‐19 pandemic
Why is this question important? 
Countries worldwide have taken many public health and social measures to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2, a highly contagious respiratory virus responsible for COVID‐19. A range of measures have been put in place to minimise transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 within schools and the wider community. Schools have the potential to be settings of high viral transmission because they involve extended interactions amongst people in close proximity. A previous review located and examined studies on the effectiveness of such school‐based measures regarding SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission. It is equally important to look at their unintended consequences on health and society in order that policymakers and parents can make informed decisions. Unintended consequences of a public health measure may be beneficial or harmful (or a mix of both). A public health measure may result in a mix of benefits and harms. For this review, we planned to examine the unintended consequences of measures designed to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 in schools. This review can therefore be seen as complementing the previous review on the effectiveness of such measures.    
What did we do? 
Firstly, we searched nine databases for studies that assessed any measure put in place in the school settings (primary or secondary schools, or both) to prevent transmission of the virus. We considered all types of studies and a broad range of outcomes. 
Secondly, we grouped the identified studies according to the types of measures they examined. We then described which approaches were used in the studies, where these were conducted, and which unintended consequences were evaluated.  
What did we find? 
We found 18 studies that matched our inclusion criteria. Five studies used ‘real‐life’ data (observational studies); five studies used data generated by a computer and based on a set of assumptions (modelling studies); three studies were experimental studies (e.g. laboratory‐based); and four studies used qualitative methods, meaning they based their findings on interviews with people. One study used mixed methods, combining numerical and non‐numerical (qualitative) information.  
Studies examined four different types of measures, as follows.
‐ Measures to reduce contacts (4 studies): policies to reduce the number of students in the school building (i.e. reducing the number of students present per class) and/or to reduce the number of contacts of students (e.g. through defined groups or staggered arrival, breaks, and departures). 
‐ Measures to make contacts safer (14 studies): practices to ensure safer contacts between people in the school and classroom setting (e.g. mask mandates or distancing regulations), to modify the environment or activities (e.g. enhanced cleaning or ventilation practices). 
‐ Surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (6 studies): testing and/or screening strategies (e.g. temperature taking, screening tests for students and staff, and testing of symptomatic students and staff) and self‐isolation or quarantine measures. 
‐ Multicomponent measures (1 study): interventions using a combination of at least two of the above measures. 
We looked at the following unintended outcomes.
‐ Educational consequences (11 studies), e.g. changes in school performance, advancement to the next grade, or change in graduation numbers. 
‐ Psychosocialoutcomes (7 studies), e.g. mental health, anxieties about going to school. 
‐ Physical health and health behaviour outcomes beyond COVID‐19 (3 studies), e.g. hand eczema due to increased handwashing. 
‐ Environmental consequences (3 studies), e.g. changes in air quality in classrooms. 
‐ Socio‐economic consequences (2 studies), e.g. economic burden on families.  
What did we conclude? 
We identified a wide range of unintended consequences of school‐based measures designed to prevent the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. However, the evidence base is small, and there are large gaps where more research is needed. This scoping review is a first step in gauging the extent of those consequences. More research is needed to collect additional information and to enable a more thorough analysis of the evidence. Psychosocial consequences (e.g. mental health issues, depression, loneliness) and equity and equality consequences (e.g. disadvantages for children from low‐income households, unfair distribution of work between genders for parents, are in need of further attention. We recommend that future research look at interventions such as fixed groups, alternating physical presence at school and staggered arrival departure and break times, as well as testing and quarantine measures.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to March 2021.

Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is an increasingly recognised neurodevelopmental condition; that is, a neurologically‐based condition which interferes with the acquisition, retention or application of specific skills. ASD is characterised by challenges with socialisation and communication, and by stereotyped and repetitive behaviours. A stereotyped behaviour is one which is repeated over and over again and which seems not to have any useful function. ASD often co‐occurs with mental health disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). People with ASD may show certain cognitive differences (i.e. differences in ways of thinking) which influence their response to therapies. Thus, there is a need for evidence‐based guidelines to treat mental health issues in this group. 
OCD, a common condition characterised by repeated obsessional thoughts and compulsive acts, occurs with greater frequency in persons with ASD than in the general population. Genetic, anatomic, neurobiological and psychological factors have been proposed to explain this co‐occurrence. However, care should be taken to distinguish stereotyped and repetitive behaviours characteristic of ASD from obsessive compulsive acts in OCD. 
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the recommended treatment for OCD, but studies have suggested that this treatment may be less effective in those with OCD co‐occurring with ASD. Hence, modifications to CBT treatment may be helpful when treating OCD co‐occurring with ASD to optimise outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 
Search methods
We searched for studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, five other bibliographic databases, international trial registries and other sources of grey literature (to 24 August 2020). We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies missed from the original electronic searches. We contacted subject experts for further information when needed. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross‐over, cluster‐ and quasi‐randomised controlled trials involving both adults and children with diagnoses of OCD and ASD. We included studies of participants with co‐occurring conditions (i.e. those experiencing other mental illnesses or neurodevelopmental conditions at the same time), but we did not include individuals who had a co‐occurring global learning difficulty. Treatment could be in any setting or format and include behavioural therapy (BT) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which may have been adapted for those with ASD. Comparator interventions included no treatment, waiting list, attention placebo (where the control group receives non‐specific aspects of therapy, but not the active ingredient) and treatment as usual (TAU, where the control group receives the usual treatment, according to accepted standards). 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently screened studies for inclusion. The authors extracted relevant data from the one eligible study, assessed the risk of bias and certainty of evidence (GRADE). Outcomes of interest were changes in OCD symptoms and treatment completion (primary outcome), and severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and behavioural difficulties, as well as degree of family accommodation (secondary outcomes). We did not conduct meta‐analyses as only one study met the selection criteria. 
Main results
We included only one RCT of 46 participants in our analysis. This study compared CBT for OCD in persons with high‐functioning ASD with a control group who received anxiety management only. There were no differences in rates of treatment completion between the CBT (87%) and anxiety management (87%) groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.25; low‐certainty evidence). Behavioural difficulties were not included as an outcome measure in the study. This study showed that there may be a benefit at the end of treatment favouring CBT compared with anxiety management in OCD symptoms (mean difference (MD) ‐3.00, 95% CI ‐8.02 to 2.02), depression symptoms (MD ‐1.80, 95% CI ‐11.50 to 7.90), anxiety symptoms (MD ‐3.20, 95% CI ‐11.38 to 4.98), and quality of life (MD 5.20, 95% CI ‐1.41 to 11.81), but the evidence was of low certainty.  
Authors' conclusions
Evidence is limited regarding the efficacy of CBT for treatment of OCD in ASD. There is much scope for future study, not only examining the efficacy of CBT for OCD in ASD, but also the particular ways that OCD manifests in and affects people with ASD and the role of the family in treatment response. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Talking Therapy for Repeated Thoughts and Actions in People with Autism

## Plain Title

Does talking therapy help people with autism who have repeated unwanted thoughts and actions?

## Rationale

**What is autism?**

Autism is a brain condition that affects how a person grows and learns. People with autism may find it hard to talk with others or make friends. They may also do the same actions over and over.

**What is OCD?**

OCD stands for obsessive compulsive disorder. People with OCD have unwanted thoughts that keep coming back. They also feel they must do certain actions again and again. For example, they might wash their hands many times or check locks over and over.

**Why does this matter?**

People with autism get OCD more often than other people. This makes life harder for them. But it can be hard to tell the difference. Some repeated actions are part of autism. Other repeated actions are signs of OCD.

**What is the usual treatment?**

Doctors often use talking therapy to treat OCD. This therapy is called CBT. CBT stands for cognitive behavioural therapy. In CBT, people learn to change how they think and act.

**Why did we need this study?**

Some studies show that CBT may not work as well for people who have both autism and OCD. People with autism may think in different ways. This means they might need different types of help. We wanted to find out if CBT works for people with both conditions.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

We looked for all studies that tested talking therapy for OCD in people with autism. We searched many medical databases up to August 2020. We looked for studies where some people got therapy and others did not. This helps us see if the therapy really works.

We only found one study that met our needs. This study had 46 people in it. All of them had both autism and OCD. They were able to function well in daily life.

Half the group got CBT for OCD. The other half got help managing their worry and fear only. This second group did not get the full OCD treatment.

The study looked at several things. Did people finish the treatment? Did their OCD get better? Did they feel less sad or worried? Did their quality of life improve?

## Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

Most people finished the treatment in both groups. About 87 out of 100 people in each group completed it. This means CBT was no better or worse than the other treatment for keeping people in therapy.

The study showed that CBT might help a little bit more than just managing worry. People who got CBT might have had:
- Fewer OCD symptoms
- Less sadness
- Less worry
- Better quality of life

But we cannot be sure about these results. The evidence was weak. This is because we only found one small study.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, we do not have strong proof that CBT works well for people with both autism and OCD. We need more studies with more people. These studies should look at:
- Does CBT really help people with autism and OCD?
- How does OCD show up differently in people with autism?
- Can families help with treatment?
- Should we change CBT to work better for people with autism?

**Conclusion**

We need much more research in this area. Doctors and families need better information. This will help them choose the best treatment for people with both autism and OCD.",10.1002-14651858.CD013173,"Behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
Aim of the review 
The aim of the review is to see if cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help people who have OCD who also have ASD. 
Background 
People who have been given a diagnosis of ASD tend to have certain things in common. They often understand social interactions and communication differently to other people. People with ASD may also be less flexible in their thinking than other people, which may make it more difficult for them to use psychological therapies in the way that they are usually presented. The opinions of people with ASD are valuable in helping clinicians decide which research areas related to ASD should take priority. 
Someone who has been diagnosed with OCD has certain symptoms which, to some extent, affect how they are able to get on with their lives. Someone with OCD has persistent thoughts, although they don't want the thoughts and often think that the thoughts are unreasonable. These thoughts are often worries about themselves or someone else being harmed or about something not being perfect or just right. Sometimes the person with OCD feels as if they have to think thoughts or do actions repeatedly to 'make things right', even though they often really know that they don't need to. The repeated actions might be something like washing their hands. 
Research has shown that people with ASD are more likely to develop OCD. People may have certain genes that make them more likely to develop both ASD and OCD, or it may be that the way people with ASD tend to think makes them more likely to have OCD. 
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been used for a long time to treat OCD. CBT is usually carried out by visiting a therapist, but it can be delivered in different ways, such as online. CBT involves talking about the repeated thoughts that occur and helping the person manage and reduce them, and also involves trying to carry out compulsive actions less often. Because people with ASD sometimes have a different way of thinking and communicating, clinicians have wondered if CBT would be as useful to treat OCD in people with ASD as it is in people who have OCD but don't have ASD. Other researchers have devised ways to change the way that CBT is delivered to people with ASD to help them to get the most out of the treatment, and this is called 'adapted CBT'. Studies have shown that adapted CBT is useful for some anxiety disorders that occur in ASD. However, not as many studies have looked at how adapted CBT might be useful for OCD in people with ASD. 
Search 
We searched for randomised controlled trials of delivery of CBT to people with OCD who also had ASD. A randomised controlled trial is a trial where the participants are randomly allocated to CBT or another treatment group so that the people running the trial have no say about and do not know to which group the participants belong. The other treatment group is called the control group. In these studies, the people in the control group do not receive CBT, but they may have sessions with their therapists that do not include CBT, or they may be on a waiting list. If meeting with your therapist or waiting for time to pass were just as helpful as CBT, for example, then the results would be less likely to show a difference between the outcomes of the treatment group and the control group. Conversely, if CBT was more effective, then we might expect to see the CBT group doing better than the control group. Therefore, at the end of each trial, when the results in the treatment group are compared to the results in the control group, it gives information about how effective CBT might be for people with OCD and ASD. The evidence in this review is current to August 2020. 
Conclusion 
We found that there was only one published randomised controlled trial of delivery of CBT to people with OCD and ASD that met our search criteria. The control group in this trial was given a treatment called 'anxiety management' which helped the participants to manage anxiety but did not help them to deal specifically with repeated thoughts and actions, as CBT does. This study aimed to see if either anxiety management or CBT was better at treating OCD in people with ASD, but the study did not find a difference in response between the two treatments.

7,10.1002-14651858.CD013194-abstract.txt,"Background
Melanoma has one of the fastest rising incidence rates of any cancer. It accounts for a small percentage of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. History‐taking and visual inspection of a suspicious lesion by a clinician is usually the first in a series of ‘tests’ to diagnose skin cancer. Establishing the accuracy of visual inspection alone is critical to understating the potential contribution of additional tests to assist in the diagnosis of melanoma. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection for the detection of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in adults with limited prior testing and in those referred for further evaluation of a suspicious lesion. Studies were separated according to whether the diagnosis was recorded face‐to‐face (in‐person) or based on remote (image‐based) assessment. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: CENTRAL; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated visual inspection in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma, compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. We excluded studies reporting data for ‘clinical diagnosis’ where dermoscopy may or may not have been used. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities per algorithm and threshold using the bivariate hierarchical model. We investigated the impact of: in‐person test interpretation; use of a purposely developed algorithm to assist diagnosis; and observer expertise. 
Main results
We included 49 publications reporting on a total of 51 study cohorts with 34,351 lesions (including 2499 cases), providing 134 datasets for visual inspection. Across almost all study quality domains, the majority of study reports provided insufficient information to allow us to judge the risk of bias, while in three of four domains that we assessed we scored concerns regarding applicability of study findings as 'high'. Selective participant recruitment, lack of detail regarding the threshold for deciding on a positive test result, and lack of detail on observer expertise were particularly problematic. 
Attempts to analyse studies by degree of prior testing were hampered by a lack of relevant information and by the restricted inclusion of lesions selected for biopsy or excision. Accuracy was generally much higher for in‐person diagnosis compared to image‐based evaluations (relative diagnostic odds ratio of 8.54, 95% CI 2.89 to 25.3, P < 0.001). Meta‐analysis of in‐person evaluations that could be clearly placed on the clinical pathway showed a general trade‐off between sensitivity and specificity, with the highest sensitivity (92.4%, 95% CI 26.2% to 99.8%) and lowest specificity (79.7%, 95% CI 73.7% to 84.7%) observed in participants with limited prior testing (n = 3 datasets). Summary sensitivities were lower for those referred for specialist assessment but with much higher specificities (e.g. sensitivity 76.7%, 95% CI 61.7% to 87.1%) and specificity 95.7%, 95% CI 89.7% to 98.3%) for lesions selected for excision, n = 8 datasets). These differences may be related to differences in the spectrum of included lesions, differences in the definition of a positive test result, or to variations in observer expertise. We did not find clear evidence that accuracy is improved by the use of any algorithm to assist diagnosis in all settings. Attempts to examine the effect of observer expertise in melanoma diagnosis were hindered due to poor reporting. 
Authors' conclusions
Visual inspection is a fundamental component of the assessment of a suspicious skin lesion; however, the evidence suggests that melanomas will be missed if visual inspection is used on its own. The evidence to support its accuracy in the range of settings in which it is used is flawed and very poorly reported. Although published algorithms do not appear to improve accuracy, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the ‘no algorithm’ approach should be preferred in all settings. Despite the volume of research evaluating visual inspection, further prospective evaluation of the potential added value of using established algorithms according to the prior testing or diagnostic difficulty of lesions may be warranted. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Checking Skin Spots by Eye to Find Skin Cancer

## Plain Title

How Well Can Doctors Find Skin Cancer by Looking at Skin Spots?

## Rationale

**What is melanoma and why does it matter?**

Melanoma is a type of skin cancer. It is not very common compared to other skin cancers. But it causes most deaths from skin cancer. The number of people getting melanoma is growing faster than almost any other cancer.

**How do doctors check for melanoma?**

When someone has a spot on their skin that looks odd, the doctor first looks at it with their eyes. This is called visual inspection. The doctor asks questions about the spot and looks at it closely. This is usually the first step before doing other tests.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need to know how good they are at finding melanoma just by looking. This helps us understand if other tests are needed. Many tools and methods exist to help doctors check skin spots. But we first need to know how well simple looking works on its own.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

The researchers wanted to learn how accurate visual inspection is. They looked at two ways doctors check spots: looking at the spot in person or looking at pictures of the spot. They wanted to know how many melanomas doctors can find and how many times they might be wrong.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at many past studies. They searched medical databases up to August 2016. They found 49 reports about 51 different groups of studies. These studies included over 34,000 skin spots. About 2,500 of these spots were melanoma.

**Who was included in these studies?**

The studies looked at adults who had skin spots that might be melanoma. Some people were seeing a doctor for the first time about their spot. Others had already been sent to a specialist for more checking.

**How did researchers check the results?**

The researchers compared what doctors saw with the true answer. The true answer came from either cutting out the spot and testing it in a lab or watching the spot over time.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

Doctors were much better at finding melanoma when they looked at skin spots in person. Looking at pictures was not as accurate. When doctors saw patients in person, they were about 8 times more likely to make the right call than when looking at pictures.

**How accurate was visual inspection?**

The results varied based on the situation. For people seeing a doctor for the first time, doctors found about 92 out of 100 melanomas. But they also thought some normal spots were cancer when they were not. For people sent to specialists, doctors found about 77 out of 100 melanomas. But they were better at knowing which spots were not cancer.

**Did using special methods help?**

Some doctors used special checklists or rules to help them decide. The study did not find clear proof that these methods made doctors more accurate in all situations.

**What problems did researchers find?**

Many studies did not give enough details. It was hard to know if the doctors were experts or not. Many studies only looked at spots that were already cut out. This made it hard to know how well visual inspection works in real life.

**What do the results mean?**

Visual inspection is very important for checking skin spots. But doctors will miss some melanomas if they only use their eyes. Using visual inspection alone is not enough. The studies done so far have problems and do not give us complete answers.

**What should happen next?**

More research is needed. Future studies should be better planned. They should clearly describe how doctors make decisions. They should test whether special checklists help in different situations. This will help doctors know the best way to check for melanoma.",10.1002-14651858.CD013194,"How accurate is visual inspection of skin lesions with the naked eye for diagnosis of melanoma in adults? 
What is the aim of the review? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate checking suspicious skin lesions (lumps, bumps, wounds, scratches or grazes) with the naked eye (visual inspection) can be to diagnose melanoma (diagnostic accuracy). The Review also investigated whether diagnostic accuracy was different depending on whether the clinician was face to face with the patient (in‐person visual inspection), or looked at an image of the lesion (image‐based visual inspection). Cochrane researchers included 19 studies to answer this question. 
Why is it important to know the diagnostic accuracy of visual examination of skin lesions suspected to be melanomas? 
Not recognising a melanoma when it is present (a false‐negative test result) delays surgery to remove it (excision), risking cancer spreading to other organs in the body and possibly death. Diagnosing a skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) as a melanoma when it is not (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery, further investigations, and patient anxiety. Visual inspection of suspicious skin lesions by a clinician using the naked eye is usually the first of a series of ‘tests’ to diagnose melanoma. Knowing the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection alone is important to decide whether additional tests, such as a biopsy (removing a part of the lesion for examination under a microscope) are needed to improve accuracy to an acceptable level. 
What did the review study? 
Researchers wanted to find out the diagnostic accuracy of in‐person compared with image‐based visual inspection of suspicious skin lesions. Researchers also wanted to find out whether diagnostic accuracy was improved if doctors used a 'visual inspection checklist' or depending on how experienced in visual inspection they were (level of clinical expertise). They considered the diagnostic accuracy of the first visual inspection of a lesion, for example, by a general practitioner (GP), and of lesions that had been referred for further evaluation, for example, by a dermatologist (doctor specialising in skin problems). 
What are the main results of the review? 
Only 19 studies (17 in‐person studies and 2 image‐based studies) were clear whether the test was the first visual inspection of a lesion or was a visual inspection following referral (for example, when patients are referred by a GP to skin specialists for visual inspection). 
First in‐person visual inspection (3 studies) 
The results of three studies of 1339 suspicious skin lesions suggest that in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 90 (9%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ An estimated 268 will have a visual inspection result indicating melanoma is present. Of these, 185 will not be melanoma and will result in an unnecessary biopsy (false‐positive results). 
‐ An estimated 732 will have a visual inspection result indicating that melanoma is not present. Of these, seven will actually have melanoma and would not be sent for biopsy (false‐negative results). 
Two further studies restricted to 4228 suspicious skin lesions that were all selected to be excised found similar results. 
In‐person visual inspection after referral, all lesions selected to be excised (8 studies) 
The results of eight studies of 5331 suspicious skin lesions suggest that in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 90 (9%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ An estimated 108 will have a visual inspection result indicating melanoma is present, and of these, 39 will not be melanoma and will result in an unnecessary biopsy (false‐positive results). 
‐ Of the 892 lesions with a visual inspection result indicating that melanoma is not present, 21 will actually be melanoma and would not be sent for biopsy (false‐negative results). 
Overall, the number of false‐positive results (diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not) was observed to be higher and the number of false‐negative results (not recognising a melanoma when it is present) lower for first visual inspections of suspicious skin lesions compared to visual inspection following referral. 
Visual inspection of images of suspicious skin lesions (2 studies) 
Accuracy was much lower for visual inspection of images of lesions compared to visual inspection in person. 
Value of visual inspection checklists 
There was no evidence that use of a visual inspection checklist or the level of clinical expertise changed diagnostic accuracy. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The majority of included studies diagnosed melanoma by lesion biopsy and confirmed that melanoma was not present by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma. In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow‐up, or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses). Biopsy or follow‐up are likely to have been reliable methods for deciding whether patients really had melanoma. In a few studies, experts diagnosed the absence of melanoma (expert diagnosis), which is less likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had melanoma. There was lots of variation in the results of the studies in this review and the studies did not always describe fully the methods they used, which made it difficult to assess their reliability. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Thirteen studies were undertaken in Europe (68%), with the remainder undertaken in Asia (n = 1), Oceania (n = 4), and North America (n = 1). Mean age ranged from 30 to 73.6 years (reported in 10 studies). The percentage of individuals with melanoma ranged between 4% and 20% in first visualised lesions and between 1% and 50% in studies of referred lesions. In the majority of studies, the lesions were unlikely to be representative of the range of those seen in practice, for example, only including skin lesions of a certain size or with a specific appearance. In addition, variation in the expertise of clinicians performing visual inspection and in the definition used to decide whether or not melanoma was present across studies makes it unclear as to how visual inspection should be carried out and by whom in order to achieve the accuracy observed in studies. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Error rates from visual inspection are too high for it to be relied upon alone. Although not evaluated in this review, other technologies need to be used to ensure accurate diagnosis of skin cancer. There is considerable variation and uncertainty about the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection alone for the diagnosis of melanoma. There is no evidence to suggest that visual inspection checklists reliably improve the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection, so recommendations cannot be made about when they should be used. Despite the existence of numerous research studies, further, well‐reported studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection with and without visual inspection checklists and by clinicians with different levels of expertise are needed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.

A considerable challenge for maternity care providers is recognising clinical deterioration early in pregnant women. Professional bodies recommend the use of clinical assessment protocols or evaluation tools, commonly referred to as physiological track‐and‐trigger systems (TTS) or early warning systems (EWS), as a means of helping maternity care providers recognise actual or potential clinical deterioration early. TTS/EWS are clinician‐administered (midwife, obstetrician), bedside physiological assessment protocols, charts or tools designed to record routinely assessed clinical parameters; that is, blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, urine output and mental/neurological alertness. In general, these systems involve the application of scores or alert indicators to the observed physiological parameters based on their prespecified limits of normality. The overall system score or alert limit is then used to assist the maternity care provider identify a need to escalate care. This, in turn, may allow for earlier intervention(s) to alter the course of the emerging critical illness and ultimately reduce or avoid mortality and morbidity sequelae. 
Objectives
To evaluate the clinical‐ and cost‐effectiveness of maternal physiological TTS/EWS on pregnancy, labour and birth, postpartum (up to 42 days) and neonatal outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (28 May 2021), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (7 June 2021), OpenGrey, the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database (7 June 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐RCTs, comparing physiological TTS/EWS with no system or another system. Participants were women who were pregnant or had given birth within the previous 42 days, at high risk and low risk for pregnancy, labour and birth, and postpartum complications. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (VS and MN) independently assessed all identified papers for inclusion and performed risk of bias assessments. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Data extraction was also conducted independently by two review authors (VS and MN) and checked for accuracy. We used the summary odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to present the results for dichotomous data and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI to present the results for continuous data. 
Main results
We included two studies, a parallel RCT involving 700 women and a stepped‐wedge cluster trial involving 536,233 women. Both studies were published in 2019, and both were conducted in low‐resource settings. The interventions were the 'Saving Mothers Score' (SMS) and the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device, and both interventions were compared with standard care. Both studies had low or unclear risk of bias on all seven risk of bias criteria. Evidence certainty, assessed using GRADE, ranged from very low to moderate certainty, mainly due to other bias as well as inconsistency and imprecision. 
For women randomised to TTS/EWS compared to standard care there is probably little to no difference in maternal death (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.11; 1 study, 536,233 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care may reduce total haemorrhage (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.69; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For women randomised to TTS/EWS compared to standard care there may be little to no difference in sepsis (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.80; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence), eclampsia (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.03; 2 studies, 536,933 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and HELLP (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.40; 1 study, 700 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and probably little to no difference in maternal admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (OR 0.78, 95% CI  0.53 to 1.15; 2 studies, 536,933 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care may reduce a woman's length of hospital stay (MD ‐1.21, 95% CI ‐1.78 to ‐0.64; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence) but may result in little to no difference in neonatal death (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.84; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Cost‐effectiveness measures were not measured in either of the two studies.  
Authors' conclusions
Use of TTS/EWS in maternity care may be helpful in reducing some maternal outcomes such as haemorrhage and maternal length of hospital stay, possibly through early identification of clinical deterioration and escalation of care. The evidence suggests that the use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care probably results in little to no difference in maternal death and may result in little to no difference in neonatal death. Both of the included studies were conducted in low‐resource settings where the use of TTS/EWS might potentially confer a different effect to TTS/EWS use in high‐resource settings. Further high‐quality trials in high‐ and middle‐resource settings, as well as in discrete populations of high‐ and low‐risk women, are required. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using Early Warning Systems to Detect Health Problems in Pregnant Women

## Plain Title

Can special tracking tools help doctors and nurses spot health problems earlier in pregnant women?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Pregnant women can become very sick very quickly. Doctors and nurses sometimes find it hard to notice when a pregnant woman's health is getting worse. Missing early warning signs can lead to serious problems for both mother and baby.

**What are early warning systems?**

Early warning systems are special charts or tools that nurses and doctors use at the bedside. They check and write down important body signs like blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, how much urine a woman makes, and how alert she is. The system gives scores or alerts when these signs are not normal. This helps staff know when they need to get more help or start treatment quickly.

**Why was this study needed?**

Health experts think these tracking tools might help save lives. By catching problems early, doctors can treat women sooner. This might prevent serious illness or death for mothers and babies. However, researchers needed to find out if these tools really work.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies that tested early warning systems in pregnant women. They found two studies that met their standards. One study included 700 women. The other study was much larger with 536,233 women. Both studies were done in 2019 in countries with fewer medical resources.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included women who were pregnant or had given birth within the past 42 days. The women had different levels of health risk. Some were healthy, while others had higher chances of problems.

**What did the studies compare?**

Both studies tested special early warning tools. One tool was called the ""Saving Mothers Score."" The other was called the ""CRADLE Vital Sign Alert device."" Researchers compared these tools to regular care without special tracking systems.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The studies showed mixed results:

**Deaths:** Using early warning systems probably made little to no difference in how many mothers died. The tools also made little to no difference in how many babies died.

**Bleeding:** The early warning systems may help reduce severe bleeding after birth. This was one clear benefit found in the research.

**Hospital stays:** Women who were tracked with these systems may have spent less time in the hospital. On average, they left about one day earlier.

**Other serious problems:** The tools may make little to no difference in other serious conditions. These include blood infections, seizures from high blood pressure, and liver problems. The tools probably made little to no difference in how many women needed intensive care.

**What does this mean?**

Early warning systems might help in some ways. They may reduce bleeding and shorten hospital stays. This could happen because staff notice problems earlier and act faster. However, the tools did not clearly reduce deaths of mothers or babies in these studies.

**Important notes:**

Both studies took place in countries with limited medical resources. The tools might work differently in countries with more hospitals and equipment. More research is needed in different settings and with different groups of women.

**What comes next?**

Researchers need to do more high-quality studies. These should include countries with better medical resources. They should also look at women with different health risks separately. This will help doctors know when these tools work best.

**Cost information:**

Neither study looked at whether these systems save money. This is important information that future studies should include.",10.1002-14651858.CD013276,"Physiological track‐and‐trigger/early warning systems for use in maternity care
What is the question? 
The aim of this review is to find out from randomised controlled trials if using simple monitoring tools are helpful in alerting to clinical problems and in reducing serious illness or death in pregnant women and in their first six weeks after birth. Examples of such tools are track and trigger systems or early warning systems kept by the bedside in maternity care. 
Why is this important? 
Many natural functional changes occur in a woman's body during pregnancy. As a result, a pregnant woman, who may appear healthy and well, can become rapidly very sick. This is called clinical deterioration. If not detected sufficiently early and treated successfully, the pregnant woman can become seriously ill or even die. Examples are serious bleeding, development of convulsions when a woman has high blood pressure, blood clots and serious infection. Simple bedside tools or charts can be used by maternity care providers (midwives and doctors) to record information on a woman's health. The recorded health measures include her blood pressure, pulse rate, breathing rate, body temperature, and other health measures such as urine output and mental alertness. The tools have been introduced so that the measures are observed, recorded and interpreted together, rather than as single measures. The intention is to detect when serious illness is, or might be developing. Medical staff can then step in to prevent serious harm.  
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 28 May 2021 and identified two studies that compared an early warning system with standard care. One study was a single‐centre study involving 700 women and the second was a stepped‐wedge cluster trial (multiple centres grouped into 'clusters') involving 536,233 women. Different clusters of centres introduced the tool over time until all centres were using the tool. Both studies were carried out in low‐resource healthcare settings. The tools were called the 'Saving Mothers Score' (SMS) and the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device. Risk of bias in the two studies was low or unclear.  
We found that the tools probably do not reduce maternal death. Women may have less serious bleeding (or haemorrhage) when an early warning tool is used. This finding was supported by low‐certainty evidence. We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to a potentially life‐threatening body response to infection (sepsis), to blood pressure with swelling, protein in the urine and convulsions (eclampsia), to a serious illness in pregnancy that affects the blood and the way the liver works (HELLP), or being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Use of the tools probably reduces the time a woman stays in hospital (moderate‐certainty evidence). We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to the death of the baby in the first month after birth (neonatal death). This finding was supported by low‐certainty evidence. Neither of the two included studies reported cost outcomes. 
What does this mean? 
Use of early warning tools for women in maternity care in low‐resource settings may reduce serious bleeding and probably reduces the number of days a woman stays in the hospital but may not reduce maternal or infant deaths. More studies are required on the different early warning systems in low‐resource settings. Studies are also needed in middle‐ and high‐resource settings, and in high‐ and low‐risk pregnant women.

9,10.1002-14651858.CD013705.pub3-abstract.txt,"Background
Accurate rapid diagnostic tests for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection would be a useful tool to help manage the COVID‐19 pandemic. Testing strategies that use rapid antigen tests to detect current infection have the potential to increase access to testing, speed detection of infection, and inform clinical and public health management decisions to reduce transmission. This is the second update of this review, which was first published in 2020. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of rapid, point‐of‐care antigen tests for diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We consider accuracy separately in symptomatic and asymptomatic population groups. Sources of heterogeneity investigated included setting and indication for testing, assay format, sample site, viral load, age, timing of test, and study design. 
Search methods
We searched the COVID‐19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) on 08 March 2021. We included independent evaluations from national reference laboratories, FIND and the Diagnostics Global Health website. We did not apply language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included studies of people with either suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, known SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or known absence of infection, or those who were being screened for infection. We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated commercially produced, rapid antigen tests. We included evaluations of single applications of a test (one test result reported per person) and evaluations of serial testing (repeated antigen testing over time). Reference standards for presence or absence of infection were any laboratory‐based molecular test (primarily reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR)) or pre‐pandemic respiratory sample. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard screening procedures with three people. Two people independently carried out quality assessment (using the QUADAS‐2 tool) and extracted study results. Other study characteristics were extracted by one review author and checked by a second. We present sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each test, and pooled data using the bivariate model. We investigated heterogeneity by including indicator variables in the random‐effects logistic regression models. We tabulated results by test manufacturer and compliance with manufacturer instructions for use and according to symptom status. 
Main results
We included 155 study cohorts (described in 166 study reports, with 24 as preprints). The main results relate to 152 evaluations of single test applications including 100,462 unique samples (16,822 with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2). Studies were mainly conducted in Europe (101/152, 66%), and evaluated 49 different commercial antigen assays. Only 23 studies compared two or more brands of test. 
Risk of bias was high because of participant selection (40, 26%); interpretation of the index test (6, 4%); weaknesses in the reference standard for absence of infection (119, 78%); and participant flow and timing 41 (27%). Characteristics of participants (45, 30%) and index test delivery (47, 31%) differed from the way in which and in whom the test was intended to be used. Nearly all studies (91%) used a single RT‐PCR result to define presence or absence of infection. 
The 152 studies of single test applications reported 228 evaluations of antigen tests. Estimates of sensitivity varied considerably between studies, with consistently high specificities. Average sensitivity was higher in symptomatic (73.0%, 95% CI 69.3% to 76.4%; 109 evaluations; 50,574 samples, 11,662 cases) compared to asymptomatic participants (54.7%, 95% CI 47.7% to 61.6%; 50 evaluations; 40,956 samples, 2641 cases). Average sensitivity was higher in the first week after symptom onset (80.9%, 95% CI 76.9% to 84.4%; 30 evaluations, 2408 cases) than in the second week of symptoms (53.8%, 95% CI 48.0% to 59.6%; 40 evaluations, 1119 cases). For those who were asymptomatic at the time of testing, sensitivity was higher when an epidemiological exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2 was suspected (64.3%, 95% CI 54.6% to 73.0%; 16 evaluations; 7677 samples, 703 cases) compared to where COVID‐19 testing was reported to be widely available to anyone on presentation for testing (49.6%, 95% CI 42.1% to 57.1%; 26 evaluations; 31,904 samples, 1758 cases). Average specificity was similarly high for symptomatic (99.1%) or asymptomatic (99.7%) participants. 
We observed a steady decline in summary sensitivities as measures of sample viral load decreased. 
Sensitivity varied between brands. When tests were used according to manufacturer instructions, average sensitivities by brand ranged from 34.3% to 91.3% in symptomatic participants (20 assays with eligible data) and from 28.6% to 77.8% for asymptomatic participants (12 assays). For symptomatic participants, summary sensitivities for seven assays were 80% or more (meeting acceptable criteria set by the World Health Organization (WHO)). The WHO acceptable performance criterion of 97% specificity was met by 17 of 20 assays when tests were used according to manufacturer instructions, 12 of which demonstrated specificities above 99%. For asymptomatic participants the sensitivities of only two assays approached but did not meet WHO acceptable performance standards in one study each; specificities for asymptomatic participants were in a similar range to those observed for symptomatic people. 
At 5% prevalence using summary data in symptomatic people during the first week after symptom onset, the positive predictive value (PPV) of 89% means that 1 in 10 positive results will be a false positive, and around 1 in 5 cases will be missed. At 0.5% prevalence using summary data for asymptomatic people, where testing was widely available and where epidemiological exposure to COVID‐19 was suspected, resulting PPVs would be 38% to 52%, meaning that between 2 in 5 and 1 in 2 positive results will be false positives, and between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 cases will be missed. 
Authors' conclusions
Antigen tests vary in sensitivity. In people with signs and symptoms of COVID‐19, sensitivities are highest in the first week of illness when viral loads are higher. Assays that meet appropriate performance standards, such as those set by WHO, could replace laboratory‐based RT‐PCR when immediate decisions about patient care must be made, or where RT‐PCR cannot be delivered in a timely manner. However, they are more suitable for use as triage to RT‐PCR testing. The variable sensitivity of antigen tests means that people who test negative may still be infected. Many commercially available rapid antigen tests have not been evaluated in independent validation studies. 
Evidence for testing in asymptomatic cohorts has increased, however sensitivity is lower and there is a paucity of evidence for testing in different settings. Questions remain about the use of antigen test‐based repeat testing strategies. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of screening programmes at reducing transmission of infection, whether mass screening or targeted approaches including schools, healthcare setting and traveller screening. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Rapid Tests to Detect COVID-19 Infection

## Plain Title
How Well Do Rapid Antigen Tests Detect COVID-19 Infection?

## Rationale

### What is COVID-19 and why is testing important?
COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. This virus spreads easily from person to person. Testing helps find out who has the virus. When we know who is infected, we can stop the virus from spreading to others.

### What are rapid antigen tests?
Rapid antigen tests are quick tests that can show results in minutes. They look for parts of the virus in samples from your nose or throat. These tests are faster than lab tests, which can take hours or days.

### Why did researchers do this study?
Researchers wanted to know how well rapid antigen tests work. They wanted to see if these tests could help doctors and health workers make quick decisions. Fast test results could help sick people get care sooner. They could also help stop the virus from spreading.

### What did researchers want to find out?
Researchers wanted to know two main things. First, how often do these tests correctly find the virus when someone has it? Second, how often do these tests correctly show no virus when someone does not have it?

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study these tests?
Researchers looked at 155 different groups of studies. These studies included over 100,000 test samples from people. The studies tested 49 different brands of rapid antigen tests.

### Who was tested in these studies?
The studies included different types of people:
- People who felt sick and might have COVID-19
- People who felt fine but might have been exposed to the virus
- People being checked for the virus even without symptoms

The studies included people of all ages. Most studies took place in Europe.

### How did researchers check if the tests were right?
Researchers compared rapid test results to lab tests called RT-PCR. RT-PCR tests are very accurate. They are considered the best way to know if someone has the virus.

### How long did the studies last?
Each person in the studies gave one or more test samples. Most people were tested just once. Some studies tested people multiple times over several days or weeks.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

#### For people with symptoms:
The tests found the virus in 73 out of 100 people who had it. This means the tests missed 27 out of 100 infected people. The tests worked best in the first week of illness. During that time, they found 81 out of 100 infected people. In the second week, they only found 54 out of 100 infected people.

The tests rarely said someone had the virus when they did not. They were correct 99 out of 100 times when saying someone did not have the virus.

#### For people without symptoms:
The tests found the virus in only 55 out of 100 people who had it. This means they missed 45 out of 100 infected people. The tests worked better when people had been near someone with COVID-19. They found 64 out of 100 infected people in this group.

#### Different test brands worked differently:
Some brands found the virus better than others. The best tests found between 80 and 91 out of 100 infected people with symptoms. The worst tests found only 34 out of 100 infected people with symptoms.

Seven test brands met the standards set by the World Health Organization for people with symptoms. Only two brands came close to meeting standards for people without symptoms.

#### What do these results mean in real life?
If 5 out of 100 people have COVID-19 and show symptoms in their first week:
- 1 out of 10 positive test results will be wrong
- About 1 out of 5 infected people will be missed

If only 5 out of 1,000 people have COVID-19 and have no symptoms:
- Between 1 in 2 and 2 in 5 positive results will be wrong
- Between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 infected people will be missed

### What did the researchers conclude?
Rapid antigen tests work differently depending on the brand. They work best for people with symptoms in the first week of illness. Some tests are good enough to use when quick decisions are needed. However, they work better as a first check before doing a lab test.

People who test negative might still have the virus. This is especially true for people without symptoms. More research is needed to understand how well these tests work for screening large groups of people.",10.1002-14651858.CD013705,"How accurate are rapid antigen tests for diagnosing COVID‐19?
Key messages 
• Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID‐19, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected. 
• Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID‐19. 
• The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests. 
What are rapid point‐of‐care antigen tests for COVID‐19? 
Rapid point‐of‐care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID‐19 infection in people with or without COVID‐19 symptoms. They: 
• are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point‐of‐care) or in non‐healthcare settings such as in the home; 
• are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps; 
• are less expensive than standard laboratory tests;
• do not require a specialist operator or setting; and
• provide results ‘while you wait’.
For this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as ‘lateral flow tests’. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over‐the‐counter pregnancy tests. 
Why is this question important? 
People with suspected COVID‐19 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self‐isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID‐19 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT‐PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result. 
In many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID‐19 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID‐19, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point‐of‐care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID‐19 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID‐19 using RT‐PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms. 
What did we find? 
We included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID‐19 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe. 
Main results 
In people with confirmed COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID‐19 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID‐19 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). 
In people who did not have COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms. 
Different brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as ‘acceptable’ for confirming and ruling out COVID‐19 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID‐19. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms. 
Using summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID‐19: 
• 45 people would test positive for COVID‐19. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID‐19 (false positive result). 
• 955 people would test negative for COVID‐19. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID‐19 (false negative result). 
In people with no symptoms of COVID‐19 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID‐19 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID‐19: 
• 62 people would test positive for COVID‐19. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID‐19 (false positive result). 
• 9938 people would test negative for COVID‐19. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID‐19 (false negative result). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
In general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers’ instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID‐19 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT‐PCR result as evidence of no COVID‐19 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms. 
What does this mean? 
In people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT‐PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT‐PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT‐PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self‐isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people ‐ individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected. 
Rapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID‐19. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non‐healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers’ instructions.

10,10.1002-14651858.CD008838.pub2-abstract.txt,"Immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings
At least 1 in 200 people have suffered a severe allergic reaction to a sting from a bee, wasp, or ant, and insect stings are the second most common cause of fatal allergic reactions in some countries. Treatment with insect venom, usually given by a course of injections (called venom immunotherapy), is thought to reduce the risk of allergic reactions to an insect sting. In this review, we evaluated the effectiveness of venom immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings. 
From analysis of 7 studies, which included 392 participants, we found that this treatment reduces the chance of having a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by 90%, a consistent finding between studies. Venom immunotherapy also significantly improves the quality of life of people who have had a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by reducing anxiety and possible limitation of activities caused by fear of insects. However, almost 1 in 10 people treated with venom immunotherapy during the trials had an allergic reaction to their treatment. We were unable to find out whether venom immunotherapy prevents fatal allergic reactions to insect stings, because these are so rare. The decision whether to start venom immunotherapy depends on an accurate diagnosis, followed by careful assessment of a person's risk of having another allergic reaction to a sting, the degree to which the insect sting allergy affects their quality of life, and the risk of an allergic reaction to their treatment.

## Plain Title
How Well Does Allergy Treatment Work to Prevent Bad Reactions to Insect Stings?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Some people have very bad reactions when stung by bees, wasps, or ants. At least 1 out of 200 people have had a severe reaction to an insect sting. In some countries, insect stings are the second most common cause of deadly allergic reactions.

### What happens to people with this problem?
People who have had bad reactions to stings often feel very worried. They may be scared of insects. This fear can stop them from doing normal activities outside.

### What treatment might help?
Doctors can give a treatment called venom immunotherapy. This treatment uses small amounts of insect venom. The venom is usually given through a series of shots over time. The goal is to help the body get used to the venom. This may stop bad reactions from happening if the person gets stung again.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers wanted to find out if venom immunotherapy really works. They needed to know if it keeps people safe from bad reactions. They also wanted to know if the treatment itself was safe.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review study. Researchers looked at 7 different studies that had already been done. They combined the results to get a bigger picture.

### Who was in the studies?
A total of 392 people took part in these 7 studies. All of these people had suffered a severe allergic reaction to an insect sting before.

### What did the studies look at?
The studies tested whether venom immunotherapy could prevent future allergic reactions. Some people got the treatment. Other people did not get the treatment. Researchers then compared what happened to both groups.

## Results

### What were the main findings?
The treatment works very well. Venom immunotherapy reduces the chance of having a serious allergic reaction by 90%. This means 9 out of 10 bad reactions can be prevented. All 7 studies found similar results. This makes the finding very strong.

### How did the treatment help quality of life?
People who got the treatment felt much better about their daily lives. They had less worry and fear about insects. They felt more free to do outdoor activities. They did not have to limit what they did because of fear.

### Were there any problems with the treatment?
About 1 in 10 people had an allergic reaction to the treatment itself. This means the treatment can cause side effects. However, these reactions during treatment were usually manageable.

### What could the study not answer?
The researchers could not find out if the treatment prevents deaths from insect stings. Deaths from insect stings are very rare. The studies were not big enough to measure this.

### What do the results mean?
Venom immunotherapy is a very good treatment for preventing bad reactions to insect stings. But it is not right for everyone. Doctors need to think carefully about each person.

### Who should get this treatment?
The decision to start treatment depends on several things:
- The person must have a correct diagnosis
- Doctors must check how likely the person is to have another bad reaction
- Doctors must consider how much the allergy affects the person's daily life
- Doctors must weigh the risk of reactions to the treatment itself

### Final conclusion
Venom immunotherapy is very effective. It can prevent 9 out of 10 serious allergic reactions to insect stings. It also helps people feel less afraid and live more normal lives. Each person should talk with their doctor to decide if this treatment is right for them.",10.1002-14651858.CD008838,"Immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings
At least 1 in 200 people have suffered a severe allergic reaction to a sting from a bee, wasp, or ant, and insect stings are the second most common cause of fatal allergic reactions in some countries. Treatment with insect venom, usually given by a course of injections (called venom immunotherapy), is thought to reduce the risk of allergic reactions to an insect sting. In this review, we evaluated the effectiveness of venom immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings. 
From analysis of 7 studies, which included 392 participants, we found that this treatment reduces the chance of having a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by 90%, a consistent finding between studies. Venom immunotherapy also significantly improves the quality of life of people who have had a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by reducing anxiety and possible limitation of activities caused by fear of insects. However, almost 1 in 10 people treated with venom immunotherapy during the trials had an allergic reaction to their treatment. We were unable to find out whether venom immunotherapy prevents fatal allergic reactions to insect stings, because these are so rare. The decision whether to start venom immunotherapy depends on an accurate diagnosis, followed by careful assessment of a person's risk of having another allergic reaction to a sting, the degree to which the insect sting allergy affects their quality of life, and the risk of an allergic reaction to their treatment.

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Strengths of Blood Cleaning Treatment for Patients with Sudden Kidney Failure

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people in the hospital get very sick and their kidneys suddenly stop working well. Doctors call this acute kidney injury, or AKI. When kidneys fail, harmful waste builds up in the blood. These wastes include chemicals like creatinine and urea. Too much potassium and acid also build up. Extra water stays in the body. The person may stop making urine. All of these problems can lead to death.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors use a machine to clean the blood when kidneys fail. This treatment is called continuous renal replacement therapy, or CRRT. A thin tube goes into a vein. Blood flows through the tube to a filter. The filter removes waste and extra water. Clean blood flows back into the body. This happens slowly and steadily.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Some doctors thought stronger, more intensive cleaning might work better. They believed it might remove more waste and water. This could help patients live and help their kidneys heal. Researchers wanted to test if stronger treatment was better than gentler treatment.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of other studies. Researchers looked at six different studies. They searched for all studies done up to February 2016. The six studies included 3,185 patients total.

**Who was in the studies?**

All patients were very sick adults in intensive care units. All had sudden kidney failure. Their kidneys had stopped working properly.

**What did the studies compare?**

Some patients got intensive CRRT. This means stronger blood cleaning. Other patients got less intensive CRRT. This means gentler blood cleaning. Researchers compared the two groups.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The stronger treatment did not work better than the gentler treatment. Here are the main findings:

**Death rates:** The same number of patients died in both groups. Stronger cleaning did not save more lives.

**Kidney healing:** Kidneys healed at the same rate in both groups. Stronger cleaning did not help kidneys recover faster.

**Side effects:** Both treatments caused similar side effects. One example is bleeding. The rates were the same in both groups.

**One difference:** Patients getting stronger treatment had one problem. Their blood phosphate levels dropped too low. Phosphate is a mineral the body needs. Low phosphate can cause weakness and other problems.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Gentler blood cleaning works just as well as stronger cleaning. Patients do not benefit from more intensive treatment. Gentler treatment may be safer because it causes fewer problems with phosphate levels.

**Why is this important?**

This study helps doctors choose the best treatment. They now know that stronger is not better. Gentler treatment is just as good. It may also be safer and cost less.

**Conclusions:**

For patients with sudden kidney failure, the strength of blood cleaning treatment does not matter much. Both intensive and less intensive treatments work equally well. Doctors can safely use gentler treatment. This is good news because gentler treatment may have fewer side effects.",10.1002-14651858.CD010613,"Intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury

Demodex blepharitis is a chronic condition commonly associated with recalcitrant dry eye symptoms though many people with Demodex mites are asymptomatic. The primary cause of this condition in humans is two types of Demodex mites: Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis. There are varying reports of the prevalence of Demodex blepharitis among adults, and it affects both men and women equally. While Demodex mites are commonly treated with tea tree oil, the effectiveness of tea tree oil for treating Demodex blepharitis is not well documented. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of tea tree oil on ocular Demodex infestation in people with Demodex blepharitis. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2019, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; LILACS; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the databases on 18 June 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared treatment with tea tree oil (or its components) versus another treatment or no treatment for people with Demodex blepharitis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts and then full text of records to determine their eligibility. The review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using Covidence. A third review author resolved any conflicts at all stages. 
Main results
We included six RCTs (1124 eyes of 562 participants; 17 to 281 participants per study) from the US, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey. The RCTs compared some formulation of tea tree oil to another treatment or no treatment. Included participants were both men and women, ranging from 39 to 55 years of age. All RCTs were assessed at unclear or high risk of bias in one or more domains. We also identified two RCTs that are ongoing or awaiting publications. 
Data from three RCTs that reported a short‐term mean change in the number of Demodex mites per eight eyelashes contributed to a meta‐analysis. We are uncertain about the mean reduction for the groups that received the tea tree oil intervention (mean difference [MD] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24 to 1.16) at four to six weeks as compared to other interventions. Only one RCT reported data for long‐term changes, which found that the group that received intense pulse light as the treatment had complete eradication of Demodex mites at three months. We graded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as very low. 
Three RCTs reported no evidence of a difference for participant reported symptoms measured on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) between the tea tree oil group and the group receiving other forms of intervention. Mean differences in these studies ranged from ‐10.54 (95% CI – 24.19, 3.11) to 3.40 (95% CI ‐0.70 7.50). We did not conduct a meta‐analysis for this outcome given substantial statistical heterogeneity and graded the certainty of the evidence as low. 
One RCT provided information concerning visual acuity but did not provide sufficient data for between‐group comparisons. The authors noted that mean habitual LogMAR visual acuity for all study participants improved post‐treatment (mean LogMAR 1.16, standard deviation 0.26 at 4 weeks). We graded the certainty of evidence for this outcome as low. No RCTs provided data on mean change in number of cylindrical dandruff or the proportion of participants experiencing conjunctival injection or experiencing meibomian gland dysfunction. 
Three RCTs provided information on adverse events. One reported no adverse events. The other two described a total of six participants randomized to treatment with tea tree oil who experienced ocular irritation or discomfort that resolved with re‐educating the patient on application techniques and continuing use of the tea tree oil. We graded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as very low. 
Authors' conclusions
The current review suggests that there is uncertainty related to the effectiveness of 5% to 50% tea tree oil for the short‐term treatment of Demodex blepharitis; however, if used, lower concentrations may be preferable in the eye care arena to avoid induced ocular irritation. Future studies should be better controlled, assess outcomes at long term (e.g. 10 to 12 weeks or beyond), account for patient compliance, and study the effects of different tea tree oil concentrations. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Tea Tree Oil for Treating Eyelid Mites

## Plain Title

Does tea tree oil help treat tiny mites that live on the eyelids?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**

Tiny mites called Demodex can live on human eyelids. Two types of these mites affect people: Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis. When these mites cause problems, the condition is called Demodex blepharitis. Blepharitis means the eyelids are swollen or irritated.

**What problems does it cause?**

Many people with these mites have no symptoms at all. However, some people develop long-lasting dry eye problems that do not go away easily. This can make daily life harder for patients. Both men and women can get this condition.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors often use tea tree oil to treat these eyelid mites. However, no one knew for sure if tea tree oil really works. Researchers needed to study whether tea tree oil actually helps people with Demodex blepharitis. They wanted to know if it reduces the number of mites and makes symptoms better.

**Why might tea tree oil work?**

Tea tree oil is a natural product that may kill mites or stop them from growing. Doctors have used it for years, but they needed proof that it works.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies that tested tea tree oil for eyelid mites. They found six studies from different countries: the United States, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey.

**Who was in the studies?**

The six studies included 562 people total. This means 1,124 eyes were studied. Each study had between 17 and 281 people. Both men and women joined these studies. People in the studies were between 39 and 55 years old. All had Demodex mites on their eyelids.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared tea tree oil to other treatments or no treatment. Some studies used different amounts of tea tree oil. The amounts ranged from 5% to 50% tea tree oil.

**How long did the studies last?**

Most studies checked results after 4 to 6 weeks. This is called short-term. Only one study looked at results after 3 months. This is called long-term.

## Results

**What did researchers find about mite numbers?**

Researchers are not sure if tea tree oil reduces the number of mites. Three studies counted mites on eyelashes after 4 to 6 weeks. The results were unclear. One study looked at 3 months and found that a different treatment called intense pulse light worked better than tea tree oil at removing all mites.

**What did patients say about their symptoms?**

Three studies asked patients about their eye symptoms. Researchers used a questionnaire called the Ocular Surface Disease Index. Patients who used tea tree oil did not feel much different than patients who used other treatments. The evidence quality for this finding was low.

**Did vision improve?**

One study looked at how well people could see. Vision improved slightly for all people in the study after 4 weeks. However, the study did not compare tea tree oil to other treatments clearly. The evidence quality was low.

**Were there side effects?**

Three studies reported on side effects. One study found no side effects. Two other studies found that 6 people had eye irritation or discomfort from tea tree oil. These problems went away after doctors taught patients the right way to apply the oil. The evidence quality for side effects was very low.

**What do the results mean?**

Researchers are not certain if tea tree oil works for treating eyelid mites. If doctors do use tea tree oil, lower amounts may be safer. Higher amounts may irritate the eyes more.

**What is needed next?**

Future studies should be better designed. They should follow patients for longer times, such as 10 to 12 weeks or more. Studies should check if patients use the treatment correctly. They should also test different amounts of tea tree oil to find the safest and most helpful dose.",10.1002-14651858.CD013333,"Tea tree oil for Demodex blepharitis
What was the aim of this review?To examine the effects of tea tree oil, an essential oil derived from an Australian tree, which can be applied in many different forms (eyelid wipes, eyelid shampoo, oil massages, etc.) on Demodex blepharitis. Demodex blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid caused by Demodex mites (frequently referred to as eyelash mites). 
Key messagesWe are uncertain if tea tree oil is better compared to other treatments. Other factors such as dosage, ocular hygiene, and patient compliance likely affect treatment outcomes; however, more and better‐designed studies are needed to confirm these findings. 
What did we study in this review?Blepharitis causes symptoms such as eye itching, burning, dryness, irritation, watering, or blurry vision, which lead people to seek medical attention. This study aimed to understand the ability of tea tree oil to improve symptoms or to treat Demodex blepharitis (or both) in comparison to no treatment or other forms of treatment containing no tea tree oil. 
What were the main results of this review?This review included six studies with 562 participants (1124 eyes). They were men and women between the ages of 39 and 55 years. The included studies were conducted in the US, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey. Trial designs greatly varied, which limited analyses and the confidence in the results. Most studies included in this report had a high degree of bias. It is uncertain if tea tree oil (concentration ranging from 5% to 50%) is helpful for reducing the number of Demodex mites in people with Demodex blepharitis in short‐term cases. While not fully addressed in the reviewed literature, people should be educated on how to properly apply tea tree oil products because patient compliance and method of application likely affects efficacy. None of the studies in this review reported any side effects directly related to the treatment; however, one study did report irritation around the eyes on using tea tree oil, which was resolved on re‐educating the person on the application technique.

","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments to Prevent Bleeding During Surgery in People with Bleeding Disorders

## Plain Title
Comparing Treatments to Stop Bleeding During Surgery in People Born with Bleeding Problems

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
Some people are born with bleeding disorders. This means their blood does not clot the way it should. Clotting is when blood thickens and stops flowing. Without proper clotting, people can bleed too much.

Hemophilia is one type of bleeding disorder. People with hemophilia are missing certain proteins in their blood. These proteins help blood clot. Without them, even small cuts can bleed for a long time.

### Why is this a problem during surgery?
Surgery always involves some bleeding. For people with bleeding disorders, surgery can be very risky. They may bleed much more than other people. How much they bleed depends on two things: how severe their bleeding disorder is and what type of surgery they need.

### What treatments might help?
Doctors can give medicines to help blood clot better during surgery. Some people get clotting factor concentrates. These replace the missing clotting proteins. Other people get different drugs that help blood clot. Sometimes doctors use both types of medicine together.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors do not know the best way to give these treatments. They do not know the right dose. They do not know how long to give the medicine. They do not know the best way to give it. This study looked at research to find answers to these questions.

## Trial Design

### How is this study designed?
This was a review of other studies. The researchers looked for trials that compared different treatments. They only included certain types of studies. These studies had to randomly assign people to different treatment groups.

The researchers found four studies to include. These studies had 112 people total.

### Who was in the studies?
All the people had bleeding disorders from birth. Most had hemophilia A or hemophilia B. Some people also had inhibitors. Inhibitors are antibodies that fight against clotting factor treatment. This makes treatment harder.

### What did the studies compare?
Two studies looked at 59 people having teeth pulled. These people got standard treatment. Some also got an extra drug called an antifibrinolytic. This drug stops clots from breaking down. Other people got a fake pill called a placebo.

Two other studies looked at 53 people with inhibitors. These people were having surgery. They got a medicine called recombinant activated factor VII. One study compared a high dose to a low dose. The other study compared one large dose to a steady drip of medicine.

### How long were people in the studies?
The studies followed people during surgery and after surgery. The exact time varied by study type.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The four studies gave some useful information. They showed two specific situations where certain treatments might work. However, the studies were small. They did not answer most questions about the best treatments.

### What is still unknown?
Doctors still do not know the best treatment for each type of bleeding disorder. They do not know the best treatment for each type of surgery. There is not enough evidence from these studies to make clear recommendations.

### What do the researchers conclude?
More studies would help doctors learn more. However, these studies are hard to do. Right now, they are not seen as the most important research to do.

The good news is that surgery is already done safely in people with bleeding disorders. Doctors use their experience and information from other types of studies. They follow local guidelines. Both major and minor surgeries are performed successfully.

### What does this mean for patients?
Patients with bleeding disorders can have surgery safely. Doctors know how to manage bleeding during surgery. However, the exact best treatment approach is not proven by research studies. Doctors rely on their experience and other information to make treatment decisions.",10.1002-14651858.CD009961,"Preventing bleeding in people with congenital bleeding disorders during and after surgery

We searched the following databases from inception to December 2021: MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library), CINAHL (EBSCO host), LILACS, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the US National Institutes of Health clinical trial register, the European Union Clinical Trials Register, the International Association for Cannabinoid Medicines databank. We hand searched citation lists of included studies and relevant reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised parallel or cross‐over trials (RCTs) evaluating any cannabinoid (including herbal Cannabis, Cannabis flowers, plant‐based cannabinoids, or synthetic cannabinoids) irrespective of dose, route, frequency, or duration of use for adults with MS. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane Risk of bias 2 tool for parallel RCTs and crossover trials. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: reduction of 30% in the spasticity Numeric Rating Scale, pain relief of 50% or greater in the Numeric Rating Scale‐Pain Intensity, much or very much improvement in the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Health‐Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs) (tolerability), serious adverse events (SAEs), nervous system disorders, psychiatric disorders, physical dependence. 
Main results
We included 25 RCTs with 3763 participants of whom 2290 received cannabinoids. Age ranged from 18 to 60 years, and between 50% and 88% participants across the studies were female.  The included studies were 3 to 48 weeks long and compared nabiximols, an oromucosal spray with a plant derived equal (1:1) combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) (13 studies), synthetic cannabinoids mimicking THC (7 studies), an oral THC extract of Cannabis sativa (2 studies), inhaled herbal Cannabis (1 study) against placebo. One study compared dronabinol, THC extract of Cannabis sativa and placebo, one compared inhaled herbal Cannabis, dronabinol and placebo. We identified eight ongoing studies. 
Critical outcomes 
• Spasticity: nabiximols probably increases the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of spasticity compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 2.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 4.04; 5 RCTs, 1143 participants; I2 = 67%; moderate‐certainty evidence). The absolute effect was 216 more people (95% CI 99 more to 332 more) per 1000 reporting benefit with cannabinoids than with placebo. 
• Chronic neuropathic pain: we found only one small trial that measured the number of participants reporting substantial pain relief with a synthetic cannabinoid compared with placebo (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 16.17; 1 study, 48 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether cannabinoids reduce chronic neuropathic pain intensity. 
• Treatment discontinuation due to AEs: cannabinoids may increase slightly the number of participants who discontinue treatment compared with placebo (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.84; 21 studies, 3110 participants; I² = 17%; low‐certainty evidence); the absolute effect is 39 more people (95% CI 15 more to 76 more) per 1000 people. 
Important outcomes 
• PGIC: cannabinoids probably increase the number of people who report 'very much' or 'much' improvement in health status compared with placebo (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.36; 8 studies, 1215 participants; I² = 0%; moderate‐certainty evidence). The absolute effect is 113 more people (95% CI 57 more to 175 more) per 1000 people reporting improvement. 
• HRQoL: cannabinoids may have little to no effect on HRQoL (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.02; 8 studies, 1942 participants; I2 = 0%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• SAEs: cannabinoids may result in little to no difference in the number of participants who have SAEs compared with placebo (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.99; 20 studies, 3124 participants; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• AEs of the nervous system: cannabinoids may increase nervous system disorders compared with placebo (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.44; 7 studies, 1154 participants; I² = 63%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• Psychiatric disorders: cannabinoids may increase psychiatric disorders compared with placebo (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.88; 6 studies, 1122 participants; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• Drug tolerance: the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of cannabinoids on drug tolerance (OR 3.07, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.95; 2 studies, 458 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Compared with placebo, nabiximols probably reduces the severity of spasticity in the short‐term in people with MS. We are uncertain about the effect on chronic neurological pain and health‐related quality of life. Cannabinoids may increase slightly treatment discontinuation due to AEs, nervous system and psychiatric disorders compared with placebo. We are uncertain about the effect on drug tolerance. The overall certainty of evidence is limited by short‐term duration of the included studies. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Cannabinoids for Treating Symptoms in People with Multiple Sclerosis

## Plain Title

Can cannabis-based medicines help reduce muscle stiffness and pain in people with multiple sclerosis?

## Rationale

**What is multiple sclerosis and why is this study needed?**

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the brain and nerves. People with MS often have two main problems: muscle stiffness (called spasticity) and long-lasting nerve pain. These problems get worse as the disease gets worse. They make it hard for people to do daily tasks and enjoy life.

Current medicines for muscle stiffness and pain often do not work well. Or they cause side effects that people cannot tolerate. Many people with MS want to try cannabis-based medicines. But doctors need to know if these medicines really work and if they are safe.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if cannabis-based medicines can help reduce muscle stiffness and pain in adults with MS. They also wanted to know what side effects these medicines might cause.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 25 different studies. These studies included 3,763 people with MS. Of these people, 2,290 received cannabis-based medicines.

The people in the studies were between 18 and 60 years old. Most were women (50 to 88 out of every 100 people).

The studies lasted from 3 weeks to 48 weeks. Most studies were short-term.

The studies tested different types of cannabis-based medicines:
- Nabiximols: a mouth spray made from cannabis plants
- Synthetic cannabinoids: man-made versions of chemicals found in cannabis
- Cannabis extracts: oils taken from cannabis plants
- Inhaled herbal cannabis: smoked or vaporized cannabis

All these medicines were compared to placebo (a fake treatment with no active medicine).

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**For muscle stiffness:**
Nabiximols probably helps reduce muscle stiffness. Out of every 1,000 people who use it, about 216 more people feel better compared to placebo. This means the medicine helps some people but not everyone.

**For pain:**
Only one small study looked at pain relief. Researchers are not sure if cannabis-based medicines help with nerve pain. More studies are needed.

**For overall improvement:**
Cannabis-based medicines probably help people feel better overall. Out of every 1,000 people, about 113 more people say they feel ""much better"" or ""very much better"" compared to placebo.

**For quality of life:**
Cannabis-based medicines may not improve quality of life much.

**What about side effects?**

Cannabis-based medicines may cause more side effects than placebo:
- About 39 more people out of 1,000 stop treatment because of side effects
- More people have nervous system problems (like dizziness)
- More people have mental health problems (like anxiety or mood changes)

**Serious side effects:**
Cannabis-based medicines may not cause more serious health problems than placebo.

**Drug dependence:**
Researchers are not sure if people become dependent on these medicines. More research is needed.

**What do these results mean?**

Nabiximols mouth spray probably helps reduce muscle stiffness in people with MS in the short term. Some people feel better overall when using cannabis-based medicines.

However, these medicines may cause side effects. Some people may need to stop treatment because of these side effects.

Researchers are not sure about long-term effects. Most studies only lasted a few weeks or months. More long-term studies are needed.

People with MS should talk to their doctors about whether cannabis-based medicines are right for them. Doctors can help weigh the benefits against the risks for each person.",10.1002-14651858.CD013444,"Cannabis and cannabinoids for people with multiple sclerosis
Key messages• Treatment with nabiximols likely results in improvement of spasticity and may not increase serious harmful effects compared with placebo 
• Compared with placebo, cannabinoids (nabiximols, Cannabis extract, synthetic cannabinoids) likely improve well‐being when measured with patient‐reported outcomes  
• Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefit of these medicines for treating chronic neuropathic pain is unclear. 
What is the issue? 
Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience spasticity that causes also pain and impacts on the ability to carry out daily activities. Spasticity is a form of increased muscle tone. Cannabis‐based medicines refer to the use of Cannabis, or its ingredients called cannabinoids, as medical therapies to alleviate spasticity, chronic pain and other symptoms in MS. An international survey found that MS was one of the five medical conditions for which Cannabis was most often used. Another survey conducted in the UK found that more than one in five people with MS reported they had used Cannabis to try to manage their symptoms.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if cannabinoids were better than placebo in adults with MS to improve: 
• spasticity;
• chronic neuropathic pain;
• well‐being,
We also wanted to find out if cannabinoids were associated with:
• treatment discontinuation due to unwanted effects; 
• serious harmful effects;
• nervous system disorders or psychiatric disorders;
• drug tolerance defined as a condition that occurs when the body gets used to a medicine so that more medicine is needed. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that compared cannabinoids against placebo in adult people with MS. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and certainty of evidence. 
What did we find?  
We found 25 studies that involved 3763 people with MS, 2290 of whom received cannabinoids. Fifteen studies were very short term or short‐term studies (two to 12 weeks), seven were intermediate term (12 to 26 weeks), and two were long term (50 and 156 weeks). One study reported results at three days only. The biggest study was conducted in 657 people and the smallest study involved 14 people. Most studies were done in European countries. Thirteen studies evaluated an oral spray (nabiximols) containing two compounds derived from the Cannabis plant. The other studies compared different cannabinoids with placebo. Pharmaceutical companies funded 15 of the studies. 
Main results 
Compared with placebo, cannabinoids: 
• probably increase the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of spasticity for up to 14 weeks (evidence from five studies in 1143 people); 
• may increase the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of chronic neuropathic pain, but the evidence is very uncertain (evidence from one study in 48 people). 
We are uncertain whether cannabinoids reduce chronic neuropathic pain intensity:
• probably increase the number of people who perceive their well‐being as 'very much' or 'much' improved (evidence from eight studies in 1215 people); 
• may increase slightly the number of people who discontinue treatment due to unwanted effects (evidence from 21 studies in 3110 people); 
• may result in little to no difference in the number of people who have serious harmful effects (evidence from 20 studies in 3124 people); 
• may increase nervous system disorders (evidence from seven studies in 1154 people) or psychiatric disorders (evidence from six studies in 1122 people); 
• may have little to no effect on the number of people who have drug tolerance, but the evidence is very uncertain (two studies in 458 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
There is no high‐quality evidence. 
We are moderately confident that cannabinoids work better versus no cannabinoids to improve severity of spasticity and well‐being in adults with MS. We have little confidence in our results for the effect on chronic neuropathic pain because the available evidence is limited. 
There is limited evidence to determine the effects of cannabinoids on serious harmful effects, nervous system or psychiatric disorders, and drug tolerance. 
How up to date is the evidence?The evidence is up‐to‐date to December 2021.

15,10.1002-14651858.CD013259.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Surgery is the cornerstone in curative treatment of colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, surgery itself can adversely affect patient health. 'Enhanced Recovery After Surgery' programmes, which include multimodal interventions, have improved patient outcomes substantially. However, these are mainly applied peri‐ and postoperatively. Multimodal prehabilitation includes multiple preoperative interventions to prepare patients for surgery with the aim of increasing resilience, thereby improving postoperative outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of multimodal prehabilitation programmes on functional capacity, postoperative complications, and quality of life in adult patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO in January 2021. We also searched trial registries up to March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adult patients with non‐metastatic colorectal cancer, scheduled for surgery, comparing multimodal prehabilitation programmes (defined as comprising at least two preoperative interventions) with no prehabilitation. We focused on the following outcomes: functional capacity (i.e. 6‐minute walk test, VO2peak, handgrip strength), postoperative outcomes (i.e. complications, mortality, length of hospital stay, emergency department visits, re‐admissions), health‐related quality of life, compliance, safety of prehabilitation, and return to normal activities. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Any disagreements were solved with discussion and consensus. We pooled data to perform meta‐analyses, where possible. 
Main results
We included three RCTs that enrolled 250 participants with non‐metastatic colorectal cancer, scheduled for elective (mainly laparoscopic) surgery. Included trials were conducted in tertiary care centres and recruited patients during periods ranging from 17 months to 45 months. A total of 130 participants enrolled in a preoperative four‐week trimodal prehabilitation programme consisting of exercise, nutritional intervention, and anxiety reduction techniques. Outcomes of these participants were compared to those of 120 participants who started an identical but postoperative programme. 
Postoperatively, prehabilitation may improve functional capacity, determined with the 6‐minute walk test at four and eight weeks (mean difference (MD) 26.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐13.81 to 65.85; 2 studies; n = 131; and MD 26.58, 95% CI ‐8.88 to 62.04; 2 studies; n = 140); however, the certainty of evidence is low and very low, respectively, due to serious risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. After prehabilitation, the functional capacity before surgery improved, with a clinically relevant mean difference of 24.91 metres (95% CI 11.24 to 38.57; 3 studies; n = 225). The certainty of evidence was moderate due to downgrading for serious risk of bias. Prehabilitation may also result in fewer complications (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.29; 3 studies; n = 250) and fewer emergency department visits (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.32; 3 studies; n = 250). The certainty of evidence was low due to downgrading for serious risk of bias and imprecision. On the other hand, prehabilitation may also result in a higher re‐admission rate (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.65; 3 studies; n = 250). The certainty of evidence was again low due to downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision. The effect on VO2peak, handgrip strength, length of hospital stay, mortality rate, health‐related quality of life, return to normal activities, safety of the programme, and compliance rate could not be analysed quantitatively due to missing or insufficient data. The included studies did not report a difference between groups for health‐related quality of life and length of hospital stay. Data on remaining outcomes were not reported or were reported inadequately in the included studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Prehabilitation may result in an improved functional capacity, determined with the 6‐minute walk test both preoperatively and postoperatively. Complication rates and the number of emergency department visits postoperatively may also diminish due to a prehabilitation programme, while the number of re‐admissions may be higher in the prehabilitation group. The certainty of evidence ranges from moderate to very low, due to downgrading for serious risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. In addition, only three heterogeneous studies were included in this review. Therefore, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Numerous relevant RCTs are ongoing and will be included in a future update of this review. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Getting Ready for Bowel Cancer Surgery: Does a Pre-Surgery Exercise and Nutrition Program Help Patients Recover Better?

## Rationale

**What is colorectal cancer and why is this important?**

Colorectal cancer is cancer that starts in the colon or rectum (parts of the bowel). Surgery is the main way to treat this cancer and try to cure it. However, surgery is hard on the body. It can make patients weak and cause problems after the operation.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if helping patients get stronger before surgery would help them do better afterward. They tested programs called ""prehabilitation."" These programs help patients prepare their bodies before surgery. The programs included exercise, eating better, and ways to reduce worry and stress.

**Why might this help?**

When patients are stronger and healthier before surgery, their bodies may handle the operation better. They might recover faster and have fewer problems. This could mean shorter hospital stays and better quality of life.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at three different studies. These studies included 250 adults with colorectal cancer. The cancer had not spread to other parts of the body. All patients were scheduled for surgery.

Half of the patients (130 people) joined a four-week program before their surgery. This program included:
- Exercise training
- Nutrition advice and support
- Techniques to reduce anxiety

The other half (120 people) did not do this program before surgery. Instead, they started the same program after their surgery.

**Who was in the study?**

The studies included adult patients with colorectal cancer. Most had surgery done through small cuts (called laparoscopic surgery). The studies took place at large hospitals. Each study lasted between 17 months and 45 months.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

Researchers measured how well patients could walk and move. They used a test where patients walk for six minutes.

**Before surgery:**
Patients who did the prehabilitation program could walk about 25 meters farther than before they started. This shows the program helped them get stronger before surgery.

**After surgery:**
Patients who did prehabilitation before surgery could walk farther than patients who did not. At four weeks after surgery, they walked about 26 meters farther. At eight weeks, they still walked about 27 meters farther. However, researchers are not completely certain about these results.

**Other findings:**
- Patients who did prehabilitation may have had slightly fewer problems after surgery.
- They may have needed fewer emergency room visits.
- However, they may have needed to return to the hospital slightly more often.
- The program did not clearly change how long patients stayed in the hospital.
- Quality of life seemed similar in both groups.

**What do these results mean?**

The prehabilitation program may help patients get stronger before surgery. This strength may help them recover better afterward. However, researchers need more studies to be sure. The three studies in this review were small and different from each other. This makes it hard to know for certain if prehabilitation always helps.

**What happens next?**

Many more studies are happening now. When these studies finish, researchers will have better answers. Future reviews will include these new studies. This will help doctors know if prehabilitation programs should be used for all patients having colorectal cancer surgery.

**Important note:**
The evidence is not strong yet. Doctors and patients should talk together about whether prehabilitation might help in each person's situation.",10.1002-14651858.CD013259,"Preparing a patient with bowel cancer for surgery with multiple interventions
Aim of this review 
The aim of this review is to find out whether multiple interventions introduced in the period prior to surgery for bowel cancer could prepare a patient by increasing the patient's overall fitness, and thus improve outcomes after surgery. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all available randomised controlled trials on this topic. 
Key messages 
Only three studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, information was not available for all outcomes and the overall certainty of evidence was very low to moderate. More and larger studies are needed to gather evidence on this topic. 
What was studied in the review? 
Surgery is often given to cure patients diagnosed with early stage bowel cancer. Surgery has a negative impact on the overall fitness of the patient. The energy level decreases, patients are more dependent in their daily living activities, and quality of life decreases. Furthermore, complications may occur after surgery causing a further decrease of fitness. Preoperative interventions, such as exercise programmes, nutritional advice and supplements, as well as mental support, may increase the fitness of the patient, prior to surgery. This concept is called prehabilitation. The impact of surgery is diminished and consequently results in faster and better recovery. Combining such preoperative interventions results in better preparation for surgery because each interventions may help to strengthen the effects of the others. The review authors aimed to study the effect of such multiple‐intervention preparation programmes before surgery for patients with bowel cancer. The review authors focused on these outcomes: physical fitness, number of complications after surgery, death rate, quality of life (assessed with questionnaires), length of stay in the hospital, number of emergency department visits, number of re‐admissions after surgery, safety of the programme and adherence to the programme. They compared groups with prehabilitation programmes to groups not receiving any preparation prior to surgery, other than standard care. 
Main results of this review 
The review authors found three studies with 250 participants with bowel cancer, without metastases, scheduled for surgery. Studies were conducted in Canada. A total of 130 participants followed four‐week prehabilitation programmes prior to surgery, which included exercises, nutritional advice and supplements, as well as techniques to reduce anxiety about their cancer and its treatment. Another 120 participants followed identical programmes, but only started them after the surgery, when they were discharged from hospital. 
Overall, the review authors did not find an improvement in either group of participants. The certainty of evidence was very low to moderate, mainly because of the small numbers of studies and participants included in the review. Physical fitness potentially improves and the number of complications and emergency department visits may diminish in patients receiving prehabilitation programmes prior to surgery. On the other hand, more re‐admissions to the hospital occurred after prehabilitation programmes. Because data on death rates, quality of life, length of stay in the hospital, safety of the programme and adherence to the programme was not complete or not reported, the review authors did not analyse these outcomes. Due to the mostly low or very low certainty of the evidence, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to January 2021 and also looked for unpublished, ongoing studies up to March 2021. In a future update of this review, many ongoing studies will likely have been completed, which can be included to collect more evidence on this subject.

Tongxinluo, in capsule form, is a traditional Chinese medicine which consists of herbs and insects. Traditionally it has been thought to have clinical benefits for patients with angina, including the reduction of the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and complications of some types of heart surgery. Some studies also suggest a possible benefit in reducing the frequency and severity of angina attacks and improving symptoms. However, none of these individual studies have been reviewed systematically. 
The review authors systematically reviewed evidence from 18 randomised controlled trials for the benefit of tongxinluo with or without other treatments, including routine care or placebo, for patients with unstable angina. All the trials were conducted in China. The total number of participants was 1413, ranging in age from 25 to 88 years. Most studies randomised patients to receive tongxinluo with conventional medication or conventional medications alone. 
There was some evidence from seven studies that tongxinluo improved the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes indicating ischaemia and reduced the number of people with no improvement or worsening of ECG (six studies). Some improvement in angina symptoms (10 studies) and reduced numbers of people showing no improvement or worsening of symptoms were apparent with tongxinluo. Tongxinluo appeared to be as effective as isosorbide mononitrate in three studies. A few cases of slight gastrointestinal discomfort were reported after giving tongxinluo in seven studies and three cases of breaking of tiny blood vessels under the skin (ecchymosis) in one study. 
The evidence suggested possible benefits relating to a range of outcomes among patients with unstable angina but all the studies were of poor quality and neither blinding nor allocation concealment were used. This makes it impossible to reach firm conclusions about the benefit of this treatment. Large, high quality, randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the possible benefit of tongxinluo for unstable angina and to suggest appropriate future use of this herbal medicine. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can a Chinese Herbal Medicine Called Tongxinluo Help People with Unstable Chest Pain from Heart Disease?

## Rationale

**What is unstable angina?**
Unstable angina is a type of chest pain. It happens when the heart does not get enough blood. This condition is serious. It can lead to a heart attack. People with unstable angina often feel pain or pressure in their chest. This pain can happen at rest or with little activity. It affects their daily life and causes worry.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors in China have used tongxinluo for many years. Tongxinluo is a traditional Chinese medicine. It comes in capsule form. It is made from herbs and insects. Doctors believe it may help people with chest pain. Some think it might reduce heart attacks. Others think it may make chest pain happen less often. It might also make the pain less severe. However, no one had carefully looked at all the research together. The researchers wanted to see if tongxinluo really works. They wanted to know if it is safe.

**What did the researchers think would happen?**
The researchers thought tongxinluo might help people with unstable angina. They believed it could improve heart function. They thought it might reduce chest pain symptoms.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a systematic review. The researchers looked at 18 different studies. All studies were done in China. The studies were randomized controlled trials. This means patients were put into groups by chance.

**Who was in the studies?**
A total of 1,413 people took part. Their ages ranged from 25 to 88 years old. All had unstable angina. Both men and women were included.

**What did the studies compare?**
Most studies compared two groups. One group took tongxinluo plus regular heart medicines. The other group took only regular heart medicines. Some studies compared tongxinluo to a placebo. A placebo is a pill with no active medicine. Three studies compared tongxinluo to another medicine called isosorbide mononitrate.

**How long did the studies last?**
The review did not specify exact study lengths. Different studies lasted different amounts of time.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**
The studies showed some possible benefits:

Seven studies looked at heart tests called ECGs. ECGs measure the heart's electrical activity. Tongxinluo seemed to improve ECG results. Six studies found fewer people had worsening ECG readings when taking tongxinluo.

Ten studies looked at chest pain symptoms. People taking tongxinluo reported some improvement. Fewer people said their symptoms got worse or stayed the same.

Three studies compared tongxinluo to isosorbide mononitrate. Isosorbide mononitrate is a common heart medicine. Tongxinluo worked about as well as this medicine.

**Were there side effects?**
Most people tolerated tongxinluo well. Seven studies reported mild stomach upset in some people. One study found three cases of small broken blood vessels under the skin. These side effects were not serious.

**What are the main conclusions?**
The results suggest tongxinluo might help people with unstable angina. However, the researchers have important concerns. All 18 studies had poor quality. The studies did not use proper blinding. This means people knew which treatment they received. The studies also did not properly hide group assignments. These problems make the results less reliable.

**What does this mean?**
The researchers cannot say for certain that tongxinluo works. Better studies are needed. Future studies should be larger. They should use better methods. They should properly blind participants and researchers. Only then can doctors know if tongxinluo truly helps. Only then can they recommend it safely.

**Why is this important?**
Many people use traditional Chinese medicines. Doctors need good evidence about what works. This review shows we need more research. It helps guide future studies on tongxinluo.",10.1002-14651858.CD004474,"Tongxinluo (a traditional Chinese medicine) capsules may help patients suffering from unstable angina

A few cases of slight gastrointestinal discomfort were reported after giving tongxinluo in seven studies and three cases of breaking of tiny blood vessels under the skin (ecchymosis) in one study. 
The evidence suggested possible benefits relating to a range of outcomes among patients with unstable angina but all the studies were of poor quality and neither blinding nor allocation concealment were used. This makes it impossible to reach firm conclusions about the benefit of this treatment. Large, high quality, randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the possible benefit of tongxinluo for unstable angina and to suggest appropriate future use of this herbal medicine.

Why this is important 
Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), also known as chronic otitis media (COM), is an inflammation and infection of the middle ear that lasts for two weeks or more. People with CSOM usually experience recurrent or persistent ear discharge – pus that leaks out from a hole in the eardrum – and hearing loss. 
Different approaches can be used to clean the affected ears and remove discharge. These include: 
‐ using cotton wool or tissue paper (dry mopping);‐ sucking up material blocking the ear with a small device (usually done under a microscope); or‐ washing out the ear (irrigation). 
To find out how effective ear cleaning is in people with CSOM, and whether it causes unwanted effects, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. In particular, we wanted to know whether ear cleaning stopped ear discharge, and whether it affected health‐related quality of life, or hearing. We also wanted to know if it caused pain, discomfort or irritation in the ear, unwanted effects such as dizziness or ear bleeding, or any serious complications. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found three studies in 431 people with CSOM. People were followed for between six weeks and six months after treatment. 
The studies compared:
‐ daily dry mopping versus no treatment (two studies, 351 people);‐ daily suction combined with antibiotic ear drops administered in a clinic, versus one instance of suction only (in a clinic) followed by daily self‐administered antibiotic ear drops (one study, 80 people). 
Daily dry mopping compared against no treatment 
‐ We do not know whether dry mopping stops ear discharge, because the evidence on whether people experienced discharge after four weeks was of very low certainty, and no studies looked at the presence of discharge earlier. 
‐ One study reported serious complications, but it was not clear whether the people who reported complications had their ears cleaned with dry mopping or not, or whether the complications occurred before or after treatment. We therefore could not tell whether dry mopping caused serious complications, or how often these occurred. 
‐ One study looked at hearing, but did not report the results in a way that could tell us whether or not dry mopping affects hearing. 
‐ No studies investigated the impact of dry mopping on health‐related quality of life, ear pain, dizziness or ear bleeding. 
Daily suction compared against one instance of suction only, in addition to antibiotic ear drops 
‐ We do not know whether suction stops ear discharge, because the evidence for between one and two weeks after treatment was of very low certainty, and the results for discharge after four weeks could not be interpreted. 
‐ We do not know if suction affects hearing or dizziness, as the evidence was of very low certainty. 
‐ No studies investigated the impact of suction on health‐related quality of life, ear pain, serious complications or ear bleeding. 
What this means 
We do not know how effective ear cleaning is for people with CSOM, and whether it causes unwanted effects. There are very few studies in this area, and these provide very low‐certainty evidence. Unwanted effects were not well reported in the studies we found. We need researchers to conduct future studies that compare ear cleaning to no cleaning, and compare different cleaning techniques and frequency, so that we can assess the benefits and risks of ear cleaning for people with CSOM.

","# Plain Language Summary: Ear Cleaning for Long-Lasting Ear Infections

## Plain Title

Does Cleaning the Ear Help People with Long-Lasting Ear Infections That Leak Pus?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?

Some people get ear infections that last a long time. Doctors call this chronic suppurative otitis media, or CSOM. People with CSOM have an infection in the middle part of their ear. This infection lasts for two weeks or more.

### What happens to people with this condition?

People with CSOM often have pus that leaks out of their ear. The pus comes through a hole in their eardrum. Many people with CSOM also cannot hear as well as they used to.

### How do doctors clean ears?

Doctors can clean ears in different ways. One way uses cotton wool or tissue paper to wipe the ear dry. Another way uses a small tool to suck out the pus and other material. Doctors often use a microscope to see better when they do this. A third way washes out the ear with water.

### Why did researchers do this study?

Researchers wanted to know if cleaning the ear helps people with CSOM. They wanted to find out if ear cleaning stops the pus from leaking. They also wanted to know if ear cleaning causes any problems. These problems might include pain, dizziness, or bleeding from the ear.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers find the answer?

Researchers looked for all studies about ear cleaning for CSOM. They found three studies with 431 people who had CSOM. The studies watched people for six weeks to six months after treatment.

### What did the studies compare?

Two studies looked at dry mopping every day compared to no treatment. These studies included 351 people.

One study looked at two different approaches. Both groups used antibiotic ear drops. One group had their ears cleaned with suction every day at the clinic. The other group had suction done just once at the clinic. Then they put in their own ear drops at home each day. This study included 80 people.

## Results

### What did the researchers find about dry mopping?

The researchers could not tell if dry mopping stops ear discharge. The evidence was very weak. The studies did not look at discharge before four weeks had passed.

One study mentioned serious problems in some people. But the study did not make it clear which people had their ears cleaned. It also did not say when the problems happened. So researchers could not tell if dry mopping caused these problems.

One study looked at hearing. But it did not report the results in a clear way. So researchers could not tell if dry mopping helps or hurts hearing.

No studies looked at quality of life, ear pain, dizziness, or ear bleeding with dry mopping.

### What did the researchers find about suction?

The researchers could not tell if suction stops ear discharge. The evidence was very weak. The results after four weeks were not clear.

The researchers could not tell if suction affects hearing or causes dizziness. The evidence was very weak.

No studies looked at quality of life, ear pain, serious problems, or ear bleeding with suction.

### What does this mean?

We do not know if ear cleaning helps people with CSOM. We also do not know if it causes problems. There are very few studies about this topic. The studies that exist provide very weak evidence. The studies did not report well on problems that ear cleaning might cause.

### What is needed next?

More studies are needed. These studies should compare ear cleaning to no cleaning. They should also compare different ways to clean ears. They should look at how often ears should be cleaned. This will help us learn if ear cleaning helps or hurts people with CSOM.

18,10.1002-14651858.CD013348.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Cervical cancer ranks as the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in women. Historically, women with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer have had limited treatment options. New anti‐angiogenesis therapies, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting agents, offer an alternative strategy to conventional chemotherapy; they act by inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels, thereby restricting tumour growth by blocking the blood supply. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of VEGF targeting agents in the management of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer. 
Search methods
We performed searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, online registers of clinical trials, and abstracts of scientific meetings up until 27 May 2020. 
Selection criteria
We examined randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the use of VEGF targeting agents alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy or other VEGF targeting agents. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently screened the results of search strategies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and analysed data according to the standard methods expected by Cochrane. The certainty of evidence was assessed via the GRADE approach. 
Main results
A total of 1634 records were identified. From these, we identified four studies with a total of 808 participants for inclusion. We also identified two studies that were awaiting classification and nine ongoing studies. 
Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy 
Treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy may result in lower risk of death compared to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.95; 1 study, 452 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, there are probably more specific adverse events when compared to chemotherapy alone, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (risk ratio (RR) 18.00, 95% CI 2.42 to 133.67; 1 study, 440 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); serious thromboembolic events (RR 4.5, 95% CI 1.55 to 13.08; 1 study, 440 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and hypertension (RR 13.75, 95% CI 5.07 to 37.29; 1 study, 440 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There may also be a higher incidence of serious haemorrhage (RR 5.00, 95% CI 1.11 to 22.56; 1 study, 440 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In addition, the incidence of serious adverse events is probably higher (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.79; 1 study, 439 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio was USD 295,164 per quality‐adjusted life‐year (1 study, 452 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Cediranib plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy 
Treatment with cediranib plus chemotherapy may or may not result in similar risk of death when compared to chemotherapy alone (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.65; 1 study, 69 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very uncertain results for the incidences of specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (RR 3.27, 95% CI 0.14 to 77.57; 1 study, 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); serious haemorrhage (RR 5.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 109.49; 1 study, 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); serious thromboembolic events (RR 3.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 80.59; 1 study, 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and serious hypertension (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.02 to 8.62; 1 study, 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In addition, there may or may not be a similar incidence of serious adverse events compared to chemotherapy alone (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.78; 1 study, 67 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy/brachytherapy versus chemotherapy or chemotherapy/brachytherapy 
Treatment with apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy/brachytherapy may or may not result in similar risk of death compared to chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy/brachytherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.60; 1 study, 52 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, hypertension events may occur at a higher incidence as compared to chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy/brachytherapy alone (RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.28 to 20.73; 1 study, 52 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Pazopanib plus lapatinib versus lapatinib 
Treatment with pazopanib plus lapatinib may result in higher risk of death compared to lapatinib alone (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.31; 1 study, 117 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very uncertain results for the incidences of specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.59; 1 study, 152 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); haemorrhage (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 5.58; 1 study, 152 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and thromboembolic events (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.50; 1 study, 152 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In addition, the incidence of hypertension events is probably higher (RR 12.00, 95% CI 2.94 to 49.01; 1 study, 152 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There may or may not be a similar incidence of serious adverse events as compared to lapatinib alone (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.26; 1 study, 152 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Pazopanib versus lapatinib 
Treatment with pazopanib may or may not result in similar risk of death as compared to lapatinib (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.38; 1 study, 152 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very uncertain results for the incidences of specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.12; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); haemorrhage (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.40; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and thromboembolic events (RR 3.08, 95% CI 0.13 to 74.42; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In addition, the incidence of hypertension events is probably higher (RR 11.81, 95% CI 2.89 to 48.33; 1 study, 150 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The risk of serious adverse events may or may not be similar as compared to lapatinib (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.07; 1 study, 150 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We found low‐certainty evidence in favour of the use of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. However, bevacizumab probably increases specific adverse events (gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae, thromboembolic events, hypertension) and serious adverse events. We found low‐certainty evidence that does not support the use of cediranib plus chemotherapy, apatinib plus chemotherapy, apatinib plus chemotherapy/brachytherapy, or pazopanib monotherapy. We found low‐certainty evidence suggesting that pazopanib plus lapatinib worsens outcomes. The VEGF inhibitors apatinib and pazopanib may increase the probability of hypertension events. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Blood Vessel-Blocking Drugs for Advanced Cervical Cancer

## Plain Title

Do drugs that block blood vessel growth help women with advanced cervical cancer?

## Rationale

**What is cervical cancer and why is it a problem?**

Cervical cancer is a disease where cancer cells grow in the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the womb. This cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in women around the world.

**What happens when cervical cancer spreads?**

Sometimes cervical cancer spreads to other parts of the body. This is called metastatic cancer. Sometimes it comes back after treatment. This is called recurrent cancer. When this happens, women have very few treatment options.

**What are blood vessel-blocking drugs?**

Tumors need blood to grow. They make new blood vessels to get more blood. Some new drugs work by stopping tumors from making these new blood vessels. Without blood supply, tumors cannot grow as easily. These drugs are called VEGF targeting agents. They block a substance called VEGF that helps make new blood vessels.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if these blood vessel-blocking drugs could help women with advanced cervical cancer. They wanted to see if these drugs work better than regular chemotherapy alone. They also wanted to know if these drugs cause harmful side effects.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at four studies that tested these drugs. They searched medical databases up to May 2020. They only included studies that compared different treatments in a fair way.

**Who was in these studies?**

A total of 808 women took part in these four studies. All the women had cervical cancer that had spread or come back.

**What treatments were tested?**

The studies tested several different drugs:
- Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone
- Cediranib plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone
- Apatinib plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone
- Pazopanib and lapatinib, tested alone and together

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time varied by study. The abstract does not give exact time periods.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy:**
This combination may help women live longer than chemotherapy alone. However, it probably causes more serious side effects. These include:
- Holes or abnormal connections in the digestive system
- Blood clots
- High blood pressure
- Bleeding problems
- More serious health problems overall

This treatment is also very expensive. It costs about $295,000 for each year of good quality life gained.

**Cediranib plus chemotherapy:**
This combination may not help women live longer. The results were unclear about side effects.

**Apatinib plus chemotherapy:**
This combination may not help women live longer. It may cause more high blood pressure problems.

**Pazopanib plus lapatinib:**
This combination may actually make outcomes worse. Women taking both drugs together may have higher risk of death. It probably causes more high blood pressure.

**Pazopanib alone:**
This drug may not work better than lapatinib alone. It probably causes more high blood pressure.

**What do these results mean?**

Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy may help some women with advanced cervical cancer live longer. But doctors and patients must weigh this benefit against serious side effects. The other drugs tested did not show clear benefits. Some may even cause harm.

**What are the main conclusions?**

The evidence supports using bevacizumab with chemotherapy, but only with caution. Patients should know about the serious side effects. The other drugs tested need more research. More studies are needed to find better treatments for women with advanced cervical cancer.

The quality of evidence was low to moderate. This means researchers are not completely certain about these findings. More research could change these conclusions.",10.1002-14651858.CD013348,"Inhibition of blood vessel formation in advanced cervical cancer
What is the aim of this review?The aim of this Cochrane Review is to find out whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting drugs, which inhibit the formation of new blood vessels, can improve survival in women with cervical cancer that has spread to distant sites (metastasised) or has not responded to or come back (recurred) after initial treatment. These drugs include bevacizumab, cediranib, apatinib, pazopanib, anlotinib, and nintedanib. 
Key messagesBevacizumab plus chemotherapy may improve survival and probably increases specific and serious adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations through the gut wall, blood clot formation (thromboembolic events) in blood vessels, hypertension (increased blood pressure), and bleeding (haemorrhage). 
Cediranib or apatinib plus chemotherapy, or pazopanib alone, may make little to no difference in survival. Pazopanib plus lapatinib may reduce survival. 
What are the main results of the review?We found four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria and enrolled 808 women. 
We found one study, which included 452 women, that assessed the use of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. The inclusion of bevacizumab may improve overall survival and probably increases the incidences of specific and serious adverse events. 
A second study analysed 69 women treated with cediranib plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. Cediranib may make little to no difference in survival, and it is uncertain whether it increases the incidences of specific or serious adverse events. 
Another study with 59 women reported data on the use of apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy) versus chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy alone. Apatinib may make little to no difference in survival, but it exhibited promising efficacy for progression‐free survival. 
We found one study with 228 women that compared pazopanib plus lapatinib versus only lapatinib, or pazopanib versus lapatinib: pazopanib plus lapatinib may reduce survival and probably increases the incidence of hypertension; pazopanib alone may make little to no difference in survival and probably increases the incidence of hypertension. 
Overall the quality (certainty) of the evidence was low, as each comparison included only one study and most studies were small.

19,10.1002-14651858.CD008011.pub3-abstract.txt,"Treatment for cardiac problems caused by anthracycline chemotherapy for childhood cancer 
Anthracyclines are anticancer drugs used in the treatment of different types of childhood cancer. An important adverse effect of anthracyclines is damage to the heart, which can lead to asymptomatic (without complaints) or symptomatic (with complaints) cardiac problems during and after cancer treatment. While there are several drugs available to treat other types of cardiac problems in adults, it is not known if these drugs are beneficial in treating cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines in childhood cancer patients and survivors. A physician confronted with a childhood cancer patient or survivor with anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems should be able to make an informed decision on how to treat this patient based on high‐quality evidence about the beneficial and adverse effects of the treatment options. We searched for and summarised studies that evaluated drugs for treating anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. 
We identified two randomised studies evaluating two different drugs in two different types of patients. One of these drugs, an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril), had a short‐term beneficial effect on heart function in survivors of childhood cancer with asymptomatic cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines compared with placebo. However, the drug had no significant beneficial effect on other important outcomes and was associated with side effects such as dizziness and fatigue. This study was of reasonable/good quality. The other study was of low quality and found no effect of a short treatment with phosphocreatine in childhood leukaemia patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiac problems compared with a control treatment with vitamin C, adenosine triphosphate, vitamin E, and oral coenzyme Q10. 
We could make no definitive conclusions about treatment options for anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. High‐quality studies are needed to determine if there are drugs that improve heart function in these patients. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatment for Heart Problems Caused by Cancer Drugs in Children

## Plain Title
Can medicines help treat heart problems caused by cancer drugs in children?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Some children with cancer get treated with drugs called anthracyclines. These drugs help fight cancer. But they can also hurt the heart. This heart damage can happen during cancer treatment or years later.

Some children have heart problems but feel fine. Doctors call this ""no symptoms."" Other children feel sick from their heart problems. Doctors call this ""having symptoms.""

### Why did researchers do this study?
Doctors have medicines that help adults with other types of heart problems. But no one knows if these same medicines help children who have heart problems from cancer drugs.

Doctors need to know which medicines work best. They need to know which medicines are safe. This helps them make good choices when treating children.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to find out if any medicines can help fix heart problems caused by anthracycline cancer drugs in children.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study this?
Researchers looked for studies that tested medicines in children. They wanted studies that compared one medicine to another medicine or to a fake pill (called a placebo).

### Who was in the studies?
The researchers found two studies:

**Study 1:** This study included survivors of childhood cancer. These were people who had cancer as children but were now better. They had heart problems but felt fine (no symptoms). The heart problems came from anthracycline drugs.

**Study 2:** This study included children with leukemia (a type of blood cancer). Some children had symptoms. Some did not have symptoms. All had heart problems from anthracycline drugs.

### What medicines did the studies test?
**Study 1** tested a medicine called enalapril. This is an ACE inhibitor. Doctors use this type of medicine for other heart problems.

**Study 2** tested a medicine called phosphocreatine. Researchers compared it to a mix of vitamins and other supplements.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies lasted for a short time. The exact time varied by study.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**Study 1 (enalapril):**
- Enalapril helped heart function a little bit in the short term.
- The study compared enalapril to a fake pill.
- But enalapril did not help with other important heart measures.
- Some people taking enalapril felt dizzy or tired.
- This study was done fairly well.

**Study 2 (phosphocreatine):**
- This medicine did not help heart problems.
- Researchers compared it to vitamins and supplements.
- This study had some problems with how it was done.
- The results are hard to trust.

### What does this mean for patients?
Right now, doctors do not have clear answers. They do not know which medicines work best for heart problems caused by cancer drugs in children.

One medicine (enalapril) might help a little bit. But it can cause side effects. More research is needed to know if it really helps over time.

### What do researchers conclude?
Researchers need more and better studies. These studies should test different medicines. They should include more children. They should last longer.

Only then can doctors know the best way to treat heart problems from cancer drugs in children.

### Why is this important?
Many children survive cancer today. But some have heart problems from their cancer treatment. Finding safe and helpful medicines could improve their lives. It could help their hearts work better. It could help them feel better and live longer, healthier lives.

Right now, families and doctors must make treatment choices without good information. Better research will help them make better choices.",10.1002-14651858.CD008011,"Treatment for cardiac problems caused by anthracycline chemotherapy for childhood cancer 
Anthracyclines are anticancer drugs used in the treatment of different types of childhood cancer. An important adverse effect of anthracyclines is damage to the heart, which can lead to asymptomatic (without complaints) or symptomatic (with complaints) cardiac problems during and after cancer treatment. While there are several drugs available to treat other types of cardiac problems in adults, it is not known if these drugs are beneficial in treating cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines in childhood cancer patients and survivors. A physician confronted with a childhood cancer patient or survivor with anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems should be able to make an informed decision on how to treat this patient based on high‐quality evidence about the beneficial and adverse effects of the treatment options. We searched for and summarised studies that evaluated drugs for treating anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. 
We identified two randomised studies evaluating two different drugs in two different types of patients. One of these drugs, an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril), had a short‐term beneficial effect on heart function in survivors of childhood cancer with asymptomatic cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines compared with placebo. However, the drug had no significant beneficial effect on other important outcomes and was associated with side effects such as dizziness and fatigue. This study was of reasonable/good quality. The other study was of low quality and found no effect of a short treatment with phosphocreatine in childhood leukaemia patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiac problems compared with a control treatment with vitamin C, adenosine triphosphate, vitamin E, and oral coenzyme Q10. 
We could make no definitive conclusions about treatment options for anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. High‐quality studies are needed to determine if there are drugs that improve heart function in these patients.

## Plain Title
Testing Plant-Based Treatments for Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain and Joint Problems

## Rationale

**What is rheumatoid arthritis?**

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease that affects your joints. Your body's defense system, which normally fights germs, attacks your own joints by mistake. This makes joints swell up, become stiff, and hurt. The small joints in your hands and feet usually get affected first.

**Why is this a problem for patients?**

RA causes pain and makes it hard to move. People with RA have trouble doing daily tasks. Right now, there is no cure for RA. Treatments can only help reduce pain and stiffness and help people move better.

**Why was this study needed?**

For many years, people have used plant-based treatments for RA. Some people think these herbal treatments might work as well as regular drugs but cause fewer side effects. Like regular drugs, herbal treatments may work by calming down the body's defense system and reducing swelling in the joints.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if herbal treatments really help people with RA. They looked at different plant-based treatments to see if they reduce pain, help people move better, and if they are safe to use.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at many other studies that tested herbal treatments. They gathered all the information together to see what works.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Both men and women were included.

**What treatments were tested?**

Researchers looked at several plant-based treatments. The main ones were:
- Oils from evening primrose, borage seeds, or blackcurrant seeds (these contain a substance called GLA)
- A Chinese herb called Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F
- Other herbal treatments

**How long did the studies last?**

Most studies lasted about 6 months.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**For oils containing GLA (from evening primrose, borage seeds, or blackcurrant seeds):**

These oils probably help reduce pain. On a pain scale from 0 to 100, people taking these oils had pain scores 33 points lower. People taking fake pills (placebo) only had pain scores 19 points lower. This means the oils helped reduce pain by an extra 14 points.

These oils may help people do daily tasks better. People taking the oils could do tasks 16% better. People taking fake pills only did tasks 5% better.

These oils probably do not cause more side effects than fake pills. Possible side effects may include headache, upset stomach, and loose stools. Rare problems might include allergic reactions and seizures.

**For Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F:**

This Chinese herb may help some RA symptoms. Higher doses (180 to 350 mg each day) may work better than lower doses (60 mg each day).

This herb does cause some side effects. Women may have painful periods. Men may have trouble having children. Other problems may include not passing enough urine and getting more infections.

**For other herbal treatments:**

Researchers could not be sure if other herbal treatments work. There were not enough studies, or the studies did not measure important things like joint swelling.

**What do these results mean?**

Some herbal treatments, especially oils with GLA, may help people with RA feel less pain and move better. They seem fairly safe for most people. The Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F might also help, but it has more side effects.

More research is needed to know if other herbal treatments work. People with RA should talk to their doctor before trying any herbal treatment.

**Important note about side effects:**

We do not always know about rare but serious side effects. More studies are needed to fully understand the risks of these treatments.",10.1002-14651858.CD002948,"Herbal therapy for rheumatoid arthritis

21,10.1002-14651858.CD005231.pub3-abstract.txt,"Can smokers be helped to reduce the harm caused by cigarette smoking by smoking fewer cigarettes or using different tobacco products? 
Background 
The best thing to do to reduce the harms caused by smoking is to quit, but some people may not want to do this or may feel that they are unable to stop smoking completely. Cutting down the number of cigarettes smoked daily or using different tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco or low‐tar cigarettes, may reduce some of the harm caused by smoking. It may also help people to stop smoking completely in the long term. On the other hand, reducing smoking or using other tobacco products may not improve health and could reduce a person's motivation to quit smoking altogether. It is important that we review the evidence to find out whether these approaches could help smokers who do not want to or cannot quit to reduce the harm caused by their smoking. We were mainly interested in whether these approaches improved the health of smokers, but also looked at smoking reduction and quitting rates. 
Study characteristics 
We found 20 randomised controlled trials that tested ways to help people to cut down the number of cigarettes they smoked. Some of these just advised smokers to smoke less, but most also provided them with a product to help them cut down: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, bupropion, electronic cigarettes (ecigs), or snus (a form of smokeless, oral tobacco). We also found four randomized controlled trials that tested the effects of using cigarettes designed to reduce the damage caused by smoking: reduced tar, carbon or nicotine cigarettes. Most of the studies used NRT to help people to reduce their smoking. All of the studies included people who were not planning to quit smoking soon. The research is current to October 2015. 
Key results 
Eight studies (with 3081 smokers) found that using NRT roughly doubled the likelihood of halving the number of cigarettes smoked each day, compared to using a placebo. Using NRT in this way also nearly doubled the likelihood of quitting completely. One trial each tested bupropion, varenicline, ecigs and snus to help reduce the harms caused by smoking, and there was no evidence that any of these treatments helped smokers to reduce the number of cigarettes they were smoking each day. This may be because there has not yet been enough research into these methods. Only one of the trials testing cigarettes designed to reduce risk measured their effect on the number of people quitting smoking. It found that people were not more likely to quit smoking if they used reduced‐nicotine cigarettes than if they smoked their usual cigarettes. We did not find any trials which reported the long‐term health effects of the treatments, and so it remains uncertain how much health benefit there is from reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day or smoking cigarettes designed to be less harmful. 
Quality of evidence 
The tobacco industry funded three of the included studies of cigarettes designed to reduce risk. None of the studies looked at whether there had been a long‐term change in the health of the users. We rate the quality of the evidence looking at how many people quit smoking as 'low' or 'very low', generally because the findings are based on a small number of studies. We need more studies to investigate methods of reducing the harm caused by continued smoking. These need to measure the health of the users over a long period.

## Plain Title
Can Smokers Cut Down on Cigarettes or Use Other Tobacco Products to Reduce Health Harm?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**
Smoking cigarettes harms your health. The best way to avoid this harm is to quit smoking. But some people do not want to quit or feel they cannot stop.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know if smokers could reduce harm in other ways. They looked at two main options:
- Smoking fewer cigarettes each day
- Using different tobacco products

These other products included chewing tobacco or cigarettes with less tar. Researchers thought these approaches might help in two ways. First, they might reduce some harm from smoking. Second, they might help people quit completely later on.

**Why was this study needed?**
There are concerns about these approaches. They might not actually improve health. They might also make people less likely to quit smoking altogether. Researchers needed to review the evidence to find out if these methods really help.

The main goal was to see if these approaches improved smokers' health. Researchers also wanted to know if people smoked less or quit completely.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers reviewed 24 studies. These studies tested different ways to help smokers.

Twenty studies looked at cutting down the number of cigarettes smoked. Some studies just told people to smoke less. Most studies also gave people a product to help them cut down. These products included:
- Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) – patches or gum that give you nicotine without smoking
- Varenicline – a medicine that helps with quitting
- Bupropion – another medicine that helps with quitting
- Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)
- Snus – tobacco you put in your mouth but do not smoke

Four studies tested special cigarettes designed to cause less harm. These had less tar, carbon, or nicotine.

**Who was in these studies?**
All studies included people who were not planning to quit smoking soon.

**When was this research done?**
The research included studies up to October 2015.

## Results

**What did the studies find?**

**Nicotine replacement therapy:**
Eight studies included 3,081 smokers. These studies found that NRT helped people cut down. People using NRT were twice as likely to cut their smoking in half compared to people using a fake treatment. About 2 out of every 10 people using NRT cut their smoking in half. Only 1 out of 10 people using fake treatment did this.

NRT also helped people quit completely. People using NRT were nearly twice as likely to quit smoking.

**Other products:**
One study each tested bupropion, varenicline, e-cigarettes, and snus. These studies did not show that these products helped people smoke less. This might be because not enough research has been done yet.

**Special cigarettes:**
Only one study looked at cigarettes with less nicotine. It found these cigarettes did not help people quit. People were no more likely to quit with these cigarettes than with regular cigarettes.

**What about long-term health?**
No studies measured long-term health effects. This is important. We still do not know if cutting down on cigarettes or using less harmful cigarettes actually improves health over time.

**Quality of the evidence:**
The tobacco industry paid for three studies. This could affect the results. The quality of evidence was rated as low or very low. This is mainly because there were not many studies.

**What do we still need to know?**
We need more studies. These studies should:
- Test different ways to reduce smoking harm
- Follow people for a long time
- Measure actual health changes

**Main conclusions:**
NRT can help people smoke fewer cigarettes and may help them quit. We do not have enough evidence about other methods. Most importantly, we do not know if these approaches actually improve health over time.",10.1002-14651858.CD005231,"Can smokers be helped to reduce the harm caused by cigarette smoking by smoking fewer cigarettes or using different tobacco products?

Glioblastoma is an aggressive form of brain cancer. Approximately five in 100 people with glioblastoma survive for five years past diagnosis. Glioblastomas that have a particular modification to their DNA (called methylation) in a particular region (the O6‐methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter) respond better to treatment with chemotherapy using a drug called temozolomide. 
Objectives
To determine which method for assessing MGMT methylation status best predicts overall survival in people diagnosed with glioblastoma who are treated with temozolomide. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index to December 2018, and examined reference lists. For economic evaluation studies, we additionally searched NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED) up to December 2014. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were longitudinal (cohort) studies of adults with diagnosed glioblastoma treated with temozolomide with/without radiotherapy/surgery. Studies had to have related MGMT status in tumour tissue (assessed by one or more method) with overall survival and presented results as hazard ratios or with sufficient information (e.g. Kaplan‐Meier curves) for us to estimate hazard ratios. We focused mainly on studies comparing two or more methods, and listed brief details of articles that examined a single method of measuring MGMT promoter methylation. We also sought economic evaluations conducted alongside trials, modelling studies and cost analysis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently undertook all steps of the identification and data extraction process for multiple‐method studies. We assessed risk of bias and applicability using our own modified and extended version of the QUality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. We compared different techniques, exact promoter regions (5'‐cytosine‐phosphate‐guanine‐3' (CpG) sites) and thresholds for interpretation within studies by examining hazard ratios. We performed meta‐analyses for comparisons of the three most commonly examined methods (immunohistochemistry (IHC), methylation‐specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and pyrosequencing (PSQ)), with ratios of hazard ratios (RHR), using an imputed value of the correlation between results based on the same individuals. 
Main results
We included 32 independent cohorts involving 3474 people that compared two or more methods. We found evidence that MSP (CpG sites 76 to 80 and 84 to 87) is more prognostic than IHC for MGMT protein at varying thresholds (RHR 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.71). We also found evidence that PSQ is more prognostic than IHC for MGMT protein at various thresholds (RHR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.84). The data suggest that PSQ (mainly at CpG sites 74 to 78, using various thresholds) is slightly more prognostic than MSP at sites 76 to 80 and 84 to 87 (RHR 1.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.48). Many variants of PSQ have been compared, although we did not see any strong and consistent messages from the results. Targeting multiple CpG sites is likely to be more prognostic than targeting just one. In addition, we identified and summarised 190 articles describing a single method for measuring MGMT promoter methylation status. 
Authors' conclusions
PSQ and MSP appear more prognostic for overall survival than IHC. Strong evidence is not available to draw conclusions with confidence about the best CpG sites or thresholds for quantitative methods. MSP has been studied mainly for CpG sites 76 to 80 and 84 to 87 and PSQ at CpG sites ranging from 72 to 95. A threshold of 9% for CpG sites 74 to 78 performed better than higher thresholds of 28% or 29% in two of three good‐quality studies making such comparisons.

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Tests to Predict How Long People with Brain Cancer Live After Treatment

## Rationale

**What is glioblastoma?**
Glioblastoma is a very serious type of brain cancer. It grows fast and is hard to treat. Only about 5 out of 100 people with this cancer live for 5 years after doctors find it.

**What is MGMT methylation?**
Some glioblastomas have a special change in their DNA called methylation. This change happens in a part of the DNA called the MGMT promoter. When this change is present, the cancer responds better to a chemotherapy drug called temozolomide.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors use different tests to check if this DNA change is present. However, they do not know which test works best to predict how long patients will live. Finding the best test would help doctors make better treatment choices for their patients.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to find out which test best predicts survival in people with glioblastoma who receive temozolomide treatment.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This was not a single new study. Instead, researchers looked at many studies that had already been done. They searched medical databases up to December 2018. They looked for studies that:
- Included adults with glioblastoma
- Gave patients temozolomide treatment
- Used at least two different tests to check for the MGMT DNA change
- Tracked how long patients lived

**Who was included?**
The researchers found 32 groups of studies. These studies included 3,474 people total. All were adults with glioblastoma who received temozolomide treatment.

**What tests did they compare?**
The researchers mainly compared three tests:
- IHC: This test looks at MGMT protein in tissue samples
- MSP: This test checks specific DNA sites (numbered 76 to 80 and 84 to 87)
- PSQ: This test also checks DNA sites (mainly numbered 74 to 78)

**How long did the studies last?**
Each original study followed patients for different lengths of time. The researchers looked at how long patients lived after diagnosis.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers found important differences between the tests:

**MSP versus IHC:**
The MSP test predicted survival better than the IHC test. This means MSP was more accurate at telling doctors which patients might live longer.

**PSQ versus IHC:**
The PSQ test also predicted survival better than the IHC test.

**PSQ versus MSP:**
The PSQ test appeared slightly better than the MSP test at predicting survival. However, this difference was small.

**What about different DNA sites?**
The researchers found that checking multiple DNA sites works better than checking just one site. For the PSQ test, checking sites 74 to 78 worked well. A score of 9% or higher at these sites predicted survival better than using higher scores like 28% or 29%.

**Why does this matter?**
These results help doctors choose the best test. Better tests mean doctors can:
- Predict more accurately how patients will respond to treatment
- Make better treatment decisions
- Give patients more accurate information about their outlook

**What did the researchers conclude?**
PSQ and MSP tests work better than IHC tests for predicting survival. The PSQ test checking DNA sites 74 to 78 with a 9% threshold appears to be a good choice. However, more research is needed to confirm the best DNA sites and score thresholds to use.

**Additional findings:**
The researchers also found 190 other articles that studied only one test method. This shows many scientists are working to improve testing for glioblastoma patients.",10.1002-14651858.CD013316,"Which method of determining MGMT promoter methylation best predicts survival in people with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide? 
What was the aim of this review? 
Glioblastoma is a very aggressive type of brain cancer. People with glioblastoma are usually treated with surgical removal of the tumour followed by radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both. The standard chemotherapy is a medicine called temozolomide. Some glioblastoma tumours have a particular modification in their DNA (which contains the genetic code of organisms), and knowing whether a person has this modification is useful to predict how long the person may live after their diagnosis with cancer and how they may respond to temozolomide. The modification is known as 'methylation of the MGMT promoter region' and it can also affect MGMT protein expression (the way MGMT is made and modified). There are many ways to work out whether a tumour has this modification. In this review, we attempted to work out which method is best. 
What we found 
We identified 32 studies comparing different ways to measure whether the MGMT promoter region is methylated. The main three methods were called 'methylation‐specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR),' 'pyrosequencing' (both of which look directly at the MGMT promoter region) and 'immunohistochemistry' (which looks at MGMT protein expression). We found that methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing are better at predicting overall survival than immunohistochemistry. Methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing can be carried out by targeting different parts of the tumour DNA. Pyrosequencing can be performed using different cut‐off thresholds to determine whether a tumour is methylated or unmethylated. We did not identify very clear signals in terms of the best parts of the DNA to target or which are the best cut‐off thresholds. 
How reliable are results of the studies in this review? 
We rated our confidence in the evidence as 'moderate' for our conclusions about methylation‐specific PCR, but as 'low' for pyrosequencing. Although there were many studies, they all looked at different variants of the methods, so it is difficult to work out exactly which variant is best. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Our review indicates both methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing provide better predictions of survival than immunohistochemistry. There is some evidence that pyrosequencing may be better than methylation‐specific PCR at predicting overall survival, depending on the DNA targets and cut‐off thresholds used. We documented the most frequent DNA targets used in methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing. We described cut‐off thresholds used in pyrosequencing, although it is unclear which of these is best.

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Types of Insulin for People with Type 1 Diabetes

## Rationale

**What is Type 1 Diabetes?**
Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong disease. The body cannot control blood sugar levels on its own. This can cause problems right away and over many years.

**How is Type 1 Diabetes Treated?**
People with type 1 diabetes need insulin shots every day. There are two main types of insulin they need. One type works all day and night (called basal insulin). The other type works quickly at meal times (called bolus insulin).

**What Insulin Was Used Before?**
For many years, doctors used an insulin called NPH for the all-day coverage. NPH is called an intermediate acting insulin. This means it works for a medium amount of time.

**Why Did Doctors Want to Try New Insulins?**
Scientists made new insulins that last longer. These are called long acting insulins. Their names are insulin ultralente, insulin glargine, and insulin detemir. These newer insulins work more like the body's natural insulin. Doctors thought these might work better. They hoped these new insulins would control blood sugar better. They also hoped they would cause fewer problems, like blood sugar dropping too low at night.

**Why Was This Study Needed?**
Doctors needed to know if the new long acting insulins really worked better than NPH. They wanted to compare them in real patients, not just in theory.

## Trial Design

**How Was This Study Designed?**
Researchers looked at 23 different studies. They combined the results from all these studies together. This helped them see the bigger picture.

**Who Was in These Studies?**
A total of 6,787 people took part. About 3,872 people used long acting insulin. About 2,915 people used intermediate acting insulin (NPH). All participants had type 1 diabetes.

**How Long Did the Studies Last?**
Each study lasted one year or less. No study followed patients for longer than that.

## Results

**What Did Researchers Measure?**
Researchers looked at several things:
- A blood test called glycosylated hemoglobin (or HbA1c for short). This test shows how well diabetes is controlled over time.
- Blood sugar levels in the morning before eating.
- How often blood sugar dropped too low at night. This is called nocturnal hypoglycemia.
- Long term problems from diabetes.

**What Were the Main Findings?**

The long acting insulins showed some benefits:
- The HbA1c test was slightly lower with long acting insulin. But the difference was very small. It may not matter much in real life.
- Long acting insulins worked better at night. Morning blood sugar levels were lower.
- People had fewer times when blood sugar dropped too low at night.

**What Was Missing?**
The studies did not look at long term problems from diabetes. The studies were too short to see these effects.

**What Did the Researchers Conclude?**

The quality of the studies was not very good. Most studies were rated as medium to low quality. The studies were also too short. Because of these problems, researchers could not make strong conclusions. They could not say for sure if long acting insulins are better or worse than intermediate acting insulins.

**What Is Needed Next?**
Longer studies are needed. These studies should follow patients for many years. This would help doctors understand the true benefits and risks of long acting insulins. Only then can they know which insulin is best for people with type 1 diabetes.",10.1002-14651858.CD006297,"Intermediate acting versus long acting insulin for type 1 diabetes mellitus

24,10.1002-14651858.CD013787-abstract.txt,"Background
Specific diagnostic tests to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and resulting COVID‐19 disease are not always available and take time to obtain results. Routine laboratory markers such as white blood cell count, measures of anticoagulation, C‐reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin, are used to assess the clinical status of a patient. These laboratory tests may be useful for the triage of people with potential COVID‐19 to prioritize them for different levels of treatment, especially in situations where time and resources are limited. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of routine laboratory testing as a triage test to determine if a person has COVID‐19. 
Search methods
On 4 May 2020 we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the COVID‐19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID‐19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included both case‐control designs and consecutive series of patients that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of routine laboratory testing as a triage test to determine if a person has COVID‐19. The reference standard could be reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) alone; RT‐PCR plus clinical expertise or and imaging; repeated RT‐PCR several days apart or from different samples; WHO and other case definitions; and any other reference standard used by the study authors. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from each included study. They also assessed the methodological quality of the studies, using QUADAS‐2. We used the 'NLMIXED' procedure in SAS 9.4 for the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) meta‐analyses of tests for which we included four or more studies. To facilitate interpretation of results, for each meta‐analysis we estimated summary sensitivity at the points on the SROC curve that corresponded to the median and interquartile range boundaries of specificities in the included studies. 
Main results
We included 21 studies in this review, including 14,126 COVID‐19 patients and 56,585 non‐COVID‐19 patients in total. Studies evaluated a total of 67 different laboratory tests. Although we were interested in the diagnotic accuracy of routine tests for COVID‐19, the included studies used detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection through RT‐PCR as reference standard. There was considerable heterogeneity between tests, threshold values and the settings in which they were applied. For some tests a positive result was defined as a decrease compared to normal vaues, for other tests a positive result was defined as an increase, and for some tests both increase and decrease may have indicated test positivity. None of the studies had either low risk of bias on all domains or low concerns for applicability for all domains. Only three of the tests evaluated had a summary sensitivity and specificity over 50%. These were: increase in interleukin‐6, increase in C‐reactive protein and lymphocyte count decrease. 
Blood count 
Eleven studies evaluated a decrease in white blood cell count, with a median specificity of 93% and a summary sensitivity of 25% (95% CI 8.0% to 27%; very low‐certainty evidence). The 15 studies that evaluated an increase in white blood cell count had a lower median specificity and a lower corresponding sensitivity. Four studies evaluated a decrease in neutrophil count. Their median specificity was 93%, corresponding to a summary sensitivity of 10% (95% CI 1.0% to 56%; low‐certainty evidence). The 11 studies that evaluated an increase in neutrophil count had a lower median specificity and a lower corresponding sensitivity. The summary sensitivity of an increase in neutrophil percentage (4 studies) was 59% (95% CI 1.0% to 100%) at median specificity (38%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in monocyte count (4 studies) was 13% (95% CI 6.0% to 26%) at median specificity (73%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of a decrease in lymphocyte count (13 studies) was 64% (95% CI 28% to 89%) at median specificity (53%; low‐certainty evidence). Four studies that evaluated a decrease in lymphocyte percentage showed a lower median specificity and lower corresponding sensitivity. The summary sensitivity of a decrease in platelets (4 studies) was 19% (95% CI 10% to 32%) at median specificity (88%; low‐certainty evidence). 
Liver function tests 
The summary sensitivity of an increase in alanine aminotransferase (9 studies) was 12% (95% CI 3% to 34%) at median specificity (92%; low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (7 studies) was 29% (95% CI 17% to 45%) at median specificity (81%) (low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of a decrease in albumin (4 studies) was 21% (95% CI 3% to 67%) at median specificity (66%; low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in total bilirubin (4 studies) was 12% (95% CI 3.0% to 34%) at median specificity (92%; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Markers of inflammation 
The summary sensitivity of an increase in CRP (14 studies) was 66% (95% CI 55% to 75%) at median specificity (44%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in procalcitonin (6 studies) was 3% (95% CI 1% to 19%) at median specificity (86%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in IL‐6 (four studies) was 73% (95% CI 36% to 93%) at median specificity (58%) (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Other biomarkers 
The summary sensitivity of an increase in creatine kinase (5 studies) was 11% (95% CI 6% to 19%) at median specificity (94%) (low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in serum creatinine (four studies) was 7% (95% CI 1% to 37%) at median specificity (91%; low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (4 studies) was 25% (95% CI 15% to 38%) at median specificity (72%; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Although these tests give an indication about the general health status of patients and some tests may be specific indicators for inflammatory processes, none of the tests we investigated are useful for accurately ruling in or ruling out COVID‐19 on their own. Studies were done in specific hospitalized populations, and future studies should consider non‐hospital settings to evaluate how these tests would perform in people with milder symptoms. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Blood Markers to Identify COVID-19

## Plain Title
Can routine blood tests help doctors identify people with COVID-19?

## Rationale

### What is COVID-19 and why is this important?
COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. This virus spread around the world starting in 2020. Many people got sick. Some people had mild symptoms. Other people became very ill.

### The problem doctors faced
The best test for COVID-19 looks for the virus itself. This test is called RT-PCR. But this test was not always available everywhere. It also took time to get results. Doctors needed faster ways to identify who might have COVID-19.

### What are routine blood tests?
When people go to the hospital, doctors often do blood tests. These tests check many things in the blood. They look at white blood cells that fight infection. They measure proteins that show inflammation in the body. They check how organs like the liver are working. These tests are quick and available in most hospitals.

### Why researchers did this study
Researchers wanted to know if these routine blood tests could help identify COVID-19. If these tests worked well, doctors could use them to sort patients quickly. They could decide who needs urgent care. They could do this even before getting virus test results. This would be especially helpful when hospitals are very busy or when virus tests are hard to get.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study this question?
Researchers looked at 21 studies that other scientists had already done. These studies included over 70,000 people total. About 14,000 people had COVID-19. About 56,000 people did not have COVID-19.

### What did the studies measure?
The studies looked at 67 different blood tests. For each test, researchers checked two things. First, how often did the test correctly identify people with COVID-19? Second, how often did the test correctly identify people without COVID-19?

### Who was in these studies?
The studies mostly included people who were already in hospitals. These were people sick enough to need hospital care.

### How did researchers know who really had COVID-19?
All studies used the RT-PCR virus test as the true answer. They compared blood test results to virus test results.

## Results

### What did researchers find?
No single blood test was good enough to identify COVID-19 on its own. Most tests missed many people who actually had COVID-19. Some tests also incorrectly suggested COVID-19 in people who did not have it.

### The three best tests
Three tests performed slightly better than others, but still not well enough:

**Test 1: Interleukin-6 increase**
This protein goes up when the body fights infection. It correctly identified 73 out of 100 people with COVID-19. But it also incorrectly suggested COVID-19 in 42 out of 100 people without the disease.

**Test 2: C-reactive protein increase**
This protein also shows inflammation. It correctly identified 66 out of 100 people with COVID-19. But it incorrectly suggested COVID-19 in 56 out of 100 people without the disease.

**Test 3: Low lymphocyte count**
Lymphocytes are white blood cells. When counts drop, it can mean infection. This test correctly identified 64 out of 100 people with COVID-19. But it incorrectly suggested COVID-19 in 47 out of 100 people without the disease.

### Other tests performed worse
Many other blood tests were even less helpful. Some examples:
- Low white blood cell count found only 25 out of 100 people with COVID-19
- High procalcitonin found only 3 out of 100 people with COVID-19
- High liver enzymes found only 12 to 29 out of 100 people with COVID-19

### What does this mean?
These routine blood tests cannot replace virus tests for COVID-19. They miss too many people who have the disease. They also suggest disease in too many people who do not have it.

### Why this matters
Doctors can use these blood tests to check overall health. Some tests show if the body is fighting infection. But doctors cannot use these tests alone to diagnose COVID-19. They still need virus tests to know for sure.

### What needs to happen next
All studies in this review looked at hospital patients. Future research should test people with milder symptoms. This would show if blood tests work better in people not sick enough for the hospital.",10.1002-14651858.CD013787,"How accurate are routine laboratory tests for diagnosis of COVID‐19?
What are routine laboratory tests? 
Routine laboratory tests are blood tests that assess the health status of a patient. Tests include counts of different types of white blood cells (these help the body fight infection), and detection of markers (proteins) that indicate organ damage, and general inflammation. These tests are widely available and in some places they may be the only tests available for diagnosis of COVID‐19. 
What did we want to find out? 
People with suspected COVID‐19 need to know quickly whether they are infected so that they can self‐isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. 
Currently, the standard test for COVID‐19 is usually the RT‐PCR test. In the RT‐PCR, samples from the nose and throat are sent away for testing, usually to a large, central laboratory with specialist equipment. Other tests include imaging tests, like X‐rays, which also require specialist equipment. 
We wanted to know whether routine laboratory tests were sufficiently accurate to diagnose COVID‐19 in people with suspected COVID‐19. We also wanted to know whether they were accurate enough to prioritize patients for different levels of treatment. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of routine laboratory tests to diagnose COVID‐19 compared with RT‐PCR or other tests. Studies could be of any design and be set anywhere in the world. Studies could include participants of any age or sex, with suspected COVID‐19, or use samples from people known to have – or not to have ‐ COVID‐19. 
What we found 
We found 21 studies that looked at 67 different routine laboratory tests for COVID‐19. Most of the studies looked at how accurately these tests diagnosed infection with the virus causing COVID‐19. Four studies included both children and adults, 16 included only adults and one study only children. Seventeen studies were done in China, and one each in Iran, Italy, Taiwan and the USA. All studies took place in hospitals, except one that used samples from a database. Most studies used RT‐PCR to confirm COVID‐19 diagnosis. 
Accuracy of tests is most often reported using ‘sensitivity’ and ‘specificity’. Sensitivity is the proportion of people with COVID‐19 correctly detected by the test; specificity is the proportion of people without COVID‐19 who are correctly identified by the test. The nearer sensitivity and specificity are to 100%, the better the test. A test to prioritize people for treatment would require a high sensitivity of more than 80%. 
Where four or more studies evaluated a particular test, we pooled their results and analyzed them together. Our analyses showed that only three of the tests had both sensitivity and specificity over 50%. Two of these were markers for general inflammation (increases in interleukin‐6 and C‐reactive protein). The third was for lymphocyte count decrease. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell where a low count might indicate infection. 
How reliable are the results? 
Our confidence in the evidence from this review is low because the studies were different from each other, which made them difficult to compare. For example, some included very sick people, while some included people with hardly any COVID‐19 symptoms. Also, the diagnosis of COVID‐19 was confirmed in different ways: RT‐PCR was sometimes used in combination with other tests. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Routine laboratory tests can be issued by most healthcare facilities. However, our results are probably not representative of most clinical situations in which these tests are being used. Most studies included very sick people with high rates of COVID‐19 virus infection of between 27% and 76%. In most primary healthcare facilities, this percentage will be lower. 
What does this mean? 
Routine laboratory tests cannot distinguish between COVID‐19 and other diseases as the cause of infection, inflammation or tissue damage. None of the tests performed well enough to be a standalone diagnostic test for COVID‐19 nor to prioritize patients for treatment. They will mainly be used to provide an overall picture about the health status of the patient. The final COVID‐19 diagnosis has to be made based on other tests. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched all COVID‐19 studies up to 4 May 2020.

The projected rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could develop into a substantial health problem worldwide. Whether dipeptidyl‐peptidase (DPP)‐4 inhibitors or glucagon‐like peptide (GLP)‐1 analogues are able to prevent or delay T2DM and its associated complications in people at risk for the development of T2DM is unknown. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of DPP‐4 inhibitors and GLP‐1 analogues on the prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in people with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting blood glucose, moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; PubMed; Embase; ClinicalTrials.gov; the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We asked investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials. The date of the last search of all databases was January 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of 12 weeks or more comparing DPP‐4 inhibitors and GLP‐1 analogues with any pharmacological glucose‐lowering intervention, behaviour‐changing intervention, placebo or no intervention in people with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, moderately elevated HbA1c or combinations of these. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors read all abstracts and full‐text articles and records, assessed quality and extracted outcome data independently. One review author extracted data which were checked by a second review author. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or the involvement of a third review author. For meta‐analyses, we planned to use a random‐effects model with investigation of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. 
Main results
We included seven completed RCTs; about 98 participants were randomised to a DPP‐4 inhibitor as monotherapy and 1620 participants were randomised to a GLP‐1 analogue as monotherapy. Two trials investigated a DPP‐4 inhibitor and five trials investigated a GLP‐1 analogue. A total of 924 participants with data on allocation to control groups were randomised to a comparator group; 889 participants were randomised to placebo and 33 participants to metformin monotherapy. One RCT of liraglutide contributed 85% of all participants. The duration of the intervention varied from 12 weeks to 160 weeks. We judged none of the included trials at low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains and did not perform meta‐analyses because there were not enough trials. 
One trial comparing the DPP‐4 inhibitor vildagliptin with placebo reported no deaths (very low‐quality evidence). The incidence of T2DM by means of WHO diagnostic criteria in this trial was 3/90 participants randomised to vildagliptin versus 1/89 participants randomised to placebo (very low‐quality evidence). Also, 1/90 participants on vildagliptin versus 2/89 participants on placebo experienced a serious adverse event (very low‐quality evidence). One out of 90 participants experienced congestive heart failure in the vildagliptin group versus none in the placebo group (very low‐quality evidence). There were no data on non‐fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, health‐related quality of life or socioeconomic effects reported. 
All‐cause and cardiovascular mortality following treatment with GLP‐1 analogues were rarely reported; one trial of exenatide reported that no participant died. Another trial of liraglutide 3.0 mg showed that 2/1501 in the liraglutide group versus 2/747 in the placebo group died after 160 weeks of treatment (very low‐quality evidence). 
The incidence of T2DM following treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg compared to placebo after 160 weeks was 26/1472 (1.8%) participants randomised to liraglutide versus 46/738 (6.2%) participants randomised to placebo (very low‐quality evidence). The trial established the risk for (diagnosis of) T2DM as HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% (6.5% or greater), fasting plasma glucose 5.6 mmol/L or greater to 6.9 mmol/L or less (7.0 mmol/L or greater) or two‐hour post‐load plasma glucose 7.8 mmol/L or greater to 11.0 mmol/L (11.1 mmol/L). Altogether, 70/1472 (66%) participants regressed from intermediate hyperglycaemia to normoglycaemia compared with 268/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group. The incidence of T2DM after the 12‐week off‐treatment extension period (i.e. after 172 weeks) showed that five additional participants were diagnosed T2DM in the liraglutide group, compared with one participant in the placebo group. After 12‐week treatment cessation, 740/1472 (50%) participants in the liraglutide group compared with 263/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group had normoglycaemia. 
One trial used exenatide and 2/17 participants randomised to exenatide versus 1/16 participants randomised to placebo developed T2DM (very low‐quality evidence). This trial did not provide a definition of T2DM. One trial reported serious adverse events in 230/1524 (15.1%) participants in the liraglutide 3.0 mg arm versus 96/755 (12.7%) participants in the placebo arm (very low quality evidence). There were no serious adverse events in the trial using exenatide. Non‐fatal myocardial infarction was reported in 1/1524 participants in the liraglutide arm and in 0/55 participants in the placebo arm at 172 weeks (very low‐quality evidence). One trial reported congestive heart failure in 1/1524 participants in the liraglutide arm and in 1/755 participants in the placebo arm (very low‐quality evidence). Participants receiving liraglutide compared with placebo had a small mean improvement in the physical component of the 36‐item Short Form scale showing a difference of 0.87 points (95% CI 0.17 to 1.58; P = 0.02; 1 trial; 1791 participants; very low‐quality evidence). No trial evaluating GLP‐1‐analogues reported data on stroke, microvascular complications or socioeconomic effects. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no firm evidence that DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues compared mainly with placebo substantially influence the risk of T2DM and especially its associated complications in people at increased risk for the development of T2DM. Most trials did not investigate patient‐important outcomes. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Can Two Types of Diabetes Drugs Prevent Type 2 Diabetes in People at Risk?

## Plain Title

Can DPP-4 Inhibitors and GLP-1 Analogues Prevent or Delay Type 2 Diabetes in People at Risk?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Type 2 diabetes is a disease where the body cannot control blood sugar well. More and more people around the world are getting this disease. Before someone gets type 2 diabetes, they often have higher than normal blood sugar levels. This is called being ""at risk"" for diabetes.

**What are DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues?**

These are two types of drugs that doctors use to treat people who already have type 2 diabetes. DPP-4 inhibitors are pills. GLP-1 analogues are shots. Both types of drugs help the body control blood sugar.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know if these drugs could stop or delay diabetes in people at risk. If these drugs work, they might help people avoid getting diabetes. This could prevent serious health problems that diabetes causes. These problems include heart disease, kidney damage, and vision loss.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this question?**

Researchers looked for studies that tested these drugs in people at risk for diabetes. They found 7 studies. Two studies tested DPP-4 inhibitors. Five studies tested GLP-1 analogues.

**Who was in these studies?**

About 98 people took DPP-4 inhibitors. About 1,620 people took GLP-1 analogues. About 924 people took a fake pill or another drug for comparison. One large study using a drug called liraglutide included most of the people.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies lasted from 12 weeks to 160 weeks. This is about 3 months to 3 years.

## Results

**What did the researchers find about DPP-4 inhibitors?**

Only one small study tested a DPP-4 inhibitor called vildagliptin. The results were unclear. Three out of 90 people taking vildagliptin got diabetes. One out of 89 people taking a fake pill got diabetes. The study did not show clear benefits. The quality of this evidence was very low.

**What did the researchers find about GLP-1 analogues?**

The largest study tested liraglutide for 160 weeks. Here is what happened:

- Fewer people got diabetes: 26 out of 1,472 people taking liraglutide got diabetes. This is about 2 out of 100 people. In comparison, 46 out of 738 people taking a fake pill got diabetes. This is about 6 out of 100 people.

- More people returned to normal blood sugar: 66 out of 100 people taking liraglutide had normal blood sugar at the end. Only 36 out of 100 people taking the fake pill had normal blood sugar.

- After people stopped taking the drug: Some benefits remained. But some people did develop diabetes after stopping the drug.

**What about side effects?**

Very few people died in these studies. Serious side effects happened in about 15 out of 100 people taking liraglutide. About 13 out of 100 people taking the fake pill had serious side effects. Heart problems were rare in both groups.

**What about quality of life?**

One study found a small improvement in physical health for people taking liraglutide. The improvement was very small.

**What was missing?**

Most studies did not look at important health problems like heart attacks or strokes. They did not look at kidney or eye damage. They did not look at costs.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

The evidence is not strong enough to say these drugs clearly prevent diabetes or its complications. More and better studies are needed. These studies should look at health problems that matter most to patients. They should follow people for longer periods of time.

Review question 
Are the glucose‐lowering medicines, DPP‐4 inhibitors (e.g. linagliptin or vildagliptin) and GLP‐1 analogues (e.g. exenatide or liraglutide) able to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes and its associated complications in people at risk for the development of type 2 diabetes? 
Background 
DPP‐4 inhibitors and GLP‐1 analogues are widely used to treat people with type 2 diabetes. People with moderately elevated blood glucose are said to be at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (often referred to as 'prediabetes'). It is currently not known whether DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues should be prescribed for people with raised blood glucose levels who do not have type 2 diabetes. We wanted to find out whether these medicines could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people at increased risk. We also wanted to know the effects on patient‐important outcomes such as complications of diabetes (e.g. kidney and eye disease, heart attacks, strokes), death from any cause, health‐related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health) and side effects of the medicines. 
Study characteristics 
Participants had to have blood glucose levels higher than considered normal, but below the glucose levels that are used to diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found seven randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 2702 participants. The duration of the treatments varied from 12 weeks to 160 weeks. One study investigating liraglutide dominated the evidence (2285/2702 participants). The participants in this study were overweight or obese. 
This evidence is up to date as of January 2017.
Key results 
DPP‐4 inhibitors did not reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with placebo (a dummy medicine). In the big study investigating the GLP‐1‐analogue liraglutide, given in a dose used for obese people (3.0 mg), the development of type 2 diabetes was delayed: 26/1472 (1.8%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 46/738 (6.2%) participants randomised to placebo developed type 2 diabetes after 160 weeks. On the other side, 970/1472 (66%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 268/738 (36%) participants randomised to placebo switched back to normal glucose levels. This study was extended for another 12 weeks without treatment and five additional participants developed diabetes in the liraglutide group, compared with one participant in the placebo group. After the 12 weeks without treatment, 740/1472 (50%) participants in the liraglutide group compared with 263/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group had glucose levels considered as normal. This means that to keep chances high to prevent type 2 diabetes in people at risk one probably needs to continuously take this drug. Of note, serious adverse events (e.g. defined as hospitalisation or a hazard putting the participant at risk, such as an interaction with another medicine) happened more often following liraglutide treatment (230/1524 (15%) participants in the liraglutide group and 96/755 (13%) participants in the placebo group) and it is unclear whether taking this drug is safe in the long term. 
We detected neither an advantage nor a disadvantage of DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues in relation to non‐fatal heart attacks, non‐fatal strokes or heart failure. Our included studies did not report on other complications of diabetes such as kidney or eye disease. The effects on health‐related quality of life were inconclusive. In the included studies, very few participants died and there was no apparent relation to treatment. 
Future studies should investigate more patient‐important outcomes like complications of diabetes and especially the side effects of the medications, because we do not know for sure whether 'prediabetes' is just a condition arbitrarily defined by a laboratory measurement, is in fact a real risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether treatment of this condition translates into better patient‐important outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
All included trials had deficiencies in the way they were conducted or how key items were reported. For the individual comparisons, the number of participants was small, resulting in a high risk of random errors (play of chance).

26,10.1002-14651858.CD013210.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disease of the gut. About 75% of people with CD undergo surgery at least once in their lifetime to induce remission. However, as there is no known cure for the disease, patients usually experience a recurrence even after surgery. Different interventions are routinely used in maintaining postsurgical remission. There is currently no consensus on which treatment is the most effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and harms of interventions for the maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's disease and rank the treatments in order of effectiveness. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 January 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles, abstracts from major gastroenterology meetings, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. There was no restriction on language, date, or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different interventions used for maintaining surgically induced remission in people with CD who were in postsurgical remission. Participants had to have received maintenance treatment for at least three months. We excluded studies assessing enteral diet, diet manipulation, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplementation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by arbitration of a third review author when necessary. We conducted a network meta‐analysis (NMA) using a Bayesian approach through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. For the pairwise comparisons carried out in Review Manager 5, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the NMA, we presented hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) and reported ranking probabilities for each intervention. For the NMA, we focused on three main outcomes: clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Data were insufficient to assess time to relapse and histologic relapse. Adverse events and serious adverse events were not sufficiently or objectively reported to permit an NMA. We used CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta‐Analysis) methods to evaluate our confidence in the findings within networks, and GRADE for entire networks. 
Main results
We included 35 RCTs (3249 participants) in the review. The average age of study participants ranged between 33.6 and 38.8 years. Risk of bias was high in 18 studies, low in four studies, and unclear in 13 studies. Of the 35 included RCTs, 26 studies (2581 participants; 9 interventions) were considered eligible for inclusion in the NMA. The interventions studied included 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA), adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone. This resulted in 30 direct contrasts, which informed 102 mixed‐treatment contrasts. 
The evidence for the clinical relapse network (21 studies; 2245 participants) and endoscopic relapse (12 studies; 1128 participants) were of low certainty while the evidence for withdrawal due to adverse events (15 studies; 1498 participants) was of very low certainty. This assessment was due to high risk of bias in most of the studies, inconsistency, and imprecision across networks. We mainly judged individual contrasts as of low or very low certainty, except 5‐ASA versus placebo, the evidence for which was judged as of moderate certainty. 
We ranked the treatments based on effectiveness and the certainty of the evidence. For clinical relapse, the five most highly ranked treatments were adalimumab, infliximab, budesonide, 5‐ASA, and purine analogues. We found some evidence that adalimumab (HR 0.11, 95% Crl 0.02 to 0.33; low‐certainty evidence) and 5‐ASA may reduce the probability of clinical relapse compared to placebo (HR 0.69, 95% Crl 0.53 to 0.87; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse (HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.27 to 1.34; low‐certainty evidence). We are less confident about the effectiveness of infliximab (HR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.02 to 1.74; very low‐certainty evidence) and purine analogues (HR 0.75, 95% CrI 0.55 to 1.00; low‐certainty evidence). It was unclear whether the other interventions reduced the probability of a clinical relapse, as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing endoscopic relapse. Whilst there might be some evidence of prevention of endoscopic relapse with adalimumab (HR 0.10, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.32; low‐certainty evidence), no other intervention studied appeared to be effective. 
Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing withdrawal due to adverse events. Withdrawal due to adverse events appeared to be least likely with sulfasalazine (HR 1.96, 95% Crl 0.00 to 8.90; very low‐certainty evidence) and most likely with antibiotics (HR 53.92, 95% Crl 0.43 to 259.80; very low‐certainty evidence). When considering the network as a whole, two adverse events leading to study withdrawal (i.e. pancreatitis and leukopenia) occurred in more than 1% of participants treated with an intervention. Pancreatitis occurred in 2.8% (11/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.17% (2/1210) of all other groups studied. Leukopenia occurred in 2.5% (10/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.08% (1/1210) of all other groups studied. 
Authors' conclusions
Due to low‐certainty evidence in the networks, we are unable to draw conclusions on which treatment is most effective for preventing clinical relapse and endoscopic relapse. Evidence on the safety of the interventions was inconclusive, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia from purine analogues were evident in the studies. Larger trials are needed to further understand the effect of the interventions on endoscopic relapse. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments to Keep Crohn's Disease in Remission After Surgery

## Plain Title
Which treatments work best to keep Crohn's disease from coming back after surgery?

## Rationale

**What is Crohn's disease?**
Crohn's disease is a long-term illness that affects the gut. It causes pain and problems with digestion. The disease does not go away on its own.

**Why do people need surgery?**
About 3 out of 4 people with Crohn's disease need surgery at least once. Surgery helps control the disease for a while. But the disease usually comes back even after surgery. This is called a relapse.

**Why was this study needed?**
After surgery, doctors give patients different treatments. These treatments try to keep the disease from coming back. But doctors do not agree on which treatment works best. This study looked at many different treatments. The goal was to find out which ones work best to keep Crohn's disease away after surgery.

**What treatments were studied?**
The researchers looked at 9 different treatments. These included medicines like 5-ASA, adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, and sulfasalazine.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
The researchers looked at 35 past studies. These studies included 3,249 people with Crohn's disease. All of these people had surgery and were in remission. This means their disease was under control.

**Who was in the studies?**
The people in the studies were adults. Their average age was between 34 and 39 years old. The studies included both men and women.

**How long did the studies last?**
People in the studies took their treatment for at least 3 months. Some studies lasted longer.

**What did the researchers measure?**
The researchers looked at three main things:
- How many people had their disease come back (clinical relapse)
- How many people showed signs of disease in medical tests (endoscopic relapse)
- How many people stopped treatment because of side effects

## Results

**What did the study find?**
The researchers could not say for certain which treatment works best. This is because the quality of evidence was low. Many of the past studies had problems with how they were done.

**Which treatments might help?**
The five treatments that ranked highest were:
1. Adalimumab
2. Infliximab
3. Budesonide
4. 5-ASA
5. Purine analogues

**What about specific treatments?**
- Adalimumab may help keep the disease from coming back
- 5-ASA may help keep the disease from coming back
- The researchers were less sure about the other treatments

**Were there side effects?**
Some people stopped taking their medicine because of side effects. The researchers found:
- Antibiotics had the most people stop treatment
- Sulfasalazine had the fewest people stop treatment

Two serious side effects happened with purine analogues:
- Pancreatitis (swelling of the pancreas): This happened in about 3 out of 100 people taking purine analogues
- Leukopenia (low white blood cells): This happened in about 3 out of 100 people taking purine analogues

These side effects were rare in people taking other treatments.

**What do the results mean?**
The researchers could not say which treatment is best. The evidence was not strong enough. More and better studies are needed. These studies should look at more people. They should also check for disease signs using medical tests.

**What should patients know?**
If you have Crohn's disease and had surgery, talk to your doctor. Your doctor can help you choose the best treatment for you. Each treatment has benefits and risks. Your doctor will consider your specific situation.",10.1002-14651858.CD013210,"Interventions for maintaining surgically included remission in Crohn's disease
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out which drugs are most effective for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease who have undergone surgery to achieve remission. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. We examined these studies using a method known as network meta‐analysis (NMA) in order to compare and rank all the treatments in terms of clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse and safety. 
What was studied in the review? 
Crohn's disease is a chronic disease of the gut. It is known to change from periods when people experience a flare‐up of the disease (relapse) to periods of good health (remission). Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. People with Crohn's disease may undergo surgery to remove diseased parts of their gut and achieve remission. However, their symptoms return after a while. Different drugs can be given to ensure that people with Crohn's disease remain in remission for as long as possible. These drugs include mesalazine, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and adalimumab, amongst others. Whilst these drugs have been known to reduce inflammation (pain and swelling) in the gut, side effects can occur with their use. We attempted to find out which treatments are the safest and most effective for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease after surgery. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
We searched for studies published up to 15 January 2019.
What are the main results of the review? 
We included 35 relevant trials, which were published between 1976 and 2018. The studies included a total of 3249 participants who were mostly adults. Our NMA included 26 studies (2581 participants) and compared nine groups of treatments such as 5‐aminosalicylic acid, adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone, which are used in preventing relapse after surgery in people with Crohn's disease. Adalimumab may reduce the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo (dummy treatment). 5‐aminosalicylic acid probably reduces the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo. Budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse. The entire network evidence is of low certainty due to the small number of participants included in the studies and high risk of bias. This means that are confidence in these results is limited. Research to understand the effect of the treatments on endoscopic relapse and safety was limited, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia were reported in participants who received purine analogues. 
Key messages 
We uncertain about which treatments are most effective in preventing postoperative relapse in Crohn's disease. Alhough there is limited research on the harms (side effects) of these treatments, there were reported instances of pancreatitis and leukopenia in participants who received purine analogues.

Each year, in high‐income countries alone, approximately 100 million people develop scars. Excessive scarring can cause pruritus, pain, contractures, and cosmetic disfigurement, and can dramatically affect people's quality of life, both physically and psychologically. Hypertrophic scars are visible and elevated scars that do not spread into surrounding tissues and that often regress spontaneously. Silicone gel sheeting (SGS) is made from medical‐grade silicone reinforced with a silicone membrane backing and is one of the most commonly used treatments for hypertrophic scars. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of silicone gel sheeting for the treatment of hypertrophic scars in any care setting. 
Search methods
In April 2021 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with any hypertrophic scars and assessed the use of SGS. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, data extraction and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. We resolved initial disagreements by discussion, or by consulting a third review author when necessary. 
Main results
Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 10 to 60 participants. The trials were clinically heterogeneous with differences in duration of follow‐up, and scar site. We report 10 comparisons, SGS compared with no SGS treatment and SGS compared with the following treatments: pressure garments; silicone gel; topical onion extract; polyurethane; propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting; Kenalog injection; flashlamp‐pumped pulsed‐dye laser; intense pulsed light  and Gecko Nanoplast (a silicone gel bandage). Six trials had a split‐site design and three trials had an unclear design (resulting in a mix of paired and clustered data). 
Included studies reported limited outcome data for the primary review outcomes of severity of scarring measured by health professionals and adverse events (limited data reported by some included studies, but further analyses of these data was not possible) and no data were reported for severity of scarring reported by patients. For secondary outcomes some pain data were reported, but health‐related quality of life and cost effectiveness were not reported. Many trials had poorly‐reported methodology, meaning the risk of bias was unclear. We rated all evidence as being either of low or very low certainty, often because of imprecision resulting from few participants, low event rates, or both, all in single studies. 
SGS compared with no SGS 
Seven studies with 177 participants compared SGS with no SGS for hypertrophic scars. Two studies with 31 participants (32 scars) reported severity of scarring assessed by health professionals, and it is uncertain whether there is a difference in severity of scarring between the two groups (mean difference (MD) ‐1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.77 to 0.12; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and twice for serious imprecision). One study with 34 participants suggests SGS may result in a slight reduction in pain level compared with no SGS treatment (MD −1.26, 95% CI −2.26 to −0.26; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
SGS compared with pressure garments 
One study with 54 participants was included in this comparison. The study reported that SGS may reduce pain levels compared with pressure garments (MD −1.90, 95% CI −2.99 to −0.81;  low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
SGS compared with silicone gel 
One study with 32 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on severity of scarring assessed by health professionals compared with silicone gel (MD 0.40, 95% CI −0.88 to 1.68; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, twice for imprecision). 
SGS compared with topical onion extract 
One trial (32 participants) was included in this comparison. SGS may slightly reduce severity of scarring compared with topical onion extract (MD ‐1.30, 95% CI ‐2.58 to ‐0.02; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and once for imprecision). 
SGS compared with polyurethane 
One study with 60 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on the severity of scarring assessed by health professionals compared with polyurethane (MD 0.50, 95% CI ‐2.96 to 3.96; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and twice for imprecision). 
SGS compared with self‐adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting 
One study with 38 participants was included in this comparison. It is uncertain if SGS reduces pain compared with self‐adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting (MD −0.12, 95% CI −0.18 to −0.06). This is very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for imprecision and once for indirectness. 
SGS compared with Gecko Nanoplast 
One study with 60 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on pain compared with Gecko Nanoplast (MD 0.70, 95% CI  ‐0.28 to 1.68; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. 
There was a lack of reportable data from the other three comparisons of SGS with Kenalog injection, flashlamp‐pumped pulsed‐dye laser or intense pulsed light. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently limited rigorous RCT evidence available about the clinical effectiveness of SGS in the treatment of hypertrophic scars. None of the included studies provided evidence on severity of scarring validated by participants, health‐related quality of life, or cost effectiveness. Reporting was poor, to the extent that we are not confident that most trials are free from risk of bias. The limitations in current RCT evidence suggest that further trials are required to reduce uncertainty around decision‐making in the use of SGS to treat hypertrophic scars. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Silicone Gel Sheeting for Treating Raised Scars

## Plain Title

Does silicone gel sheeting help treat raised scars?

## Rationale

**What are hypertrophic scars?**

Every year, about 100 million people in wealthy countries develop scars. Some scars become raised and thick. These are called hypertrophic scars. They stay raised but do not spread into nearby skin. Many of these scars get better on their own over time.

**Why are these scars a problem?**

Raised scars can cause several problems for people:
- Itching
- Pain
- Tight skin that limits movement
- Changes in appearance

These problems can affect how people feel about themselves. They can impact daily life in both physical and emotional ways.

**What is silicone gel sheeting?**

Silicone gel sheeting (SGS) is a treatment made from medical silicone. It has a backing that helps it stay in place. Doctors use it often to treat raised scars. People place the sheets on their scars.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if SGS really works. They wanted to find out if it helps scars look better. They also wanted to know if it reduces pain. This information helps doctors and patients make better treatment choices.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies that tested SGS. They found 13 studies that met their standards. These studies included between 10 and 60 people each.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included people who had raised scars. The scars were in different places on the body. The studies followed people for different lengths of time.

**What did researchers compare?**

The studies compared SGS to several different treatments:
- No treatment at all
- Pressure garments (tight clothing worn over scars)
- Silicone gel (a liquid form)
- Onion extract cream
- Other types of sheeting materials
- Steroid injections
- Laser treatments
- Other silicone bandages

Some studies had people use different treatments on different scars. This let researchers compare results on the same person.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found very limited information. Most studies were small. Many did not report results clearly. This made it hard to know if SGS really works.

**Comparing SGS to no treatment:**

Seven studies with 177 people compared SGS to no treatment. The results were unclear about whether SGS makes scars look better. One study suggested SGS might reduce pain slightly compared to no treatment.

**Comparing SGS to pressure garments:**

One study with 54 people found that SGS may reduce pain more than pressure garments.

**Comparing SGS to onion extract cream:**

One study with 32 people found that SGS might make scars look slightly better than onion extract cream.

**Comparing SGS to other treatments:**

Results were unclear when comparing SGS to silicone gel, other sheeting materials, or other silicone bandages. The studies were too small to be sure about the results.

**What was missing?**

The studies did not report several important things:
- How patients felt about their scars
- Quality of life
- Cost of treatment
- Side effects (only limited information)

**Quality of the evidence:**

The researchers rated all evidence as low or very low quality. This means we cannot be confident in the results. The studies had problems:
- Too few people in each study
- Unclear methods
- Results that were not consistent

**Main conclusions:**

There is not enough good evidence to know if SGS works for raised scars. The studies done so far are too small and have too many problems. We need better studies with more people. These studies should measure what matters most to patients. They should track how scars look, how they feel, and how they affect daily life.

Doctors and patients should know that current evidence is limited. More research is needed before we can say for sure whether SGS helps treat raised scars.",10.1002-14651858.CD013357,"Silicone gel sheeting for treating hypertrophic scars
Background 
A scar is a mark left on the skin after a wound or injury has healed, for example, after surgery or after a burn. Most scars will fade and become paler over time, but some scars may become red and raised (called hypertrophic scars). Hypertrophic scars may take several years to flatten and fade. 
Scars can be itchy, painful or unsightly, and may restrict movement. Scarring can affect people physically and emotionally, and can affect a person's well‐being. 
Treatments aim to improve a scar’s appearance and help to make it less visible. They include: wearing clothing that fits tightly around the skin (pressure garments); treatments applied to the scar; laser therapy and silicone gel sheets. 
Silicone gel sheets are soft wound dressings containing an elastic form of silicone. They have a soft, rubbery texture and stick to the skin. They are commonly used on healing skin to help soften and flatten a hypertrophic scar. 
What did we want to find out? 
In this Cochrane Review, we wanted to find out how well silicone gel sheets worked in treating hypertrophic scars. 
Our methods 
We searched for studies that investigated the use of silicone gel sheets to treat hypertrophic scars. We searched for randomised controlled trials only, in which the treatment each person receives is chosen at random. These studies give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
What we found 
We found 13 studies with 468 people (425 of them completed the study) with hypertrophic scars caused by surgery, injury, burns or scalding. The studies compared the effects of silicone gel sheets with: giving no treatment with silicone gel sheets; wearing pressure garments; applying silicone gel or onion extract; polyurethane dressings; steroid injections;  laser therapy; intense pulsed light or Gecko Nanoplast (a silicone gel bandage). 
All studies were conducted in hospitals, in Europe (6 studies), China (2), the USA (1), Canada (1), Iran (1), Turkey (1) and India (1). They lasted for different lengths of time: from 3 months to 12 months. 
Four studies reported assessments of scars by healthcare professionals in way that was usable for this review. No studies reported useful results for the person's own assessment of their scar after treatment. 
No studies reported useful results for people's well‐being (quality of life): for whether people stayed on the treatment (adherence), whether the treatments had any unwanted effects; or whether the treatments were cost‐effective (the benefits of treatment outweighed any extra costs). 
The studies did not give enough information to compare silicone gel sheets with steroid injections, laser therapy or pulsed light. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Silicone gel sheets may slightly improve the appearance of hypertrophic scars compared with onion extract.  We are uncertain whether silicone gel sheets improve a scar's appearance better than no treatment with silicone gel sheets, or silicone gel, or polyurethane.  
Silicone gel sheets may reduce pain levels compared with pressure garments. Silicone gel sheets may also result in a slight reduction in pain levels compared with no treatment with silicone gel sheets. We are uncertain whether silicone gel sheets decrease pain compared with self‐adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting.  The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of silicone gel sheets on pain compared with Gecko Nanoplast. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence was low, or very low. The evidence we found comes from a few studies (sometimes only one), often in small numbers of people, with poorly reported results, so we are not sure how reliable the results are. We therefore think our conclusions would be likely to change if results from further studies become available. 
Conclusions 
We are uncertain about whether silicone gel sheets work better than most other treatments for hypertrophic scars. Silicone gel sheets may improve the appearance of scars slightly compared with applying onion extract, and may reduce pain compared with no treatment with silicone gel sheets or pressure garments.

Aerosols and spatter are generated in a dental clinic during aerosol‐generating procedures (AGPs) that use high‐speed hand pieces. Dental healthcare providers can be at increased risk of transmission of diseases such as tuberculosis, measles and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) through droplets on mucosae, inhalation of aerosols or through fomites on mucosae, which harbour micro‐organisms. There are ways to mitigate and contain spatter and aerosols that may, in turn, reduce any risk of disease transmission. In addition to personal protective equipment (PPE) and aerosol‐reducing devices such as high‐volume suction, it has been hypothesised that the use of mouth rinse by patients before dental procedures could reduce the microbial load of aerosols that are generated during dental AGPs. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of preprocedural mouth rinses used in dental clinics to minimise incidence of infection in dental healthcare providers and reduce or neutralise contamination in aerosols. 
Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 4 February 2022. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials and excluded laboratory‐based studies. Study participants were dental patients undergoing AGPs. Studies compared any preprocedural mouth rinse used to reduce contaminated aerosols versus placebo, no mouth rinse or another mouth rinse. Our primary outcome was incidence of infection of dental healthcare providers and secondary outcomes were reduction in the level of contamination of the dental operatory environment, cost, change in mouth microbiota, adverse events, and acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened search results, extracted data from included studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and judged the certainty of the available evidence. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect estimate for continuous outcomes, and random‐effects meta‐analysis to combine data  
Main results
 We included 17 studies with 830 participants aged 18 to 70 years. We judged three trials at high risk of bias, two at low risk and 12 at unclear risk of bias.  
None of the studies measured our primary outcome of the incidence of infection in dental healthcare providers.  
The primary outcome in the studies was reduction in the level of bacterial contamination measured in colony‐forming units (CFUs) at distances of less than 2 m (intended to capture larger droplets) and 2 m or more (to capture droplet nuclei from aerosols arising from the participant's oral cavity). It is unclear what size of CFU reduction represents a clinically significant amount. 
There is low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence that chlorhexidine (CHX) may reduce bacterial contamination, as measured by CFUs, compared with no rinsing or rinsing with water. There were similar results when comparing cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) with no rinsing and when comparing CPC, essential oils/herbal mouthwashes or boric acid with water. There is very low‐certainty evidence that tempered mouth rinses may provide a greater reduction in CFUs than cold mouth rinses. There is low‐certainty evidence that CHX may reduce CFUs more than essential oils/herbal mouthwashes. The evidence for other head‐to‐head comparisons was limited and inconsistent.  
The studies did not provide any information on costs, change in micro‐organisms in the patient's mouth or adverse events such as temporary discolouration, altered taste, allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. The studies did not assess acceptability of the intervention to patients or feasibility of implementation for dentists.  
Authors' conclusions
None of the included studies measured the incidence of infection among dental healthcare providers. The studies measured only reduction in level of bacterial contamination in aerosols. None of the studies evaluated viral or fungal contamination. We have only low to very low certainty for all findings. We are unable to draw conclusions regarding whether there is a role for preprocedural mouth rinses in reducing infection risk or the possible superiority of one preprocedural rinse over another. Studies are needed that measure the effect of rinses on infectious disease risk among dental healthcare providers and on contaminated aerosols at larger distances with standardised outcome measurement.

## Plain Title

Can Mouth Rinses Used Before Dental Procedures Reduce the Spread of Germs to Dental Staff?

## Rationale

**What happens during dental treatment?**

When dentists use high-speed tools to clean or drill teeth, they create tiny drops of water and spit that float in the air. These drops are called aerosols and spatter. They can carry germs from a patient's mouth.

**Why is this a problem?**

Dental staff can breathe in these germs or get them in their eyes, nose, or mouth. This can spread diseases like tuberculosis, measles, and other serious illnesses. Germs can also land on surfaces in the dental office.

**What might help?**

Dentists already use protective gear like masks and gloves. They also use special suction tools to remove water and spit. Researchers wanted to know if having patients rinse their mouth before treatment could also help. The idea is that mouth rinse might kill germs in the mouth. This could mean fewer germs in the air during dental work.

**Why study this?**

This study was needed to find out if mouth rinses really work to protect dental staff. Researchers wanted to know which mouth rinses work best.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for studies where patients were randomly assigned to use different mouth rinses. They only included studies done in real dental offices, not in labs.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included 830 people total. These people were between 18 and 70 years old. They were dental patients getting treatments that use high-speed tools.

**What did researchers compare?**

They compared different mouth rinses to each other. They also compared mouth rinses to plain water or to no rinsing at all. The mouth rinses tested included:
- Chlorhexidine (a germ-killing rinse)
- Cetylpyridinium chloride (another germ-killing rinse)
- Essential oils or herbal rinses
- Boric acid rinse

**How long did the study last?**

Each person was only in the study for one dental visit.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

The studies did not measure whether dental staff actually got sick less often. Instead, they measured germs in the air during dental work. They counted germs that landed on special plates placed around the dental chair.

**Did mouth rinses reduce germs?**

Some mouth rinses may reduce germs in the air:
- Chlorhexidine may work better than water or no rinsing
- Cetylpyridinium chloride may work better than water or no rinsing
- Essential oils, herbal rinses, and boric acid may work better than water
- Warm mouth rinses may work better than cold ones
- Chlorhexidine may work better than essential oils or herbal rinses

However, the evidence is weak. The studies were small and had problems with how they were done.

**What didn't the studies tell us?**

The studies did not measure:
- Whether dental staff got sick less often
- Viruses or fungi in the air (only bacteria)
- Cost of using mouth rinses
- Side effects like tooth staining or bad taste
- Whether patients liked using the rinses
- Whether dentists found them easy to use

**What do the results mean?**

We cannot say for sure if mouth rinses protect dental staff from getting sick. We also cannot say which mouth rinse works best. The studies only showed that some rinses reduce bacteria counts in the air. But we don't know if this reduction is enough to prevent disease.

**What is needed next?**

Better studies are needed. These studies should measure whether dental staff actually get sick less often. They should also measure germs farther from the dental chair and use the same methods to make results easier to compare.",10.1002-14651858.CD013826,"Does use of mouth rinse before a dental procedure reduce the risk of infection transmission from patient to health professional? 
Why is this question important? 
Many dental procedures generate droplets that settle on a surface quickly. If high‐speed instruments, such as a drill, are used, aerosols are generated, which consist of tiny particles that remain suspended in the air and that can be inhaled or that settle farther away on surfaces. These aerosols contain a variety of micro‐organisms and may transmit infections either through direct contact or indirectly through the contaminated surfaces. To prevent the spread of infection, it may help to reduce the number of micro‐organisms that are present in these aerosols. The use of mouth rinses before a dental procedure ('preprocedural mouth rinse') has been suggested as a possible way to reduce the amount of contamination of these aerosols. Chlorhexidine, povidone iodine and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) are some of the commonly used mouth rinses. They act by killing or inactivating the micro‐organisms in the mouth and thereby reducing the level of contamination in the aerosol that is generated. We wanted to find out whether rinsing the mouth before a dental procedure reduces the contamination of aerosols produced during dental procedures in practice and helps prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
We searched for all relevant studies that compared mouth rinses used before dental procedures against placebo (fake treatment), no intervention or another mouth rinse considered to be inactive. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed our confidence in the evidence. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find? 
We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies used chlorhexidine, CPC, essential oil/herbal mouth rinses, povidone iodine and boric acid in comparison to no rinsing, or rinsing with water, saline (salt water) or another mouth rinse. None of the studies measured the how often dental healthcare providers became infected with micro‐organisms. All the included studies measured the level of bacterial contamination in droplets or aerosols in the dental clinic. They did not examine contamination with viruses or fungi.  
Most rinses decreased bacterial contamination in aerosols to some extent, but there was considerable variation in the effects and we do not know what size of reduction is necessary to reduce infection risk.  
The studies did not provide any information on costs, change in micro‐organisms in the patient's mouth or side effects such as temporary discolouration, altered taste, allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. The studies did not assess whether patients were happy to use a mouth rinse or whether it was easy for dentists to implement.  
Overall, the results suggest that using a preprocedural mouth rinse may reduce the level of bacterial contamination in aerosols compared with no rinsing or rinsing with water, but we have only low or very low certainty that the evidence is reliable and we do not know how this reduction in contamination relates to the risk of infection. 
What does this mean? 
We have very little confidence in the evidence, and further studies may change the findings of our review. No studies measured infection risk or investigated viral or fungal contamination.  
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to February 2022.

Behavioural activation is a brief psychotherapeutic approach that seeks to change the way a person interacts with their environment. Behavioural activation is increasingly receiving attention as a potentially cost‐effective intervention for depression, which may require less resources and may be easier to deliver and implement than other types of psychotherapy. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with other psychological therapies for depression in adults. 
To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with medication for depression in adults. 
To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with treatment as usual/waiting list/placebo no treatment for depression in adults. 
Search methods
We searched CCMD‐CTR (all available years), CENTRAL (current issue), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 onwards), Ovid EMBASE (1980 onwards), and Ovid PsycINFO (1806 onwards) on the 17 January 2020 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 'behavioural activation', or the main elements of behavioural activation for depression in participants with clinically diagnosed depression or subthreshold depression. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language or publication status to the searches. We searched international trials registries via the World Health Organization's trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural activation for the treatment of depression or symptoms of depression in adults aged 18 or over. We excluded RCTs conducted in inpatient settings and with trial participants selected because of a physical comorbidity. Studies were included regardless of reported outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened all titles/abstracts and full‐text manuscripts for inclusion. Data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments were also performed by two review authors in duplicate. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for more information. 
Main results
Fifty‐three studies with 5495 participants were included; 51 parallel group RCTs and two cluster‐RCTs. 
We found moderate‐certainty evidence that behavioural activation had greater short‐term efficacy than treatment as usual (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 1.78; 7 RCTs, 1533 participants), although this difference was no longer evident in sensitivity analyses using a worst‐case or intention‐to‐treat scenario. Compared with waiting list, behavioural activation may be more effective, but there were fewer data in this comparison and evidence was of low certainty (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.90 to 5.09; 1 RCT, 26 participants). No evidence on treatment efficacy was available for behavioural activation versus placebo and behavioural activation versus no treatment. 
We found moderate‐certainty evidence suggesting no evidence of a difference in short‐term treatment efficacy between behavioural activation and CBT (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.07; 5 RCTs, 601 participants). Fewer data were available for other comparators. No evidence of a difference in short term‐efficacy was found between behavioural activation and third‐wave CBT (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.33; 2 RCTs, 98 participants; low certainty), and psychodynamic therapy (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.99; 1 RCT,60 participants; very low certainty). Behavioural activation was more effective than humanistic therapy (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.95; 2 RCTs, 46 participants; low certainty) and medication (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.76; 1 RCT; 141 participants; moderate certainty), but both of these results were based on a small number of trials and participants. No evidence on treatment efficacy was available for comparisons between behavioural activation versus interpersonal, cognitive analytic, and integrative therapies. 
There was moderate‐certainty evidence that behavioural activation might have lower treatment acceptability (based on dropout rate) than treatment as usual in the short term, although the data did not confirm a difference and results lacked precision (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.31; 14 RCTs, 2518 participants). Moderate‐certainty evidence did not suggest any difference in short‐term acceptability between behavioural activation and waiting list (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.93; 8 RCTs. 359 participants), no treatment (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.09; 3 RCTs, 187 participants), medication (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.16; 2 RCTs, 243 participants), or placebo (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.67; 1 RCT; 96 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No evidence on treatment acceptability was available comparing behavioural activation versus psychodynamic therapy. 
Low‐certainty evidence did not show a difference in short‐term treatment acceptability (dropout rate) between behavioural activation and CBT (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.25; 12 RCTs, 1195 participants), third‐wave CBT (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.10; 3 RCTs, 147 participants); humanistic therapy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.20 to 5.55; 2 RCTs, 96 participants) (very low certainty), and interpersonal, cognitive analytic, and integrative therapy (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.20; 4 RCTs, 123 participants). 
Results from medium‐ and long‐term primary outcomes, secondary outcomes, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses are summarised in the text. 
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review suggests that behavioural activation may be more effective than humanistic therapy, medication, and treatment as usual, and that it may be no less effective than CBT, psychodynamic therapy, or being placed on a waiting list. However, our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. 
We found no evidence of a difference in short‐term treatment acceptability (based on dropouts) between behavioural activation and most comparison groups (CBT, humanistic therapy, waiting list, placebo, medication, no treatment or treatment as usual). Again, our confidence in all these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. 
No data were available about the efficacy of behavioural activation compared with placebo, or about treatment acceptability comparing behavioural activation and psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal, cognitive analytic and integrative therapies. 
The evidence could be strengthened by better reporting and better quality RCTs of behavioural activation and by assessing working mechanisms of behavioural activation. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Behavioral Activation as a Treatment for Depression

## Plain Title

Does behavioral activation help adults with depression compared to other treatments?

## Rationale

**What is depression and why does it matter?**

Depression is a common mental health problem. It makes people feel very sad and tired. People with depression often lose interest in things they used to enjoy. Depression can make it hard to work, spend time with family, or do daily tasks.

**What is behavioral activation?**

Behavioral activation is a type of talk therapy. It helps people change how they interact with the world around them. The goal is to help people do more activities that make them feel good. This therapy is shorter than many other treatments. It may cost less money and be easier for doctors to provide.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need to know which treatments work best for depression. Behavioral activation might be a good option because it is simpler to deliver than other therapies. Researchers wanted to compare behavioral activation to other common treatments. This would help doctors choose the best treatment for their patients.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at 53 different studies done by other scientists. These studies included 5,495 adults with depression. All participants were 18 years old or older.

The researchers compared behavioral activation to many different treatments:
- Other types of talk therapy
- Medicine for depression
- Usual care from doctors
- Waiting lists (no treatment yet)
- Placebo (fake treatment)

The researchers looked at two main questions:
1. Did behavioral activation help reduce depression?
2. Did people stay in treatment or drop out?

The original studies lasted different amounts of time. Some were short term (a few weeks). Others followed people for many months.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**Compared to usual care:**
Behavioral activation worked better than usual care from doctors in the short term. However, when researchers looked more closely at the data, this difference was less clear.

**Compared to other talk therapies:**
Behavioral activation worked about the same as CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy). This is another common talk therapy for depression. Behavioral activation worked better than humanistic therapy. The researchers found limited information about other types of therapy.

**Compared to medicine:**
Behavioral activation worked better than medicine in one small study. But more research is needed to be sure.

**Compared to waiting lists:**
Behavioral activation might work better than being on a waiting list. But there was not enough information to be certain.

**Did people stay in treatment?**
About the same number of people dropped out of behavioral activation as other treatments. This suggests people found it as acceptable as other options.

**What are the main conclusions?**

Behavioral activation may help people with depression. It appears to work as well as CBT. It might work better than usual care, humanistic therapy, and medicine. However, the researchers were not completely confident in these findings.

More high-quality studies are needed. Future research should use better methods and clearer reporting. Scientists also need to understand exactly how behavioral activation helps people get better.

**Why does this matter for patients?**

This research suggests behavioral activation could be a good treatment choice for depression. It may be easier to access than other therapies. It might require fewer resources to provide. This could help more people get treatment for depression.

However, patients should talk to their doctors about all treatment options. The best treatment depends on each person's individual needs.",10.1002-14651858.CD013305,"Behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults
Review question 
In this Cochrane review, we wanted to find out how well behavioural activation therapy works for depression in adults. 
Why this is important 
Depression is a common mental health problem that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in people, activities, and things that were once enjoyable. A person with depression may feel tearful, irritable, or tired most of the time, and may have problems with sleep, concentration, and memory. These and other symptoms can make daily life more difficult than usual. 
Treatments for depression include medications (antidepressants) and psychological therapies (talking therapies). Behavioural activation is a type of psychological therapy that encourages a person to develop or get back into activities which are meaningful to them. The therapy involved scheduling activities and monitoring behaviours and looking at specific situations where changing these behaviours and activities may be helpful. A therapist may support people in person, over the phone, or online, usually over multiple sessions. 
It is important to know whether behavioural activation could be an effective and acceptable treatment to offer to people with depression. 
What we did 
In January 2020, we searched for studies of behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults (aged over 18 years). We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which treatments were given to study participants at random; these studies give the most reliable evidence. 
We included 53 studies involving 5495 participants. The studies compared behavioural activation with no treatment, standard or usual care, a dummy treatment (placebo), taking medications, being on a waiting list for treatment, or other psychotherapies (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), third‐wave CBT, humanistic therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and integrative therapy). 
The studies were conducted in 14 countries; most were conducted in the USA (27 studies). Most studies lasted from four to 16 weeks. 
The outcomes we focussed on were how well the treatments worked and whether they were acceptable to participants. How well treatments worked (efficacy) was measured by the number of people who responded well to treatment or no longer met criteria for depression at the end of treatment. Acceptability was measured by counting how many people dropped out during the study. 
What did we find? 
Behavioural activation may treat depression better than receiving usual care. We were uncertain whether behavioural activation worked better than medication or being on a waiting list, and we found no evidence for this outcome comparing behavioural activation to no treatment or placebo treatment. 
We found no differences between behavioural activation and CBT in treating depression. Although we did not find enough evidence to compare behavioural activation reliably with other psychotherapies, it may work better than humanistic therapy, and we found no differences between behavioural activation and third‐wave CBT or psychodynamic therapy. No evidence was available comparing behavioural activation to integrative therapies. 
Behavioural activation is probably less acceptable to people than usual care. We found no differences in acceptability of behavioural activation compared with being on a waiting list, no treatment, taking antidepressants, or receiving a placebo treatment. We also found no differences in acceptability between behavioural activation and other psychotherapies studied (CBT, third‐wave CBT, humanistic therapy, integrative therapies). For behavioural activation compared with psychodynamic therapy, we found no evidence on treatment acceptability. 
Conclusions 
Behavioural activation may be an effective and acceptable treatment for depression in adults. Offering this therapy in practice would give people with depression greater treatment choice, and different formats and types of delivery could be explored to meet the demand for mental health support. Our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. 
Most findings were short‐term, meaning that we cannot be sure behavioural activation would be helpful to people with depression in the longer term. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence is mostly low to moderate. Some findings are based on only a few studies, with poorly reported results, in which the participants knew which treatment they received. Therefore, we are not sure how reliable the results are. Our conclusions may change if more studies are conducted.

Major depressive disorders have a significant impact on children and adolescents, including on educational and vocational outcomes, interpersonal relationships, and physical and mental health and well‐being. There is an association between major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. Antidepressant medication is used in moderate to severe depression; there is now a range of newer generations of these medications. 
Objectives
To investigate, via network meta‐analysis (NMA), the comparative effectiveness and safety of different newer generation antidepressants in children and adolescents with a diagnosed major depressive disorder (MDD) in terms of depression, functioning, suicide‐related outcomes and other adverse outcomes. The impact of age, treatment duration, baseline severity, and pharmaceutical industry funding was investigated on clinician‐rated depression (CDRS‐R) and suicide‐related outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR)), together with Ovid Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO till March 2020. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of six to 18 year olds of either sex and any ethnicity with clinically diagnosed major depressive disorder were included. Trials that compared the effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants with each other or with a placebo were included. Newer generation antidepressants included: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors; norepinephrine dopamine disinhibitors (NDDIs); and tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs). 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We analysed dichotomous data as Odds Ratios (ORs), and continuous data as Mean Difference (MD) for the following outcomes: depression symptom severity (clinician rated), response or remission of depression symptoms, depression symptom severity (self‐rated), functioning, suicide related outcomes and overall adverse outcomes. Random‐effects network meta‐analyses were conducted in a frequentist framework using multivariate meta‐analysis. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Confidence in Network Meta‐analysis (CINeMA). We used ""informative statements"" to standardise the interpretation and description of the results. 
Main results
Twenty‐six studies were included. There were no data for the two primary outcomes (depressive disorder established via clinical diagnostic interview and suicide), therefore, the results comprise only secondary outcomes. Most antidepressants may be associated with a ""small and unimportant"" reduction in depression symptoms on the CDRS‐R scale (range 17 to 113) compared with placebo (high certainty evidence: paroxetine: MD ‐1.43, 95% CI ‐3.90, 1.04; vilazodone: MD ‐0.84, 95% CI ‐3.03, 1.35; desvenlafaxine MD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐3.51, 3.36; moderate certainty evidence: sertraline: MD ‐3.51, 95% CI ‐6.99, ‐0.04; fluoxetine: MD ‐2.84, 95% CI ‐4.12, ‐1.56; escitalopram: MD ‐2.62, 95% CI ‐5.29, 0.04; low certainty evidence: duloxetine: MD ‐2.70, 95% CI ‐5.03, ‐0.37; vortioxetine: MD 0.60, 95% CI ‐2.52, 3.72; very low certainty evidence for comparisons between other antidepressants and placebo). 
There were ""small and unimportant"" differences between most antidepressants in reduction of depression symptoms (high‐ or moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Results were similar across other outcomes of benefit.
In most studies risk of self‐harm or suicide was an exclusion criterion for the study. Proportions of suicide‐related outcomes were low for most included studies and 95% confidence intervals were wide for all comparisons. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of mirtazapine (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.03, 8.04), duloxetine (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.72, 1.82), vilazodone (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.68, 1.48), desvenlafaxine (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.59, 1.52), citalopram (OR 1.72, 95% CI 0.76, 3.87) or vortioxetine (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.29, 8.60) on suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo. There is low certainty evidence that escitalopram may ""at least slightly"" reduce odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.43, 1.84). There is low certainty evidence that fluoxetine (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87, 1.86), paroxetine (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.85, 3.86), sertraline (OR 3.03, 95% CI 0.60, 15.22), and venlafaxine (OR 13.84, 95% CI 1.79, 106.90) may ""at least slightly"" increase odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo. 
There is moderate certainty evidence that venlafaxine probably results in an ""at least slightly"" increased odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with desvenlafaxine (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01, 0.56) and escitalopram (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01, 0.56). There was very low certainty evidence regarding other comparisons between antidepressants. 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, methodological shortcomings of the randomised trials make it difficult to interpret the findings with regard to the efficacy and safety of newer antidepressant medications. Findings suggest that most newer antidepressants may reduce depression symptoms in a small and unimportant way compared with placebo. Furthermore, there are likely to be small and unimportant differences in the reduction of depression symptoms between the majority of antidepressants. However, our findings reflect the average effects of the antidepressants, and given depression is a heterogeneous condition, some individuals may experience a greater response. Guideline developers and others making recommendations might therefore consider whether a recommendation for the use of newer generation antidepressants is warranted for some individuals in some circumstances. Our findings suggest sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine, as well as fluoxetine (which is currently the only treatment recommended for first‐line prescribing) could be considered as a first option. 
Children and adolescents considered at risk of suicide were frequently excluded from trials, so that we cannot be confident about the effects of these medications for these individuals. If an antidepressant is being considered for an individual, this should be done in consultation with the child/adolescent and their family/caregivers and it remains critical to ensure close monitoring of treatment effects and suicide‐related outcomes (combined suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) in those treated with newer generation antidepressants, given findings that some of these medications may be associated with greater odds of these events. Consideration of psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy, as per guideline recommendations, remains important. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Antidepressant Medications for Children and Teenagers with Depression

## Plain Title

Do newer antidepressant medications help children and teenagers with depression?

## Rationale

**What is depression and why does it matter?**

Depression is a serious mental health problem. It affects how young people feel, think, and act. Children and teenagers with depression may feel very sad or lose interest in things they used to enjoy.

Depression can harm many parts of a young person's life. It can affect their school work. It can damage their friendships. It can hurt their physical and mental health. Some young people with depression think about suicide or try to harm themselves.

**What are antidepressants?**

Doctors sometimes prescribe antidepressant medications for moderate to severe depression. These are medicines that may help reduce depression symptoms. There are many newer types of these medications available today.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to find out which newer antidepressants work best for young people. They also wanted to know if these medications are safe. This information helps doctors, young people, and families make better treatment choices.

The study looked at many different antidepressant medications. These included medications like fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and others.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at 26 different studies that had already been done. They combined the results to compare different medications.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included children and teenagers aged 6 to 18 years old. These young people had been diagnosed with major depression by a doctor. The studies included both boys and girls from different backgrounds.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared newer antidepressant medications with each other. They also compared these medications with placebo. A placebo is a pill that looks like medicine but contains no active medication.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at several things:
- How severe depression symptoms were
- Whether young people got better
- How well they could function in daily life
- Suicide-related thoughts and behaviors
- Side effects from the medications

## Results

**What did the study find about depression symptoms?**

Most antidepressants reduced depression symptoms only a small amount compared with placebo. The reduction was so small it may not make a meaningful difference in daily life.

The researchers used a scale from 17 to 113 to measure depression. Most medications lowered scores by only 1 to 4 points. This is a very small change.

Different antidepressants were mostly similar to each other. There were only small differences between them in how well they worked.

**What about suicide-related outcomes?**

This is an important concern for families and doctors. However, many studies did not include young people who were at high risk for suicide. This makes it hard to know how safe these medications are for those most at risk.

The number of suicide-related events was low in most studies. Some medications may slightly increase the risk of suicide-related thoughts or behaviors. These included fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine.

Other medications may slightly decrease this risk or have no clear effect. However, the evidence is uncertain.

**What do these results mean?**

The researchers found it hard to draw clear conclusions. Many studies had problems with how they were done. This makes the results difficult to interpret.

On average, newer antidepressants may help reduce depression symptoms a small amount. However, some individual young people might benefit more than others. Depression affects people differently.

**Which medications might be considered first?**

Based on this research, doctors might consider sertraline, escitalopram, or duloxetine as first options. Fluoxetine is currently the most recommended medication for young people.

**Important safety message**

If a young person takes an antidepressant, they need close monitoring. Doctors should watch carefully for changes in symptoms and any suicide-related thoughts or behaviors.

Talking therapy, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, remains an important treatment option. Families should discuss all treatment choices with their doctor.

**Final thoughts**

Treatment decisions should involve the young person, their family, and their doctor. Each person is different and may respond differently to treatment.",10.1002-14651858.CD013674,"Newer generation antidepressants for depression in children and adolescents: a network meta‐analysis 
How well do newer formulations of antidepressants work for children and adolescents with clinical depression? 
Children and adolescents (6 to 18 years) with depression (also called ‘major depressive disorder’) experience a range of negative impacts in all areas of their lives and have an increased risk of suicide, suicidal thinking and suicide attempts. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression, but can also increase the risk of suicide‐related outcomes. 
Who will be interested in this research? 
The research in this Cochrane Review will interest:
‐ people who decide policy, and influence decisions about the prescription of antidepressant medicines to children and adolescents; 
‐ people who prescribe these medicines to children and adolescents;
‐ children and adolescents with depression; and
‐ those who support and care for them (including their parents and caregivers and clinicians who provide treatment). 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how well newer formulations (called ‘new generation’) antidepressants work to improve depression in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years. New generation antidepressants are those that have been developed recently. They are sometimes referred to as ‘second‐‘ and ‘third‐generation’ antidepressants; they do not include older formulations (tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors). 
We wanted to know how these antidepressants affect:
‐ symptoms of depression;
‐ recovery: no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder;
‐ response or remission: scores on a scale indicating an important reduction in depression or no longer experiencing depression; 
‐ ability to function in daily life;
‐ suicide‐related outcomes; and
‐ whether they cause any unwanted effects in children and adolescents.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that tested new generation antidepressants on children or adolescents (or both) who had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. We identified 26 such studies. We then assessed the trustworthiness of those studies, and synthesized the findings across the studies. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
Most newer antidepressants probably reduce depression symptoms better than a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain any medicine but looks identical to the medicine being tested). However, the reduction is small and may not be experienced as important by children and adolescents, their parents and caregivers, or clinicians. When different medications are compared against each other, there may be only small and unimportant differences between most of them for the reduction of symptoms. 
Our findings reflect what happens on average to individuals, but some individuals may experience a greater response. This might lead to recommendations being made for the use of antidepressants for some individuals in some circumstances. Our findings suggest that sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine and fluoxetine can be used if medication is being considered. 
The impact of medication on depression symptoms should be closely monitored by those prescribing the medication, especially as suicide‐related thinking and behaviour may be increased in those taking these medications. Close monitoring of suicide‐related behaviours is vital in those treated with new generation antidepressants. 
What should happen next? 
The studies that provided this evidence largely excluded children and adolescents who: 
‐ were already thinking about suicide and wanting to take their own lives (i.e. had suicidal ideation); 
‐ were self‐harming;
‐ had other mental health conditions; and
‐ had psychosocial difficulties.
Future research should aim to understand the impacts of these medicines in children and adolescents with these problems, who are more typical of those who request clinical services.

Medications used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have significantly improved patient outcomes and delayed time to surgery. However, some of these therapies are recognized to increase the general risk of infection and have an unclear impact on postoperative infection risk. 
Objectives
To assess the impact of IBD medications on postoperative infection risk within 30 days of surgery. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane IBD Groups Specialized Register (29 October 2019), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2019), EMBASE (January 1985 to October 2019), the Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception up to October 2019 and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials, quasi‐randomized controlled trials, non‐randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies, case‐control studies and cross‐sectional studies comparing patients treated with an IBD medication preoperatively or within 30 days postoperatively to patients who were not taking that medication. Manuscripts and abstracts were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts and extracted data. The primary outcome was postoperative infection within 30 days of surgery. Secondary outcomes included incisional infections and wound dehiscence, intra‐abdominal infectious complications and extra‐abdominal infections. Three authors assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle‐Ottawa scale. We contacted authors for additional information when data were missing. For the primary and secondary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using the generic inverse variance method. When applicable, we analyzed adjusted and unadjusted data separately. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. 
Main results
Sixty‐eight non‐randomized studies were included. Twenty‐four studies had low risk of bias while the remaining had very high risk. Based on pooling of adjusted data, overall infectious complications were increased in patients who received anti‐TNF agents (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.13; very low certainty evidence) and corticosteroids (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.38 to 2.09; low certainty evidence). Use of 5‐ASA (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.14; very low certainty evidence), immunomodulators (OR 1.29; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.76; low certainty evidence) and anti‐integrin agents (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.36; low certainty evidence) had no impact on overall infectious complications. No difference in the odds of wound‐related complications was seen in patients using corticosteroids, 5‐ASA, immunomodulators, anti‐TNF or anti‐integrin agents when compared to controls. Both corticosteroids and anti‐TNF agents increased odds of intra‐abdominal infection (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.28 to 1.84; very low certainty evidence and OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.82; very low certainty evidence, respectively) whereas no impact was observed with 5‐ASA, immunomodulators or anti‐integrin agents. The rate of extra‐abdominal infections was not affected by corticosteroids, immunomodulators, anti‐TNF or anti‐integrin agents. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence regarding corticosteroids, 5ASA, immunomodulators, anti‐TNF mediations and anti‐integrin medications was low or very low in certainty. Thus, the impact of these medications on postoperative infectious complications is uncertain and no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding their safety in the perioperative period. Decisions regarding preoperative IBD medications should be tailored to each patient’s unique circumstances. Future studies should focus on controlling for potential confounding factors to generate higher quality evidence.

## Plain Title
Do Medicines for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Increase the Risk of Infections After Surgery?

## Rationale

**What is inflammatory bowel disease?**
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition where parts of the gut become swollen and damaged. This causes pain, diarrhea, and other problems that make daily life hard for patients.

**What medicines treat IBD?**
Doctors use several types of medicines to treat IBD. These medicines help patients feel better and can delay the need for surgery. The medicines include:
- Steroids (also called corticosteroids)
- 5-ASA medicines
- Immunomodulators (medicines that change how the immune system works)
- Anti-TNF agents (medicines that block a protein causing swelling)
- Anti-integrin agents (newer medicines that stop certain cells from causing damage)

**Why was this study needed?**
Some IBD medicines work by lowering the body's immune response. This helps reduce gut swelling. However, a weaker immune system might make it harder to fight infections. When IBD patients need surgery, doctors worry these medicines might increase the chance of infections after the operation. This study looked at whether taking IBD medicines before or after surgery increases infection risk within 30 days of the operation.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at 68 earlier studies done by other scientists. They combined the results to see overall patterns. The studies included patients of different ages and genders who had IBD and needed surgery. The researchers looked at whether patients took IBD medicines before surgery or within 30 days after surgery. They compared infection rates between patients who took these medicines and patients who did not.

**What did researchers measure?**
The main goal was to count infections within 30 days after surgery. They also looked at specific types of infections:
- Wound infections (infections at the cut made during surgery)
- Infections inside the belly
- Infections in other parts of the body

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The researchers found that the quality of evidence was low or very low. This means the results are uncertain. Here is what the data showed:

**Steroids:** Patients taking steroids had more infections overall. They also had more infections inside the belly. About 2 patients taking steroids had infections for every 1 patient not taking steroids who had infections.

**Anti-TNF agents:** Patients taking anti-TNF medicines had more infections overall. They also had more infections inside the belly. About 2 patients taking anti-TNF had infections for every 1 patient not taking them who had infections.

**5-ASA medicines:** These medicines did not seem to increase or decrease infection risk.

**Immunomodulators:** These medicines did not clearly change infection risk.

**Anti-integrin agents:** These medicines did not seem to affect infection risk.

**Wound infections:** None of the medicines clearly increased wound infections.

**Infections outside the belly:** None of the medicines increased these infections.

**What do the results mean?**

Because the quality of evidence was low, doctors cannot be certain about how these medicines affect infection risk after surgery. The impact of IBD medicines on infections after surgery remains unclear. Doctors cannot make firm conclusions about whether these medicines are safe or risky around the time of surgery.

**What should doctors do?**

Doctors should make decisions about IBD medicines before surgery based on each patient's specific situation. They should consider the patient's overall health, disease severity, and other factors.

**What is needed next?**

Future studies need better designs. They should account for other factors that might affect infection risk. This would provide clearer answers to help doctors and patients make better decisions.",10.1002-14651858.CD013256,"Infection risk after surgery in patients using medications for inflammatory bowel disease 
Background  
More than 1.2 million individuals in North America are affected by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is a condition that involves inflammation in the large and/or small intestine(s), resulting in symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Many of the medications used to treat IBD suppress the immune system. As a result, use of these medications increases the risk of infection. This increased risk of infection is particularly concerning in patients undergoing surgery. 
Review Question  
This systematic review examined the combined data from 68 previously published studies to determine whether patients using IBD medications around the time of surgery had more infections compared to those not using the same medications. 
Study Characteristics  
This systematic review is current up to 29 October 2019. It included 68 studies in patients with IBD who underwent surgery. Most participants were 18 years or older and both men and women were included. Five IBD medication groups were examined within our study. Infections were tracked up to 30 days after surgery. 
Key Results  
Analyses of this large set of data revealed that infection risk around the time of surgery varied depending on which type of IBD medication the patients were on. Patients being treated with corticosteroids or anti‐TNF agents seemed to have more infections after surgery, while those on 5‐ASA, immunomodulators or anti‐integrin agents did not seem to have more infections after surgery. These findings should be taken with caution as our review included studies which were of limited quality, and therefore we were not able to draw any firm conclusions.These findings could help doctors choose which medications to treat IBD patients with before surgery. Decisions should be tailored to each patient's unique health needs. In addition, this study suggests the need to carefully monitor for infections after surgery in patients who are on certain types of IBD medications.  
Limitations  
One limitation of this systematic review was its dependence on data from a wide range of previously published studies, with various approaches and quality control standards. Most studies examined had very low certainty regarding its conclusions. This review illustrates the need for future high‐quality research examining the impact of medications used to treat IBD on infection risk after surgery.

It is not clear exactly what needs to be done to improve physical activity in the long term, which is what may be required for health benefits. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low, due to difficulties working out exactly what people did in the studies, and also because there were lots of single studies (some quite small) looking at different types of interventions. This means that it was difficult to generalise these findings to all people with COPD. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
What Works Best to Help People with Lung Disease Be More Active?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people have a lung disease called COPD. COPD makes it hard to breathe. People with COPD often feel short of breath. This makes it hard for them to move around and be active.

**Why is being active important?**

Being active is good for everyone's health. It helps keep the body strong. It helps the heart work better. But people with COPD find it very hard to be active. Their breathing problems get in the way.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors want to help people with COPD be more active. But they do not know which ways work best. Many different methods have been tried. This study looked at all the research done so far. The goal was to find out which methods really help.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. The researchers looked at 76 other studies. They did not do new tests on patients. Instead, they gathered results from past studies. This let them see the big picture.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 8,018 people with COPD. The studies looked at both men and women. They included people of different ages. All of them had breathing problems from COPD.

**What did the studies test?**

The studies tested many different ways to help people be more active. Some studies looked at exercise programs. Others looked at counseling about being active. Some tested medicines for COPD. Other studies looked at special diets, oxygen therapy, and surgery. A few even tested singing and muscle stimulation.

**How long did the studies last?**

Different studies lasted different amounts of time. Some were short. Others followed people for longer. Only a few studies checked on people after the program ended.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

Some methods did help people with COPD be more active. Three types of help worked best:
- Exercise training programs
- Counseling about physical activity
- COPD medicines

**How much did activity improve?**

People who got these types of help moved more. Some did 6 to 24 more minutes of activity each day. The activity was at least moderate intensity. This means it made their heart beat faster. Some people walked longer distances. Others took more steps each day.

**What is still unclear?**

The researchers are not sure about some important things. They do not know when these methods work best. They do not know exactly how to use them. Most studies did not follow people for a long time. So we do not know if people stay active after the program ends. Staying active for a long time is what really helps health.

**Why was it hard to compare studies?**

Each study measured activity in different ways. Some counted steps. Others measured minutes of activity. Some measured how far people walked. This made it hard to compare results. Also, studies did not always explain exactly what they did. So it was hard to know which parts of the program helped most.

**What was the quality of the evidence?**

The quality of the evidence was generally low. Many studies were small. Each study looked at different methods. This makes it hard to know if the results apply to all people with COPD. More research is needed with better methods.

**What do these results mean?**

Some methods can help people with COPD be more active. Exercise programs, activity counseling, and COPD medicines show promise. But doctors need more information. They need to know the best way to use these methods. They need to know how to help people stay active for years, not just weeks or months.",10.1002-14651858.CD012626,"What are the most effective ways to encourage people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to be more physically active?

People with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) need treatment with insulin for survival. Whether any particular type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin provides benefit especially regarding risk of diabetes complications and hypoglycaemia is unknown. 
Objectives
To compare the effects of long‐term treatment with (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogues to NPH insulin (neutral protamine Hagedorn) or another (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogue in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We explored the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medical Agency (EMA) web pages. We asked pharmaceutical companies, EMA and investigators for additional data and clinical study reports (CSRs). The date of the last search of all databases was 24 August 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of 24 weeks or more comparing one (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin to NPH insulin or another (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin in people with T1DM. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed risk of bias using the new Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 (RoB 2) tool and extracted data. Our main outcomes were all‐cause mortality, health‐related quality of life (QoL), severe hypoglycaemia, non‐fatal myocardial infarction/stroke (NFMI/NFS), severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia, serious adverse events (SAEs) and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). We used a random‐effects model to perform meta‐analyses and calculated risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and 95% prediction intervals for effect estimates. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence applying the GRADE instrument. 
Main results
We included 26 RCTs. Two studies were unpublished. We obtained CSRs, clinical study synopses or both as well as medical reviews from regulatory agencies on 23 studies which contributed to better analysis of risk of bias and improved data extraction. A total of 8784 participants were randomised: 2428 participants were allocated to NPH insulin, 2889 participants to insulin detemir, 2095 participants to insulin glargine and 1372 participants to insulin degludec. Eight studies contributing 21% of all participants comprised children. The duration of the intervention varied from 24 weeks to 104 weeks. 
Insulin degludec versus NPH insulin: we identified no studies comparing insulin degludec with NPH insulin. 
Insulin detemir versus NPH insulin (9 RCTs): five deaths reported in two studies including adults occurred in the insulin detemir group (Peto OR 4.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 31.38; 9 studies, 3334 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Three studies with 870 participants reported QoL showing no true beneficial or harmful effect for either intervention (low‐certainty evidence). There was a reduction in severe hypoglycaemia in favour of insulin detemir: 171/2019 participants (8.5%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 138/1200 participants (11.5%) in the NPH insulin group experienced severe hypoglycaemia (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.92; 8 studies, 3219 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between 0.34 and 1.39. Only 1/331 participants in the insulin detemir group compared with 0/164 participants in the NPH insulin group experienced a NFMI (1 study, 495 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No study reported NFS. A total of 165/2094 participants (7.9%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 102/1238 participants (8.2%) in the NPH insulin group experienced SAEs (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.21; 9 studies, 3332 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia was observed in 70/1823 participants (3.8%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 60/1102 participants (5.4%) in the NPH insulin group (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.17; 7 studies, 2925 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The MD in HbA1c comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin was 0.01%, 95% CI ‐0.1 to 0.1; 8 studies, 3122 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence. 
Insulin glargine versus NPH insulin (9 RCTs): one adult died in the NPH insulin group (Peto OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.00 to 6.98; 8 studies, 2175 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Four studies with 1013 participants reported QoL showing no true beneficial effect or harmful effect for either intervention (low‐certainty evidence). Severe hypoglycaemia was observed in 122/1191 participants (10.2%) in the insulin glargine group compared with 145/1159 participants (12.5%) in the NPH insulin group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.04; 9 studies, 2350 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No participant experienced a NFMI and one participant in the NPH insulin group experienced a NFS in the single study reporting this outcome (585 participants; low‐certainty evidence). A total of 109/1131 participants (9.6%) in the insulin glargine group compared with 110/1098 participants (10.0%) in the NPH insulin group experienced SAEs (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.84; 8 studies, 2229 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia was observed in 69/938 participants (7.4%) in the insulin glargine group compared with 83/955 participants (8.7%) in the NPH insulin group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.12; 6 studies, 1893 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The MD in HbA1c comparing insulin glargine with NPH insulin was 0.02%, 95% CI ‐0.1 to 0.1; 9 studies, 2285 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence. 
Insulin detemir versus insulin glargine (2 RCTs),insulin degludec versus insulin detemir (2 RCTs), insulin degludec versus insulin glargine (4 RCTs): there was no evidence of a clinically relevant difference for all main outcomes comparing (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogues with each other. 
For all outcomes none of the comparisons indicated differences in tests of interaction for children versus adults. 
Authors' conclusions
Comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin for T1DM showed lower risk of severe hypoglycaemia in favour of insulin detemir (moderate‐certainty evidence). However, the 95% prediction interval indicated inconsistency in this finding. Both insulin detemir and insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin did not show benefits or harms for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia. For all other main outcomes with overall low risk of bias and comparing insulin analogues with each other, there was no true beneficial or harmful effect for any intervention. Data on patient‐important outcomes such as QoL, macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications were sparse or missing. No clinically relevant differences were found between children and adults. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Types of Long-Acting Insulin for People with Type 1 Diabetes

## Plain Title

Comparing long-acting insulin types for people with type 1 diabetes

## Rationale

**What is type 1 diabetes?**

People with type 1 diabetes cannot make their own insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use sugar from food. Without insulin, people with type 1 diabetes cannot survive. They must take insulin every day.

**What types of insulin are there?**

There are different types of insulin. Some work quickly. Others work slowly over many hours. These slow types are called long-acting insulins. They help control blood sugar all day and night.

The older long-acting insulin is called NPH insulin. Newer types are called insulin analogues. These include insulin detemir, insulin glargine, and insulin degludec.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need to know which long-acting insulin works best. They want to know which one:
- Keeps blood sugar levels steady
- Causes fewer problems
- Helps people feel better
- Prevents diabetes complications

Low blood sugar (called hypoglycemia) is a serious problem. It can happen when insulin works too well. Severe low blood sugar can be dangerous. It can cause confusion, passing out, or seizures.

The researchers wanted to find out if newer insulin types work better than NPH insulin. They also wanted to compare the newer types with each other.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

The researchers looked at 26 studies done by other scientists. These studies tested different long-acting insulins. The studies included 8,784 people total.

**Who was in these studies?**

- Adults and children with type 1 diabetes
- About 1 in 5 people in the studies were children
- Both males and females

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared:
- Insulin detemir versus NPH insulin (9 studies)
- Insulin glargine versus NPH insulin (9 studies)
- Insulin detemir versus insulin glargine (2 studies)
- Insulin degludec versus insulin detemir (2 studies)
- Insulin degludec versus insulin glargine (4 studies)

**How long did the studies last?**

People stayed in the studies for 24 weeks to 104 weeks. Most studies lasted about 6 months to 2 years.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**Insulin detemir compared to NPH insulin:**

Insulin detemir reduced severe low blood sugar events. About 9 out of 100 people using insulin detemir had severe low blood sugar. About 12 out of 100 people using NPH insulin had this problem.

However, results varied between studies. Some studies showed bigger differences than others.

Both insulins controlled blood sugar levels about the same. They had similar rates of serious health problems. Low blood sugar at night happened at similar rates with both insulins.

Quality of life was similar with both insulins.

**Insulin glargine compared to NPH insulin:**

Insulin glargine and NPH insulin worked about the same. They had similar rates of:
- Severe low blood sugar (about 10 to 13 out of 100 people)
- Low blood sugar at night
- Serious health problems
- Blood sugar control

Quality of life was similar with both insulins.

**Comparing newer insulins to each other:**

When researchers compared the newer insulins to each other, they found no major differences. All the newer types worked about the same.

**Did insulins work differently in children versus adults?**

No. The insulins worked the same way in children and adults.

**What was missing from these studies?**

The studies did not have much information about:
- Quality of life
- Long-term diabetes complications like heart disease
- Kidney or eye problems from diabetes

**What do these results mean?**

Insulin detemir may cause less severe low blood sugar than NPH insulin. But this finding was not consistent across all studies.

For most other outcomes, the different long-acting insulins worked about the same. People using any of these insulins had similar blood sugar control and similar rates of problems.

More research is needed to understand long-term effects. Doctors and patients should discuss which insulin might work best for each person.",10.1002-14651858.CD013498,"Do people with type 1 diabetes mellitus benefit from using a different type of insulin as their basal insulin? 
Background 
Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar (glucose) level to become too high. Insulin is a hormone that is released by the pancreas (a small organ behind the stomach) which controls the blood levels of glucose. In people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) the pancreas does not produce any insulin, so the person has to inject insulin to control the glucose levels and keep well. The goal of insulin therapy is to provide insulin that mimics physiologic insulin secretion. Insulin is given by an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) by means of insulin syringes, insulin pens or insulin pumps. In order to control blood glucose levels in periods of fasting, basal or background insulin is needed. Basal insulin can be given by means of daily or twice‐daily injections of an intermediate‐acting or (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin. Basal insulin can be given as intermediate‐acting human neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or as (ultra‐)long‐acting analogue insulin (synthetic insulin). Bolus insulin is taken at mealtime (prandial insulin) to control blood glucose levels following a meal and is given by means of short‐acting or rapid‐acting insulin. The aim for most people with T1DM is to achieve near‐normal blood glucose levels to avoid long‐term complications such as kidney and eye disease and to allow flexibility regarding time, type and amount of food intake. The major unwanted effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) which can be severe. 
We wanted to find out whether one type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin compared with NPH insulin or another type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin is better for people with T1DM. The outcomes we were specifically interested in were death, health‐related quality of life, severe (night‐time) hypoglycaemia, serious unwanted events, non‐fatal complications of diabetes (heart attacks, strokes) and levels of glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) which is an indicator of long‐term glucose control. 
What did we look for? 
We searched medical databases and contacted pharmaceutical manufacturers and drug regulatory agencies for studies that:— were randomised controlled trials (medical studies where participants are put randomly into one of the treatment groups);— included people with T1DM;— compared one (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin with another (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin or NPH insulin;— lasted at least 24 weeks. 
What did we find?We found 26 studies including a total of 8780 participants (21% were children). The studies lasted between 24 weeks and two years. They compared:— NPH insulin with insulin detemir (nine studies);— NPH insulin with insulin glargine (nine studies);— Insulin detemir with insulin glargine (two studies);— Insulin degludec with insulin detemir (two studies);— Insulin degludec with insulin glargine (four studies). 
No study compared NPH insulin with insulin degludec.
Key results 
There were no clear differences for all main outcomes comparing (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogues with each other. 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reduced with insulin detemir: among 1000 participants using NPH insulin, 115 would experience severe hypoglycaemia; using insulin detemir there would be 36 participants fewer (9 to 55 participants fewer) experiencing severe hypoglycaemia. However, the results were inconsistent, meaning if another study was performed there may not be a clear difference between insulin detemir and NPH insulin. There was no clear difference regarding the risk of severe night‐time hypoglycaemia. There were no clear differences for health‐related quality of life, serious unwanted effects or HbA1c levels. Very few people experienced a heart attack or died, and stroke was not reported. 
There were no clear differences comparing insulin glargine with NPH insulin for all main outcomes. Very few people experienced a heart attack, stroke or died. 
There were also no clear differences for all comparisons between children and adults.
Certainty of the evidence In the comparison of the insulin analogues detemir and glargine with NPH insulin, we are moderately confident about the results for death, severe (night‐time) hypoglycaemia, serious unwanted effects and HbA1c levels. We are uncertain about the effects on heart attacks, stroke and health‐related quality of life, mainly because there were only a few studies which did not last long enough to reliably investigate these outcomes.

Intestinal dysbiosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in very preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Dietary supplementation with synbiotics (probiotic micro‐organisms combined with prebiotic oligosaccharides) to modulate the intestinal microbiome has been proposed as a strategy to reduce the risk of NEC and associated mortality and morbidity. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of enteral supplementation with synbiotics (versus placebo or no treatment, or versus probiotics or prebiotics alone) for preventing NEC and associated morbidity and mortality in very preterm or VLBW infants. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, the Maternity and Infant Care database and CINAHL, from earliest records to 17 June 2021. We searched clinical trials databases and conference proceedings, and examined the reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing prophylactic synbiotics supplementation with placebo or no synbiotics in very preterm (< 32 weeks' gestation) or very low birth weight (< 1500 g) infants. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors separately performed the screening and selection process,  evaluated risk of bias of the trials, extracted data, and synthesised effect estimates using risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), and mean difference, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the level of certainty for effects on NEC, all‐cause mortality, late‐onset invasive infection, and neurodevelopmental impairment. 
Main results
We included six trials in which a total of 925 infants participated. Most trials were small (median sample size 200). Lack of clarity on methods used to conceal allocation and mask caregivers or investigators were potential sources of bias in four of the trials. The studied synbiotics preparations contained lactobacilli or bifidobacteria (or both) combined with fructo‐ or galacto‐oligosaccharides (or both).  
Meta‐analyses suggested that synbiotics may reduce the risk of NEC (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.40; RD 70 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 100 fewer to 40 fewer; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 14, 95% CI 10 to 25; six trials (907 infants); low certainty evidence); and all‐cause mortality prior to hospital discharge (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.85; RD 50 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 120 fewer to 100 fewer; NNTB 20, 95% CI 8 to 100; six trials (925 infants); low‐certainty evidence). Synbiotics may have little or no effect on late‐onset invasive infection, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.21; RD 20 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 70 fewer to 30 more; five trials (707 infants); very low‐certainty evidence). None of the trials assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes. In the absence of high levels of heterogeneity, we did not undertake any subgroup analysis (including the type of feeding). 
Authors' conclusions
The available trial data provide only low‐certainty evidence about the effects of synbiotics on the risk of NEC and associated morbidity and mortality for very preterm or very low birth weight infants. Our confidence in the effect estimates is limited; the true effects may be substantially different from these estimates. Large, high‐quality trials would be needed to provide evidence of sufficient validity and applicability to inform policy and practice. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using Synbiotics to Prevent Serious Bowel Disease in Very Premature Babies

## Plain Title
Can giving synbiotics (helpful bacteria plus special sugars) to very premature babies prevent a serious bowel disease?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Very premature babies can develop a serious bowel disease. This disease is called necrotising enterocolitis, or NEC. In NEC, parts of the baby's bowel become damaged and may die. NEC can make babies very sick. Some babies with NEC may die.

**Why does this happen?**

Very premature babies are born before 32 weeks of pregnancy. They may also have very low birth weight (less than 1500 grams, or about 3 pounds). These tiny babies have immature bowels. The balance of bacteria in their bowels may not be healthy. This unhealthy balance may lead to NEC.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to test if synbiotics could help. Synbiotics are a combination of two things:
- Probiotics: helpful bacteria
- Prebiotics: special sugars that feed the helpful bacteria

Researchers thought synbiotics might create a healthier balance of bacteria in the bowel. This might prevent NEC from happening.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need safe ways to protect premature babies from NEC. If synbiotics work, they could save lives. They could also prevent serious health problems.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at six different studies. These studies tested synbiotics in premature babies. The researchers combined the results from all six studies.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included 925 babies total. All babies were either:
- Born very early (before 32 weeks), OR
- Had very low birth weight (less than 1500 grams)

**What did the babies receive?**

Some babies received synbiotics. The synbiotics contained helpful bacteria (lactobacilli or bifidobacteria). They also contained special sugars (fructo-oligosaccharides or galacto-oligosaccharides).

Other babies received a placebo or no treatment. A placebo looks like the real treatment but contains no active ingredients.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies followed babies until they left the hospital.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The studies suggest synbiotics might help premature babies. However, the evidence is not strong.

**Effects on NEC:**
Synbiotics may reduce the risk of NEC. For every 1000 babies treated:
- About 70 fewer babies might develop NEC
- This means treating 14 babies might prevent NEC in 1 baby

**Effects on death:**
Synbiotics may reduce deaths before hospital discharge. For every 1000 babies treated:
- About 50 fewer babies might die
- This means treating 20 babies might prevent 1 death

**Effects on infections:**
Synbiotics may have little effect on serious infections. The evidence is very uncertain.

**Effects on brain development:**
None of the studies looked at brain development. We do not know if synbiotics affect how babies develop.

**What are the limitations?**

The evidence has several problems:
- The studies were small
- Some studies had design problems
- We cannot be very confident in the results
- The true effects might be very different

**What do the results mean?**

The evidence is not strong enough to know for sure if synbiotics work. Doctors cannot yet rely on these results to make treatment decisions.

**What is needed next?**

Larger, better-designed studies are needed. These studies should:
- Include more babies
- Follow babies as they grow
- Use careful research methods
- Look at brain development

Only then will doctors know if synbiotics truly help premature babies.

**Conclusion:**

Synbiotics might help prevent NEC and death in premature babies. However, we need more research to be sure. The current evidence is not strong enough to change how doctors care for premature babies.",10.1002-14651858.CD014067,"Do synbiotics prevent necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm or very low birth weight infants? 
Background 
Very preterm (born more than eight weeks early) and very low birth weight (less than 1.5 kg) infants are at risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis, a severe condition where some of the lining of the infant's bowel becomes inflamed, and the cells of this tissue die. This condition is associated with death, serious infection, and long‐term disability, as well as developmental problems. 
What did we want to find out? 
One way to help prevent necrotising enterocolitis may be to add synbiotics (combinations of probiotic bacteria or yeasts plus non‐digestible sugars to support probiotic growth and colonisation) to milk feeds. We wanted to find out whether synbiotics might benefit very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Our outcomes of interest included necrotising enterocolitis, death from any cause, serious infection, duration of hospitalisation since birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
What did we do? 
For our Cochrane Review, we searched several important databases to identify randomized controlled trials that investigated the use of synbiotics for preventing necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm and very low birth weight infants. We used standard Cochrane methods to conduct our review and perform our analyses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. 
What did we find? 
We found six trials with a total of 925 infant participants. Trials were mostly small, and most had design flaws that might have biased their findings. 
Main results 
Combined analyses showed that giving synbiotics to very preterm or very low birth weight infants may reduce the risk of necrotising enterocolitis and death. Synbiotics may have little or no effect in reducing the risk of serious infection, but the evidence is very uncertain. None of the studies that we identified assessed the effect of synbiotics on disability or developmental outcomes. 
What are the limitations of this evidence? 
Although the evidence from randomised controlled trials can potentially be of high certainty, the methods used in our review's included trials may have introduced biases that exaggerated the benefits of giving synbiotics to very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Also, because most of the trials were small, the effect estimates for some outcomes were imprecise. For these reasons, we graded down the certainty of the evidence. All evidence in our review is of low or very low certainty. 
There is low‐certainty evidence that synbiotics prevent necrotising enterocolitis and death from any cause. There is very low‐certainty evidence that synbiotics may have little or no effect in preventing serious infection. 
How up to date is this evidence?

35,10.1002-14651858.CD013779-abstract.txt,"Background
Evidence from disease epidemics shows that healthcare workers are at risk of developing short‐ and long‐term mental health problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned about the potential negative impact of the COVID‐19 crisis on the mental well‐being of health and social care professionals. Symptoms of mental health problems commonly include depression, anxiety, stress, and additional cognitive and social problems; these can impact on function in the workplace. The mental health and resilience (ability to cope with the negative effects of stress) of frontline health and social care professionals ('frontline workers' in this review) could be supported during disease epidemics by workplace interventions, interventions to support basic daily needs, psychological support interventions, pharmacological interventions, or a combination of any or all of these. 
Objectives
Objective 1: to assess the effects of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. 
Objective 2: to identify barriers and facilitators that may impact on the implementation of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. 
Search methods
On 28 May 2020 we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus databases and WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing. We also searched ongoing trials registers and Google Scholar. We ran all searches from the year 2002 onwards, with no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included studies in which participants were health and social care professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks, categorised as epidemics or pandemics by WHO, from 2002 onwards. For objective 1 we included quantitative evidence from randomised trials, non‐randomised trials, controlled before‐after studies and interrupted time series studies, which investigated the effect of any intervention to support mental health or resilience, compared to no intervention, standard care, placebo or attention control intervention, or other active interventions. For objective 2 we included qualitative evidence from studies that described barriers and facilitators to the implementation of interventions. Outcomes critical to this review were general mental health and resilience. Additional outcomes included psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression or stress; burnout; other mental health disorders; workplace staffing; and adverse events arising from interventions. 
Data collection and analysis
Pairs of review authors independently applied selection criteria to abstracts and full papers, with disagreements resolved through discussion. One review author systematically extracted data, cross‐checked by a second review author. For objective 1, we assessed risk of bias of studies of effectiveness using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. For objective 2, we assessed methodological limitations using either the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) qualitative study tool, for qualitative studies, or WEIRD (Ways of Evaluating Important and Relevant Data) tool, for descriptive studies. We planned meta‐analyses of pairwise comparisons for outcomes if direct evidence were available. Two review authors extracted evidence relating to barriers and facilitators to implementation, organised these around the domains of the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research, and used the GRADE‐CERQual approach to assess confidence in each finding. We planned to produce an overarching synthesis, bringing quantitative and qualitative findings together. 
Main results
We included 16 studies that reported implementation of an intervention aimed at supporting the resilience or mental health of frontline workers during disease outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): 2; Ebola: 9; Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS): 1; COVID‐19: 4). Interventions studied included workplace interventions, such as training, structure and communication (6 studies); psychological support interventions, such as counselling and psychology services (8 studies); and multifaceted interventions (2 studies). 
Objective 1: a mixed‐methods study that incorporated a cluster‐randomised trial, investigating the effect of a work‐based intervention, provided very low‐certainty evidence about the effect of training frontline healthcare workers to deliver psychological first aid on a measure of burnout. 
Objective 2: we included all 16 studies in our qualitative evidence synthesis; we classified seven as qualitative and nine as descriptive studies. We identified 17 key findings from multiple barriers and facilitators reported in studies. We did not have high confidence in any of the findings; we had moderate confidence in six findings and low to very low confidence in 11 findings. We are moderately confident that the following two factors were barriers to intervention implementation: frontline workers, or the organisations in which they worked, not being fully aware of what they needed to support their mental well‐being; and a lack of equipment, staff time or skills needed for an intervention. We are moderately confident that the following three factors were facilitators of intervention implementation: interventions that could be adapted for local needs; having effective communication, both formally and socially; and having positive, safe and supportive learning environments for frontline workers. We are moderately confident that the knowledge or beliefs, or both, that people have about an intervention can act as either barriers or facilitators to implementation of the intervention. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a lack of both quantitative and qualitative evidence from studies carried out during or after disease epidemics and pandemics that can inform the selection of interventions that are beneficial to the resilience and mental health of frontline workers. Alternative sources of evidence (e.g. from other healthcare crises, and general evidence about interventions that support mental well‐being) could therefore be used to inform decision making. When selecting interventions aimed at supporting frontline workers' mental health, organisational, social, personal, and psychological factors may all be important. Research to determine the effectiveness of interventions is a high priority. The COVID‐19 pandemic provides unique opportunities for robust evaluation of interventions. Future studies must be developed with appropriately rigorous planning, including development, peer review and transparent reporting of research protocols, following guidance and standards for best practice, and with appropriate length of follow‐up. Factors that may act as barriers and facilitators to implementation of interventions should be considered during the planning of future research and when selecting interventions to deliver within local settings. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Supporting the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers During Disease Outbreaks

## Plain Title
Can workplace programs and mental health support help healthcare workers cope better during disease outbreaks?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Healthcare workers who care for sick people during disease outbreaks often face high stress. This stress can harm their mental health both during and after the outbreak. Mental health problems can include feeling sad, worried, or overwhelmed. These problems can make it hard for workers to do their jobs well.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

When diseases spread quickly and affect many people, healthcare workers are at the front line. They face extra stress from long hours, fear of getting sick, and seeing many patients suffer. The World Health Organization warned that the COVID-19 crisis could harm the mental health of these workers.

Researchers wanted to find out what kinds of help or programs work best to protect healthcare workers' mental health during outbreaks. They also wanted to know what makes these programs easy or hard to use in real life.

**Why is this study important?**

If we know what helps healthcare workers stay mentally healthy, we can better support them. This means they can continue caring for patients. It also means fewer workers will suffer from mental health problems.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers do this study?**

Researchers looked for studies done during disease outbreaks since 2002. They searched medical databases and research records. They looked for studies about programs that helped healthcare workers cope with stress.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers. These workers cared for patients during disease outbreaks. The outbreaks included SARS, Ebola, MERS, and COVID-19.

**What kinds of programs were tested?**

The programs fell into three groups:
- Workplace programs: training, better communication, and clear work structures
- Mental health support: counseling and psychology services
- Programs that combined different types of help

**How many studies did researchers find?**

They found 16 studies that tested these programs. Most studies just described what happened. Only one study compared a program to no program in a strong way.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found very little strong evidence. Only one study tested a program using a strong research method. That study looked at training healthcare workers to give psychological first aid. The results were unclear about whether this training helped reduce burnout.

**What makes programs work or not work?**

The researchers found several things that affect whether programs succeed:

Things that make programs harder to use:
- Workers and hospitals not knowing what kind of help they need
- Not having enough equipment, time, or trained staff

Things that make programs easier to use:
- Programs that can be changed to fit local needs
- Good communication between workers and managers
- Safe and supportive work environments where workers can learn

One thing can work both ways:
- What people believe about a program can make it easier or harder to use

**What do the results mean?**

There is not enough good research to tell us which programs work best. More research is needed. Until we have better evidence, decision-makers may need to use information from other sources. This could include research from other types of healthcare crises.

**What should happen next?**

Researchers need to do better studies during disease outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic gives a chance to test programs properly. Future studies should be carefully planned. They should follow best practices for research. They should track workers for long enough to see lasting effects.

When choosing programs to help healthcare workers, leaders should think about:
- What the workplace needs
- What workers need socially and personally
- What mental health support is available
- What might make programs hard or easy to use

Supporting healthcare workers' mental health during disease outbreaks is very important. We need more research to know what works best.",10.1002-14651858.CD013779,"What is the best way to support resilience and mental well‐being in frontline healthcare professionals during and after a pandemic? 
What is ‘resilience’? 
Working as a 'frontline' health or social care professional during a global disease pandemic, like COVID‐19, can be very stressful. Over time, the negative effects of stress can lead to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, which, in turn, may affect work, family and other social relationships. ‘Resilience’ is the ability to cope with the negative effects of stress and so avoid mental health problems and their wider effects. 
Healthcare providers can use various strategies (interventions) to support resilience and mental well‐being in their frontline healthcare professionals. These could include work‐based interventions, such as changing routines or improving equipment; or psychological support interventions, such as counselling. 
What did we want to find out? 
First (objective 1), we wanted to know how successfully any interventions improved frontline health professionals’ resilience or mental well‐being. 
Second (objective 2), we wanted to know what made it easier (facilitators) or harder (barriers) to deliver these interventions. 
What did we do? 
We searched medical databases for any kind of study that investigated interventions designed to support resilience and mental well‐being in healthcare professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks. The disease outbreaks had to be classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as epidemics or pandemics, and take place from 2002 onwards (the year before the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak). 
What did we find? 
We found 16 relevant studies. These studies came from different disease outbreaks ‐ two were from SARS; nine from Ebola; one from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); and four from COVID‐19. The studies mainly looked at workplace interventions that involved either psychological support (for example, counselling or seeing a psychologist) or work‐based interventions (for example, giving training, or changing routines). 
Objective 1: one study investigated how well an intervention worked. This study was carried out immediately after the Ebola outbreak, and investigated whether staff who were training to give other people (such as patients and their family members) 'psychological first aid' felt less ‘burnt out’. We had some concerns about the results that this study reported and about some of its methods. This means that our certainty of the evidence is very low and we cannot say whether the intervention helped or not. 
Objective 2: all 16 studies provided some evidence about barriers and facilitators to implement interventions. We found 17 main findings from these studies. We do not have high confidence in any of the findings; we had moderate confidence in six findings and low to very low confidence in 11 findings. 
We are moderately confident that the following two factors were barriers to implementation of an intervention: frontline workers, or the organisations in which they worked, not being fully aware of what they needed to support their mental well‐being; and a lack of equipment, staff time or skills needed for an intervention. 
We are moderately confident that the following three factors were facilitators to implementation of an intervention: interventions that could be adapted for a local area; having effective communication, both formally within an organisation and informal or social networks; and having positive, safe and supportive learning environments for frontline healthcare professionals. 
We are moderately confident that the knowledge and beliefs that frontline healthcare professionals have about an intervention can either help or hinder implementation of the intervention. 
Key messages 
We did not find any evidence that tells us about how well different strategies work at supporting the resilience and mental well‐being of frontline workers. We found some limited evidence about things that might help successful delivery of interventions. Properly planned research studies to find out the best ways to support the resilience and mental well‐being of health and social care workers are urgently required.

Guidelines recommend routine arteriovenous (AV) graft and fistula surveillance (technology‐based screening) in addition to clinical monitoring (physical examination) for early identification and pre‐emptive correction of a stenosis before the access becomes dysfunctional. However, consequences on patient‐relevant outcomes of pre‐emptive correction of a stenosis in a functioning access as opposed to deferred correction, i.e. correction postponed to when the access becomes dysfunctional, are uncertain. 
Objectives
We aimed to evaluate 1) whether pre‐emptive correction of an AV access stenosis improves clinically relevant outcomes; 2) whether the effects of pre‐emptive correction of an AV access stenosis differ by access type (fistula versus graft), aim (primary and secondary prophylaxis), and surveillance method for primary prophylaxis (Doppler ultrasound for the screening of functional and anatomical changes versus measurement of the flow in the access); and 3) whether other factors (dialysis duration, access location, configuration or materials, algorithm for referral for intervention, intervention strategies (surgical versus radiological or other), or study design) explain the heterogeneity that might exist in the effect estimates. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 30 November 2015 using search terms relevant to this review. 
Selection criteria
We included all studies of any access surveillance method for early identification and pre‐emptive treatment of an AV access stenosis. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on potentially remediable and irremediable failure of the access (i.e. thrombosis and access loss respectively); infection and mortality; and resource use (hospitalisation, diagnostic and intervention procedures). Analysis was by a random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR), hazard ratio (HR) or incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We identified 14 studies (1390 participants), nine enrolled adults without a known access stenosis (primary prophylaxis; three studies including people using fistulas) and five enrolled adults with a documented stenosis in a non‐dysfunctional access (secondary prophylaxis; three studies in people using fistulas). Study follow‐up ranged from 6 to 38 months, and study size ranged from 58 to 189 participants. In low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence (based on GRADE criteria) in adults treated with haemodialysis, relative to no surveillance and deferred correction, surveillance with pre‐emptive correction of an AV stenosis reduced the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.97; I² = 30%; 18 study comparisons, 1212 participants), and probably improves the longevity of AV access (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99; I² = 0%; 11 study comparisons, 972 participants). In analyses subgrouped by access type, pre‐emptive stenosis correction did not reduce the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.12; I² = 0%; 11 study comparisons, 697 participants) or access loss in grafts (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.11; I² = 0%; 7 study comparisons; 662 participants), but did reduce the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.71; I² = 0%; 7 study comparisons, 515 participants) and the risk of access loss in fistulas (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.86; I² = 0%; 4 studies; 310 participants). Three of the four studies reporting access loss data in fistulas (199 participants) were conducted in the same centre. Insufficient data were available to assess whether benefits vary by prophylaxis aim in fistulas (i.e. primary and secondary prophylaxis). Although the magnitude of the effects of pre‐emptive stenosis correction was considerable for patient‐centred outcomes, results were either heterogeneous or imprecise. While pre‐emptive stenosis correction may reduce the rates of hospitalisation (IRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93; I² = 67%; 4 study comparisons, 219 participants) and use of catheters (IRR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98; I² = 53%; 6 study comparisons, 394 participants), it may also increase the rates of diagnostic procedures (IRR 1.78, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.67; I² = 62%; 7 study comparisons, 539 participants), infection (IRR 1.74, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.91; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 248 participants) and mortality (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.11; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 386 participants). 
In general, risk of bias was high or unclear in most studies for many domains we assessed. Four studies were published after 2005 and only one had evidence of registration within a trial registry. No study reported information on authorship and/or involvement of the study sponsor in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. 
Authors' conclusions
Pre‐emptive correction of a newly identified or known stenosis in a functional AV access does not improve access longevity. Although pre‐emptive stenosis correction may be promising in fistulas existing evidence is insufficient to guide clinical practice and health policy. While pre‐emptive stenosis correction may reduce the risk of hospitalisation, this benefit is uncertain whereas there may be a substantial increase (i.e. 80%) in the use of access‐related procedures and procedure‐related adverse events (e.g. infection, mortality). The net effects of pre‐emptive correction on harms and resource use are thus unclear. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Checking and Fixing Blood Access Problems Before They Stop Working in Dialysis Patients

## Plain Title

Does fixing narrowed blood vessels used for dialysis before they stop working help patients?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

People with kidney failure need dialysis. This is a treatment that cleans the blood. To do dialysis, doctors create a special blood vessel connection. This can be a fistula (joining an artery and vein) or a graft (using a tube to connect them).

Sometimes these blood vessels get narrow. This is called stenosis. When the narrowing gets bad, the blood vessel can get blocked. This is called thrombosis. When this happens, patients cannot get dialysis.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors can check blood vessels in two ways:
- Physical examination (feeling and listening to the blood vessel)
- Special tests using machines (called surveillance)

Some doctors use special tests to find narrowing early. They then fix the narrowing before it causes a blockage. This is called pre-emptive correction.

Other doctors wait. They only fix problems after the blood vessel stops working. This is called deferred correction.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if finding and fixing narrowing early helps patients. They wanted to see if this approach works better than waiting until problems happen.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 14 different studies. They combined the results to find patterns.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included 1,390 adults getting dialysis. Some used fistulas. Others used grafts.

**How long did the studies last?**

Studies followed patients for 6 to 38 months. Each study had 58 to 189 people.

**What did researchers compare?**

They compared two approaches:
- Finding narrowing early with tests and fixing it right away
- Waiting and only fixing problems after the blood vessel stops working

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The results were mixed. Benefits depended on the type of blood vessel.

**For all patients together:**
- Early checking and fixing reduced blockages by about 1 in 5 cases
- Early checking and fixing probably helped blood vessels last longer
- Early checking and fixing may have reduced hospital stays

**For patients with fistulas:**
- Early checking and fixing cut blockages in half
- Early checking and fixing cut blood vessel failure in half
- These benefits looked promising

**For patients with grafts:**
- Early checking and fixing did not clearly help
- Blockages happened at similar rates either way
- Blood vessels lasted about the same time either way

**What were the downsides?**

Early checking and fixing may have caused problems:
- Patients needed 80% more procedures and tests
- Infections may have increased
- Deaths may have increased slightly

**What were the study limitations?**

Many studies had problems:
- Study methods were not always clear or well done
- Most studies were small
- Results varied between studies
- Few recent studies were included

**What do the results mean?**

For grafts, early checking and fixing does not clearly help. The benefits are uncertain.

For fistulas, early checking and fixing might help. But more research is needed. Most positive results came from studies at one medical center.

The overall balance is unclear. Early checking and fixing might prevent some blockages and hospital stays. But it also means many more procedures. These extra procedures may cause infections and other problems.

**What are the conclusions?**

Researchers cannot yet say if early checking and fixing is better. Current evidence does not clearly support routine surveillance for all dialysis patients.

More high-quality studies are needed. These studies should look at what matters most to patients: quality of life, safety, and overall health outcomes.

Until better evidence exists, doctors and patients should discuss the pros and cons together. They should decide based on individual circumstances.",10.1002-14651858.CD010709,"Pre‐emptive correction of stenosis of the arteriovenous access for haemodialysis
An arteriovenous access consists of a direct surgical connection between an artery and a vein in the arm (fistula) or a plastic conduit connecting an artery and a vein (graft). If these forms of access become dysfunctional the delivery of dialysis therapy becomes suboptimal. The most common cause of access dysfunction is the development of a restriction or conduit narrowing called 'stenosis'. Because early correction of stenosis is considered critical to maintain the patency (openness) of the access and prolong its use, guidelines recommend regular surveillance of the access (i.e. screening based on diagnostic tests) in addition to or instead of a physical exam (clinical monitoring) to identify and treat early lesions. 
In this review we included 14 studies, randomising 1390 participants to either a pre‐emptive correction of an access stenosis (i.e. before the access became dysfunctional) or a deferred correction of an access stenosis (i.e. if and when the access became dysfunctional). This review shows that pre‐emptive correction of an arteriovenous access stenosis does not improve longevity of the access overall. In people using grafts pre‐emptive correction does not reduce the risk of thrombosis or access loss. In people using fistulas pre‐emptive stenosis correction reduces the risk of thrombosis and may prolong the longevity of the access. However, this surveillance and pre‐emptive correction strategy may increase the number of access‐related procedures and procedure‐related adverse events. 
This systematic review presents, to clinicians and patients, evidence‐based data that do not support the use of access surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of stenosis in grafts. Although surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of stenosis reduce the risk of thrombosis and may reduce the risk of access loss in fistulas, they may also increase the risk of procedure‐related adverse events and health‐care cost. Large multicentre clinical trials are necessary in this patient population to better clarify potential harms and expected benefits of routine surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of fistula stenosis.

Hyperkalaemia is a common electrolyte abnormality caused by reduced renal potassium excretion in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Potassium binders, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate and calcium polystyrene sulfonate, are widely used but may lead to constipation and other adverse gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, reducing their tolerability. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer ion exchange resins for treatment of hyperkalaemia which may cause fewer GI side‐effects. Although more recent studies are focusing on clinically‐relevant endpoints such as cardiac complications or death, the evidence on safety is still limited. Given the recent expansion in the available treatment options, it is appropriate to review the evidence of effectiveness and tolerability of all potassium exchange resins among people with CKD, with the aim to provide guidance to consumers, practitioners, and policy‐makers. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of potassium binders for treating chronic hyperkalaemia among adults and children with CKD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 10 March 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled studies (quasi‐RCTs) evaluating potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia administered in adults and children with CKD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed risks of bias and extracted data. Treatment estimates were summarised by random effects meta‐analysis and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence interval (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using GRADE processes. 
Main results
Fifteen studies, randomising 1849 adult participants were eligible for inclusion. Twelve studies involved participants with CKD (stages 1 to 5) not requiring dialysis and three studies were among participants treated with haemodialysis. Potassium binders included calcium polystyrene sulfonate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. A range of routes, doses, and timing of drug administration were used. Study duration varied from 12 hours to 52 weeks (median 4 weeks). Three were cross‐over studies. The mean study age ranged from 53.1 years to 73 years. No studies evaluated treatment in children. 
Some studies had methodological domains that were at high or unclear risks of bias, leading to low certainty in the results. Studies were not designed to measure treatment effects on cardiac arrhythmias or major GI symptoms. 
Ten studies (1367 randomised participants) compared a potassium binder to placebo. The certainty of the evidence was low for all outcomes. We categorised treatments in newer agents (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) and older agents (calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate). Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate may make little or no difference to death (any cause) (4 studies, 688 participants: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.11, 4.32; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. The treatment effect of older potassium binders on death (any cause) was unknown. One cardiovascular death was reported with potassium binder in one study, showing that there was no difference between patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo for cardiovascular death in CKD and HD. There was no evidence of a difference between patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo for health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) at the end of treatment (one study) in CKD or HD. Potassium binders had uncertain effects on nausea (3 studies, 229 participants: RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.65, 6.78; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), diarrhoea (5 studies, 720 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.47, 1.48; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), and vomiting (2 studies, 122 participants: RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.35 to 8.51; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. Potassium binders may lower serum potassium levels (at the end of treatment) (3 studies, 277 participants: MD ‐0.62 mEq/L, 95% CI ‐0.97, ‐0.27; I2 = 92%; low certainty evidence) in CKD and HD. Potassium binders had uncertain effects on constipation (4 studies, 425 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.71, 3.52; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. Potassium binders may decrease systolic blood pressure (BP) (2 studies, 369 participants: MD ‐3.73 mmHg, 95%CI ‐6.64 to ‐0.83; I2 = 79%; low certainty evidence) and diastolic BP (one study) at the end of the treatment. No study reported outcome data for cardiac arrhythmias or major GI events. 
Calcium polystyrene sulfonate may make little or no difference to serum potassium levels at end of treatment, compared to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (2 studies, 117 participants: MD 0.38 mEq/L, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.79; I2 = 42%, low certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in systolic BP (one study), diastolic BP (one study), or constipation (one study) between calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate. 
There was no difference between high‐dose and low‐dose patiromer for death (sudden death) (one study), stroke (one study), myocardial infarction (one study), or constipation (one study). 
The comparative effects whether potassium binders were administered with or without food, laxatives, or sorbitol, were very uncertain with insufficient data to perform meta‐analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence supporting clinical decision‐making for different potassium binders to treat chronic hyperkalaemia in adults with CKD is of low certainty; no studies were identified in children. Available studies have not been designed to measure treatment effects on clinical outcomes such as cardiac arrhythmias or major GI symptoms. This review suggests the need for a large, adequately powered study of potassium binders versus placebo that assesses clinical outcomes of relevance to patients, clinicians and policy‐makers. This data could be used to assess cost‐effectiveness, given the lack of definitive studies and the clinical importance of potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia in people with CKD. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Medicines to Lower High Potassium Levels in People with Kidney Disease

## Plain Title

Do medicines that remove potassium from the body help people with kidney disease who have high potassium levels?

## Rationale

**What is high potassium and why is it a problem?**

Potassium is a mineral found in your blood. When your kidneys don't work well, potassium can build up to dangerous levels. This is called high potassium. High potassium can cause serious heart problems.

**What are potassium binders?**

Potassium binders are medicines that help remove extra potassium from your body. Older medicines include calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate. These older medicines often cause stomach problems like constipation. Newer medicines include patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. Doctors hope these newer medicines cause fewer stomach problems.

**Why was this study needed?**

Many people with kidney disease have high potassium. Doctors need to know which medicines work best and are safest. This review looked at all the research to help doctors, patients, and health leaders make better choices.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies that tested potassium binders in adults and children with kidney disease. They searched medical databases up to March 2020.

**Who was in the studies?**

The researchers found 15 studies with 1,849 adults. No studies included children. Most studies included people with kidney disease who were not on dialysis. Three studies included people on dialysis. People in the studies were between 53 and 73 years old on average.

**What did the studies test?**

The studies tested different potassium binders. Some compared these medicines to fake pills (placebo). Others compared different types of potassium binders to each other. The studies used different doses and ways of giving the medicines.

**How long did the studies last?**

Studies lasted from 12 hours to 52 weeks. Most studies lasted about 4 weeks.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The quality of the evidence was low. This means we cannot be very sure about the results.

**Effects on death and heart problems:**

The newer medicines (patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) may make little or no difference in death rates. Only one heart-related death happened in the studies. Studies did not look closely at heart rhythm problems.

**Effects on potassium levels:**

Potassium binders may lower potassium levels in the blood. This is what the medicines are supposed to do.

**Effects on blood pressure:**

Potassium binders may lower blood pressure slightly.

**Effects on quality of life:**

One study looked at quality of life. It found no clear difference between potassium binders and placebo.

**Side effects:**

Researchers were not sure about side effects. Potassium binders might cause stomach problems like nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, or constipation. But the studies did not give clear answers. Studies did not look for serious stomach problems.

**Comparing different medicines:**

Calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate may work about the same. There was not enough information to compare other medicines.

**What are the main conclusions?**

The evidence about potassium binders is limited. We need better studies to know if these medicines really help people with kidney disease. Future studies should look at important outcomes like heart problems and serious side effects. No studies tested these medicines in children.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Potassium binders may help lower potassium levels. However, we don't know enough about whether they prevent serious problems like heart rhythm issues. We also don't know enough about side effects. Patients should talk with their doctors about the benefits and risks of these medicines.

**Word count: Approximately 620 words**",10.1002-14651858.CD013165,"Are potassium treatments effective for reduce the excess of potassium among people with chronic kidney disease? 
What is the issue? 
High levels of potassium (a body salt) can build up with chronic kidney disease. This can lead to changes in muscle function including the heart muscle, and cause problems with heart rhythms that can be dangerous. Dialysis can remove potassium from the blood, but for some patients levels can still be high. Patients with severe kidney failure who have not yet started dialysis may have high potassium levels. Treatments have been available for many years but can cause constipation and abdominal discomfort, which make them intolerable for many patients. Newer treatments have been developed including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These may be more tolerable but it is uncertain whether they help to prevent heart complications. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all the research trials that have assessed the potassium‐lowering treatments for children and adults with chronic kidney diseases. We evaluated how certain we could be about the overall findings using a system called ""GRADE"". 
What did we find? 
There are 15 studies involving 1849 randomised adults. Patients in the studies were given a potassium binder or a dummy pill (placebo) or standard care. The treatment they got was decided by random chance. The studies were generally short‐term over days to weeks and focused on potassium levels. Heart related complications could not be measured in this short time frame. Based on the existing research, we can't be sure whether potassium binders improve well‐being or prevent complications in people with chronic kidney disease. There were no studies in children. 
Conclusions 
We can't be certain about the best treatments to reduce body potassium levels for people with chronic kidney disease. We need more information from clinical studies that involve a larger number of patients who have the treatment over several months or years.

Respiratory disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF), and many different therapies are used by people with CF in the management of respiratory problems. Bronchodilator therapy is used to relieve symptoms of shortness of breath and to open the airways to allow clearance of mucus. Despite the widespread use of inhaled bronchodilators in CF, there is little objective evidence of their efficacy. A Cochrane Review looking at both short‐ and long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF was withdrawn from the Cochrane Library in 2016. That review has been replaced by two separate Cochrane Reviews: one on long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF, and this review on short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF. For this review 'inhaled' includes the use of pressurised metered dose inhalers (MDIs), with or without a spacer, dry powder devices and nebulisers. 
Objectives
To evaluate short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators in children and adults with CF in terms of clinical outcomes and safety. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books on 28 March 2022 and searched trial registries for any new or ongoing trials on 12 April 2022. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs that looked at the effect of any short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator delivered by any device, at any dose, at any frequency and for any duration compared to either placebo or another short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator in people with CF. We screened references as per standard Cochrane methodology. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. Where we were not able to enter data into our analyses we reported results directly from the papers. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 11 trials from our systematic search, with 191 participants meeting our inclusion criteria; three of these trials had three treatment arms. Eight trials compared short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to placebo and four trials compared short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists to placebo. Three trials compared short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists. All were cross‐over trials with only small numbers of participants. We were only able to enter data into the analysis from three trials comparing short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to placebo. 
Short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus placebo 
All eight trials (six single‐dose trials and two longer‐term trials) reporting on this comparison reported on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), either as per cent predicted (% predicted) or L. We were able to combine the data from two trials in a meta‐analysis which showed a greater per cent change from baseline in FEV1 L after beta‐2 agonists compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 6.95%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 12.02; 2 trials, 82 participants). Only one of the longer‐term trials reported on exacerbations, as measured by hospitalisations and courses of antibiotics. Only the second longer‐term trial presented results for participant‐reported outcomes. Three trials narratively reported adverse events, and these were all mild. Three single‐dose trials and the two longer trials reported on forced vital capacity (FVC), and five trials reported on peak expiratory flow, i.e. forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF25-75). One trial reported on airway clearance in terms of sputum weight. We judged the certainty of evidence for each of these outcomes to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. 
Short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists versus placebo 
All four trials reporting on this comparison looked at the effects of ipratropium bromide, but in different doses and via different delivery methods. One trial reported FEV1 % predicted; three trials measured this in L. Two trials reported adverse events, but these were few and mild. One trial reported FVC and three trials reported FEF25-75. None of the trials reported on quality of life, exacerbations or airway clearance. We judged the certainty of evidence for each of these outcomes to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. 
Short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists  
None of the three single‐dose trials reporting on this comparison provided data we could analyse. The original papers from three trials report that both treatments lead to an improvement in FEV1 L. Only one trial reported on adverse events; but none were experienced by any participant. No trial reported on any of our other outcomes. We judged the certainty of evidence to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists compared to short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. 
Authors' conclusions
All included trials in this review are small and of a cross‐over design. Most trials looked at very short‐term effects of inhaled bronchodilators, and therefore did not measure longer‐term outcomes. The certainty of evidence across all outcomes was very low, and therefore we have been unable to describe any effects with certainty. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Short-Acting Inhaled Bronchodilators for Cystic Fibrosis

## Plain Title

Do fast-acting inhaled medicines that open airways help people with cystic fibrosis?

## Rationale

**What is cystic fibrosis?**

Cystic fibrosis is a disease that affects the lungs. People with this disease make thick, sticky mucus in their airways. This mucus is hard to clear out. It causes breathing problems and lung infections. Lung disease is the main reason people with cystic fibrosis get sick and die.

**What are bronchodilators?**

Bronchodilators are medicines that open up the airways in the lungs. They help people breathe easier. They also help clear out mucus. Many people with cystic fibrosis use these medicines every day.

There are two main types of these medicines:
- Beta-2 agonists (like albuterol)
- Muscarinic antagonists (like ipratropium)

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors often prescribe these medicines for people with cystic fibrosis. However, we do not have strong proof that they actually work. This review looked at studies to find out if short-acting bronchodilators help people with cystic fibrosis. Short-acting means the medicine works quickly but only for a few hours.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of research studies. The authors searched for all studies that tested short-acting inhaled bronchodilators in people with cystic fibrosis.

They found 11 studies with 191 people total. All studies were small. All used a cross-over design. This means each person tried both the real medicine and a fake medicine (placebo). Then researchers compared the results.

**What did the studies look at?**

- Eight studies compared beta-2 agonists to placebo
- Four studies compared muscarinic antagonists to placebo
- Three studies compared beta-2 agonists to muscarinic antagonists

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included children and adults with cystic fibrosis. The studies did not limit by age or gender.

**How long did the studies last?**

Most studies only looked at very short-term effects. Six studies gave just one dose of medicine. Only two studies lasted longer than one day.

## Results

**What did the researchers measure?**

The main thing measured was lung function. This was tested by how much air people could blow out in one second. This test is called FEV1.

Other things measured included:
- Side effects
- Quality of life
- Lung infections
- How much mucus people could cough up

**What were the main results?**

**Beta-2 agonists compared to placebo:**

Two studies showed that beta-2 agonists might improve lung function slightly. People could blow out about 7% more air after taking the medicine. However, the studies were very small. The results are uncertain.

Few side effects were reported. The ones reported were mild.

Most studies only gave one dose. They did not measure long-term effects. They did not measure quality of life or lung infections.

**Muscarinic antagonists compared to placebo:**

All four studies tested ipratropium bromide. They used different doses and different devices.

The results were unclear. The studies were too small to know if this medicine helps.

Side effects were few and mild.

**Beta-2 agonists compared to muscarinic antagonists:**

Three studies compared these two types of medicine. The studies found that both medicines might improve lung function. However, we cannot be sure which one works better.

**What do these results mean?**

The certainty of all evidence was very low. This means we are very uncertain about the results. We cannot say for sure if short-acting bronchodilators help people with cystic fibrosis.

**Why are we uncertain?**

- The studies were very small
- Most studies only tested one dose
- The studies did not measure long-term effects
- Different studies used different methods

**What are the conclusions?**

More research is needed. Future studies should:
- Include more people
- Last longer than one dose
- Measure quality of life
- Measure lung infections
- Use the same methods

Right now, we do not have strong proof that short-acting bronchodilators help people with cystic fibrosis. However, we also do not have proof that they do not help. Doctors and patients should discuss the possible benefits and risks of these medicines.",10.1002-14651858.CD013666,"Short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for using short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators (treatments which widen and open the airways, making it easier to breathe) in people with cystic fibrosis. Short‐acting bronchodilators take effect quickly and generally last 4 to 6 hours. We were interested in any type of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator, given at any dose, and by any type of device (inhalers or nebulisers). 
Both nebulisers and inhalers deliver medicine. Nebulisers turn liquid medication into an easily‐inhaled mist. They vary in type but need a power source, e.g. a rechargeable battery, to function. Inhalers deliver short bursts of medicine (as an aerosol or dry powder) via a manual handheld device. The most common type of inhaler is a metered‐dose inhaler. Inhalers can be used with spacers (empty tubes, usually made from plastic that slot onto the mouthpiece of the inhaler).  
Inhaled bronchodilators are used by many people with cystic fibrosis to help them breathe, and to make it easier to clear mucus from their lungs. We wanted to know if these treatments were better than a placebo (dummy) treatment or another type of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 28 March 2022.
Trial characteristics 
The review included 11 trials with 191 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 5 and 40 years of age. Trials compared two different types of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator (beta‐2 agonists such as salbutamol or albuterol, and muscarinic antagonists such as ipratropium bromide) against a placebo substance which contained no medication, or a different short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator; three of the trials had three comparison groups ‐ beta‐2 agonists versus muscarinic antagonists versus placebo. All trials were cross‐over trials, so all of the people included in the trial received both treatments at different times, and the order that they received the treatments was random. The trials lasted from a single‐dose trial to 6 months. Eight trials looked at the effects of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus placebo, four trials at the effects of a short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist versus placebo, and three trials looked at the effects of a short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonist with a short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist. 
Key results 
All trials looked at the effect of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators on lung function, measured as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), but this was reported in different ways and at different time points.  
We are uncertain whether any of the short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators have an effect on FEV1 compared to placebo. The trials were too small and there were not enough data to show if there was an effect or not. 
Only six of the 11 trials reported on harmful effects of treatment: one trial reported no harmful effects and five trials reported mild tremors, dry mouth and fatigue. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence across all trials was very low. All trials used a cross‐over design where the participants are given one treatment and then swapped to the other treatment with a washout period (the length of time for a drug to be eliminated from the body) in between. It is possible that the clinical status of participants was not the same at the beginning of the first treatment phase as at the beginning of the second treatment phase. The trials were also very small and were carried out more than 10 years ago.

Review question
This review aimed to gather evidence for the use of any physical activity intervention for people with congenital heart disease. We aimed to compare interventions including exercise training, physical activity promotion or lung training with no intervention (usual care). 
Background
Congenital heart disease is the term used for a range of birth defects that affect how the heart works. People with congenital heart disease have reduced life expectancy, physical fitness and quality of life. However, due to better prenatal diagnoses, surgical procedures (often performed in the early years of life) and earlier interventions, the survival rate for those born with this disease has improved dramatically, such that most people will now live into adulthood. Exercise training and physical activity interventions are known to improve fitness, physical activity, survival and quality of life in healthy people, but it is not clear how effective these programmes are for people with long‐term medical conditions. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies in September 2019 and identified 15 studies involving 924 participants. The studies used three main types of interventions, including programmes designed to increase physical activity, aerobic fitness and health‐related quality of life and compared physical activity intervention and control interventions in people with congenital heart disease.  
Key results
We included 15 trials with 924 participants. Half of the participants were female. Of the 15 trials, 5 used a total of 500 young people (less than 18 years of age) and 10 trials used a total of 424 adult participants. We found that physical fitness and physical activity may slightly increase but we are very uncertain about quality of life. There is currently no data to say if this small increase in fitness will result in fewer visits to the hospital. But there were no recorded deaths or serious events that were related to participation in physical activity. 
Quality of evidence
Using a validated scientific approach (GRADE), the certainty in the evidence base was moderate for fitness, low for physical activity and very low for quality of life. Most outcomes were limited due to small study participant numbers and poor reporting of study details. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Physical Activity Programs for People Born with Heart Problems

## Plain Title
Can exercise and physical activity programs help people who were born with heart problems?

## Rationale

**What is congenital heart disease?**
Some people are born with hearts that do not work the way they should. This is called congenital heart disease. The heart may have parts that did not form correctly before birth.

**Why is this a problem?**
People born with heart problems often:
- Do not live as long as others
- Get tired more easily
- Cannot do as much physical activity
- Have a lower quality of life

**Good news about treatment**
Doctors can now find these heart problems before babies are born. Surgery can fix many heart problems when children are very young. Because of this, most people with congenital heart disease now live to be adults.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Exercise and physical activity help healthy people live longer and feel better. They also help healthy people stay fit and enjoy life more. But researchers wanted to know: Do exercise programs also help people born with heart problems? This study looked at all the research done on this question.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**
Researchers looked for all studies done on this topic. They searched through September 2019. They found 15 studies with 924 people total.

**Who was in these studies?**
- Half were female and half were male
- 5 studies included 500 young people under 18 years old
- 10 studies included 424 adults

**What did the studies test?**
The studies tested three main types of programs:
- Programs to help people be more physically active
- Programs to improve how fit people are
- Programs to improve quality of life

**How were the studies done?**
Some people did physical activity programs. Other people did not do these programs. This is called the control group. Researchers then compared the two groups.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

*Physical fitness:* People who did physical activity programs got a little bit more fit. But the improvement was small.

*Physical activity:* People may have been slightly more active. But researchers are not very sure about this finding.

*Quality of life:* Researchers could not tell if quality of life got better. There was not enough good information to know for sure.

*Hospital visits:* The studies did not track if people went to the hospital less often. So researchers cannot say if exercise programs reduce hospital visits.

**Was it safe?**
Yes. No one died from doing these programs. No serious health problems happened because of the physical activity.

**How good was this research?**
Researchers used a special system called GRADE to rate the quality. Here is what they found:
- Fitness results: moderate quality
- Physical activity results: low quality  
- Quality of life results: very low quality

**Why was the quality not higher?**
- The studies were small
- The studies did not report all details clearly
- Different studies measured things in different ways

**What does this mean?**
Physical activity programs appear to be safe for people born with heart problems. These programs may help people get a bit more fit. But we need more and better studies to know:
- If the programs really improve quality of life
- If they help people stay out of the hospital
- How much exercise is best
- What types of exercise work best

40,10.1002-14651858.CD013694.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Tuberculosis is a leading cause of infectious disease‐related death and is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of specific rapid molecular tests, including Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra, as initial diagnostic tests for the detection of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. However, the WHO estimates that nearly one‐third of all active tuberculosis cases go undiagnosed and unreported. We were interested in whether a single test, Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra, could be useful as a screening test to close this diagnostic gap and improve tuberculosis case detection. 
Objectives
To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in adults, irrespective of signs or symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in high‐risk groups and in the general population. Screening ""irrespective of signs or symptoms"" refers to screening of people who have not been assessed for the presence of tuberculosis symptoms (e.g. cough). 
To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for detecting rifampicin resistance in adults screened for tuberculosis, irrespective of signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in high‐risk groups and in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched 12 databases including the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE and Embase, on 19 March 2020 without language restrictions. We also reviewed reference lists of included articles and related Cochrane Reviews, and contacted researchers in the field to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Cross‐sectional and cohort studies in which adults (15 years and older) in high‐risk groups (e.g. people living with HIV, household contacts of people with tuberculosis) or in the general population were screened for pulmonary tuberculosis using Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra. For tuberculosis detection, the reference standard was culture. For rifampicin resistance detection, the reference standards were culture‐based drug susceptibility testing and line probe assays. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form and assessed risk of bias and applicability using QUADAS‐2. We used a bivariate random‐effects model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) separately for tuberculosis detection and rifampicin resistance detection. We estimated all models using a Bayesian approach. For tuberculosis detection, we first estimated screening accuracy in distinct high‐risk groups, including people living with HIV, household contacts, people residing in prisons, and miners, and then in several high‐risk groups combined. 
Main results
We included a total of 21 studies: 18 studies (13,114 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for pulmonary tuberculosis and one study (571 participants) evaluated both Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Three studies (159 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance. Fifteen studies (75%) were conducted in high tuberculosis burden and 16 (80%) in high TB/HIV‐burden countries. We judged most studies to have low risk of bias in all four QUADAS‐2 domains and low concern for applicability. 
Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as screening tests for pulmonary tuberculosis 
In people living with HIV (12 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CrI) were 61.8% (53.6 to 69.9) (602 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and 98.8% (98.0 to 99.4) (4173 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 50 have tuberculosis on culture, 40 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive; of these, 9 (22%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); and 960 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; of these, 19 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives). 
In people living with HIV (1 study), Xpert Ultra sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) were 69% (57 to 80) (68 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 98% (97 to 99) (503 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 50 have tuberculosis on culture, 53 would be Xpert Ultra‐positive; of these, 19 (36%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); and 947 would be Xpert Ultra‐negative; of these, 16 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives). 
In non‐hospitalized people in high‐risk groups (5 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 69.4% (47.7 to 86.2) (337 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and 98.8% (97.2 to 99.5) (8619 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 10 have tuberculosis on culture, 19 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive; of these, 12 (63%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); and 981 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; of these, 3 (0%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives). 
We did not identify any studies using Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra for screening in the general population. 
Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for rifampicin resistance 
Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity was 81% and 100% (2 studies, 20 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and specificity was 94% to 100%, (3 studies, 139 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Of the high‐risks groups evaluated, Xpert MTB/RIF applied as a screening test was accurate for tuberculosis in high tuberculosis burden settings. Sensitivity and specificity were similar in people living with HIV and non‐hospitalized people in high‐risk groups. In people living with HIV, Xpert Ultra sensitivity was slightly higher than that of Xpert MTB/RIF and specificity similar. As there was only one study of Xpert Ultra in this analysis, results should be interpreted with caution. There were no studies that evaluated the tests in people with diabetes mellitus and other groups considered at high‐risk for tuberculosis, or in the general population. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing for Tuberculosis in People at High Risk

## Plain Title

How Well Do Two Rapid Tests (Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra) Find Tuberculosis When Screening People at High Risk?

## Rationale

**What is tuberculosis and why is it a problem?**

Tuberculosis is a lung disease. It spreads through the air when sick people cough. Tuberculosis is one of the top 10 causes of death in the world. It kills more people than any other germ-caused disease.

**What is the problem this study tried to solve?**

Doctors can miss about 1 out of every 3 people who have tuberculosis. These people do not get treatment. They can spread the disease to others. They can become very sick or die.

**What are screening tests?**

Screening tests check for disease in people before they feel sick. This is different from testing people who already have symptoms like cough or fever.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to know if two rapid tests could find tuberculosis early. The tests are called Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. These tests give results in about 2 hours. Finding tuberculosis early could help more people get treatment. It could also stop the disease from spreading.

**Who is at high risk for tuberculosis?**

Some people are more likely to get tuberculosis. These include:
- People living with HIV (a virus that weakens the body's defenses)
- People who live with someone who has tuberculosis
- People in prisons
- Miners

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study these tests?**

Researchers looked at 21 studies from around the world. Most studies were done in countries where many people have tuberculosis.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 13,685 adults (age 15 and older). Most people were from high-risk groups. The largest group was people living with HIV.

**How did the studies work?**

People gave sputum samples. Sputum is mucus coughed up from the lungs. Researchers tested the sputum with the rapid tests. They also used a standard lab test called culture. Culture takes weeks to show results. Researchers compared the rapid test results to the culture results.

**How long did the studies last?**

Each person gave samples one time. The studies did not follow people over time.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The tests worked well to find tuberculosis in high-risk groups.

**Results in people living with HIV:**

For Xpert MTB/RIF:
- The test found tuberculosis in about 6 out of 10 people who had it
- The test correctly said ""no tuberculosis"" in about 99 out of 100 people who did not have it

Here is what this means: Imagine 1,000 people living with HIV. Fifty of them have tuberculosis.
- The test would be positive in 40 people
- Of these 40, about 9 would not actually have tuberculosis
- The test would be negative in 960 people
- Of these 960, about 19 would actually have tuberculosis

For Xpert Ultra (only one study):
- The test found tuberculosis in about 7 out of 10 people who had it
- The test correctly said ""no tuberculosis"" in about 98 out of 100 people who did not have it
- Xpert Ultra found slightly more cases than Xpert MTB/RIF

**Results in other high-risk groups:**

The tests worked about the same as in people with HIV. They found about 7 out of 10 people with tuberculosis. They correctly ruled out tuberculosis in about 99 out of 100 people.

**Testing for drug resistance:**

Some tuberculosis germs resist rifampicin. This is an important medicine for tuberculosis. The Xpert MTB/RIF test also checks for this resistance. The test worked well but researchers found only 3 small studies.

**What did researchers conclude?**

The rapid tests can help find tuberculosis in people at high risk. The tests work best in places where many people have tuberculosis. Xpert Ultra may find slightly more cases than Xpert MTB/RIF. More research is needed in other high-risk groups. No studies tested these screening tests in the general population.",10.1002-14651858.CD013694,"How accurate are sputum Xpert tests for screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults whether or not they have tuberculosis symptoms? 
Why is using Xpert tests to screen for pulmonary tuberculosis important? 
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of infectious disease‐related death and one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using specific rapid tests as initial tests for diagnosing tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. However, the WHO estimates that nearly one‐third of all active tuberculosis cases go undiagnosed and unreported. Not recognizing tuberculosis when it is present (a false negative test result) may result in illness and death and an increased risk of infecting others. An incorrect diagnosis of tuberculosis (false‐positive result) may mean that people are given antibiotics when there is no benefit to be gained. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as screening tests for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults whether or not they have tuberculosis symptoms (such as cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats). We were interested in how the tests worked in groups at high risk for tuberculosis, including people living with HIV (PLHIV), household contacts of people with tuberculosis, miners, people residing in prisons, people with diabetes, and in the general public. 
What was studied in this review? 
Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are rapid tests for simultaneously diagnosing tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. We combined study results to determine: 
‐ sensitivity: people with tuberculosis (rifampicin resistance) correctly diagnosed as having the condition. 
‐ specificity: people without tuberculosis (rifampicin resistance) correctly identified as not having the condition. 
The closer sensitivity and specificity are to 100%, the better the test.
What are the main results in this review? 
Twenty‐one studies: 18 studies (13,114 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for pulmonary tuberculosis and one study (571 participants) evaluated both Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Three studies (159 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance. 
For every 1000 people tested, if 50 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard:
PLHIV 
‐ Xpert MTB/RIF (12 studies):
· 40 people would test positive, including 9 without tuberculosis (62% sensitivity)
· 960 people would test negative, including 19 with tuberculosis (99% specificity)
‐ Xpert Ultra (1 study):
· 53 people would test positive, including 19 without tuberculosis (69% sensitivity)
· 947 people would test negative, including 16 with tuberculosis (98% specificity)
For every 1000 people tested, if 10 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard:
Other high‐risk groups combined 
‐ Xpert MTB/RIF (5 studies):
· 19 people would test positive, including 12 without tuberculosis (69% sensitivity)
· 981 people would test negative, including 3 with tuberculosis (99% specificity)
For detection of rifampicin resistance, Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity was 81% and 100% (2 studies) and specificity was 94% to 100% (3 studies). 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
In the included studies, the reference standards for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis (culture) and rifampicin resistance (drug susceptibility testing) are likely to have been reliable methods for deciding whether patients really had the conditions. We were fairly confident in the results for Xpert MTB/RIF in PLHIV, and less so for other high‐risk groups. Not enough people have been studied to be confident about the results for Xpert Ultra or for detection of rifampicin resistance. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were mainly performed in high tuberculosis and high HIV burden settings. No studies evaluated the tests in people with diabetes mellitus or the general population. 
What are the implications of this review? 
In PLHIV, Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test was accurate for tuberculosis in high tuberculosis burden settings. In high‐risk groups, Xpert MTB/RIF may assist in identifying tuberculosis, but the certainty of evidence is low. In PLHIV, Xpert Ultra sensitivity was slightly higher than that of Xpert MTB/RIF and specificity similar based on one study. There were few studies and few people tested for rifampicin resistance and no studies that evaluated the tests in people with diabetes or in the general population.

Road traffic suicides are common. However, due to the difficulty in distinguishing between motor vehicle crash fatalities and actual suicides, no official figures exist for this method of suicide. Restricting access to means is an important universal or population‐based approach to suicide prevention with clear evidence of its effectiveness. However, the evidence with respect to means restriction for the prevention of suicide on roads is not well established. We conducted a systematic review to assess the impact of restrictions on the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to restrict the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Transport Research International Documentation (TRID) Database from the date of database inception to March 2020. We conducted searches of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. We applied no date, language, or publication status restrictions to these searches. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials, controlled intervention studies without randomisation, before‐after studies, or studies using interrupted time series designs, which evaluated interventions to restrict the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened abstracts and full‐text publications against the inclusion criteria. Two review authors planned to independently extract data and assess risk of bias of included studies. However, we identified no studies eligible for inclusion. 
Main results
We identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review highlights the paucity of research around road traffic suicides and the need for future robust studies that aim to investigate the effectiveness of interventions to prevent suicide on roads. Suicide ascertainment is a key issue; therefore, clear objective criteria are necessary in order to scale up and study this method more accurately. In the absence of any substantial evidence, we advocate for more awareness on road traffic suicides and its inclusion in future government suicide prevention policies. Further research exploring effective measures, particularly those that do not require driver compliance, are also needed.

## Plain Title
A Review of Ways to Prevent People from Using Roads to End Their Lives

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Some people use roads to end their lives. This can happen when someone drives their car in a way that causes a crash. It is hard to tell if a car crash death was an accident or if someone meant to die. Because of this, we do not know how often this happens.

### Why is this important?
Making it harder for people to use certain methods to end their lives can save lives. This approach has worked well for other methods. For example, putting up barriers on bridges has helped prevent deaths. However, we do not know if similar actions work for roads.

### What did researchers want to find out?
The researchers wanted to find studies that tested ways to stop people from using roads to end their lives. They wanted to know if these methods worked. They hoped to learn which actions could help save lives on roads.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers look for answers?
This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked for studies that other people had already done. They searched many medical and research databases. They looked for any study from any time period and in any language.

### What kind of studies were they looking for?
The researchers wanted to find studies that:
- Tested a specific action or change on roads
- Looked at whether this change helped prevent deaths
- Used good methods to measure results
- Compared what happened before and after the change

These studies could have looked at things like:
- Barriers or fences along roads
- Changes to road design
- Warning signs
- Speed limits
- Other safety measures

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers found no studies that met their needs. They searched through many research papers. But they could not find even one good study about preventing suicides on roads.

### What does this mean?
This finding shows a big gap in our knowledge. We do not have good research on this topic. Scientists have not studied this problem enough.

### Why is there no research?
One main reason is that it is very hard to know if a car crash was a suicide. Doctors and police often cannot tell for sure. Without clear ways to identify these deaths, it is hard to study them.

### What do the researchers recommend?

**For awareness:**
More people need to know that some car crashes are suicides. This includes doctors, police, and government leaders.

**For policy:**
Governments should include road suicides in their suicide prevention plans. Right now, most plans do not mention this problem.

**For research:**
We need better ways to identify when a car crash is a suicide. Scientists need clear rules for how to tell the difference. Once we can identify these deaths better, we can study them more easily.

**For prevention:**
We need to test ways to prevent road suicides. The best methods would work without needing drivers to do anything. For example, road design changes might work better than warning signs.

### What is the main conclusion?
We do not yet know what works to prevent suicides on roads. Much more research is needed. Until we have better evidence, we should raise awareness about this problem. We should also include it in suicide prevention plans. This may help save lives while we wait for more research.

**Word count: Approximately 570 words**",10.1002-14651858.CD013738,"Means restriction to prevent suicide on roads
Why is this review important? 
Road traffic suicides are difficult to distinguish from motor vehicle crash fatalities and, therefore, no official figures exist for this method of suicide. Limiting access to lethal methods used for suicide (called means restriction) is an important universal or population strategy for preventing suicide. While there is evidence that means restriction is an effective approach for preventing suicides, the evidence for preventing suicide on roads is not well established. Therefore, this review aimed to explore the impact restriction of access would have on suicide on roads. 
Searching for evidence 
We searched several medical databases to find studies that assessed the impact of restricting access to means of suicide on roads. We searched the databases up to March 2020. We also searched international trial registries for unpublished and ongoing studies. Our main outcomes of interest were suicide and attempted suicide or self‐harm. 
Key results 
We found no studies eligible for inclusion in the review. As a result, we cannot draw any conclusions as to the effectiveness of means restriction interventions for the prevention of suicide on roads. Determining suicidal intent is a major problem in road crash fatalities, therefore clear objective criteria are necessary in order to scale up, study and understand this method of suicide more accurately. Improved awareness of suicide on roads in suicide prevention activities is needed, as well as, its inclusion in future government suicide prevention policies. Robust studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions to prevent suicide on roads are urgently required

Why is this review important? 
The medical profession is recognised for its challenging and demanding nature. Medical students and junior doctors have been identified as having increased personal and professional stressors during their years of training. As a result, they face increased strain on their mental well‐being. It is important that this group is supported in their mental well‐being to ensure an overall balance in health, as well as to aid their responsibilities of patient care and patient safety. Furthermore, medical students and junior doctors are often time‐poor. Therefore, it is important to establish whether mindfulness is an effective intervention which justifies its time commitment. There are no previous Cochrane Reviews examining mindfulness in our target population.  
Who will be interested in this review? 
Medical students and junior doctors; other medical professionals at different levels of training and expertise; and institutions such as universities and hospitals involved in the education and training of medical students.  
What question does this review aim to answer? 
What effects do mindfulness‐based psychological interventions have on the mental well‐being of medical students and junior doctors? 
Which studies were included in this review? 
We searched databases to find all studies of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors published up to October 2021. In order to be included in this review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to groups using a random method). Studies needed to include medical students from any year level or junior doctors in postgraduate years one, two or three. We did not exclude any studies based on participants' age, nationality or pre‐existing health conditions. We included 10 studies with a total of 731 participants in the analysis.  
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
Overall, we did not identify any evidence of an effect of mindfulness‐based interventions on anxiety or depression symptoms. However, mindfulness‐based interventions appeared to have a small positive effect on stress and a borderline positive effect on burnout. We were unable to report if mindfulness‐based interventions had any effect on deliberate self‐harm, suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour as no studies examined these outcomes. Lastly, as many studies lacked longer‐term follow‐up of participants, it is not possible to comment on the long‐term effects of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors.  
We rated the overall certainty of evidence as 'low' or 'very low'. 
What should happen next? 
While there were no strong positive findings from the review, some results regarding mindfulness and stress outcomes suggest that there needs to be further research into mindfulness. Any future research should be rigorously designed, and ideally, include assessments of the longer‐term impact of mindfulness.   
","# Plain Language Summary: Mindfulness for Improving Mental Well-Being in Medical Students and Junior Doctors

## Plain Title
Does Mindfulness Help Medical Students and Junior Doctors Feel Better Mentally?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Being a doctor is hard work. Medical students and junior doctors face many challenges during their training years. They deal with stress from both their personal lives and their work. This can harm their mental health and well-being.

**Why does this matter?**

When medical students and junior doctors feel stressed or unwell, it affects them in two ways. First, their own health suffers. Second, it may affect how well they care for patients. We need to help these doctors-in-training stay mentally healthy.

**What is mindfulness?**

Mindfulness is a way to focus on the present moment. It helps people pay attention to their thoughts and feelings without judging them.

**Why study mindfulness?**

Medical students and junior doctors have very little free time. We need to know if mindfulness really works. If it does work, then spending time on it makes sense. No one had looked at all the research on mindfulness for this group before.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

The researchers wanted to know: Does mindfulness help medical students and junior doctors feel better mentally?

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

The researchers looked for all studies about mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors. They searched up to October 2021. They only included certain types of studies. These studies had to split people into groups using a random method. This is called a randomized controlled trial.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included medical students from any year of training. They also included junior doctors in their first, second, or third year after medical school. The studies did not limit people by age, country, or health problems. In total, 10 studies were included. These studies had 731 people in them.

**What did the studies look at?**

The studies looked at mental health problems like anxiety, depression, stress, and burnout. Burnout means feeling exhausted and overwhelmed by work.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The results were mixed. Mindfulness did not seem to help with anxiety or depression. However, mindfulness did seem to help a little bit with stress. It also might help a little with burnout, but the results were not clear.

The researchers wanted to know if mindfulness affected self-harm or suicidal thoughts. But none of the studies looked at these problems. So we do not know if mindfulness helps with these issues.

**What about long-term effects?**

Most studies did not follow people for a long time. So we do not know if mindfulness keeps helping people months or years later.

**How strong is this evidence?**

The researchers rated the evidence as ""low"" or ""very low"" quality. This means we cannot be very sure about the results. The studies may not have been done well enough. Or there may not have been enough studies.

**What do these results mean?**

Mindfulness might help medical students and junior doctors feel less stressed. But we need better research to know for sure. Right now, the evidence is not strong enough to say mindfulness definitely works.

**What comes next?**

More research is needed. Future studies should be done more carefully. They should follow people for longer periods of time. This will help us understand if mindfulness really helps. It will also show if the benefits last over time.

**Why is this important?**

Medical students and junior doctors need support for their mental health. Finding ways to help them is very important. It helps them stay healthy. It also helps them take better care of their patients.",10.1002-14651858.CD013740,"Mindfulness for improving mental well‐being in medical students and junior doctors

Review question 
How does key‐hole (laparoscopic) abdominal surgery compare with standard access (open) abdominal operation for people with pancreatic cancer? 
Background 
The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen that secretes pancreatic juice that aids digestion and contains cells that produce important hormones such as insulin. The pancreas can be divided into the head of the pancreas (right part of the pancreas) and the body and tail of the pancreas (left part or distal part of the pancreas). Distal pancreatic cancer is cancer of the body and/or tail of the pancreas. Removal of distal pancreatic cancer by surgery (distal pancreatectomy) is the preferred treatment for people with distal pancreatic cancers limited to the pancreas who are likely to withstand major surgery, because no other treatments have the potential to cure pancreatic cancer. Cancer can be removed through an abdominal operation, either laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy or open distal pancreatectomy. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is a relatively new procedure as compared with the well‐established open distal pancreatectomy. In operations on other parts of the body, laparoscopic surgery has been shown to reduce complications and length of hospital stay as compared with open surgery. However, concerns remain about the safety of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy in terms of complications after operation (postoperative complications). In addition, it is not clear whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy achieves the same amount of cancer clearance as is attained by open distal pancreatectomy. It also is not clear whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is better than open distal pancreatectomy in terms of earlier recovery after operation. We sought to resolve this issue by searching the medical literature for studies on this topic until June 2015. 
Study characteristics 
No randomised controlled trials have examined this topic. Randomised controlled trials are the best studies for finding out whether one treatment is better or worse than another because they ensure that similar types of people are receiving the treatments being assessed. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, we sought information from non‐randomised studies. We identified 12 non‐randomised studies that compared laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy in a total of 1576 patients. One of these studies did not provide results in a useable way. Thus, we included 11 studies in which a total of 1506 patients underwent distal pancreatectomy. Some 353 patients underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, and 1153 patients underwent open distal pancreatectomy. In all studies, historical information was collected from hospital records (retrospective studies). In general, historical information is less reliable than newly collected (prospective) information and findings of randomised controlled trials. 
Key results 
Differences in short‐term deaths, long‐term deaths, percentage of people with major complications, percentage of people with a pancreatic fistula (abnormal communication between the pancreas and other organs or the skin), recurrence of cancer at final time of follow‐up of participants, percentage of people with any complications and percentage of patients in whom cancer was not completely removed were imprecise. Average length of hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group than in the open group by about two days. However, this is not relevant until we can be sure that cancer cures are similar between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery. No studies have reported quality of life at any point in time, short‐term recurrence of cancer, time to return to normal activity, time to return to work or blood transfusion requirements. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was very low, mainly because it was not clear whether similar types of participants received laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy. In many studies, people with less extensive cancer received laparoscopic surgery, and those with more extensive cancer received open surgery. This makes study findings unreliable. Well‐designed randomised controlled trials are necessary if we are to obtain good quality evidence on this topic. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Key-Hole Surgery Versus Standard Surgery for Pancreatic Cancer

## Plain Title
Comparing Key-Hole Surgery to Standard Surgery for People with Pancreatic Cancer

## Rationale

**What is the pancreas and what does it do?**
The pancreas is an organ in your belly. It makes juices that help you digest food. It also makes important hormones like insulin.

**What is pancreatic cancer?**
The pancreas has two main parts. The right side is called the head. The left side is called the body and tail. Cancer can grow in any part of the pancreas. This summary focuses on cancer in the body and tail.

**Why is this condition a burden?**
Pancreatic cancer is very serious. Surgery is the only treatment that might cure it. Doctors remove the cancer through an operation. This is the best option for people whose cancer has not spread and who are healthy enough for major surgery.

**What are the two types of surgery?**
There are two ways to remove pancreatic cancer:
- Open surgery: Doctors make a large cut in the belly
- Key-hole surgery: Doctors make small cuts and use special tools

**Why was this study needed?**
Key-hole surgery is newer than open surgery. In other body parts, key-hole surgery helps people recover faster. They have fewer problems and go home sooner. But doctors are not sure if key-hole surgery is safe for pancreatic cancer. They also do not know if it removes all the cancer as well as open surgery does.

**What did researchers want to find out?**
Researchers wanted to know if key-hole surgery works as well as open surgery. They wanted to see which surgery is safer and helps people recover better.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This is not a single study. It is a review of many studies. Researchers looked at medical records from 11 different studies. They searched for all studies done until June 2015.

**Who was in these studies?**
A total of 1,506 people had surgery for pancreatic cancer:
- 353 people had key-hole surgery
- 1,153 people had open surgery

**What type of studies were these?**
These were not the best type of studies. The best studies are called randomized controlled trials. In those studies, similar people get different treatments by chance. This makes results more reliable. But no such studies existed for this topic. Instead, researchers looked at older hospital records. This type of information is less reliable.

**Important limitation:**
In many studies, people with less serious cancer got key-hole surgery. People with more serious cancer got open surgery. This makes it hard to compare the two surgeries fairly.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

Researchers could not find clear answers to most questions. The information was not reliable enough. Here is what they found:

**Deaths and complications:**
- Short-term deaths: No clear difference
- Long-term deaths: No clear difference
- Major problems after surgery: No clear difference
- Pancreatic fistula (a leak from the pancreas): No clear difference
- Any complications: No clear difference
- Cancer coming back: No clear difference
- Cancer not fully removed: No clear difference

**Hospital stay:**
People who had key-hole surgery went home about two days sooner. But this does not matter much yet. Doctors need to know if key-hole surgery cures cancer as well as open surgery does.

**Missing information:**
Studies did not report:
- Quality of life
- How soon cancer came back
- Time to return to normal activities
- Time to return to work
- Need for blood transfusions

**What do these results mean for patients?**
The evidence is too weak to say which surgery is better. Doctors cannot yet recommend one surgery over the other based on these studies.

**What is needed next?**
Better studies are needed. Researchers should do randomized controlled trials. In these studies, similar people would get different surgeries by chance. This would give more reliable answers.

**Conclusions:**
Right now, we do not have good evidence about key-hole surgery for pancreatic cancer. More research is needed before doctors can know which surgery is best for patients.",10.1002-14651858.CD011391,"Key‐hole (laparoscopic) versus standard access (open) abdominal operation for people with pancreatic cancer

44,10.1002-14651858.CD013198.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. Acute exacerbations punctuate the natural history of COPD and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and disease progression. Chronic airflow limitation is caused by a combination of small airways (bronchitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema), which can impact day‐to‐day activities and overall quality of life. In carefully selected patients with COPD, long‐term, prophylactic use of antibiotics may reduce bacterial load, inflammation of the airways, and the frequency of exacerbations. 
Objectives
To assess effects of different prophylactic antibiotics on exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events in people with COPD in three separate network meta‐analyses (NMAs), and to provide rankings of identified antibiotics. 
Search methods
To identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs), we searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials and clinical trials registries. We conducted the most recent search on 22 January 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs with a parallel design of at least 12 weeks' duration evaluating long‐term administration of antibiotics prophylactically compared with other antibiotics, or placebo, for patients with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
This Cochrane Review collected and updated pair‐wise data from two previous Cochrane Reviews. Searches were updated and additional studies included. We conducted three separate network meta‐analyses (NMAs) within a Bayesian framework to assess three outcomes: exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events. For quality of life, we collected data from St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Using previously validated methods, we selected the simplest model that could adequately fit the data for every analysis. We used threshold analysis to indicate which results were robust to potential biases, taking into account each study’s contributions to the overall results and network structure. Probability ranking was performed for each antibiotic class for exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events. 
Main results
Characteristics of studies and participants  
Eight trials were conducted at multiple sites that included hospital clinics or academic health centres. Seven were single‐centre trials conducted in hospital clinics. Two trials did not report settings. Trials durations ranged from 12 to 52 weeks. Most participants had moderate to severe disease. Mean age ranged from 64 years to 73 years, and more males were recruited (51% to 100%). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) ranged from 0.935 to 1.36 L. Most participants had previous exacerbations. Data from 12 studies were included in the NMAs (3405 participants; 16 treatment arms including placebo). Prophylactic antibiotics evaluated were macrolides (azithromycin and erythromycin), tetracyclines (doxycyclines), quinolones (moxifloxacin) and macrolides plus tetracyclines (roxithromycin plus doxycycline). 
Risk of bias and threshold analysis  
Most studies were at low risk across domains, except detection bias, for which only seven studies were judged at low risk. In the threshold analysis for exacerbations, all comparisons in which one antibiotic was compared with another were robust to sampling variation, especially macrolide comparisons. Comparisons of classes with placebo were sensitive to potential bias, especially macrolide versus placebo, therefore, any bias in the comparison was likely to favour the active class, so any adjustment would bring the estimated relative effect closer to the null value, thus quinolone may become the best class to prevent exacerbations. 
Exacerbations  
Nine studies were included (2732 participants) in this NMA (exacerbations analysed as time to first exacerbation or people with one or more exacerbations). Macrolides and quinolones reduced exacerbations. Macrolides had a greater effect in reducing exacerbations compared with placebo (macrolides: hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.60 to 0.75; quinolones: HR 0.89, 95% CrI 0.75 to 1.04), resulting in 127 fewer people per 1000 experiencing exacerbations on macrolides. The difference in exacerbations between tetracyclines and placebo was uncertain (HR 1.29, 95% CrI 0.66 to 2.41). Macrolides ranked first (95% CrI first to second), with quinolones ranked second (95% CrI second to third). Tetracyclines ranked fourth, which was lower than placebo (ranked third). Contributing studies were considered as low risk of bias in a threshold analysis. 
Quality of life (SGRQ)  
Seven studies were included (2237 participants) in this NMA. SGRQ scores improved with macrolide treatment compared with placebo (fixed effect‐fixed class effect: mean difference (MD) ‐2.30, 95% CrI ‐3.61 to ‐0.99), but the mean difference did not reach the minimally clinical important difference (MCID) of 4 points. Tetracyclines and quinolones did not improve quality of life any more than placebo, and we did not detect a difference between antibiotic classes. 
Serious adverse events  
Nine studies were included (3180 participants) in the NMA. Macrolides reduced the odds of a serious adverse event compared with placebo (fixed effect‐fixed class effect: odds ratio (OR) 0.76, 95% CrI 0.62 to 0.93). There was probably little to no difference in the effect of quinolone compared with placebo or tetracycline plus macrolide compared with placebo. There was probably little to no difference in serious adverse events between quinolones or tetracycline plus macrolide. With macrolide treatment 49 fewer people per 1000 experienced a serious adverse event compared with those given placebo. Macrolides ranked first, followed by quinolones. Tetracycline did not rank better than placebo. 
Drug resistance  
Ten studies reported drug resistance. Results were not combined due to variation in outcome measures. All studies concluded that prophylactic antibiotic administration was associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance. 
Authors' conclusions
This NMA evaluated the safety and efficacy of different antibiotics used prophylactically for COPD patients. Compared to placebo, prolonged administration of macrolides (ranked first) appeared beneficial in prolonging the time to next exacerbation, improving quality of life, and reducing serious adverse events. No clear benefits were associated with use of quinolones or tetracyclines. In addition, antibiotic resistance was a concern and could not be thoroughly assessed in this review. Given the trade‐off between effectiveness, safety, and risk of antibiotic resistance, prophylactic administration of antibiotics may be best reserved for selected patients, such as those experiencing frequent exacerbations. However, none of the eligible studies excluded patients with previously isolated non‐tuberculous mycobacteria, which would contraindicate prophylactic administration of antibiotics, due to the risk of developing resistant non‐tuberculous mycobacteria. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using Antibiotics Long-Term to Prevent Flare-Ups in People with Lung Disease (COPD)

## Plain Title
Can Taking Antibiotics Every Day Help Prevent Flare-Ups in People with COPD?

## Rationale

**What is COPD?**
COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is a long-term lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. The airways in the lungs become damaged and narrow. This happens in two ways: the small airways get swollen (like bronchitis), and parts of the lung get destroyed (called emphysema).

**What problems does COPD cause?**
People with COPD have trouble breathing every day. This makes it hard to do normal activities. They also have flare-ups, called exacerbations. During a flare-up, breathing gets much worse. These flare-ups can lead to hospital visits. They can make the disease worse over time. Some flare-ups can be life-threatening.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors think that giving antibiotics every day might help some COPD patients. Antibiotics kill germs called bacteria. Taking them daily might reduce bacteria in the lungs. This could reduce swelling in the airways. It might also prevent flare-ups from happening.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to find out which antibiotics work best. They looked at whether antibiotics could prevent flare-ups. They also checked if antibiotics improved quality of life. Finally, they looked at serious side effects.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a single study. Researchers looked at 17 different studies done by other scientists. They combined the results to compare different antibiotics. This method is called a network meta-analysis.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included 3,405 people with COPD. Most had moderate to severe disease. This means their breathing problems were quite bad. Most people were between 64 and 73 years old. More men than women joined these studies (about half to all were men). Most had experienced flare-ups before.

**What antibiotics were tested?**
Researchers looked at four types of antibiotics:
- Macrolides (like azithromycin and erythromycin)
- Tetracyclines (like doxycycline)
- Quinolones (like moxifloxacin)
- A combination of macrolides plus tetracyclines

Some people got a placebo. A placebo is a fake pill with no medicine.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies lasted between 12 weeks and 52 weeks. This means people took antibiotics (or placebo) every day for 3 months to 1 year.

## Results

**What did the study find about flare-ups?**
Macrolides worked best at preventing flare-ups. People taking macrolides had fewer flare-ups than those taking placebo. Out of every 1,000 people, 127 fewer had flare-ups when taking macrolides. Quinolones also helped reduce flare-ups, but not as much. Tetracyclines did not seem to help.

**What about quality of life?**
Macrolides slightly improved quality of life. However, the improvement was small. It was not big enough to make a meaningful difference in daily life. Tetracyclines and quinolones did not improve quality of life.

**Were there serious side effects?**
Macrolides actually reduced serious side effects. Out of every 1,000 people, 49 fewer had serious problems when taking macrolides compared to placebo. Quinolones and the combination treatment did not show clear differences from placebo.

**What about antibiotic resistance?**
This is an important concern. When people take antibiotics for a long time, bacteria can become resistant. This means the antibiotics stop working. All 10 studies that looked at this found that resistance developed. This is a serious problem.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
Macrolides ranked first overall. They helped prevent flare-ups, improved quality of life slightly, and reduced serious side effects. However, the risk of antibiotic resistance is a major concern. Because of this, doctors should only give daily antibiotics to certain patients. The best candidates are people who have frequent flare-ups. Doctors must weigh the benefits against the risk of creating resistant bacteria.

**Important safety note:**
People with certain lung infections should not take daily antibiotics. This includes people with non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections. Taking antibiotics could make these infections resistant to treatment.",10.1002-14651858.CD013198,"Prophylactic antibiotics for people with COPD
Review question 
Which preventative antibiotic is effective and safe for reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life, and reducing serious side effects in people with COPD? 
What is COPD? 
COPD is a lung condition that can cause long‐term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Flare‐ups (so‐called exacerbations) can be triggered by infection or inflammation, causing worsening symptoms and lung damage. Frequent exacerbations can lead to reduced quality of life and can increase the risk of death. 
Why did we do this review? 
We wanted to find out if one type of preventative antibiotic was better than another in reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life, and reducing side effects. We did this by using information from two previous reviews and comparing different antibiotics with each other, and with a control treatment (called placebo), by creating networks. As information was limited, the networks allowed us to combine information and determine the best preventative antibiotics by ranking them in order of ability to reduce exacerbations, improve quality of life, and reduce serious side effects. 
What evidence did we find? 
We tested three types of antibiotics: macrolides, quinolones, and tetracyclines. Macrolides were better in reducing exacerbations compared to control treatment. There was no clear difference in exacerbations when quinolone or tetracycline was compared with a control treatment. Tetracyclines were ranked lower than placebo in reducing exacerbations. We used the data for each antibiotic group to rank antibiotic groups in order of their ability to reduce exacerbations. We found that macrolides ranked first, followed by quinolones (second). Tetracyclines were ranked fourth and were not better than control treatment (ranked third). 
Macrolides improved quality of life compared with control treatment. Quinolones did not appear to impact quality of life, and tetracyclines may have been associated with worsening quality of life compared to control treatment. 
Macrolides were more effective in reducing serious unwanted events. There was no clear benefit for serious unwanted events with quinolone, tetracycline, or combined macrolide plus tetracycline compared with control treatment. 
We could not clearly show benefit or harm of preventative antibiotic use for microbial resistance. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did not find any concerns about the ways in which studies were carried out, except that for some studies, people collecting the information knew (1) which patient was included in which treatment group, and (2) patient results when treatments were completed. Overall, the numerical information was robust and was unlikely to be influenced by differences noted between individual studies. 
Conclusion 
We found that exacerbations were reduced, quality of life was improved, and unwanted events were fewer with macrolides compared with control treatment. We could not determine whether quinolones or tetracyclines were of benefit compared with control treatment. Macrolides were ranked highest, followed by quinolones, which ranked second. Tetracyclines were no better than control treatment (ranked fourth and third, respectively). Although these NMAs show some benefit of using macrolides, they are based on a limited number of studies, and concerns remain about antibiotic resistance with long‐term use of antibiotics.

45,10.1002-14651858.CD013812-abstract.txt,"Background
In response to the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the impact of COVID‐19, national and subnational governments implemented a variety of measures in order to control the spread of the virus and the associated disease. While these measures were imposed with the intention of controlling the pandemic, they were also associated with severe psychosocial, societal, and economic implications on a societal level. One setting affected heavily by these measures is the school setting. By mid‐April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world’s student population. In consideration of the adverse consequences of school closures, many countries around the world reopened their schools in the months after the initial closures. To safely reopen schools and keep them open, governments implemented a broad range of measures. 
The evidence with regards to these measures, however, is heterogeneous, with a multitude of study designs, populations, settings, interventions and outcomes being assessed. To make sense of this heterogeneity, we conducted a rapid scoping review (8 October to 5 November 2020). This rapid scoping review is intended to serve as a precursor to a systematic review of effectiveness, which will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA‐ScR) checklist and was registered with the Open Science Framework. 
Objectives
To identify and comprehensively map the evidence assessing the impacts of measures implemented in the school setting to reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the SARS‐CoV‐2/COVID‐19 pandemic, with particular focus on the types of measures implemented in different school settings, the outcomes used to measure their impacts and the study types used to assess these. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the CDC COVID‐19 Research Articles Downloadable Database for preprints, and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 8 October 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included studies that assessed the impact of measures implemented in the school setting. Eligible populations were populations at risk of becoming infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, or developing COVID‐19 disease, or both, and included people both directly and indirectly impacted by interventions, including students, teachers, other school staff, and contacts of these groups, as well as the broader community. We considered all types of empirical studies, which quantitatively assessed impact including epidemiological studies, modelling studies, mixed‐methods studies, and diagnostic studies that assessed the impact of relevant interventions beyond diagnostic test accuracy. Broad outcome categories of interest included infectious disease transmission‐related outcomes, other harmful or beneficial health‐related outcomes, and societal, economic, and ecological implications. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data from included studies in a standardized manner, and mapped them to categories within our a priori logic model where possible. Where not possible, we inductively developed new categories. In line with standard expectations for scoping reviews, the review provides an overview of the existing evidence regardless of methodological quality or risk of bias, and was not designed to synthesize effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterize strength of evidence (GRADE). 
Main results
We included 42 studies that assessed measures implemented in the school setting. The majority of studies used mathematical modelling designs (n = 31), while nine studies used observational designs, and two studies used experimental or quasi‐experimental designs. Studies conducted in real‐world contexts or using real data focused on the WHO European region (EUR; n = 20), the WHO region of the Americas (AMR; n = 13), the West Pacific region (WPR; n = 6), and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR; n = 1). One study conducted a global assessment and one did not report on data from, or that were applicable to, a specific country. 
Three broad intervention categories emerged from the included studies: organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (n = 36), structural/environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (n = 11), and surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (n = 19). Most studies assessed SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission‐related outcomes (n = 29), while others assessed healthcare utilization (n = 8), other health outcomes (n = 3), and societal, economic, and ecological outcomes (n = 5). Studies assessed both harmful and beneficial outcomes across all outcome categories. 
Authors' conclusions
We identified a heterogeneous and complex evidence base of measures implemented in the school setting. This review is an important first step in understanding the available evidence and will inform the development of rapid reviews on this topic. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
What School Safety Measures Were Used During COVID-19 to Keep Schools Open?

## Rationale

### What is COVID-19 and why did it affect schools?

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. This virus spreads easily from person to person. When COVID-19 started spreading around the world, governments tried to stop it. One way they did this was by closing schools.

By April 2020, schools closed in 192 countries. This affected more than 9 out of 10 students in the world. School closures caused many problems. Students missed learning time. Families faced challenges with childcare. Many children lost access to school meals. Mental health problems increased for students and families.

### Why was this study needed?

Because school closures caused so many problems, countries started reopening schools. But they needed ways to keep students and teachers safe. Governments used many different safety measures in schools. However, no one had collected all the information about these measures in one place.

### What did researchers want to learn?

Researchers wanted to find and organize all available studies about school safety measures during COVID-19. They wanted to know what measures schools used. They wanted to know how researchers measured whether these measures worked. This information would help create guidelines for schools around the world.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

This was not a regular research study with patients. Instead, researchers searched for all existing studies about school safety measures during COVID-19. This type of study is called a scoping review. It maps out what research exists on a topic.

Researchers searched medical databases and COVID-19 research collections. They looked for studies published up to October 8, 2020. They included any study that looked at safety measures in schools during the pandemic.

### What types of studies did researchers find?

Researchers found 42 studies. Most studies used computer models to predict what might happen. Some studies looked at real schools and real data. Studies came from many parts of the world. Most came from Europe and North and South America.

The studies looked at different age groups in schools. This included young children and teenagers. Studies included students, teachers, school staff, and their families.

### What safety measures did the studies examine?

Studies looked at three main types of school safety measures:

**Organizational measures:** These changed how schools operated. Examples included keeping students in small groups, reducing class sizes, and having some students learn from home.

**Structural measures:** These changed school buildings and spaces. Examples included improving air flow and cleaning surfaces more often.

**Surveillance measures:** These involved testing and tracking. Examples included checking students for symptoms and testing people for the virus.

## Results

### What did researchers find?

Researchers found many different studies about school safety measures. The studies used different methods. They looked at different outcomes. They studied different populations.

Most studies looked at whether safety measures reduced virus spread. Some studies looked at how measures affected healthcare use. A few studies examined other health effects. Some studies looked at social and economic impacts.

Studies examined both good and bad effects of school measures. This included benefits like reduced infections. It also included harms like learning loss or mental health problems.

### Why does this matter?

This review organized a large amount of information about school safety measures. It showed what types of research exist. It identified what questions researchers studied.

This information is important for several reasons. It helps researchers understand what we know about keeping schools safe during pandemics. It shows where more research is needed. It provides a foundation for creating school safety guidelines.

### What comes next?

This review is a first step. Researchers will use this information to conduct more detailed reviews. Those reviews will look more closely at whether specific safety measures work. The World Health Organization will use this information to create guidelines for schools worldwide.

### What are the limitations?

This review only mapped what studies exist. It did not judge whether studies were high quality. It did not combine results to say which measures work best. Those questions will be answered in future reviews.

**Word count: 682**",10.1002-14651858.CD013812,"Which school‐based measures designed to contain the COVID‐19 pandemic have been evaluated to date, and how were they evaluated? 
Why is this question important? 
To combat the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the impact of COVID‐19, countries worldwide have taken a variety of public health measures. In many countries, shutting schools was one of the earliest responses. By mid‐April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world’s student population. This severely disrupted school, family and work life, with likely negative impacts including: 
‐ a worsening of children’s and adolescents’ health and well‐being;‐ increases in inequalities between children and adolescents from disadvantaged and more privileged backgrounds;‐ possible decreased parental income and job security;‐ possible loss of parental economic productivity. 
Given the potential negative consequences of school closures, many countries have since reopened schools. To avoid disease transmission among students, between staff and students, and beyond, a range of school‐based measures have been put in place. These include: 
‐ students and staff wearing face masks and regularly washing their hands;‐ adapting school activities (for example, not singing in music classes);‐ improving ventilation systems; and‐ screening suspected cases of infection. 
To date, we know little about which school‐based measures designed to contain COVID‐19 have been evaluated, and how they have been evaluated. It is important to find this out, so that, in time, we can compare the effectiveness of different measures and inform future policy guidelines. 
We set out to identify and map the evidence on school‐based measures to contain COVID‐19. This work is intended to form the basis of a future review about the effectiveness of these measures. This review will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
How did we identify and map the evidence? 
First, we searched for studies that evaluated any intervention set in schools designed to prevent the spread of COVID‐19. We considered all types of studies, and a broad range of outcomes, including: 
‐ infectious disease transmission;‐ other harmful or beneficial effects on health;‐ wider implications for society, the economy, and the population. 
We then grouped studies according to how similar or different they were. This allowed us to gauge: 
‐ which types of study have been used to evaluate measures to date;‐ where studies have been conducted;‐ which types of intervention have been evaluated; and‐ which outcomes have been studied. 
What did we find? 
We found 42 studies.
Type of study 
Thirty‐one studies used mathematical modelling designs, to predict the effects of measures on populations. Two studies used experimental designs, in which researchers divide people or settings into groups to compare the effects of different measures. Nine studies used observational designs, in which researchers simply observed the effect of the intervention. 
Study setting 
Studies were conducted in Europe (20 studies), North and South America (13 studies), the West Pacific (6 studies), and the Eastern Mediterranean (1 study). Most studies evaluated measures in more than one school setting (for example, primary education and secondary education). Three studies focused on secondary schools. 
Type of intervention 
Studies evaluated three broad types of measure:
1. Organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (36 studies): these included: 
‐ measures designed to limit risks of disease transmission between people who come into contact with each other (such as face‐masks and physical distancing policies); and‐ measures to reduce opportunities for contact (for example, staggered arrival, break and departure times). 
2. Structural or environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (11 studies): for example, dividing up school playgrounds or improving air circulation. 
3. Surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (19 studies): these included: 
‐ testing, tracing, and symptom screening; and‐ isolation of confirmed cases or quarantine of suspected cases. 
Outcomes studied 
Studies assessed the effects of measures on:
‐ SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission (29 studies), including the number of new cases or the average number of people to whom one infected person will pass the virus (reproduction number R);‐ healthcare use (8 studies), for example, the number of hospitalizations;‐ other health outcomes (3 studies), for example, the risk of developing hand eczema (a skin condition); and‐ societal, economic, and other population‐level outcomes (5 studies), including cost. 
What are the implications of our findings? 
A wide range of school‐based measures designed to contain COVID‐19 have been evaluated to date. To evaluate these, researchers have used different methods and investigated different outcomes. This review is an important first step in gauging what evidence is available, and will inform future rapid reviews on this topic.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD‐1/PD‐L1 axis have changed the first‐line treatment of people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Single‐agent pembrolizumab (a PD‐1 inhibitor) is currently the standard of care as monotherapy in patients with PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50%, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy when PD‐L1 expression is less than 50%. Atezolizumab (PD‐L1 inhibitor) has also been approved in combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab (an anti‐angiogenic antibody) in first‐line NSCLC regardless of PD‐L1 expression. The combination of first‐line PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitors with anti‐CTLA‐4 antibodies has also been shown to improve survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, particularly in people with high tumour mutational burden (TMB). The association of ipilimumab (an anti CTLA4) and nivolumab (PD‐1 inhibitor) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in all patients with PD‐L1 expression ≥1%. Although these antibodies are currently used in clinical practice, some questions remain unanswered, such as the best‐treatment strategy, the role of different biomarkers for treatment selection and the effectiveness of immunotherapy according to specific clinical characteristics. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of first‐line immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), as monotherapy or in combination, compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab for people with advanced NSCLC, according to the level of PD‐L1 expression. 
Search methods
We performed an electronic search of the main databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase) from inception until 31 December 2020 and conferences meetings from 2015 onwards. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy or safety of first‐line ICI treatment for adults with advanced NSCLC who had not previously received any anticancer treatment. We included trials comparing single‐ or double‐ICI treatment to standard first‐line therapy (platinum‐based chemotherapy +/‐ bevacizumab). All data come from ‘international multicentre studies involving adults, age 18 or over, with histologically‐confirmed stage IV NSCLC. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed the search results and a fourth review author resolved any disagreements. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS); secondary outcomes were overall objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v 1.1, grade 3 to 5 treatment‐related adverse events (AEs) (CTCAE v 5.0) and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). We performed meta‐analyses where appropriate using the random‐effects model for hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and used the I² statistic to investigate heterogeneity. 
Main results
Main results 
We identified 15 trials for inclusion, seven completed and eight ongoing trials. We obtained data for 5893 participants from seven trials comparing first‐line single‐ (six trials) or double‐ (two trials) agent ICI with platinum‐based chemotherapy, one trial comparing both first‐line single‐ and double‐agent ICsI with platinum‐based chemotherapy. All trials were at low risk of selection and detection bias, some were classified at high risk of performance, attrition or other source of bias. The overall certainty of evidence according to GRADE ranged from moderate‐to‐low because of risk of bias, inconsistency, or imprecision. The majority of the included trials reported their outcomes by PD‐L1 expressions, with PD‐L1 ≥ 50 being considered the most clinically useful cut‐off level for decision makers. Also, iIn order to avoid overlaps between various PDL‐1 expressions we prioritised the review outcomes according to PD‐L1 ≥ 50. 
Single‐agent ICIIn the PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50% group single‐agent ICI probably improved OS compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.76, 6 RCTs, 2111 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). In this group, single‐agent ICI also may improve PFS (HR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.88, 5 RCTs, 1886 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and ORR (risk ratio (RR):1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75, 4 RCTs, 1672 participants, low‐certainty evidence). HRQoL data were available for only one study including only people with PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50%, which suggested that single‐agent ICI may improve HRQoL at 15 weeks compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 1.51, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.10, 1 RCT, 297 participants, low‐certainty evidence).In the included studies, treatment‐related AEs were not reported according to PD‐L1 expression levels. Grade 3‐4 AEs may be less frequent with single‐agent ICI compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 0.41, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.50, I² = 62%, 5 RCTs, 3346 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
More information about efficacy of single‐agent ICI compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy according to the level of PD‐L1 expression and to TMB status or specific clinical characteristics is available in the full text. 
Double‐agent ICI Double‐ICI treatment probably prolonged OS compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy in people with PD‐L1 expression ≥50% (HR: 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.89 2 RCTs, 612 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence).Trials did not report data on HRQoL, PFS and ORR according to PD‐L1 groups.Treatment related AEs were not reported according to PD‐L1 expression levels. The frequency of grade 3‐4 AEs may not differ between double‐ICI treatment and platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09, I² = 81%, 2 RCTs, 1869 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
More information about efficacy of double‐agent ICI according to the level of PD‐L1 expression and to TMB status is available in the full text. 
Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence in this review suggests that single‐agent ICI in people with NSCLC and PD‐L1 ≥50% probably leads to a higher overall survival rate and may lead to a higher progression‐free survival and overall response rate when compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy and may also lead to a lower rate of adverse events and higher HRQoL. Combined ICI in people with NSCLC and PD‐L1 ≥50% also probably leads to a higher overall survival rate when compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy, but its effect on progression‐free survival, overall response rate and HRQoL is unknown due to a lack of data. The rate of adverse events may not differ between groups. 
This review used to be a living review. It is transitioned out of living mode because current research is exploring ICI in association with chemotherapy or other immunotherapeutic drugs versus ICI as single agent rather than platinum based chemotherapy.

## Plain Title

Testing immune system drugs as first treatment for people with advanced lung cancer

## Rationale

**What is advanced non-small cell lung cancer?**

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. Advanced lung cancer means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. This is a serious illness that can cause many problems for patients and is hard to treat.

**What are immune checkpoint inhibitors?**

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are drugs that help the body's own immune system fight cancer. They work by removing the ""brakes"" on immune cells, allowing them to attack cancer cells better.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors have been using chemotherapy drugs made from platinum to treat advanced lung cancer. Now, newer immune system drugs are available. Doctors need to know if these immune drugs work better than chemotherapy. They also need to know which patients will benefit most from these drugs.

**What is PD-L1?**

PD-L1 is a protein found on some cancer cells. Doctors can test how much PD-L1 is on the cancer. This test helps predict which patients might respond better to immune drugs.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to find out if immune drugs work better than standard chemotherapy. They wanted to know if these drugs help patients live longer and have fewer side effects. They also wanted to know if the amount of PD-L1 matters.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of multiple studies. Researchers looked at 15 different trials. They collected data from 7 completed trials with 5,893 patients.

**Who was in these studies?**

All patients were adults aged 18 or older. They all had advanced lung cancer that had spread. None had received cancer treatment before. The studies included patients from many countries around the world.

**What treatments were compared?**

Researchers compared three types of treatment:
- Single immune drug alone
- Two immune drugs together
- Standard chemotherapy with platinum drugs

**How long did the studies last?**

The length varied by study. Patients stayed in studies until their cancer got worse or they had serious side effects.

## Results

**What did researchers find about single immune drugs?**

For patients with high PD-L1 levels (50% or more):

Single immune drugs probably helped patients live longer than chemotherapy. The cancer also probably took longer to get worse. More patients responded to treatment. Patients had fewer serious side effects. One study showed patients felt better in their daily lives.

**What about using two immune drugs together?**

For patients with high PD-L1 levels:

Two immune drugs together probably helped patients live longer than chemotherapy. Researchers did not have enough information about other benefits. Side effects were similar to chemotherapy.

**What about side effects?**

Single immune drugs caused fewer serious side effects than chemotherapy. About 2 out of 5 patients had serious side effects with immune drugs. About 5 out of 5 patients had serious side effects with chemotherapy.

With two immune drugs, serious side effects were similar to chemotherapy.

**What do these results mean?**

For patients with high PD-L1 levels, immune drugs work better than chemotherapy. Patients live longer and often feel better. Single immune drugs cause fewer serious side effects than chemotherapy.

**Why is this important?**

This review helps doctors choose the best first treatment for lung cancer patients. Testing for PD-L1 levels helps identify which patients benefit most from immune drugs.

**What comes next?**

Researchers are now studying combinations of immune drugs with chemotherapy. They are also testing other new treatment approaches.

Review question 
Is immunotherapy more effective and less toxic than chemotherapy for people diagnosed with non‐small cell lung cancer (a subtype of lung cancer) who have not previously been treated and who are not suitable for curative treatment? 
Background 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths and non‐small cell lung cancer represent more than 85% of all lung cancer cases. Curative surgery and radiotherapy are not treatment options when the disease is at an advanced stage and until recently these people were offered chemotherapy. Since 2016, immunotherapies (antibodies able to stimulate the immune system against cancer cells) have been shown to improve survival for these patients. 
Side effects of immunotherapies are mainly inflammation of the tissues caused by the activation of the immune system against different organs, while chemotherapy usually causes a reduction in the white blood cells and red blood cells, hair loss, nausea and vomiting.In this Cochrane Review, we tried to find out how effective and safe immunotherapies (given alone or as combinations) are compared to standard chemotherapy for people with non‐small cell lung cancer who are not suitable for possibly curative treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the main databases and records of conference meetings up to 31st December 2020. We included seven studies (5893 participants) comparing immunotherapies (antibodies that interact with specific proteins called immune checkpoints) with chemotherapy for people with non‐small cell lung cancer not previously treated. 
Key results 
We reported the results by PD‐L1 levels (a protein produced by the tumour or immune cells and bound by immune checkpoint inhibitors) 
In people with more than 50% of tumour/immune cells expressing PD‐L1 protein, single immunotherapy might improve survival with fewer side effects. In addition, treatment with combined immunotherapies may improve survival in both people with high expression of PD‐L1 protein.The rate of toxic effects may be the same for people treated with combined immunotherapies or chemotherapy. 
Certainty of evidence 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low.
Conclusions 
For people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer with a high expression of PD‐L1 protein, immunotherapies alone or combinations of immunotherapies prolonged life compared to chemotherapy. The frequency of side effects may be lower with the use of immunotherapies alone compared to chemotherapy. The frequency of side effects may not differ between combinations of immunotherapies and chemotherapy.

Review question: In newborn infants who require a central venous catheter, does the use of antiseptic or antibiotic catheter dressing, compared to no dressing, reduce catheter‐related infections? 
Background: Central venous catheters (CVCs) are small tubes inserted into the vein to give fluids, medication and intravenous nutrition to sick patients. The risks of CVCs are well‐known, and can cause infections, which may result in death or serious illnesses. Newborn infants are vulnerable, as they on the one hand require the CVCs to sustain life, and on the other hand are at high risks of the complications, due to their thin skin and poorly‐developed immune system. 
Several measures have been developed to reduce infections in newborn infants. These include hand hygiene for caregivers, skin cleaning for the infants, antibiotics and modification of the catheters including the use of antiseptic or antibiotic‐coated catheter dressing or patch that could be placed on the skin at the CVC insertion site. While promising, these measures need on‐going evaluation. In this review, we synthesized up‐to‐date evidence on the effectiveness and safety of antiseptic or antibiotic dressing as a part of CVC care in sick newborn infants. 
Search date: We performed a search in multiple medical databases in September 2015. 
Study characteristics: Three studies (total participants: 855) fit our inclusion criteria. There were two main comparisons: i) chlorhexidine dressing and alcohol skin cleansing against standard polyurethane dressing and povidone‐iodine skin cleansing (from one large study), and ii) silver‐alginate patch against a control group without patch (from two smaller studies). The quality of the included studies are high, except that the people closely involved in the trials such as the care personnel were not masked from knowing whether or not the infants in the study were given antiseptic or antibiotic dressing, which might have affected their recording or interpretation of the results. 
Study funding sources: One of the studies was funded in part by Johnson and Johnson Medical; Children's Foundation; Children's Hospital, Milwaukee and National Institutes of Health. Another study was funded by the Vanderbilt NICU Research Fund. Funding source was not stated in the third study. 
Key results: In our main findings, chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol skin cleansing made no difference to catheter‐related blood stream infection (CRBSI) and blood stream infection (""sepsis"") without an identifiable source, although it significantly reduced the chance of micro‐organisms lodging in the CVCs (""catheter colonisation""), with an average of 9% reduction in risk among newborn infants with a baseline risk of 24% (1 study, 655 infants). However, infants who received chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol skin cleansing were more likely to develop skin irritation (""contact dermatitis""), as 19 out of 335 infants (5.7%) in the chlorhexidine group developed this complication compared to none in the group that received standard dressing/povidone‐iodine cleansing. However, it was unclear whether the dressing or the alcohol solution was mainly responsible for the skin irritation, as the other group did not use alcohol solution for skin cleansing. In the other comparison, silver‐alginate patch made no overall differences in CRBSI and mortality compared to no dressing, neither did it cause any adverse reaction. 
Quality of the evidence: There was moderate‐quality evidence for all the major outcomes. The major factor that affected the quality of evidence was the lack of precision in the result estimates, as the calculated plausible range of the effects (the 95% confidence intervals) were wide. 
Conclusions: Chlorhexidine CVC dressing with alcohol skin cleansing posed a high risk of skin irritation against a modest reduction in catheter colonisation. For silver‐alginate patch, evidence is still insufficient for a clear picture of benefit an harm. We have made recommendations for future research that evaluate these interventions.

Special Dressings on Tubes That Go Into Veins: Do They Help Prevent Infections in Newborn Babies?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?

Newborn babies who are very sick often need small tubes put into their veins. Doctors call these tubes central venous catheters or CVCs. These tubes help doctors give babies fluids, medicine, and food through the vein.

However, these tubes can cause problems. Germs can get into the tube and cause infections. These infections can make babies very sick or even cause death.

Newborn babies face extra risks. They need these tubes to stay alive. But their skin is very thin. Their bodies cannot fight germs well yet. This makes infections more likely.

### Why was this study needed?

Doctors have tried many ways to prevent infections in babies with these tubes. They wash their hands carefully. They clean the baby's skin. They give antibiotics. They also try special dressings or patches that go on the skin where the tube enters.

Some of these dressings contain germ-fighting medicine. They might help stop infections. But doctors need to know if these dressings really work. They also need to know if the dressings are safe for babies.

This study looked at all the research done so far. The goal was to find out if these special dressings help prevent infections in newborn babies.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

Researchers searched medical records in September 2015. They looked for studies that tested special dressings on newborn babies with tubes in their veins.

They found three studies. These studies included 855 babies total.

The studies tested two types of special dressings:

**First type:** One large study tested chlorhexidine dressing with alcohol skin cleaning. This was compared to standard dressing with povidone-iodine skin cleaning. Chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine are both germ-fighting medicines.

**Second type:** Two smaller studies tested silver-alginate patches. Silver can kill germs. These patches were compared to no patch at all.

All the babies in these studies were newborns who needed tubes in their veins. The studies were well done. However, the nurses and doctors knew which babies got the special dressings. This might have affected how they recorded the results.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**For chlorhexidine dressing with alcohol cleaning:**

The special dressing did not reduce serious blood infections. It also did not reduce infections that spread through the whole body.

However, it did help in one way. Fewer germs grew on the tubes. About 9 out of 100 fewer babies had germs on their tubes compared to standard care. This finding came from one study with 655 babies.

But there was a problem. The chlorhexidine dressing with alcohol caused skin irritation. About 6 out of 100 babies got red, irritated skin. None of the babies who got standard care had this problem.

Researchers are not sure what caused the skin irritation. It might have been the dressing. It might have been the alcohol used to clean the skin.

**For silver-alginate patches:**

These patches did not reduce serious blood infections. They did not reduce deaths. They also did not cause skin problems.

There is not enough information yet to know if these patches help or harm babies.

### What do these results mean?

Chlorhexidine dressing with alcohol cleaning has both good and bad effects. It reduces germs on tubes. But it causes skin irritation in some babies. The benefit is small. The risk of skin irritation is real.

For silver-alginate patches, more research is needed. Right now, doctors do not have enough information to know if these patches work.

### Quality of the evidence

The quality of evidence was moderate. This means the results are fairly reliable. However, some results were not very precise. The true effects might be different from what the studies showed.

### Conclusions

Special dressings might help reduce germs on tubes. But they can also cause skin problems in newborn babies.

Humour‐based interventions are defined as any intervention that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression, or appreciation of the absurdity or incongruity of life's situations. Humour‐based interventions can be implemented in different settings, including hospitals, nursing homes and day care centres. They have been posed as an adjunct to usual care for people with schizophrenia, but a summary of the evidence is lacking. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of humour‐based interventions as an add‐on intervention to standard care for people with schizophrenia. 
Search methods
On 31 July 2019 and 10 February 2021 we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study‐based register of trials, which is based on CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.Gov, Embase, ISRCTN, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and WHO ICTRP. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing humour‐based interventions with active controls, other psychological interventions, or standard care for people with schizophrenia. We excluded studies fulfilling our prespecified selection criteria but without useable data from further quantitative synthesis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality, following the guidance from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For binary outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean differences (MDs) and their 95% CIs. We assessed risks of bias for included studies and created summary of findings tables using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included three studies in this review for qualitative synthesis, although one study did not report any relevant outcomes. We therefore include two studies (n = 96) in our quantitative synthesis. No data were available on the following prespecified primary outcomes: clinically‐important change in general mental state, clinically‐important change in negative symptoms, clinically‐important change in overall quality of life, and adverse effects. As compared with active control, humour‐based interventions may not improve the average endpoint score of a general mental state scale (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score: MD −1.70, 95% CI −17.01 to 13.61; 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence); positive symptoms (PANSS positive symptom score: MD 0.00, 95% CI −2.58 to 2.58; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence), negative symptoms (PANSS negative symptom score: MD −0.70, 95% CI −4.22 to 2.82; 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence) and anxiety (State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI): MD −2.60, 95% CI −5.76 to 0.56; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence). Due to the small sample size, we remain uncertain about the effect of humour‐based interventions on leaving the study early as compared with active control (no event, 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence). On the other hand, humour‐based interventions may reduce depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): MD −6.20, 95% CI −12.08 to −0.32; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence). Compared with standard care, humour‐based interventions may not improve  depressive symptoms (BDI second edition: MD 0.80, 95% CI −2.64 to 4.24; 1 study, 59 participants; low certainty of evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of humour‐based interventions on leaving the study early for any reason compared with standard care (risk ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.80; 1 study, 66 participants; very low certainty of evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We are currently uncertain whether the evidence supports the use of humour‐based interventions in people with schizophrenia. Future research with rigorous and transparent methodology investigating clinically important outcomes is warranted. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Humor-Based Treatments for People with Schizophrenia

## Plain Title
Can humor help treat people with schizophrenia?

## Rationale

**What is schizophrenia?**
Schizophrenia is a mental health condition. It affects how a person thinks, feels, and acts. People with schizophrenia may have trouble telling what is real. They may hear voices that others do not hear. They may believe things that are not true. They may have trouble showing feelings. They may have trouble doing daily tasks. This condition can make life very hard for patients.

**What are humor-based treatments?**
Humor-based treatments use fun and laughter to help people feel better. These treatments help people find joy in life. They help people see the funny side of things. Doctors can use these treatments in hospitals, nursing homes, and day care centers. They are used along with regular care.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors wanted to know if humor could help people with schizophrenia. They thought humor might make patients feel better. They thought it might help with symptoms. But no one had looked at all the research together. This study brought together all the facts to see if humor really helps.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
The researchers looked for all studies about humor treatments for schizophrenia. They searched many medical databases. They looked for studies done up to February 2021. They only used studies that were done in a fair way. These studies compared humor treatments to other treatments or regular care.

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included people with schizophrenia. The review looked at three studies total. But only two studies had useful data. These two studies included 96 people.

**What did the studies compare?**
Some studies compared humor treatments to active control groups. Active control means patients did something else instead of humor. Other studies compared humor treatments to standard care. Standard care means the usual treatment patients get.

**How long did the studies last?**
The review does not give exact times. Different studies lasted different amounts of time.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**
The researchers could not find clear answers. The studies were too small. The quality of the studies was not very good.

**Main findings:**
- Humor treatments may not change overall mental state scores.
- Humor treatments may not help with positive symptoms. Positive symptoms include hearing voices or having false beliefs.
- Humor treatments may not help with negative symptoms. Negative symptoms include trouble showing feelings or lack of energy.
- Humor treatments may not help with anxiety.
- Humor treatments may help reduce depression when compared to active control. But they may not help with depression when compared to standard care.
- The researchers could not tell if humor treatments were safe. They did not have enough information about side effects.
- They could not tell if people stayed in treatment or left early.

**What does this mean?**
Right now, we do not know if humor treatments help people with schizophrenia. The studies were too small. More research is needed. Future studies need to be bigger. They need to be done more carefully. They need to look at things that matter to patients.

**Why is more research needed?**
Only a few small studies have been done. The results are not clear. We need bigger studies with more people. We need studies that last longer. We need to know if humor is safe. We need to know if it helps with daily life. We need to know if patients like these treatments.

**Conclusion:**
Doctors cannot say for sure if humor helps treat schizophrenia. The evidence is not strong enough yet. Patients should talk to their doctors about all treatment options. More research will help us understand if humor can be a helpful treatment.",10.1002-14651858.CD013367,"Humour‐based interventions for people with schizophrenia
Review question 
Are humour‐based interventions effective in treating people with schizophrenia?
Background 
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness. It is a disorder of thought, namely firm fixed false beliefs despite there being evidence to the contrary, loss of reality ties, and altered perception. These symptoms are further classified as (i) positive symptoms, such as speech without order, illusions or mistaken and persistent ideas; and (ii) negative symptoms, a lack of emotion or restricted quantity of speech; and decline in cognitive function, including attention, memory, and behavior control. The standard treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications. Treatment with humour‐based interventions, such as watching humorous movies, funny videos, or comedies, has been proposed as an add‐on treatment that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression, or appreciation of the irrationality or inconsistency of life's situations. 
Searching for evidence 
We ran an electronic search in February 2021 for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive humour‐based interventions in addition to usual care, or to receive usual care only, another psychological intervention or a control condition. We found eight records and checked them for suitability to include in our review. 
Evidence found 
Three trials met the review requirements and two low‐quality trials (total number of participants = 96) provided useable data. Compared with active control, humour‐based interventions may not improve positive symptoms and anxiety, but may improve depressive symptoms. However, when compared with standard care, humour‐based intervention may not improve the depressive symptoms. Current evidence is very limited and is of low to very low quality. We are uncertain as to whether humour‐based interventions may lead to clinically‐important improvement in mental state or quality of life in people with schizophrenia. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient research evidence to support the use of humour‐based interventions in people with schizophrenia.

Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is a type of eye movement disorder that can negatively impact vision. Currently, INS cannot be cured, but its effects can potentially be treated pharmacologically, optically, or surgically. This review focuses on the surgical interventions for INS. 
Despite the range of surgical interventions available, and currently applied in practice for the management of INS, there is no clear consensus, and no accepted clinical guidelines regarding the relative efficacy and safety of the various treatment options. A better understanding of these surgical options, along with their associated side effects, will assist clinicians in evidence‐based decision‐making in relation to the management of INS. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions for INS.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to 3 July 2020, with no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying the efficacy and safety of surgical options for treating INS. 
Data collection and analysis
Our prespecified outcome measures were the change from baseline in: binocular best‐corrected distance visual acuity; head posture; amplitude, frequency, intensity, and foveation period durations of the nystagmus waveform; visual recognition times; quality of life and self‐reported outcome measures; incidence of adverse effects with a probable causal link to treatment; and permanent adverse effects after surgery. 
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full‐text articles, extracted data from eligible RCTs, and judged the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. We reached consensus on any disagreements by discussion. We summarised the overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We only identified one eligible RCT (N = 10 participants), undertaken in India. This trial randomised participants to receive either a large retro‐equatorial recession of the horizontal rectus muscle of 9 mm on the medial rectus and 12 mm on the lateral rectus, or a simple tenotomy and resuturing of the four horizontal rectus muscles. We did not identify any RCTs comparing a surgical intervention for INS relative to no treatment. 
In the single eligible RCT, both eyes of each participant received the same intervention. The participants’ age and gender were not reported, nor was information on whether participants were idiopathic or had sensory disorders. The study only included participants with null in primary position and did not explicitly exclude those with congenital periodic alternating nystagmus. The study did not report funding source(s) or author declaration of interests. The evaluation period was six months. 
We judged this study at low risk for sequence generation and other sources of bias, but at high risk of bias for performance and detection bias. The risk of bias was unclear for selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. 
There is very uncertain evidence about the effect of the interventions on visual acuity and change in amplitude, frequency, and intensity of the nystagmus waveform. We were unable to calculate relative effects due to lack of data. None of the participants in either intervention group reported adverse effects at six‐month follow‐up (very low‐certainty evidence). There was no quantitative data reported for quality of life, although the study reported an improvement in quality of life after surgery in both intervention groups (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Change in head posture, foveation period durations of the nystagmus waveform, visual recognition times, and permanent adverse effects after surgery were not reported in the included study. 
We judged the certainty of the evidence, for both the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes, to be very low. Due to a lack of comprehensive reporting of adverse events, there was also very low‐certainty of the safety profile of the evaluated surgical interventions in this population. As such, we are very uncertain about the relative efficacy and safety of these interventions for the surgical management of INS. 
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review identified minimal high‐quality evidence relating to the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions for INS. The limited availability of evidence must be considered by clinicians when treating INS, particularly given these procedures are irreversible and often performed on children. More high‐quality RCTs are needed to better understand the efficacy and safety profile of surgical interventions for INS. This will assist clinicians, people with INS, and their parents or caregivers to make evidence‐based treatment decisions. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Surgery for Infantile Nystagmus Syndrome

## Plain Title

Can surgery help treat eye movement problems in people with infantile nystagmus syndrome?

## Rationale

**What is infantile nystagmus syndrome?**

Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is a condition where the eyes move on their own. The eyes may shake or wiggle back and forth. This happens without the person trying to move their eyes. These eye movements can make it hard to see clearly.

**Why is this condition a problem?**

People with INS may have trouble seeing things clearly. The constant eye movements can affect daily life. Simple tasks like reading or watching TV can be difficult. This can lower quality of life for patients and their families.

**What treatments are available?**

Right now, there is no cure for INS. However, doctors can try to help with the symptoms. There are three main ways to treat INS:
- Medicines
- Special glasses or contact lenses
- Surgery

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors use different types of surgery to treat INS. However, no one knows which surgery works best. There are no clear guidelines to help doctors choose. Doctors also need to know if these surgeries are safe. This study looked at the research to find out which surgeries work and which ones are safe.

## Trial Design

**How did the researchers do this study?**

The researchers searched for high-quality studies. They looked for studies that compared different surgeries for INS. They searched medical databases up to July 2020.

**What did they find?**

The researchers found only one study that met their standards. This study was done in India. It included 10 people with INS.

**How was the study set up?**

The study compared two different types of eye surgery:
- One group had large muscle surgery. Doctors moved eye muscles far back (9 to 12 millimeters).
- The other group had simple surgery. Doctors cut and resewed four eye muscles.

Both eyes of each person got the same surgery. The study followed people for six months after surgery.

**What information was missing?**

The study did not report the age of the people. It did not say if they were male or female. It did not say who paid for the study. This missing information makes it hard to fully understand the results.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The study did not provide enough clear information. The researchers could not tell which surgery worked better. Here is what they found:

**Vision changes:** The study did not give enough data about whether vision got better.

**Eye movement changes:** The study did not clearly show if eye movements improved. They looked at how fast, how strong, and how big the eye movements were. But the data was not clear enough to draw conclusions.

**Side effects:** No one in the study reported bad side effects after six months. However, the study did not look carefully for all possible problems.

**Quality of life:** The study said people felt better after surgery. But it did not give specific numbers or details.

**What was not reported:** The study did not report several important things. These included head position changes and long-term side effects.

**What does this mean?**

The researchers are very uncertain about these results. The study was small. It had problems with how it was done. The researchers could not tell if one surgery was better than the other. They also could not tell if the surgeries were truly safe.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

There is not enough good research on surgery for INS. Doctors need to know this when treating patients. This is especially important because:
- These surgeries cannot be undone
- Many patients are children
- Better studies are needed

More high-quality research is needed. This will help doctors, patients, and families make better choices about treatment.

Why is this question important?Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is an eye disorder that causes involuntary movement of the eyes from side to side, up and down, or in circles. INS typically develops shortly after birth, and persists throughout life. It is often associated with visual problems, such as:‐ long‐sightedness (when people can see distant objects clearly, but near objects appear blurred);‐ or short‐sightedness (when people can see near objects clearly, but distant objects appear blurred). 
There is currently no cure for INS. However, it is possible to reduce eye movement and improve people’s vision. One of the main options is eye surgery, which involves operating on the muscles that control eye movement. Several different surgical procedures can be used: some procedures involve detaching and reattaching the eye muscles, whereas others require complete removal of these muscles.   
It is unclear whether some surgical procedures for INS have more benefits or risks than others. To find out which surgical procedures work best, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. We were particularly interested in whether different surgical procedures could improve vision and quality of life in people with INS. We also wanted to know about any adverse (unwanted) effects. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for randomised controlled studies, in which people were randomly divided into two or more treatment groups. This makes it less likely that any differences between treatment effects were actually due to differences in the people who received them (rather than due to the treatments themselves, which is what we wanted to find out). 
We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find?We found one study, set in India, that involved a total of 10 people with INS who were followed for six months after surgery. The study authors did not report any information about: ‐ the age and gender of the people who took part in it;‐ or the source of funding for the study. 
The study compared two different surgical procedures: ‐ one procedure in which two horizontal rectus muscles (eye muscles that control side‐to‐side eye movements) were moved from their original position to a position further back on the eyeball; and‐ another procedure in which four horizontal rectus muscles were detached and reattached, in their original position.The procedures were conducted in both eyes. 
The study compared the effects of the treatments on:‐ clarity of vision six months after surgery;‐ intensity of eye movement six months after surgery;‐ adverse events six months after surgery; and‐ quality of life.   
The study did not investigate the effects of treatments on:‐ head posture;‐ the amount of time when the eye is still; or‐ the time it takes to recognise objects. 
We have very little confidence in the evidence from the study we found, because:‐ it is based on a very small number of people; and‐ the patients and researchers in the study knew which type of surgery each patient received. This knowledge may have influenced the study results. 
We therefore cannot determine whether the two procedures investigated in the study had different benefits and risks. 
What does this mean?There is insufficient evidence to determine whether some surgical procedures are better than others for INS. We need researchers to conduct robust randomised controlled trials in future, so that we can compare different procedures. This would help clinicians, and people with INS, to make treatment decisions based on evidence from research. 
How‐up‐to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to July 2020.

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Ways to Remove Lymph Nodes During Bladder Cancer Surgery

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people get bladder cancer that grows deep into the bladder muscle. This is called advanced bladder cancer. When this happens, doctors often need to remove the whole bladder through surgery.

**What are lymph nodes and why do they matter?**

Lymph nodes are small bean-shaped parts of the body that help fight disease. They are found throughout the body. Cancer can spread to lymph nodes near the bladder. During bladder removal surgery, doctors also take out lymph nodes to help stop cancer from spreading.

**What was the study about?**

Doctors use two different ways to remove lymph nodes:
- Standard removal: Takes out lymph nodes close to the bladder
- Extended removal: Takes out lymph nodes from a larger area, including those farther from the bladder

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors do not know which way is better. Does removing more lymph nodes help people live longer? Does it cause more problems? This study tried to answer these questions.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of research studies. The researchers looked for studies where chance decided which type of lymph node removal each person got. This type of study gives the most reliable results.

**Who was in the study?**

The researchers found one study that met their needs. This study included 401 people. Both men and women were in the study. All had bladder cancer that had grown into the muscle.

**Where did the study happen?**

The study took place at 16 large hospitals in Germany.

**How long did the study last?**

The researchers followed patients over time to see what happened to them after surgery.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The study showed that extended lymph node removal may help people in some ways:
- People may be less likely to die from any cause
- People may be less likely to die from bladder cancer

However, the researchers are not very confident in these results.

**What about side effects?**

The researchers could not be sure about side effects:
- They do not know if extended removal causes more serious problems than standard removal
- They do not know if extended removal causes more minor problems than standard removal

**What about cancer coming back?**

The researchers are not sure if extended removal stops cancer from coming back better than standard removal.

**How reliable are these results?**

The certainty of the evidence was low or very low. This means the true results might be very different from what this review found. More research is needed to know for sure.

**What do these results mean?**

Extended lymph node removal might help people with bladder cancer live longer. But doctors need more studies to be sure. They also need to learn more about the side effects of each type of surgery.

**What comes next?**

More studies are needed. These studies should include more people. They should look at both benefits and side effects. This will help doctors know which type of lymph node removal is best for their patients.

51,10.1002-14651858.CD014201-abstract.txt,"Background
The hallmark of severe hemophilia (A or B) is recurrent bleeding into joints and soft tissues with progressive joint damage, despite on‐demand treatment. Prophylaxis has long been used, but not universally adopted, because of medical, psychosocial, and cost controversies. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of clotting factor concentrate prophylaxis in managing previously‐treated individuals with hemophilia A or B. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. In addition, we searched MEDLINE and Embase and online trial registries. 
Most recent search of Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register: 24 February 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs evaluating people with hemophilia A or hemophilia B, who were previously treated with clotting factor concentrates to manage their hemophilia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently reviewed trials for eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
Ten trials (including 608 participants) were eligible for inclusion. Eight of the trials (477 participants) had arms comparing two or more prophylactic regimens to one another and four of the trials (n = 258) compared prophylaxis to on‐demand treatment (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). 
Comparison of two or more prophylactic regimens 
For trials comparing one prophylaxis regimen to another, given the heterogeneity of the data, none of the data were pooled for this comparison. Considering the individual trials, three trials reported the primary outcome of joint bleeding, and none showed a dfference between dosing regimens (low‐certainty evidence). For the secondary outcome of total bleeding events, prophylaxis with a twice‐weekly regimen of FIX likely results in reduced total bleeds compared to a once‐a‐week regimen of the same dose, mean difference (MD) 11.2 (5.81 to 16.59) (one trial, 10 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Transient low‐titer anti‐FVIII inhibitors were reported in one of the trials. Blood‐transmitted infections were not identified. Other adverse events reported include hypersensitivity, oedema, and weight gain. These were, however, rare and unrelated to study drugs (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Comparison of prophylactic and on‐demand regimens 
Four of the trials (258 participants) had arms that compared prophylaxis to on‐demand treatment. Prophylaxis may result in a large decrease in the number of joint bleeds compared to on‐demand treatment, MD ‐30.34 (95% CI ‐46.95 to ‐13.73) (two trials, 164 participants, low‐certainty evidence). One of these trials (84 participants) also reported the long‐term effects of prophylaxis versus on‐demand therapy showing improved joint function, quality of life, and pain; but no differences between groups in joint structure when assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
In one trial (84 participants) validated measures for joint health and pain assessment showed that prophylaxis likely improves joint health compared to an on‐demand regimen with an estimated change difference of 0.94 points (95% CI 0.23 to 1.65) and improves total pain scores, MD ‐17.20 (95% CI ‐27.48 to ‐6.92 (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Two trials (131 participants) reported that prophylaxis likely results in a slight increase in adverse events, risk ratio 1.71 (1.24 to 2.37) (moderate‐certainty evidence). No inhibitor development and blood‐transmitted infections were identified. 
Overall, the certainty of the body of evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have altered the effect. 
 
Authors' conclusions
There is evidence from RCTs that prophylaxis, as compared to on‐demand treatment, may reduce bleeding frequency in previously‐treated people with hemophilia. Prophylaxis may also improve joint function, pain and quality of life, even though this does not translate into a detectable improvement of articular damage when assessed by MRI.  
When comparing two different prophylaxis regimens, no significant differences in terms of protection from bleeding were found. Dose optimization could, however, result in improved efficacy. Given the heterogeneity of the data, pooled estimates were not obtained for most comparisons.  
Well‐designed RCTs and prospective observational controlled studies with standardised definitions and measurements are needed to establish the optimal and most cost‐effective treatment regimens. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Preventing Bleeding in People with Hemophilia

## Plain Title
Does Regular Treatment with Clotting Factor Work Better Than Treatment Only When Bleeding Occurs for People with Hemophilia?

## Rationale

**What is hemophilia?**
Hemophilia is a blood disorder. People with hemophilia do not have enough clotting factor in their blood. Clotting factor helps blood form clots to stop bleeding. Without enough clotting factor, people bleed more easily and for longer.

**What problems does hemophilia cause?**
People with severe hemophilia have repeated bleeding. This bleeding often happens in joints like knees, elbows, and ankles. It also happens in soft tissues. Over time, this bleeding damages the joints. This damage causes pain and makes it hard to move.

**How is hemophilia treated?**
Doctors can give people clotting factor medicine. This medicine replaces the missing clotting factor. There are two ways to use this medicine:
- On-demand treatment: Give medicine only when bleeding happens
- Prophylaxis: Give medicine on a regular schedule to prevent bleeding before it starts

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors have used prophylaxis for a long time. But not all doctors use it. There are questions about cost and other concerns. Researchers wanted to know if prophylaxis really works better than on-demand treatment. They also wanted to know which prophylaxis schedule works best.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 10 studies. These studies included 608 people with hemophilia. The studies compared different treatment plans.

Some studies compared prophylaxis to on-demand treatment. Other studies compared different prophylaxis schedules to each other.

**Who was in the studies?**
All people in the studies had hemophilia A or hemophilia B. They had all received clotting factor treatment before. The studies included both children and adults.

**How long did the studies last?**
The length of time varied between studies. Some studies lasted several months. Others lasted longer to see long-term effects.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**Prophylaxis compared to on-demand treatment:**

Prophylaxis may greatly reduce bleeding in joints. People who used prophylaxis had about 30 fewer joint bleeds than people who used on-demand treatment.

Prophylaxis likely improves joint health. It also reduces pain. People using prophylaxis had better quality of life.

However, special scans called MRI did not show differences in joint damage between the two groups.

People using prophylaxis had slightly more side effects. But these side effects were usually mild.

**Comparing different prophylaxis schedules:**

Some studies compared giving medicine once a week to twice a week. Others compared different doses.

Giving medicine twice a week may reduce total bleeds more than once a week. But the difference in joint bleeds was not clear.

Most studies did not find big differences between different prophylaxis schedules.

**Were there safety concerns?**

Side effects were rare. A few people had allergic reactions, swelling, or weight gain. These were not related to the study medicines.

No one developed inhibitors (antibodies that stop the medicine from working). No one got infections from the blood products.

**What do these results mean?**

Prophylaxis works better than on-demand treatment for preventing bleeds. It helps protect joints and reduces pain. It improves daily life for people with hemophilia.

The best prophylaxis schedule is still not clear. More research is needed to find the best dose and timing.

**What is needed next?**

Researchers need more studies. These studies should use the same ways to measure bleeding and joint health. This will help doctors find the best and most affordable treatment plans.",10.1002-14651858.CD014201,"Regular clotting factor replacement therapy to prevent joint damage in people living with severe hemophilia A or B 
Review question 
Should people, who have previously been treated for joint bleeding, be given regular preventative treatment with clotting factor concentrates to manage their condition? 
Background 
Hemophilia A and B are X‐linked inherited bleeding disorders in which bleeding  into joints is a major problem. Repeated joint bleeds can lead to affected joints (commonly referred to as 'target joints') becoming damaged and painful, with limited movement. Currently, bleeding is treated and prevented with plasma‐derived or recombinant clotting factor concentrates, and more recently non‐clotting factor formulations. This review looked at how useful and effective different clotting factor treatment strategies are for preventing joint bleeding and other outcomes in previously treated people with hemophilia A or B. 
Search date 
Date of last search: 24 February 2021.
Study characteristics 
This review includes 10 randomised controlled trials. Eight had treatment arms that compared the regular use of clotting factor concentrates to prevent joint bleeds with different dosing schemes to identify regimens that may be better; four had treatment arms that compared the regular use of factor concentrates to prevent bleeds to their 'on demand' use to treat bleeds once they occur (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). 
Key results 
In people living with hemophilia A or B previously treated for joint bleeding or with existing joint damage, preventive therapy may reduce the number of joint bleeds compared to 'on‐demand therapy'. This reduction in bleeds may lead to an improvement in joint function, pain, and quality of life. However, preventive therapy is linked to an increased use of factor concentrates and therefore higher treatment costs. Further studies are needed to establish the best preventive course of treatment in terms of starting time, frequency and dose level. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have affected the results. Future research might have an important role in changing our confidence in these results.

52,10.1002-14651858.CD013181.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
The advent of medical abortion has improved access to safe abortion procedures. Medical abortion procedures involve either administering mifepristone followed by misoprostol or a misoprostol‐only regimen. The drugs are commonly administered in the presence of clinicians, which is known as provider‐administered medical abortion. In self‐administered medical abortion, drugs are administered by the woman herself without the supervision of a healthcare provider during at least one stage of the drug protocol. Self‐administration of medical abortion has the potential to provide women with control over the abortion process. In settings where there is a shortage of healthcare providers, self‐administration may reduce the burden on the health system. However, it remains unclear whether self‐administration of medical abortion is effective and safe. It is important to understand whether women can safely and effectively terminate their own pregnancies when having access to accurate and adequate information, high‐quality drugs, and facility‐based care in case of complications. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of self‐administered versus provider‐administered medical abortion in any setting. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE in process and other non‐indexed citations, Embase, CINAHL, POPLINE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and Google Scholar from inception to 10 July 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies with a concurrent comparison group, using study designs that compared medical abortion by self‐administered versus provider‐administered methods. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently extracted the data, and we performed a meta‐analysis where appropriate using Review Manager 5. Our primary outcome was successful abortion (effectiveness), defined as complete uterine evacuation without the need for surgical intervention. Ongoing pregnancy (the presence of an intact gestational sac) was our secondary outcome measuring success or effectiveness. We assessed statistical heterogeneity with Chi2 tests and I2 statistics using a cut‐off point of P < 0.10 to indicate statistical heterogeneity. Quality assessment of the data used the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. 
Main results
We identified 18 studies (two RCTs and 16 non‐randomized studies (NRSs)) comprising 11,043 women undergoing early medical abortion (≤ 9 weeks gestation) in 10 countries. Sixteen studies took place in low‐to‐middle income resource settings and two studies were in high‐resource settings. One NRS study received analgesics from a pharmaceutical company. Five NRSs and one RCT did not report on funding; nine NRSs received all or partial funding from an anonymous donor. Five NRSs and one RCT received funding from government agencies, private foundations, or non‐profit bodies. The intervention in the evidence is predominantly from women taking mifepristone in the presence of a healthcare provider, and subsequently taking misoprostol without healthcare provider supervision (e.g. at home). 
There is no evidence of a difference in rates of successful abortions between self‐administered and provider‐administered groups: for two RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.01; 919 participants; moderate certainty of evidence. There is very low certainty of evidence from 16 NRSs: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.01; 10,124 participants. 
For the outcome of ongoing pregnancy there may be little or no difference between the two groups: for one RCT: RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.41 to 7.02; 735 participants; low certainty of evidence; and very low certainty evidence for 11 NRSs: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.49; 6691 participants. 
We are uncertain whether there are any differences in complications requiring surgical intervention, since we found no RCTs and evidence from three NRSs was of very low certainty: for three NRSs: RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.80 to 5.71; 2452 participants. 
Authors' conclusions
This review shows that self‐administering the second stage of early medical abortion procedures is as effective as provider‐administered procedures for the outcome of abortion success. There may be no difference for the outcome of ongoing pregnancy, although the evidence for this is uncertain for this outcome. There is very low‐certainty evidence for the risk of complications requiring surgical intervention. Data are limited by the scarcity of high‐quality research study designs and the presence of risks of bias. This review provides insufficient evidence to determine the safety of self‐administration when compared with administering medication in the presence of healthcare provider supervision. 
Future research should investigate the effectiveness and safety of self‐administered medical abortion in the absence of healthcare provider supervision through the entirety of the medical abortion protocol (e.g. during administration of mifepristone or as part of a misoprostol‐only regimen) and at later gestational ages (i.e. more than nine weeks). In the absence of any supervision from medical personnel, research is needed to understand how best to inform and support women who choose to self‐administer, including when to seek clinical care. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Self-Administered Medical Abortion Compared to Provider-Administered Medical Abortion

## Plain Title
Can Women Safely Take Abortion Pills at Home Without a Healthcare Provider Present?

## Rationale

**What is medical abortion?**
Medical abortion uses pills to end a pregnancy. Women take two types of pills. The first pill is called mifepristone. The second pill is called misoprostol. These pills work together to end the pregnancy safely.

**What is the difference between self-administered and provider-administered abortion?**
In provider-administered abortion, a healthcare worker watches the woman take all the pills. In self-administered abortion, the woman takes at least one of the pills by herself. This often means taking the second pill at home without a healthcare worker present.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Medical abortion has made safe abortion easier to access. Self-administered abortion could give women more control over their care. It could also help in places where there are not enough healthcare workers. However, researchers needed to know if self-administered abortion works as well as provider-administered abortion. They also needed to know if it is safe.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to compare self-administered and provider-administered medical abortion. They looked at how well each method worked. They also looked at safety. They wanted to know if women could safely end their own pregnancies when they had good information, quality pills, and access to medical care if problems occurred.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 18 different studies from 10 countries. These studies included 11,043 women total. Two studies were randomized controlled trials. These are high-quality studies. Sixteen studies were other types of comparison studies.

**Who was in the studies?**
All women in the studies were in early pregnancy. This means 9 weeks pregnant or less. Most studies took place in countries with fewer medical resources. Two studies took place in countries with more medical resources.

**What did women in the studies do?**
Most women took the first pill (mifepristone) with a healthcare provider present. Then they took the second pill (misoprostol) at home without a healthcare provider. Researchers compared these women to women who took both pills with a healthcare provider present.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies followed women through their abortion process. This typically lasted a few weeks.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The studies showed that self-administered abortion worked just as well as provider-administered abortion. About the same number of women in both groups had successful abortions. A successful abortion means the pregnancy ended completely without needing surgery.

There was probably little or no difference in ongoing pregnancies between the two groups. An ongoing pregnancy means the pregnancy did not end.

**What about safety?**

Researchers could not be certain about safety differences. There was not enough high-quality information. Some studies had problems with how they were done. This made it hard to know for sure if one method was safer than the other.

**What do these results mean?**

Taking the second abortion pill at home appears to work as well as taking it with a healthcare provider present. However, more research is needed to fully understand safety.

**What research is still needed?**

Future studies should look at women taking both pills at home without any healthcare provider supervision. Studies should also include women who are more than 9 weeks pregnant. Researchers need to learn the best ways to give women information and support when they self-administer abortion pills. Women also need to know when to seek medical care.

**Conclusions**

Self-administering the second pill for early medical abortion works as well as taking it with a provider present. However, there is not enough evidence to fully understand all safety issues. More high-quality research is needed.",10.1002-14651858.CD013181,"Self‐administered versus provider‐administered medical abortion (review)
Review question 
The aim of this review was to compare whether women taking abortion drugs on their own without healthcare provider supervision can do so as successfully and safely as women who take the drugs in the presence of trained healthcare providers. 
Background 
Medical abortion used to end pregnancies has been successful and safe when women have access to appropriate information and resources. In provider‐administered medical abortion, drugs are taken in the presence of trained healthcare providers. Access to medical abortion drugs has increased and has given women more control over their abortion procedures through self‐administration. In self‐administered medical abortion, the woman takes the drug(s) without the supervision of a healthcare provider after receiving appropriate information and resources. This is the first review of the published evidence on whether self‐administration of medical abortion is a safe and successful way to end pregnancies. We compared the success and safety of self‐administered medical abortion versus provider‐administered medical abortion. 
Study characteristics 
We included 18 studies (two randomized controlled trials and 16 prospective cohort studies) covering 11,043 women undergoing early medical abortion (up to nine weeks gestation) in 10 countries that compared self‐administered medical abortion to provider‐administered medical abortion, after an initial clinic visit. Most studies (16) were conducted in low‐to‐middle resource settings and two studies in high‐resource settings. The evidence described in this review is from studies published before 10 July 2019. 
Key results 
Women who self‐administer medical abortion drugs in early pregnancy (up to nine weeks gestational age) experience similar rates of completed abortion as women who undergo provider‐administered procedures in low‐to‐middle and high‐resource settings. Evidence about safety is uncertain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence for the success of self‐administered medical abortion compared to provider‐administered medical abortion was of moderate certainty, due to low‐certainty studies. The evidence for the safety of these interventions was very low, due to low‐certainty studies.

Children with severe global developmental delay (SGDD) have significant intellectual disability and severe motor impairment; they are extremely limited in their functional movement and are dependent upon others for all activities of daily living. SGDD does not directly cause lung dysfunction, but the combination of immobility, weakness, skeletal deformity and parenchymal damage from aspiration can lead to significant prevalence of respiratory illness. Respiratory pathology is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for children with SGDD; it can result in frequent hospital admissions and impacts upon quality of life. Although many treatment approaches are available, there currently exists no comprehensive review of the literature to inform best practice. A broad range of treatment options exist; to focus the scope of this review and allow in‐depth analysis, we have excluded pharmaceutical interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of non‐pharmaceutical treatment modalities for the management of respiratory morbidity in children with severe global developmental delay. 
Search methods
We conducted comprehensive searches of the following databases from inception to November 2013: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We searched the Web of Science and clinical trials registries for grey literature and for planned, ongoing and unpublished trials. We checked the reference lists of all primary included studies for additional relevant references. 
We updated searches in November 2019 and July 2020 and added six studies to awaiting classification, but these results have not been fully incorporated into the review. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials, controlled trials and cohort studies of children up to 18 years of age with a diagnosis of severe neurological impairment and respiratory morbidity were included. Studies of airways clearance techniques, suction, assisted coughing, non‐invasive ventilation, tracheostomy and postural management were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. As the result of heterogeneity, we could not perform meta‐analysis. We have therefore presented our results using a narrative approach. 
Main results
Fifteen studies were included in the review. Studies included children with a range of severe neurological impairments in differing settings, for example, home and critical care. Several different treatment modalities were assessed, and a wide range of outcome measures were used. Most studies used a non‐randomised design and included small sample groups. Only four randomised controlled trials were identified. Non‐randomised design, lack of information about how participants were selected and who completed outcome measures and incomplete reporting led to high or unclear risk of bias in many studies. Results from low‐quality studies suggest that use of non‐invasive ventilation, mechanically assisted coughing, high‐frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO), positive expiratory pressure and supportive seating may confer potential benefits. No serious adverse effects were reported for ventilatory support or airway clearance interventions other than one incident in a clinically unstable child following mechanically assisted coughing. Night‐time positioning equipment and spinal bracing were shown to have a potentially negative effect for some participants. However, these findings must be considered as tentative and require testing in future randomised trials. 
Authors' conclusions
This review found no high‐quality evidence for any single intervention for the management of respiratory morbidity in children with severe global developmental delay. Our search yielded data on a wide range of interventions of interest. Significant differences in study design and in outcome measures precluded the possibility of meta‐analysis. No conclusions on efficacy or safety of interventions for respiratory morbidity in children with severe global developmental delay can be made based upon the findings of this review. 
A co‐ordinated approach to future research is vital to ensure that high‐quality evidence becomes available to guide treatment for this vulnerable patient group.

## Plain Title
Non-Drug Treatments for Breathing Problems in Children with Severe Developmental Delays

## Rationale

### What is the health condition?
Some children have severe global developmental delay, or SGDD. These children have major problems with thinking and moving their bodies. They cannot move well on their own. They need help from others for all daily tasks like eating, dressing, and bathing.

### What problems does this condition cause?
SGDD does not directly harm the lungs. But these children often get breathing problems. This happens because they cannot move much. They have weak muscles. Their bones may grow in unusual ways. Food or liquid may go into their lungs by mistake. All of these things together can cause lung illness.

Breathing problems make these children very sick. They may need to go to the hospital many times. These problems can even cause death. The breathing issues make life harder for the children and their families.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors use many treatments to help with breathing problems in these children. But no one had looked at all the research together. Doctors needed to know which treatments work best and which are safe. This study looked at treatments that are not medicines. Examples include machines that help with breathing and ways to clear mucus from the lungs.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not a single study with patients. Instead, the researchers looked at many studies that other scientists had already done. They searched for all studies published up to 2020. They looked for studies about children up to 18 years old. These children had to have severe brain problems and breathing issues.

The researchers looked for studies about these treatments:
- Ways to clear mucus from airways
- Machines that suction out mucus
- Devices that help with coughing
- Machines that help with breathing
- Breathing tubes placed in the throat
- Special ways of positioning the body

The researchers found 15 studies to review. These studies included children in different places. Some children were at home. Others were in hospitals. The studies tested different treatments. They measured different things to see if treatments worked.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers found that most studies were small. Most studies were not well designed. Only four studies used the best type of design. Many studies did not explain their methods clearly. This made it hard to trust the results.

Some treatments might help. These include:
- Machines that help with breathing at night
- Machines that help with coughing
- Vests that shake the chest to loosen mucus
- Devices that create pressure when breathing out
- Special chairs that support the body

Most treatments seemed safe. Only one child had a problem. This happened when a machine helped the child cough. The child was already very sick.

Some treatments might cause problems. Special beds for nighttime and back braces made some children worse.

### What do the results mean?
The researchers could not say for sure that any treatment works. The studies were too different from each other. The studies were not high quality. More research is needed.

### What happens next?
Scientists need to do better studies. These studies should use strong designs. They should measure the same things. This will help doctors know which treatments really work. This is very important because these children need the best care possible.

### Main conclusion
Right now, there is not enough good evidence to guide treatment. Doctors cannot be sure which non-drug treatments work best for breathing problems in children with severe developmental delays. Better research is urgently needed to help these vulnerable children.",10.1002-14651858.CD010382,"Non‐drug management of breathing problems for children with severe physical and intellectual impairment 
Background For a variety of reasons, some children live with very severe intellectual and physical problems; they are unable to walk or talk and require a lot of care. In this study we refer to them as children with severe global developmental delay (SGDD); this is not a specific diagnosis but is rather an 'umbrella term' used to describe a group of children with similar problems. These children may have weak or stiff muscles and deformities of their skeleton; often they have problems with swallowing, resulting in food or saliva going into their lungs. Frequently they have a poor cough reflex and lack the strength required to expel secretions when they do cough. When we sleep, our breathing becomes shallower; for some children with SGDD whose breathing is already shallow when awake, falling asleep means that they do not breathe sufficiently deeply to take in enough oxygen and breathe out enough carbon dioxide. The consequence of these problems is that their respiratory system becomes weakened; they are more likely to develop chest infections, and relatively minor infections can make them very unwell. This can result in their spending a lot of time in hospital. This affects the quality of life for these children and families and is very expensive. Many types of treatment could help, but no good summary of studies has been prepared to tell healthcare professionals which treatments are best and when they should be used; this is the reason for this review. 
Review question The aim of our review was to discover how effective each type of treatment is for managing breathing problems in children with severe global developmental delay. As so many treatments are available, we decided to look only at treatments that do not involve drugs. 
Study characteristics We carried out a wide database search to look for studies of interventions for the management of breathing problems in children with severe neurological impairment. We found 15 studies of interest, which included a number of different types of treatment. 
Key results The results showed that several different treatments provided potential benefits, and for most interventions no serious adverse effects were reported. However, the quality of the studies was not good enough to inspire confidence in the findings. Night‐time positioning equipment and spinal bracing were shown to have a potentially negative effect in some participants. Although some studies looked at the same type of treatment, they used it in different ways or used different measures to assess effectiveness, so we could not put the results together. 
Quality of the evidence Of the 15 studies included here, only four used the 'gold standard' study design for health interventions. The remainder of the studies used less robust study designs, which limits the strength of the results. Further well‐designed randomised studies including larger numbers of participants are required to guide healthcare professionals to select the most effective treatments. 
This plain‐language summary is current to November 2013.  We updated searches in November 2019 and July 2020 and added six studies to awaiting classification, but these results have not been fully incorporated into the review.

Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs mostly in people with chronic liver disease. Worldwide, it ranks sixth in terms of incidence of cancer, and fourth in terms of cancer‐related deaths. Contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is used as an add‐on test to confirm the presence of focal liver lesions suspected as hepatocellular carcinoma after prior diagnostic tests such as abdominal ultrasound or measurement of alpha‐foetoprotein, or both. According to guidelines, a single contrast‐enhanced imaging investigation, with either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may show the typical hepatocellular carcinoma hallmarks in people with cirrhosis, which will be sufficient to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma. However, a significant number of hepatocellular carcinomas show atypical imaging features, and therefore, are missed at imaging. 
Dynamic CEUS images are obtained similarly to CT and MRI images. CEUS differentiates between arterial and portal venous phases, in which sonographic hepatocellular carcinoma hallmarks, such as arterial hyperenhancement and subsequent washout appearance, are investigated. The advantages of CEUS over CT and MRI include real‐time imaging, use of contrast agents that do not contain iodine and are not nephrotoxic, and quick image acquisition. Despite the advantages, the use of CEUS in the diagnostic algorithm for HCC remains controversial, with disagreement on relevant guidelines. 
There is no clear evidence of the benefit of surveillance programmes in terms of overall survival as the conflicting results can be a consequence of an inaccurate detection, ineffective treatment, or both. Therefore, assessing the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS may clarify whether the absence of benefit could be related to underdiagnosis. Furthermore, an assessment of the accuracy of CEUS for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is needed for either diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma or ruling it out in people with chronic liver disease who are not included in surveillance programmes. 
Objectives
1. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and at any stage in adults with chronic liver disease, in a surveillance programme or in a clinical setting. 
2. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS for the diagnosis of resectable hepatocellular carcinoma in people with chronic liver disease and identify potential sources of heterogeneity in the results. 
Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The last date of search was 5 November 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease, with cross‐sectional designs, using one of the acceptable reference standards, such as pathology of the explanted liver, and histology of resected or biopsied focal liver lesion with at least a six‐month follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods to screen studies, extract data, and assess the risk of bias and applicability concerns, using the QUADAS‐2 checklist. We used the bivariate model and provided estimates of summary sensitivity and specificity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We presented uncertainty‐of‐the‐accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Main results
We included 23 studies with 6546 participants. Studies were published between 2001 and 2021. We judged all 23 studies at high‐risk of bias in at least one domain, and 13/23 studies at high concern for applicability. Most studies used different reference standards to exclude the presence of the target condition. The time interval between the index test and the reference standard was rarely defined. We also had major concerns on their applicability due to the characteristics of the participants. 
– CEUS for hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and stage: sensitivity 77.8% (95% CI 69.4% to 84.4%) and specificity 93.8% (95% CI 89.1% to 96.6%) (23 studies, 6546 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
– CEUS for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: sensitivity 77.5% (95% CI 62.9% to 87.6%) and specificity 92.7% (95% CI 86.8% to 96.1%) (13 studies, 1257 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
The observed heterogeneity in the results remains unexplained. The sensitivity analyses, including only studies with clearly prespecified positivity criteria and only studies in which the reference standard results were interpreted with no knowledge of the results about the index test, showed no differences in the results. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that by using CEUS, as an add‐on test following abdominal ultrasound, to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and stage, 22% of people with hepatocellular carcinoma would be missed, and 6% of people without hepatocellular carcinoma would unnecessarily undergo further testing or inappropriate treatment. As to resectable hepatocellular carcinoma, we found that 23% of people with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma would incorrectly be unresected, while 8% of people without hepatocellular carcinoma would undergo further inappropriate testing or treatment. The uncertainty resulting from the high risk of bias of the included studies, heterogeneity, and imprecision of the results and concerns on their applicability limit our ability to draw confident conclusions. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing for Liver Cancer Using Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound

## Plain Title

How Well Does Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Detect Liver Cancer in People with Long-Term Liver Disease?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Liver cancer is a serious disease. It most often affects people who have long-term liver disease. Around the world, liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer. It is the fourth leading cause of death from cancer.

**Why is this study needed?**

Doctors use different tests to find liver cancer. One test is called contrast-enhanced ultrasound, or CEUS. This test uses sound waves and a special dye to look at the liver. Doctors use CEUS after other tests suggest a person might have liver cancer.

CEUS has some benefits. It works in real time. The dye used is safe for the kidneys. The test is quick. However, doctors do not agree on when to use CEUS. Some guidelines say to use it. Others do not.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know how well CEUS finds liver cancer. They wanted to know if CEUS misses cancer. They also wanted to know if CEUS wrongly suggests cancer when it is not there. This information helps doctors decide if CEUS is a good test to use.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Researchers looked at 23 different studies. These studies were done between 2001 and 2021. The studies included 6,546 adults with long-term liver disease.

All the people in these studies had CEUS tests. Doctors then checked the results using other methods. These methods included looking at liver tissue under a microscope. This helped researchers know if CEUS was correct.

Researchers looked at two groups:
- People with liver cancer of any size or stage
- People with liver cancer that could be removed with surgery

**Who was in the studies?**

All participants were adults with long-term liver disease. Some had liver cancer. Others did not. Doctors were checking to see if they had cancer.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

For liver cancer of any size or stage:
- CEUS correctly found cancer in about 78 out of 100 people who had cancer
- This means CEUS missed cancer in about 22 out of 100 people who had cancer
- CEUS correctly showed no cancer in about 94 out of 100 people without cancer
- This means CEUS wrongly suggested cancer in about 6 out of 100 people without cancer

For liver cancer that could be removed with surgery:
- CEUS correctly found cancer in about 78 out of 100 people who had cancer
- This means CEUS missed cancer in about 23 out of 100 people who had cancer
- CEUS correctly showed no cancer in about 93 out of 100 people without cancer
- This means CEUS wrongly suggested cancer in about 8 out of 100 people without cancer

**What do these results mean?**

CEUS misses cancer in some people. These people might not get the treatment they need. CEUS also wrongly suggests cancer in some people. These people might get tests or treatment they do not need.

**What are the problems with this research?**

The researchers found several problems with the studies they reviewed. The studies were not all done the same way. Some studies had design problems. This makes it hard to trust the results completely.

**What are the conclusions?**

CEUS can help find liver cancer. But it is not perfect. It misses cancer in about 1 out of 5 people. It also wrongly suggests cancer in a small number of people. Doctors should be careful when using CEUS. They may need other tests to be sure about liver cancer.

More research is needed. Better studies could help doctors know when CEUS is most helpful.",10.1002-14651858.CD013483,"How accurate are contrast‐enhanced ultrasound scans for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma?
Key messages 
In adults with chronic liver disease, contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can miss diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma in around 22.2% of people who would not then receive timely or appropriate treatment, and would fail to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma in 6.2% of people who could receive unnecessary further testing or treatment. 
In the subset of people who are able have the hepatocellular carcinoma removed by surgery, CEUS probably misses hepatocellular carcinoma in 22.5% of people who could undergo surgery to remove part of their liver while it would erroneously find cancer in 7.3% of people who would undergo unnecessary further test or surgery. 
As there were some problems with the way the studies were conducted, CEUS to detect hepatocellular carcinoma may appear more accurate than it actually is. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma important? 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is cancer originating in the liver. It is sixth in terms of occurrences of cancer and fourth in terms of cancer‐related deaths worldwide. It occurs mostly in people with chronic liver disease regardless of the exact cause. People with blood test or ultrasound results that suggest they may have hepatocellular carcinoma may go on to have further tests, such as imaging or a biopsy (where a small piece of the liver is removed and examined). If the cancer is detected early, people may have part of the liver removed or have a liver transplant. In advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, they may need chemotherapy. If hepatocellular carcinoma is missed at diagnostic testing, people will not receive appropriate treatment. However, incorrectly diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma when it is not present means that people may undergo unnecessary testing or treatment. 
What is contrast‐enhanced ultrasound and how can it diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma? 
CEUS can detect abnormalities in the liver that might be due to cancer and, using contrast agents, confirm the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. These contrast agents are safe. CEUS is used in clinical practice to confirm the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in people in whom suspicion was raised by prior performed abdominal ultrasound or a blood test to measure alpha‐foetoprotein. 
The role of CEUS in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma remains controversial between guidelines. Previous systematic reviews have assessed the performance of CEUS in detecting hepatocellular carcinoma but they have included different studies and found different results. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if CEUS is accurate enough to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease (a progressive deterioration of liver functions for more than six months). We were interested first in hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and severity and, second, in hepatocellular carcinomas that were suitable for surgical removal (resection). 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of diagnostic tests of CEUS scans compared to the best available tests to confirm hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease. The best available test is examination of the liver, or part of it, under a microscope. 
What did we find? 
We found 23 studies with 6546 adults.
Around 690 (69%) out of 1000 adults with chronic liver disease had a confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and severity. Considering these 1000 people, CEUS: 
– correctly detected liver cancer in 537 people;
– missed liver cancer in 153 people;
– incorrectly detected cancer in 19 people;
– correctly detected no cancer in 291 people.
Around 690 (69%) out of 1000 adults with chronic liver disease had a confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma that could be removed by surgery. Considering these 1000 people, CEUS: 
– correctly detected liver cancer in 535 people;
– missed liver cancer in 155 people;
– incorrectly detected cancer in 23 people;
– correctly detected no cancer in 287 people.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited as the studies used different methods to select study participants and used different reference standards. This means that CEUS scans may be more or less accurate than what the evidence suggests. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 5 November 2021.

Many millions of people living with dementia around the world are not diagnosed, which has a negative impact both on their access to care and treatment and on rational service planning. Telehealth ‐ the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to provide health services at a distance ‐ may be a way to increase access to specialist assessment for people with suspected dementia, especially those living in remote or rural areas. It has also been much used during the COVID‐19 pandemic. It is important to know whether diagnoses made using telehealth assessment are as accurate as those made in conventional, face‐to‐face clinical settings. 
Objectives
Primary objective: to assess the diagnostic accuracy of telehealth assessment for dementia and mild cognitive impairment. 
Secondary objectives: to identify the quality and quantity of the relevant research evidence; to identify sources of heterogeneity in the test accuracy data; to identify and synthesise any data on patient or clinician satisfaction, resource use, costs or feasibility of the telehealth assessment models in the included studies. 
Search methods
We searched multiple databases and clinical trial registers on 4 November 2020 for published and 'grey' literature and registered trials. We applied no search filters and no language restrictions. We screened the retrieved citations in duplicate and assessed in duplicate the full texts of papers considered potentially relevant. 
Selection criteria
We included in the review cross‐sectional studies with 10 or more participants who had been referred to a specialist service for assessment of a suspected cognitive disorder. Within a period of one month or less, each participant had to undergo two clinical assessments designed to diagnose dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI): a telehealth assessment (the index test) and a conventional face‐to‐face assessment (the reference standard). The telehealth assessment could be informed by some data collected face‐to‐face, e.g. by nurses working in primary care, but all contact between the patient and the specialist clinician responsible for synthesising the information and making the diagnosis had to take place remotely using ICT. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies. Data extracted covered study design, setting, participants, details of index test and reference standard, and results in the form of numbers of participants given diagnoses of dementia or MCI. Data were also sought on dementia subtype diagnoses and on quantitative measures of patient or clinician satisfaction, resource use, costs and feasibility. We assessed risk of bias and applicability of each included study using QUADAS‐2. We entered the results into 2x2 tables in order to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of telehealth assessment for the diagnosis of all‐cause dementia, MCI, and any cognitive syndrome (combining dementia and MCI). We presented the results of included studies narratively because there were too few studies to derive summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity. 
Main results
Three studies with 136 participants were eligible for inclusion. Two studies (20 and 100 participants) took place in community settings in Australia and one study (16 participants) was conducted in veterans' homes in the USA. Participants were referred from primary care with undiagnosed cognitive symptoms or were identified as being at high risk of having dementia on a screening test in the care homes. Dementia and MCI were target conditions in the larger study; the other studies targeted dementia diagnosis only. Only one small study used a 'pure' telehealth model, i.e. not involving any elements of face‐to‐face assessment. 
The studies were generally well‐conducted. We considered two studies to be at high risk of incorporation bias because a substantial amount of information collected face‐to‐face by nurses was used to inform both index test and reference standard assessments. One study was at unclear risk of selection bias. 
For the diagnosis of all‐cause dementia, sensitivity of telehealth assessment ranged from 0.80 to 1.00 and specificity from 0.80 to 1.00. We considered this to be very low‐certainty evidence due to imprecision, inconsistency between studies and risk of bias. For the diagnosis of MCI, data were available from only one study (100 participants) giving a sensitivity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.84) and a specificity of 0.73 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.84). We considered this to be low‐certainty evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias. For diagnosis of any cognitive syndrome (dementia or MCI), data from the same study gave a sensitivity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.99) and a specificity of 0.22 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.60). The majority of diagnostic disagreements concerned the distinction between MCI and dementia, occurring approximately equally in either direction. There was also a tendency for patients identified as cognitively healthy at face‐to‐face assessment to be diagnosed with MCI at telehealth assessment (but numbers were small). 
There were insufficient data to make any assessment of the accuracy of dementia subtype diagnosis. 
One study provided a small amount of data indicating a good level of clinician and especially patient satisfaction with the telehealth model. There were no data on resource use, costs or feasibility. 
Authors' conclusions
We found only very few eligible studies with a small number of participants. An important difference between the studies providing data for the analyses was whether the target condition was dementia only (two studies) or dementia and MCI (one study). The data suggest that telehealth assessment may be highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of all‐cause dementia when assessed against a reference standard of conventional face‐to‐face assessment, but the estimates are imprecise due to small sample sizes and between‐study heterogeneity, and may apply mainly to telehealth models which incorporate a considerable amount of face‐to‐face contact with healthcare professionals other than the doctor responsible for making the diagnosis. For the diagnosis of MCI by telehealth assessment, best estimates of both sensitivity and specificity were somewhat lower, but were based on a single study. Errors occurred at the cognitively healthy/MCI and the MCI/dementia boundaries. However, there is no evidence that diagnostic disagreements were more frequent than would be expected due to the known variation between clinicians’ opinions when assigning a dementia diagnosis.

Can Doctors Diagnose Dementia Accurately Using Video Calls and Other Remote Technology?

## Rationale

**What is dementia and why is this important?**

Dementia is a brain condition that affects memory and thinking. Millions of people around the world have dementia but have not been diagnosed. Without a diagnosis, people cannot get the care and treatment they need.

**What is the problem?**

Many people live far from specialist doctors who diagnose dementia. Getting to these doctors can be hard, especially for people in rural areas. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people could not visit doctors in person at all.

**What is telehealth?**

Telehealth means using phones, video calls, and computers to provide health care from a distance. A doctor can talk to a patient through a video call instead of meeting in person.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to know if doctors can diagnose dementia as accurately using telehealth as they can during in-person visits. This information is important because telehealth could help more people get diagnosed, especially those who live far from specialist doctors.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers design this study?**

Researchers looked for studies where the same patients were assessed two different ways within one month. Each patient had one assessment using telehealth and one assessment in person. Researchers then compared the diagnoses to see if they matched.

**Who was in these studies?**

The researchers found three studies with 136 people total. These people had been referred to specialist doctors because they might have dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI means having some memory problems that are not as severe as dementia.

Two studies took place in Australia in community settings. One study took place in veterans' homes in the United States.

**How long did the studies last?**

Each person was assessed twice within one month.

## Results

**What did the researchers find about diagnosing dementia?**

The studies showed that telehealth assessment could identify most people with dementia correctly. The accuracy ranged from 8 out of 10 people to 10 out of 10 people. However, researchers are not very confident in these results because:
- The studies were small
- The studies gave different results
- Some studies had problems with how they were designed

**What about diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI)?**

Only one study looked at MCI diagnosis. In this study, telehealth correctly identified about 7 out of 10 people with MCI. It also correctly identified about 7 out of 10 people without MCI.

**Where did mistakes happen?**

Most mistakes happened when doctors tried to decide if someone had MCI or dementia. Sometimes the in-person doctor said dementia while the telehealth doctor said MCI. Sometimes it was the other way around.

Some people who seemed healthy during in-person visits were diagnosed with MCI during telehealth visits. However, the numbers were very small.

**Did patients and doctors like using telehealth?**

One study asked patients and doctors about their experience. Both groups were satisfied with telehealth. Patients were especially happy with it.

**What information was missing?**

The studies did not provide information about costs or how easy telehealth was to use in practice.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

Telehealth may work well for diagnosing dementia. However, the evidence is limited because only three small studies were found. The results suggest telehealth can accurately identify people with dementia, but more research is needed.

For diagnosing MCI, telehealth may be somewhat less accurate. More studies with more people are needed to be sure.

The mistakes that happened with telehealth are probably similar to mistakes that happen when different doctors assess the same patient in person. Doctors sometimes disagree about diagnoses even when meeting patients face-to-face.

**Why does this matter?**

Telehealth could help more people get diagnosed with dementia, especially those who cannot easily visit specialist doctors. However, more research is needed before we can be certain about how accurate it is.",10.1002-14651858.CD013786,"Accuracy of telehealth assessment for diagnosing dementia and mild cognitive impairment
Background 
Dementia is an illness in which memory and other thinking skills deteriorate to the point that someone can no longer manage their daily activities without assistance. If the memory and thinking problems are milder, so that independent living is not affected, the condition is described as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Both conditions usually affect older people. It is considered important that people with dementia or MCI can get an accurate diagnosis at a time and place suitable for them so that they and their families can understand the problem and can access treatment and support. However millions of people with dementia around the world never get a diagnosis. There are many reasons for this, but one may be a lack of accessible diagnostic services, particularly for people in rural areas or those who find it difficult to travel. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, many face‐to‐face services were closed. Telehealth ‐ the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to provide health services at a distance may be a way to increase access to specialist assessment for people with suspected dementia who cannot easily get to clinics. However, it is important to be sure that increased accessibility does not come at the expense of accuracy of diagnosis. 
Review question 
We asked how accurate telehealth diagnoses of dementia and MCI were compared to diagnoses made when patients attend traditional clinics for a face‐to‐face assessment. 
What we did 
We searched databases of medical studies up to 4 November 2020 for studies in which people had two assessments for suspected dementia or MCI: one telehealth assessment and one conventional face‐to‐face assessment. Both assessments were done by specialists and took place within a month of each other. For the telehealth assessment, all contact between the patient and the diagnosing specialist had to have been done remotely, using ICT, but some of the information needed to make the diagnosis could be collected by other members of the healthcare team who saw the patient in person. We then assessed how closely the results of the telehealth assessments agreed with the face‐to‐face assessments. 
What we found 
We included three studies (136 participants) who had suspected dementia. One small study (16 participants) was conducted in veterans' homes in the USA; the other two studies were in community services in Australia. They all used videoconference systems for their telehealth assessments. All three studies aimed to make dementia diagnoses but only one also aimed to diagnose MCI. The quality of the studies was generally good. In two studies, nurses who saw the patients in person played a big role in gathering information used in both assessments, which could bias those studies towards close agreement between the assessments. 
The studies found that telehealth assessment correctly identified 80% to 100% of the people who were diagnosed with dementia at face‐to‐face assessment and also correctly identified 80% to 100% of people who did not have dementia. 
Only one study (100 participants) attempted to diagnose MCI. In this study, 71% of participants who had MCI and 73% of participants who did not have MCI were correctly identified using telehealth assessment. 
Telehealth assessment in this study correctly identified 97% of the participants who had either MCI or dementia, but correctly identified only 22% of those who did not have either, although again this result was very uncertain because of the very small number of people in this category. 
It is important to note that diagnoses of dementia and MCI made by two specialists seeing patients face‐to‐face will not show 100% agreement. Therefore perfect agreement between telehealth and face‐to‐face assessments cannot be expected. 
What we concluded 
From the evidence we found, telehealth assessment for diagnosing dementia seems to have a good level of accuracy when compared to face‐to‐face assessment, although the small number of studies and participants and differences between the included studies means that there is a lot of uncertainty about this result. Telehealth appeared to be a little less accurate for diagnosing MCI than for diagnosing dementia. Agreement between two face‐to‐face assessments is also not perfect and we cannot say that disagreements between telehealth and face‐to‐face diagnoses were any more common.

This is the second update of the review first published in the Cochrane Library (2010, Issue 2) and later updated (2014, Issue 9). 
Despite advances in chemotherapy, the prognosis of ovarian cancer remains poor. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce tumour antigen‐specific anti‐tumour immune responses as an alternative treatment for ovarian cancer. 
Objectives
Primary objective  • To assess the clinical efficacy of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer as evaluated by tumour response measured by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) and/or cancer antigen (CA)‐125 levels, response to post‐immunotherapy treatment, and survival differences 
◦ In addition, we recorded the numbers of observed antigen‐specific humoral and cellular responses Secondary objective  • To establish which combinations of immunotherapeutic strategies with tumour antigens provide the best immunological and clinical results 
Search methods
For the previous version of this review, we performed a systematic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2009, Issue 3), in the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE and Embase databases, and clinicaltrials.gov (1966 to July 2009). We also conducted handsearches of the proceedings of relevant annual meetings (1996 to July 2009). 
For the first update of this review, we extended the searches to October 2013, and for this update, we extended the searches to July 2017. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as well as non‐randomised studies (NRSs), that included participants with epithelial ovarian cancer, irrespective of disease stage, who were treated with antigen‐specific active immunotherapy, irrespective of type of vaccine, antigen used, adjuvant used, route of vaccination, treatment schedule, and reported clinical or immunological outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviews authors independently extracted the data. We evaluated the risk of bias for RCTs according to standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane, and for NRSs by using a selection of quality domains deemed best applicable to the NRS. 
Main results
We included 67 studies (representing 3632 women with epithelial ovarian cancer). The most striking observations of this review address the lack of uniformity in conduct and reporting of early‐phase immunotherapy studies. Response definitions show substantial variation between trials, which makes comparison of trial results unreliable. Information on adverse events is frequently limited. Furthermore, reports of both RCTs and NRSs frequently lack the relevant information necessary for risk of bias assessment. Therefore, we cannot rule out serious biases in most of the included trials. However, selection, attrition, and selective reporting biases are likely to have affected the studies included in this review. GRADE ratings were high only for survival; for other primary outcomes, GRADE ratings were very low. 
The largest body of evidence is currently available for CA‐125‐targeted antibody therapy (17 studies, 2347 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Non‐randomised studies of CA‐125‐targeted antibody therapy suggest improved survival among humoral and/or cellular responders, with only moderate adverse events. However, four large randomised placebo‐controlled trials did not show any clinical benefit, despite induction of immune responses in approximately 60% of participants. Time to relapse with CA‐125 monoclonal antibody versus placebo, respectively, ranged from 10.3 to 18.9 months versus 10.3 to 13 months (six RCTs, 1882 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Only one RCT provided data on overall survival, reporting rates of 80% in both treatment and placebo groups (three RCTs, 1062 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Other small studies targeting many different tumour antigens have presented promising immunological results. As these strategies have not yet been tested in RCTs, no reliable inferences about clinical efficacy can be made. Given the promising immunological results and the limited side effects and toxicity reported, exploration of clinical efficacy in large well‐designed RCTs may be worthwhile. 
Authors' conclusions
We conclude that despite promising immunological responses, no clinically effective antigen‐specific active immunotherapy is yet available for ovarian cancer. Results should be interpreted cautiously, as review authors found a significant dearth of relevant information for assessment of risk of bias in both RCTs and NRSs. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Immune-Based Treatments for Ovarian Cancer

## Plain Title
Can vaccines that help the immune system fight cancer improve outcomes for women with ovarian cancer?

## Rationale

**What is ovarian cancer and why is it a problem?**
Ovarian cancer is a disease where cancer cells grow in the ovaries. The ovaries are part of a woman's body that make eggs. Even with the best drugs we have today, many women with ovarian cancer do not survive. This makes ovarian cancer a very serious disease.

**What is this new treatment approach?**
Scientists are testing a different way to treat ovarian cancer. They want to use the body's own defense system, called the immune system. The immune system normally fights germs and diseases. These new treatments are called vaccines. They work by teaching the immune system to find and attack cancer cells.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Researchers wanted to know if these vaccines could help women with ovarian cancer live longer. They also wanted to see if the vaccines could shrink tumors or slow down the cancer. Because current treatments do not work well enough, doctors need better options for their patients.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This was not one single study. Instead, researchers looked at 67 different studies done by other scientists. They collected information from all these studies to see what worked and what did not.

The studies included 3,632 women with ovarian cancer. The women received different types of vaccines. Some studies compared vaccines to fake treatments called placebos. Other studies just watched what happened after women got the vaccine.

**Who was in these studies?**
All the women had ovarian cancer. The studies did not limit who could join based on age. The time women spent in each study varied. Different studies lasted different amounts of time.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**
The main finding was disappointing. None of the vaccines tested so far clearly help women with ovarian cancer live longer or get better.

**What about CA-125 vaccines?**
Most of the research focused on one type of vaccine. This vaccine targets something called CA-125. CA-125 is a marker found on many ovarian cancer cells. Seventeen studies with 2,347 women tested this vaccine.

Some small studies showed promising results. The vaccine did make the immune system respond. About 6 out of 10 women who got the vaccine showed immune responses. However, four large, well-done studies told a different story. When researchers compared the vaccine to fake treatment, they found no real benefit.

Women who got the vaccine lived about the same amount of time as women who got the fake treatment. The time before cancer came back was similar in both groups. This ranged from 10 to 19 months.

**Were there side effects?**
The good news is that most vaccines caused only mild side effects. Women generally tolerated the treatments well. This is important because it means the vaccines were safe, even though they did not work as hoped.

**What about other types of vaccines?**
Researchers also tested many other vaccines. These targeted different parts of cancer cells. Some of these showed the immune system could respond. But these were all small studies. We cannot tell if they actually help patients because larger studies have not been done yet.

**What problems did researchers find?**
The review found many problems with how studies were done and reported. Different studies measured success in different ways. This made it hard to compare results. Many studies did not report important information. Some studies may have had flaws in how they were designed.

**What do the results mean?**
Right now, there is no immune-based vaccine that doctors can use to treat ovarian cancer. The vaccines are safe and can make the immune system respond. But they do not help women live longer or feel better.

More research is needed. Future studies should be larger and better designed. They should all measure results the same way. This will help doctors know if these vaccines can ever work for ovarian cancer.

**Why is this review important?**
This review helps doctors and patients understand what we know about cancer vaccines for ovarian cancer. It shows that while the idea is good, we do not yet have a vaccine that works. Patients should know that these treatments are still experimental.",10.1002-14651858.CD007287,"Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer
Background  Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancers. Standard therapy consists of surgery and chemotherapy. Responses to chemotherapy are generally good; however, most women experience relapse, for which no curative treatment is available. The presence of certain immune cells in tumours is associated with longer survival. This suggests that stimulation of anti‐tumour immune responses (i.e. immunotherapy) might be a useful approach for improving outcomes among women with ovarian cancer. 
Review question This review evaluated the feasibility of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce anti‐tumour immune responses through administration of a tumour antigen ‐ a molecule that is expressed by tumour cells and is hardly expressed by healthy cells. Reviewers collected information on clinical outcomes, immunological responses, and side effects. 
Main findings We identified 67 studies, which included 3632 women with ovarian cancer and were published between 1966 and 2017. The most frequently described strategy was administration of antibodies targeting the tumour antigen CA‐125 (2347 participants in 17 studies). Most of these studies primarily evaluated safety and immunological responses. Severe flu‐like and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 7% to 30% of participants. Researchers frequently detected antibodies and immune cells recognising the tumour antigen CA‐125, albeit response rates varied between studies. Despite these promising immunological responses, four large studies reported no survival advantage for participants treated with CA‐125‐directed antibody over those given placebo. 
For strategies not relying on antibody administration, similar conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Overall, study authors report that treatment was well tolerated and inflammatory side effects at the injection site were most frequently observed. Researchers observed responses of the immune system for most strategies studied, but the clinical benefit of these strategies remains to be evaluated in large trials. 
Certainty of the evidence and conclusions Because no high‐certainty evidence of clinical benefit is currently available, antibody therapy targeting CA‐125 should not be incorporated into standard treatment in its current form. 
Based on lack of uniformity in included studies, we strongly advocate universal adoption of response definitions, guidelines for adverse events reporting, and directives for trial conduct and reporting. Furthermore, results from ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are awaited, and further RCTs should be conducted.

57,10.1002-14651858.CD010497.pub2-abstract.txt,"Oral fumaric acid esters for the treatment of psoriasis
Background 
Psoriasis is a long‐term inflammatory skin condition that can markedly reduce the quality of life of affected individuals. Treatments taken by mouth (oral treatments), such as methotrexate, ciclosporin, and acitretin, are commonly prescribed to people with moderate to severe psoriasis. Oral fumaric acid esters (FAE) are licensed for the treatment of psoriasis in Germany but remain unlicensed in most other countries. This means that there are different treatment options offered to people in different countries. 
Review question 
What is the available evidence for the benefits and risks of using FAE for treating psoriasis? 
Study characteristics 
Our review included six randomised control trials (RCTs) that involved 544 participants. Five RCTs compared FAE with placebo, and one compared FAE with methotrexate. The outcomes we were interested in measuring were the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), which is a psoriasis severity score, and the proportion of participants who discontinued treatment because of adverse (side) effects that are common but sufficiently serious that the drug had to be stopped, such as severe diarrhoea, infections, or cutaneous malignancy. 
Key results 
It was difficult to pool and compare results because outcome measures differed between the studies. Three studies reported significant benefit with FAE when compared with placebo after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment, but we could not combine these results in a statistical analysis to show the overall difference. The included studies did not fully examine the chance of discontinuing FAE treatment because of adverse effects, which is uncertain. One study showed that individuals on FAE are nearly five times more likely to develop nuisance adverse effects; the most common were diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, flushing, reversible protein loss in the urine, and raised levels of eosinophil blood cells. Two RCTs were similar enough to allow the combination of their results and found that FAE were better than placebo when measured by the proportion of individuals who experienced at least a 50% improvement in their psoriasis severity score. One study reported improvement of individuals' quality of life with FAE in comparison with placebo, but the significance of this difference could not be calculated. The benefit of FAE was similar to methotrexate after 12 weeks when changes in disease severity from the start to the end of the trial were compared. The number of individuals experiencing nuisance adverse effects with these two treatments was not significantly different. The included studies, which were too small and of limited duration to provide evidence about rare or delayed effects, reported no serious adverse effects of FAE. 
Quality of the evidence 
The risk of study bias, which means any factors that may systematically deviate away from the true findings, was unclear in most studies. This may be because most of the studies were conducted decades ago or were incompletely reported. Several analyses comparing FAE with placebo and methotrexate were limited because the studies were small or did not provide enough information to establish how these treatments compare with each other. Therefore, the overall quality of the evidence was low when comparing FAE with placebo and very low when comparing FAE with methotrexate. 
Future RCTs should use standard psoriasis outcome measures, including a validated quality of life scale, to enable the comparison and combination of results. They should be longer in duration or have longer follow‐up phases to provide evidence about any delayed adverse effects. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Oral Fumaric Acid Esters for Treating Psoriasis

## Plain Title
Testing Pills Called Fumaric Acid Esters to Treat Psoriasis Skin Disease

## Rationale

**What is psoriasis and why does it matter?**

Psoriasis is a skin disease that lasts a long time. It causes red, scaly patches on the skin. This condition can make life very hard for people who have it. It can affect how they feel about themselves and their daily activities.

**What treatments are available?**

People with moderate to severe psoriasis often need pills to help control their disease. Doctors commonly prescribe pills like methotrexate, ciclosporin, and acitretin. Another treatment option is fumaric acid esters, or FAE for short. These are pills that doctors in Germany can prescribe for psoriasis. However, most other countries do not allow doctors to prescribe FAE yet. This means people in different countries get different treatment choices.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to find out if FAE pills really work for psoriasis. They also wanted to know if these pills are safe. This information would help doctors and patients decide if FAE is a good treatment option. The study looked at all the research done on FAE to answer these questions.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at six different studies that had already been done. These studies were randomized control trials, or RCTs. This means patients were put into groups by chance. This type of study gives good quality results.

**Who was in these studies?**

A total of 544 people took part across all six studies. All of them had psoriasis. Five studies compared FAE pills to fake pills (called placebo). One study compared FAE pills to methotrexate pills.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at two main things. First, they measured how severe the psoriasis was using a scoring system called PASI. Second, they counted how many people stopped taking the pills because of side effects. They wanted to know about common side effects that were serious enough to make people stop treatment. These included severe diarrhea, infections, or skin cancer.

**How long did the studies last?**

Most studies lasted 12 to 16 weeks.

## Results

**What did the studies find about FAE working?**

Three studies showed that FAE pills worked better than fake pills after 12 to 16 weeks. However, each study measured results differently. This made it hard to combine all the results together.

Two studies were similar enough to combine. These showed that FAE pills worked better than fake pills. About twice as many people taking FAE had their psoriasis improve by at least half.

One study compared FAE to methotrexate. Both treatments worked about the same after 12 weeks.

One study found that people taking FAE felt their quality of life got better compared to those taking fake pills.

**What side effects did people have?**

People taking FAE were nearly five times more likely to have bothersome side effects than those taking fake pills. The most common side effects were:
- Diarrhea and stomach cramps
- Flushing (skin turning red and feeling hot)
- Protein in the urine (this went away after stopping the pills)
- Higher levels of certain white blood cells called eosinophils

The studies found no serious or dangerous side effects from FAE. However, the studies were small and short. They could not show if rare or delayed side effects might happen.

When comparing FAE to methotrexate, both treatments caused about the same number of bothersome side effects.

**How good was the evidence?**

The quality of evidence was low. Many studies were done many years ago. They did not report all their information clearly. The studies were also quite small. This makes it harder to trust the results completely.

**What does this mean?**

FAE pills may help treat psoriasis. They seem to work as well as methotrexate. However, we need better and longer studies to be sure. Future studies should measure the same things in the same way. They should also last longer to find any side effects that happen later.",10.1002-14651858.CD010497,"Oral fumaric acid esters for the treatment of psoriasis

Key messages 
Anticholinergic medicines may increase the risk of death in older adults who have dementia.  However, the evidence is low certainty, and we cannot say for certain if the anticholinergic medicines cause death, or if they are simply more likely to be used by people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.  
We cannot draw firm conclusions for the risk that anticholinergic medicines pose to the development of other undesirable clinical outcomes, such as further deterioration of memory and thinking, or behavioural and psychological issues.  More research is needed to establish whether anticholinergic medicines cause unintended problems for older adults who have dementia. 
What are anticholinergic medicines? 
Medicines can be classified by their ability to block the action of a chemical signalling system in the body, called the cholinergic system. Medicines that do this are said to have anticholinergic effects, and therefore, are referred to as anticholinergic medicines. 
What did we want to find out?  
Anticholinergic medicines are commonly used to treat a number of medical conditions that people with dementia frequently experience. Typical examples are medicines used to treat urinary tract infections or episodes of agitation. However, because the cholinergic system in the brain plays an important role in learning, memory, and emotional regulation, there are theoretical reasons to believe that the use of anticholinergic medicines may unintentionally exacerbate psychological problems in this population. In this review, we investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and future occurrence of undesirable clinical outcomes in people with dementia.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the link between anticholinergic medicines and a range of clinical outcomes in people with dementia. We compared and summarised the results of identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes.  
What did we find? 
We found a total of 18 studies, involving 102,684 adults aged 50 years or more, who had issues with memory and thinking. We found that the evidence was highly inconsistent regarding the link between anticholinergic medicines and increased issues with memory and thinking in people with dementia. There were no studies that investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and frequency of behavioural disturbances. Therefore, we could not draw any conclusions about whether anticholinergic medicines cause issues with memory and thinking, or behavioural disturbances in this population. However, we did find there was a more consistent link between anticholinergic medicines and the risk of death. Those who were taking anticholinergic medicines had a 15% higher risk of dying than those who were not taking anticholinergic medicines.   
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The available evidence is very low certainty because of the inconsistency of study results, and the lack of control for health conditions that could be linked with both the clinical outcomes and the prescribing of anticholinergic medicines themselves. It is possible that anticholinergic medicines may not actually cause death, but are simply more likely to be given to people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.   
How up to date is this evidence? 
We searched for studies published up to 29 November 2021.

## Plain Title
Do Medicines with Anticholinergic Effects Harm Older Adults with Dementia?

## Rationale

**What is dementia and why does this matter?**

Dementia is a condition that affects memory and thinking. People with dementia often have other health problems too. They may get infections or feel upset and confused. Doctors give them medicines to treat these problems.

**What are anticholinergic medicines?**

Some medicines block a system in the body called the cholinergic system. This system sends signals between cells. Medicines that block this system are called anticholinergic medicines. Many common medicines work this way.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

The cholinergic system in the brain helps with memory and learning. It also helps control emotions. Researchers wanted to know if anticholinergic medicines might make problems worse for people with dementia. They thought these medicines might harm memory or cause behavior problems. They also wanted to know if these medicines might increase the risk of death.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors often give anticholinergic medicines to people with dementia. But no one knew for sure if these medicines were safe for this group. Researchers needed to look at all the studies done so far. This would help doctors make better choices about which medicines to use.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers do this study?**

This was not a single study with patients. Instead, researchers looked for all studies already done on this topic. They searched for studies published up to November 2021.

**Who was included in the studies?**

The researchers found 18 studies. These studies included 102,684 people total. All were age 50 or older. All had problems with memory and thinking.

**What did the researchers look at?**

The researchers looked at whether people took anticholinergic medicines. Then they checked what happened to these people over time. They wanted to see if the medicines were linked to:
- More problems with memory and thinking
- Behavior problems
- Death

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The results were mixed and unclear for most outcomes.

**Memory and thinking problems:**
The studies gave very different results. Some studies found a link between anticholinergic medicines and worse memory. Other studies found no link. The researchers could not say for sure if these medicines harm memory and thinking.

**Behavior problems:**
No studies looked at this outcome. The researchers could not answer this question.

**Risk of death:**
Most studies found a link here. People taking anticholinergic medicines had a higher risk of dying. The risk was 15% higher than for people not taking these medicines. This means that for every 100 people who might die without the medicine, 115 people might die with the medicine.

**What are the problems with this evidence?**

The evidence quality was very low. This means we cannot be sure about the findings. Here is why:

The studies gave different results from each other. The studies did not account for other health problems well. People who take anticholinergic medicines might already be sicker. They might be at higher risk of dying because of their other health problems, not because of the medicine itself.

**What do these results mean?**

Anticholinergic medicines might increase the risk of death in older adults with dementia. But we cannot be certain. The medicines might not cause death directly. Instead, doctors might give these medicines to people who are already very sick.

We need more research to know for sure. Future studies need to be done more carefully. They need to account for other health problems that patients have.

**What should happen next?**

Doctors should be careful when giving anticholinergic medicines to people with dementia. They should think about the possible risks. More research is needed to understand if these medicines truly cause harm. Better studies will help doctors make safer choices for their patients.",10.1002-14651858.CD015196,"The impact of cumulative medications with anticholinergic effects on future adverse clinical outcomes in people with dementia 
Key messages 
Anticholinergic medicines may increase the risk of death in older adults who have dementia.  However, the evidence is low certainty, and we cannot say for certain if the anticholinergic medicines cause death, or if they are simply more likely to be used by people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.  
We cannot draw firm conclusions for the risk that anticholinergic medicines pose to the development of other undesirable clinical outcomes, such as further deterioration of memory and thinking, or behavioural and psychological issues.  More research is needed to establish whether anticholinergic medicines cause unintended problems for older adults who have dementia. 
What are anticholinergic medicines? 
Medicines can be classified by their ability to block the action of a chemical signalling system in the body, called the cholinergic system. Medicines that do this are said to have anticholinergic effects, and therefore, are referred to as anticholinergic medicines. 
What did we want to find out?  
Anticholinergic medicines are commonly used to treat a number of medical conditions that people with dementia frequently experience. Typical examples are medicines used to treat urinary tract infections or episodes of agitation. However, because the cholinergic system in the brain plays an important role in learning, memory, and emotional regulation, there are theoretical reasons to believe that the use of anticholinergic medicines may unintentionally exacerbate psychological problems in this population. In this review, we investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and future occurrence of undesirable clinical outcomes in people with dementia.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the link between anticholinergic medicines and a range of clinical outcomes in people with dementia. We compared and summarised the results of identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes.  
What did we find? 
We found a total of 18 studies, involving 102,684 adults aged 50 years or more, who had issues with memory and thinking. We found that the evidence was highly inconsistent regarding the link between anticholinergic medicines and increased issues with memory and thinking in people with dementia. There were no studies that investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and frequency of behavioural disturbances. Therefore, we could not draw any conclusions about whether anticholinergic medicines cause issues with memory and thinking, or behavioural disturbances in this population. However, we did find there was a more consistent link between anticholinergic medicines and the risk of death. Those who were taking anticholinergic medicines had a 15% higher risk of dying than those who were not taking anticholinergic medicines.   
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The available evidence is very low certainty because of the inconsistency of study results, and the lack of control for health conditions that could be linked with both the clinical outcomes and the prescribing of anticholinergic medicines themselves. It is possible that anticholinergic medicines may not actually cause death, but are simply more likely to be given to people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.   
How up to date is this evidence? 
We searched for studies published up to 29 November 2021.

Preterm infants have fewer nutrient reserves at birth than full‐term infants and often receive artificial formula feeds in the absence of expressed breast milk. Although it is generally agreed that feeding must be initiated slowly and advanced with much greater deliberation than in a healthy, full‐term infant, the way in which feeds are introduced and advanced in preterm infants varies widely. This review focuses on whether dilute or full‐strength formula is the preferable mode of introducing feeds in preterm infants for whom expressed breast milk is unavailable. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of dilute versus full‐strength formula on the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis, feeding intolerance, weight gain, length of stay in hospital and time to achieve full calorie intake in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants. A secondary objective was to assess the effects of different dilution strategies. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to update the search in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 1 October 2018), Embase (1980 to 1 October 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 1 October 2018). 
We searched clinical trials' registries for ongoing or recently completed trials (clinicaltrials.gov; the World Health Organization’s International Trials Registry and Platform; and the ISRCTN Registry). 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised trials comparing strengths of formula milk in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants. We excluded studies if infants received formula as a supplement to breast milk. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently assessed studies for inclusion. We collected data using the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal, with independent assessment of risk of bias and data extraction. We synthesised mean differences using a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included three studies involving 102 preterm or low birth weight infants in the review. The studies compared dilute (double‐volume, half‐strength) formula with full‐strength (20 kcal/oz (~ 68 to 70 kcal/100 mL)) formula. We assessed all three studies as having unclear risk of bias due to the likely absence of blinding of study personnel and the potential for selection bias in the largest trial. Data for the primary outcome of necrotising enterocolitis were not reported in any of the studies. We could combine two of the studies (88 infants) in the meta‐analysis. The evidence suggests that dilute formula with double‐volume (half‐strength) may lead to fewer episodes of gastric residuals per day (one study; mean difference (MD) −1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.20 to −0.20; low‐certainty evidence), fewer episodes of gastric residuals per baby until attaining 100 kcal/kg (one study; MD −0.80, 95% CI −1.32 to −0.28; low‐certainty evidence), fewer episodes of vomiting per day (one study; MD −0.04, 95% CI −0.07 to −0.01; low‐certainty evidence) and fewer occurrences of abdominal distension greater than 2 cm (two studies; MD −0.16, 95% CI −0.19 to −0.13; low‐certainty evidence). For the secondary outcomes, data suggest that infants in the dilute formula with double‐volume (half‐strength) group may have attained an adequate energy intake earlier than infants in the full‐strength group (two studies; MD −2.26, 95% CI −2.85 to −1.67; low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups for weight gain one week after commencement of intragastric feeds (one study; MD 0.05 kg, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.15; low‐certainty evidence). Data were not reported for length of hospital stay. 
Authors' conclusions
There is low‐certainty evidence from three small, old trials that use of dilute formula in preterm or low birth weight formula‐fed infants may lead to an important reduction in the time taken for preterm infants to attain an adequate energy intake. 
However, our confidence in this result is limited due to uncertainty over risk of bias and sparsity of available data. Dilute formula may reduce incidence of feeding intolerance, but the clinical significance of the reduction is uncertain. The impact on serious gastrointestinal problems, including necrotising enterocolitis, was not reported in any of the trials. Further randomised trials are needed to confirm these results. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Diluted vs. Full-Strength Formula for Premature Babies

## Plain Title

Does diluted formula work better than full-strength formula for feeding premature babies?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Babies born too early (premature babies) are smaller and have less stored nutrients than babies born at full term. These tiny babies need special care when it comes to feeding. Sometimes mothers cannot provide breast milk, so doctors must feed these babies with formula milk instead.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors do not agree on the best way to start feeding premature babies with formula. Some doctors give babies diluted formula (mixed with extra water to make it weaker). Other doctors give full-strength formula right away. Doctors need to know which method is safer and works better.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to find out if diluted formula or full-strength formula is better for premature babies. They looked at several important things. These included serious gut problems, feeding problems, weight gain, and how long babies stayed in the hospital. They also wanted to know how quickly babies could get all the calories they needed.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at three older studies. These studies included 102 premature or low birth weight babies. All babies in these studies were fed only formula milk, not breast milk.

The studies compared two types of formula feeding:
- Diluted formula: This was half-strength formula with double the usual amount of water
- Full-strength formula: This was regular formula (about 20 calories per ounce)

The researchers combined results from these studies to see what worked better. They looked carefully at how well each study was done.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The studies did not report on the most serious gut problem called necrotizing enterocolitis. This is when parts of the baby's intestine become damaged or die.

However, the studies did show some differences:

**Feeding problems were less common with diluted formula:**
- Babies had less food left in their stomachs each day
- Babies vomited less often
- Babies had less belly swelling

**Babies reached full feeding faster with diluted formula:**
- Babies who got diluted formula reached their full calorie needs about 2 days sooner than babies who got full-strength formula

**Weight gain was similar:**
- Both groups of babies gained about the same amount of weight after one week

**What the studies did not tell us:**
- How long babies stayed in the hospital
- Whether serious gut problems happened

**What do these results mean?**

Diluted formula might help premature babies have fewer feeding problems. It might also help them reach full feeding faster. However, we cannot be very sure about these results. The studies were small and old. The researchers could not tell if the studies were done in the best way possible.

**What are the main conclusions?**

Diluted formula might be helpful for premature babies who need formula feeding. It may reduce feeding problems and help babies get full nutrition faster. But we need more and better studies to be sure. Future studies should look at serious gut problems and other important health outcomes.

Doctors and parents should talk about the best feeding approach for each premature baby. More research is needed before we can say for certain which method is best.",10.1002-14651858.CD007263,"Dilute versus full‐strength formula in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants 
Review questionIs dilute formula milk (e.g. half the strength at double the volume) better tolerated than full‐strength formula milk in the initial feeding of preterm babies for whom breast milk is not available?  
BackgroundBabies born preterm (at less than 37 weeks' gestation) or with a low birth weight (less than 2500 grams) have special feeding requirements. Expressed breast milk is preferred, but preterm babies are often fed with formula milk because breast milk is not always available. The provision of artificial feeds varies considerably in preterm babies and there is concern that introducing full‐strength formulas too early may lead to the retention of feed in the stomach, which is associated with feeding intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis, a severe bowel disorder. 
Study characteristicsThe evidence for this review is current as of 1 October 2018. We included three trials that compared dilute formula milk (half‐strength, double‐volume) with full‐strength formula milk. The trials involved 102 preterm or low birth weight infants; two were conducted in the USA and one in India. The trials were small (14, 38 and 50 infants, respectively) and conducted between 25 and 30 years ago. The quality of two trials was judged to be poor due to insufficient information being provided in the trial publications, but judged to be moderate in the third trial (of 38 infants). None of the trials assessed necrotising enterocolitis as an outcome. 
Key resultsInfants receiving dilute formula (half‐strength, double‐volume) experienced fewer episodes of feeding intolerance and achieved full energy intake earlier than infants receiving full‐strength formula (20 kcal/oz (~ 68 to 70 kcal/100 mL)). 
Feeding intoleranceTwo measures of feeding intolerance (abdominal distension and episodes of gastric residuals) were reported across the trials. Two trials (88 infants) provided data for abdominal distension and gastric residuals. Infants fed dilute formula experienced 19% (CI 16% to 23%) fewer episodes of abdominal distension (> 2 cm), equivalent to 0.67 episodes per infant in the half‐strength group compared to 0.83 episodes in the full‐strength group. It was not possible to combine data on gastric residuals but both trials reported fewer episodes of gastric residuals in the dilute formula group. The third trial (14 infants) only reported that there was no difference between the groups with respect to these two outcomes. 
Time to establish full enteral feedingIn two trials (88 infants) infants receiving dilute formula experienced a 22% (CI 16% to 28%) reduction in the number of days required to reach an adequate energy intake (420 joules/kilogram), equivalent to 8 days in the half‐strength group compared to 10.3 days in the full‐strength group. 
Certainty of evidenceIn exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants, low‐certainty evidence shows that diluted formula may lead to an important reduction in the time taken to attain adequate enteral fluid and energy requirements, without increasing indicators of feeding intolerance. The clinical importance of the reduction in episodes of feeding intolerance is unclear. These findings are based on three small, old trials that may be of less relevance to current practice. A lack of data on other important outcomes, such as the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and weight gain, limits the usefulness of the studies.

Starting in late 2019, COVID‐19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2, spread around the world. Long‐term care facilities are at particularly high risk of outbreaks, and the burden of morbidity and mortality is very high among residents living in these facilities. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological measures implemented in long‐term care facilities to prevent or reduce the transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection among residents, staff, and visitors. 
Search methods
On 22 January 2021, we searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, Web of Science, and CINAHL. 
We also conducted backward citation searches of existing reviews.
Selection criteria
We considered experimental, quasi‐experimental, observational and modelling studies that assessed the effects of the measures implemented in long‐term care facilities to protect residents and staff against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Primary outcomes were infections, hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID‐19, contaminations of and outbreaks in long‐term care facilities, and adverse health effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author performed data extractions, risk of bias assessments and quality appraisals, and at least one other author checked their accuracy. Risk of bias and quality assessments were conducted using the ROBINS‐I tool for cohort and interrupted‐time‐series studies, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for case‐control studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively, focusing on the direction of effect. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, with the author team critically discussing the ratings. 
Main results
We included 11 observational studies and 11 modelling studies in the analysis. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. 
Most studies compared outcomes in long‐term care facilities that implemented the measures with predicted or observed control scenarios without the measure (but often with baseline infection control measures also in place). Several modelling studies assessed additional comparator scenarios, such as comparing higher with lower rates of testing. 
There were serious concerns regarding risk of bias in almost all observational studies and major or critical concerns regarding the quality of many modelling studies. Most observational studies did not adequately control for confounding. Many modelling studies used inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of the models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. 
Overall, we identified five intervention domains, each including a number of specific measures. 
Entry regulation measures (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies)Self‐confinement of staff with residents may reduce the number of infections, probability of facility contamination, and number of deaths. Quarantine for new admissions may reduce the number of infections. Testing of new admissions and intensified testing of residents and of staff after holidays may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain regarding whether restricting admissions of new residents reduces the number of infections, but the measure may reduce the probability of facility contamination. Visiting restrictions may reduce the number of infections and deaths. Furthermore, it may increase the probability of facility contamination, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is very uncertain how visiting restrictions may adversely affect the mental health of residents. 
Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies)Barrier nursing may increase the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent cleaning and environmental hygiene measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear how contact reduction measures affect the probability of outbreaks. These measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. Personal hygiene measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Mask and personal protective equipment usage may reduce the number of infections, the probability of outbreaks, and the number of deaths, but the evidence is very uncertain. Cohorting residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, although evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent contact ‐regulating and transmission ‐reducing measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
Surveillance measures (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies)Routine testing of residents and staff independent of symptoms may reduce the number of infections. It may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Evidence from one observational study suggests that the measure may reduce, while the evidence from one modelling study suggests that it probably reduces hospitalisations. The measure may reduce the number of deaths among residents, but the evidence on deaths among staff is unclear. Symptom‐based surveillance testing may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
Outbreak control measures (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies)Separating infected and non‐infected residents or staff caring for them may reduce the number of infections. The measure may reduce the probability of outbreaks and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. Isolation of cases may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
Multicomponent measures (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study)A combination of multiple infection‐control measures, including various combinations of the above categories, may reduce the number of infections and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides a comprehensive framework and synthesis of a range of non‐pharmacological measures implemented in long‐term care facilities. These may prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infections and their consequences. However, the certainty of evidence is predominantly low to very low, due to the limited availability of evidence and the design and quality of available studies. Therefore, true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. 
Overall, more studies producing stronger evidence on the effects of non‐pharmacological measures are needed, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries and on possible unintended consequences of these measures. Future research should explore the reasons behind the paucity of evidence to guide pandemic research priority setting in the future. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Ways to Protect Nursing Home Residents and Staff from COVID-19

## Plain Title

How well do safety measures work to stop COVID-19 from spreading in nursing homes?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new virus. It started spreading around the world in late 2019. Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities face very high risks during COVID-19 outbreaks. Many residents in these facilities are older adults. They often have other health problems. This makes them more likely to get very sick or die from COVID-19.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to find out which safety measures work best in nursing homes. These measures do not include vaccines or medicines. Instead, they include things like testing, cleaning, and visitor rules. The goal was to see which measures help protect residents and staff from getting COVID-19.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if these safety measures could:
- Reduce the number of COVID-19 infections
- Lower the number of people who need to go to the hospital
- Prevent deaths from COVID-19
- Stop outbreaks from happening in nursing homes

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this question?**

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at many different studies done by other scientists. They searched for studies published up to January 2021. They found 22 studies total. Eleven studies watched what happened in real nursing homes. Eleven studies used computer models to predict what might happen.

**Where were these studies done?**

All studies took place in wealthy countries. No studies came from poorer countries.

**What did the studies look at?**

The studies looked at nursing homes that used different safety measures. They compared these nursing homes to ones that did not use the measures. Some studies also compared different amounts of the same measure. For example, they compared more testing versus less testing.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

Researchers grouped the safety measures into five main types:

**1. Rules about who can enter the facility**

- Having staff live at the facility with residents may reduce infections and deaths.
- Keeping new residents separate for a time may reduce infections.
- Testing new residents may reduce infections, but researchers are not very sure.
- Limiting visitors may reduce infections and deaths. However, this might harm the mental health of residents. Researchers are not very sure about this.

**2. Measures to reduce contact and stop spread**

- Using masks and protective gear may reduce infections, outbreaks, and deaths. But researchers are not very sure.
- Keeping infected and healthy residents in separate groups may reduce infections. But researchers are not very sure.
- Better cleaning may reduce infections. But researchers are not very sure.

**3. Testing and monitoring**

- Testing all residents and staff regularly may reduce infections. It may also reduce hospital visits and deaths.
- Testing people when they have symptoms may reduce infections and outbreaks. But researchers are not very sure.

**4. Controlling outbreaks**

- Keeping infected people away from healthy people may reduce infections, outbreaks, and deaths.
- Isolating people who test positive may reduce infections and outbreaks. But researchers are not very sure.

**5. Using many measures together**

- Combining several safety measures may reduce infections and deaths. But researchers are not very sure.

**What are the main conclusions?**

Many safety measures may help protect nursing home residents and staff from COVID-19. However, the quality of the evidence is mostly low. This means the true effects might be quite different from what these studies show. More and better research is needed. Studies should also look at possible harmful effects of these measures. More research is needed in poorer countries.

**Word count: 627**",10.1002-14651858.CD015085,"Can non‐medicinal measures prevent or reduce SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in long term care facilities? 
Key messages 
• Non‐medicinal measures (e.g. visiting restrictions or regular testing) may prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (causing COVID‐19 disease) in residents and staff in long term care facilities, but we have concerns about the reliability of the findings. 
• More high‐quality studies on real‐world experiences are needed, in particular.
• More research is also needed on measures in facilities where most residents and staff are vaccinated, as well as regions other than North America and Europe. 
What are non‐medicinal measures? 
Non‐medicinal measures are ways of preventing or reducing disease without using medicine, such as vaccines. These include controlling people's movements and contacts, using personal protective equipment (PPE), or regular testing for infection. 
SARS‐CoV‐2 is very infectious. Elderly or disabled people, who live in care homes (long‐term care facilities), are vulnerable to infection because they live in close contact with other people, with carers and visitors entering and leaving the facility. Due to age and underlying health conditions, care home residents have an increased risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID‐19 and dying from the disease. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how effective non‐medicinal measures are in preventing residents and staff in long‐term care facilities from becoming infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and in reducing the spread of the infection. We focused on all types of long‐term care facilities for adults, such as nursing homes for the elderly and skilled nursing facilities for people living with disabilities. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated the effects of non‐medicinal measures in long‐term care facilities. To be included, studies had to report how many infections, hospitalisations or deaths the measures prevented in residents or staff, or whether the measures prevented the introduction of the virus into the facilities or prevented outbreaks within facilities. We included any type of study, including observational studies that used ‘real‐world’ data, or modelling studies based on assumed data from computer‐generated simulations. 
What did we find? 
We found 22 studies, 11 observational and 11 modelling studies. All studies were conducted in North America or Europe. 
There were four main types of measures.
1.Entry regulation measures to prevent residents, staff or visitors introducing the virus into the facility. Measures included staff confining themselves with residents, quarantine for newly‐admitted residents, testing new admissions, not allowing the admission of new residents, and preventing visitors from entering facilities. 
2. Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures to prevent people passing on the virus. Measures included wearing masks or PPE, social distancing, extra cleaning, reducing contact between residents and among staff, and placing residents and staff in care groups and limiting contact between groups. 
3. Surveillance measures designed to identify an outbreak early. Measures included regular testing of residents or staff regardless of symptoms, and symptom‐based testing. 
4. Outbreak control measures to reduce the consequences of an outbreak. Measures included isolation of infected residents, and separating infected and non‐infected residents or staff caring for them. 
Some studies used a combination of these measures.
Main results 
Entry regulation measures  (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies) 
Most studies showed that such measures were beneficial, but some studies found no effects or unwanted effects, such as depression and delirium among residents in the context of visiting restrictions. 
Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures  (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies) 
Some measures may be beneficial, but often the evidence is very uncertain.
Surveillance measures  (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies) 
Routine testing of residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, hospitalisations and deaths among residents, although the evidence on the number of deaths among staff was less clear. Testing more often, getting test results faster, and using more accurate tests were predicted to have more beneficial effects. 
Outbreak control measures  (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies) 
These measures may reduce the number of infections and the risk of outbreaks in facilities, but often the evidence is very uncertain. 
Combination measures  (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study) 
A combination of different measures may be effective in reducing the number of infections and deaths. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in these results is limited. Many studies used mathematical prediction rather than real‐world data, and we cannot be confident that the model assumptions are accurate. Most observational studies did not use the most reliable methods. This means we cannot be confident that the measure caused the effect, for example, that testing of residents reduced the number of deaths. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
This review includes studies published up to 22 January 2021.

To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of different dose schedules and different types of HPV vaccines in females and males. 
Search methods
We conducted electronic searches on 27 September 2018 in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library), and Ovid Embase. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov (both 27 September 2018), vaccine manufacturer websites, and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restriction. We considered studies if they enrolled HIV‐negative males or females aged 9 to 26 years, or HIV‐positive males or females of any age. 
Data collection and analysis
We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products containing an adjuvant or active vaccine and 'placebo' to refer to products that contain no adjuvant or active vaccine. Most primary outcomes in this review were clinical outcomes. However, for comparisons comparing dose schedules, the included RCTs were designed to measure antibody responses (i.e. immunogenicity) as the primary outcome, rather than clinical outcomes, since it is unethical to collect cervical samples from girls under 16 years of age. We analysed immunogenicity outcomes (i.e. geometric mean titres) with ratios of means, clinical outcomes (e.g. cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia) with risk ratios or rate ratios and, for serious adverse events and deaths, we calculated odds ratios. We rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE. 
Main results
We included 20 RCTs with 31,940 participants. The length of follow‐up in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years. 
Two doses versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 15‐year‐old females 
Antibody responses after two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules were similar after up to five years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected clinical outcome data. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing dose schedules was of very low‐certainty owing to imprecision and indirectness (three doses 35/1159; two doses 36/1158; 4 RCTs). One death was reported in the three‐dose group (1/898) and none in the two‐dose group (0/899) (low‐certainty evidence). 
Interval between doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 14‐year‐old females and males 
Antibody responses were stronger with a longer interval (6 or 12 months) between the first two doses of HPV vaccine than a shorter interval (2 or 6 months) at up to three years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected data about clinical outcomes. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing intervals was of very low‐certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. No deaths were reported in any of the studies (0/1898, 3 RCTs, low‐certainty evidence). 
HPV vaccination of 10‐ to 26‐year‐old males 
In one RCT there was moderate‐certainty evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control, reduced the incidence of external genital lesions (control 36 per 3081 person‐years; quadrivalent 6 per 3173 person‐years; rate ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 6254 person‐years) and anogenital warts (control 28 per 2814 person‐years; quadrivalent 3 per 2831 person‐years; rate ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; 5645 person‐years). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection‐site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (537 versus 601 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18, 3895 participants, high‐certainty evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence from two RCTs about serious adverse events with quadrivalent vaccine (control 12/2588; quadrivalent 8/2574), and about deaths (control 11/2591; quadrivalent 3/2582), owing to imprecision and indirectness. 
Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9‐ to 26‐year‐old females and males 
Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9‐ to 15‐years (n = 600), one in females aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 500). The RCT in 16‐ to 26‐year‐old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high‐grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high‐certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Comparative evidence about serious adverse events in the three RCTs (nonavalent 243/8234, quadrivalent 192/7629; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.61) was of low certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. 
HPV vaccination for people living with HIV 
Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low‐certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness. 
Authors' conclusions
The immunogenicity of two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules, measured using antibody responses in young females, is comparable. The quadrivalent vaccine probably reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males compared with control. The nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines offer similar protection against a combined outcome of cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions or cancer. In people living with HIV, both the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in high antibody responses. For all comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, the certainty of the body of evidence about serious adverse events reported during the study periods was low or very low, either because the number of events was low, or the evidence was indirect, or both. Post‐marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms that might be associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and this evidence will be incorporated in future updates of this review. Long‐term observational studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of reduced‐dose schedules against HPV‐related cancer endpoints, and whether adopting these schedules improves vaccine coverage rates. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Different Ways to Give HPV Vaccines

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Doses and Types of HPV Vaccines in Young People

## Rationale

### What is HPV and why does it matter?
HPV stands for human papillomavirus. This virus can cause cancer of the cervix in women. It can also cause other cancers and genital warts in both men and women. HPV vaccines help protect people from getting these diseases.

### The problem
The current HPV vaccine requires three shots. Many people do not complete all three shots. This means they may not be fully protected. Researchers wanted to find simpler ways to give the vaccine. Fewer shots might help more people get vaccinated.

### Why this study was needed
Doctors needed to know if giving fewer shots still works well. They also wanted to compare different types of HPV vaccines. They studied vaccines in both girls and boys. They also looked at whether the vaccines work in people living with HIV.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at 20 different studies. These studies included almost 32,000 people. The studies followed people for 7 months to 5 years.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included:
- Girls and boys aged 9 to 26 years who did not have HIV
- People of any age who were living with HIV

### What did researchers compare?
They compared:
- Two shots versus three shots of vaccine
- Different time gaps between shots
- Vaccines given to males
- Different types of vaccines (called nonavalent and quadrivalent)
- Vaccines in people living with HIV

### What did researchers measure?
For younger children, researchers measured antibody levels. Antibodies are proteins the body makes to fight infection. Higher antibody levels mean better protection. For older teens and young adults, researchers also looked at actual diseases like genital warts and precancer.

## Results

### Two shots versus three shots in girls aged 9 to 15
Two shots worked as well as three shots. The body made similar amounts of antibodies with both schedules. This protection lasted for up to 5 years. No studies looked at actual disease prevention yet. Side effects were similar between groups.

### Time between shots
Waiting longer between the first two shots worked better. A 6-month or 12-month gap created more antibodies than a 2-month gap. This was true for both girls and boys aged 9 to 14.

### Vaccines for males aged 10 to 26
The quadrivalent vaccine worked well in males. It greatly reduced genital warts and other genital lesions. Males who got the vaccine had more pain or redness where they got the shot. But this was mild and went away quickly.

### Comparing two vaccine types in people aged 9 to 26
Researchers compared nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines. Both vaccines prevented precancer and cancer equally well. The nonavalent vaccine caused slightly more pain or redness at the injection site.

### Vaccines for people living with HIV
Both bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines created good antibody responses in people with HIV. Protection lasted for up to 2 years in children with HIV.

### Safety findings
Serious side effects were rare in all groups. Deaths were very rare and not clearly linked to the vaccines. More long-term monitoring is needed to track safety.

### What this means
Two shots of HPV vaccine may be enough for young people. This could help more people complete their vaccination. The vaccines work in both males and females. They also work in people living with HIV. Different types of vaccines provide similar protection.

### What happens next
Researchers need longer studies. They want to see if fewer shots prevent cancer as well as three shots do. They also want to know if simpler schedules help more people get vaccinated.",10.1002-14651858.CD013479,"Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines and the number of doses administered to prevent HPV‐related disease in females and males 
Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a group of viruses that infect the skin and mucous membranes. Some types of HPV are sexually transmitted and are common in young people. Most infections will be cleared by the immune system, but some people will experience persistent infection with certain HPV types that go on to cause abnormalities in infected cells. These changes are called 'precancerous' because they can develop into cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anal canal, penis, and head and neck. Infection with other HPV types causes warts in the genital area or around the anus. 
Vaccination aims to prevent future HPV infections. Three HPV vaccines are in use – a bivalent one (protects against two HPV types), a quadrivalent one (protects against four HPV types), and a nonavalent one (protects against nine HPV types). In women, three doses of the bivalent or the quadrivalent HPV vaccines protect against precancer of the cervix caused by the HPV types contained in the vaccine. Evidence about the nonavalent vaccine, about the effects of the quadrivalent vaccine in males, and about the effects of HPV vaccines in people with HIV infection, has not yet been reviewed thoroughly. Uptake of HPV vaccines remains low in many countries. Simpler vaccine schedules, or giving the vaccine to both girls and boys, could increase the number of people being vaccinated. 
Trials of HPV vaccines are not always designed to collect data about precancer and cancer, for several reasons. Firstly, HPV vaccine is routinely given before girls become sexually active, and it is not ethical to take specimens from the cervix of girls who have not had sex. Secondly, HPV‐related precancer and cancer are rare and do not develop until years after HPV infection has occurred. Thirdly, participants in a trial will be offered treatment if precancer develops, so progression to cervical cancer would be even rarer, even without vaccination. An international committee of experts states that, in some circumstances, antibody levels (i.e. showing a strong immune system response), can be used to demonstrate protection against cervical and anal cancer. The antibody levels following vaccination in a trial should not be lower than those found in other studies on adults in whom the vaccine has been shown to protect against severe HPV‐related cervical or anal disease. 
Review question(s) 
How effective or harmful are different HPV vaccine schedules (i.e. number and timing of doses) and different HPV vaccines in females and males? 
Main results 
These results are based on research evidence to 27 September 2018. We analysed 20 studies involving 31,940 people. 
Studies comparing two doses of HPV vaccine to three doses, or comparing the time interval between doses, focus on immune system responses rather than infection or disease outcomes. Two doses of HPV vaccine result in similar immune system responses to three doses, and a longer interval (up to 12 months) between doses gives a stronger immune system response than a shorter interval. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the vaccine schedules for serious adverse events and death. 
In 16‐ to 26‐year‐old men, one study showed evidence of moderate certainty that a quadrivalent HPV vaccine provides better protection against external genital lesions and genital warts than a dummy treatment (control). In 16‐ to 26‐year‐old women, one study showed that the nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines provide the same levels of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer (high‐certainty evidence). 
There was evidence that the quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more local adverse events (such as pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site) than a control treatment in males, and that the nonavalent vaccine resulted in more local adverse events than the quadrivalent vaccine in males and females. Evidence about serious adverse events and deaths from studies comparing different HPV vaccine types or dose schedules was of low or very low‐certainty. 
In people living with HIV, HPV vaccines result in reasonable levels of immune system response, but evidence about their effects on persistent HPV infection or HPV‐related disease outcomes and harms is limited. 
Certainty of the evidence 
No major issues were identified with the methodological quality of the studies for the measurements of infection and disease outcomes, or for immune system responses. Our certainty in the evidence about serious harms and deaths across all the studies comparing different HPV vaccines and vaccine schedules is low, either because of their low frequency, or because the evidence is indirect, or both. Evidence graded as high certainty means that we were confident that further research is unlikely to change our findings. Moderate‐certainty evidence means that there is a possibility that further research may have an important effect on our findings, whilst low‐certainty evidence means that our confidence was limited and further research may have an important impact on our findings. Very low‐certainty evidence means that we were uncertain about the result. 
Conclusion 
A two‐dose schedule of HPV vaccines in young females results in immune system responses that are comparable with a three‐dose schedule. In males, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine appears to be effective in the prevention of external genital lesions and genital warts. Quadrivalent and nonavalent HPV vaccines in young women result in similar levels of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer. Evidence about the efficacy and harms in people living with HIV is limited. Further long‐term population‐level studies are needed to continue monitoring safety of these vaccines, to determine for how long two doses of vaccine can provide protection against HPV‐related disease, the effect against HPV‐related cancer, and whether a two‐dose immunisation schedule will increase vaccine coverage.

Background 
Flare ups of symptoms (exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis are treated aggressively to prevent further damage to the lungs.

Study characteristics 
No completed studies have compared different lengths of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, but there is one study under way looking at this question. When the results are published, we plan to include the study in this review. 
Key results 
Further research is needed to find the best duration of treatment for exacerbations. A shorter duration of treatment may be better as these courses of treatment are easier for people to complete. They are also less expensive and cause fewer drug reactions than longer treatments. However, it is not clear if shorter treatment is enough to treat infections adequately. It is also not clear whether shorter treatment results in early recurrence or increased frequency of chest infections. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
How Long Should People with Cystic Fibrosis Receive Antibiotics Through a Vein for Lung Infections?

## Rationale

**What is cystic fibrosis and why does it matter?**

Cystic fibrosis is a lifelong disease. It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs. This mucus traps germs and leads to lung infections.

**What happens during a flare-up?**

People with cystic fibrosis sometimes get flare-ups. These are times when their chest symptoms get worse. Flare-ups can cause more lung damage if not treated quickly.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors treat these flare-ups with strong antibiotics. They give the antibiotics through a vein (a tube placed in the arm). This is called intravenous treatment. It helps the medicine reach the lungs faster.

The problem is that doctors don't know the best length of time for this treatment. Different hospitals use different time periods. Some treat for 10 days. Others treat for 14 days. If symptoms don't improve, they may treat for 21 days.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know the best length of time for antibiotic treatment. They wanted to find out if shorter treatment works as well as longer treatment.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers look for answers?**

The researchers searched for studies that compared different treatment lengths. They looked for studies that tested shorter treatment times against longer treatment times.

**What did they find?**

The researchers did not find any completed studies. No studies have compared different lengths of intravenous antibiotic treatment for cystic fibrosis flare-ups.

However, one study is currently happening. When that study finishes, the researchers will include it in their review.

**When did they search?**

The researchers searched for studies up to May 30, 2019.

## Results

**What were the main findings?**

The researchers could not report any results. This is because no completed studies were found.

**What does this mean for patients?**

More research is needed. Doctors still don't know the best length of time for antibiotic treatment during flare-ups.

**Why might shorter treatment be better?**

Shorter treatment could have some benefits:
- It is easier for people to complete
- It costs less money
- It may cause fewer side effects from the medicine

**Why might longer treatment be needed?**

Longer treatment might be necessary because:
- Shorter treatment might not fully clear the infection
- The infection might come back sooner
- People might get more frequent chest infections

**What do researchers conclude?**

Researchers need to do more studies. These studies should compare different treatment lengths. They should measure:
- How well each treatment length works
- How quickly infections come back
- How often people get new infections
- What side effects happen

Until these studies are done, doctors will continue using different treatment lengths. They will base their choices on their own experience and hospital practices.

**What happens next?**

One study is currently underway. When it is finished, it will help answer these important questions. The researchers will update this review when those results are available.

For now, people with cystic fibrosis should talk to their doctors. Together, they can decide the best treatment length for each flare-up.",10.1002-14651858.CD006682,"Length of time needed for antibiotic treatment given directly into the blood stream to clear acute chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis

Atopic eczema (AE), also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that causes significant burden. Phototherapy is sometimes used to treat AE when topical treatments, such as corticosteroids, are insufficient or poorly tolerated. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of phototherapy for treating AE. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov to January 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials in adults or children with any subtype or severity of clinically diagnosed AE. Eligible comparisons were any type of phototherapy versus other forms of phototherapy or any other treatment, including placebo or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology. For key findings, we used RoB 2.0 to assess bias, and GRADE to assess certainty of the evidence. Primary outcomes were physician‐assessed signs and patient‐reported symptoms. Secondary outcomes were Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), safety (measured as withdrawals due to adverse events), and long‐term control. 
Main results
We included 32 trials with 1219 randomised participants, aged 5 to 83 years (mean: 28 years), with an equal number of males and females. Participants were recruited mainly from secondary care dermatology clinics, and study duration was, on average, 13 weeks (range: 10 days to one year). We assessed risk of bias for all key outcomes as having some concerns or high risk, due to missing data, inappropriate analysis, or insufficient information to assess selective reporting. 
Assessed interventions included: narrowband ultraviolet B (NB‐UVB; 13 trials), ultraviolet A1 (UVA1; 6 trials), broadband ultraviolet B (BB‐UVB; 5 trials), ultraviolet AB (UVAB; 2 trials), psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA; 2 trials), ultraviolet A (UVA; 1 trial), unspecified ultraviolet B (UVB; 1 trial), full spectrum light (1 trial), Saalmann selective ultraviolet phototherapy (SUP) cabin (1 trial), saltwater bath plus UVB (balneophototherapy; 1 trial), and excimer laser (1 trial). Comparators included placebo, no treatment, another phototherapy, topical treatment, or alternative doses of the same treatment. 
Results for key comparisons are summarised (for scales, lower scores are better):
NB‐UVB versus placebo/no treatment 
There may be a larger reduction in physician‐assessed signs with NB‐UVB compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment (mean difference (MD) ‐9.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.62 to ‐15.18; 1 trial, 41 participants; scale: 0 to 90). Two trials reported little difference between NB‐UVB and no treatment (37 participants, four to six weeks of treatment); another reported improved signs with NB‐UVB versus no treatment (11 participants, nine weeks of treatment). 
NB‐UVB may increase the number of people reporting reduced itch after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.72, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.69; 1 trial, 40 participants). Another trial reported very little difference in itch severity with NB‐UVB (25 participants, four weeks of treatment). 
The number of participants with moderate to greater global improvement may be higher with NB‐UVB than placebo after 12 weeks of treatment (RR 2.81, 95% CI 1.10 to 7.17; 1 trial, 41 participants). 
NB‐UVB may not affect rates of withdrawal due to adverse events. No withdrawals were reported in one trial of NB‐UVB versus placebo (18 participants, nine weeks of treatment). In two trials of NB‐UVB versus no treatment, each reported one withdrawal per group (71 participants, 8 to 12 weeks of treatment). 
We judged that all reported outcomes were supported with low‐certainty evidence, due to risk of bias and imprecision. No trials reported HRQoL. 
NB‐UVB versus UVA1 
We judged the evidence for NB‐UVB compared to UVA1 to be very low certainty for all outcomes, due to risk of bias and imprecision. There was no evidence of a difference in physician‐assessed signs after six weeks (MD ‐2.00, 95% CI ‐8.41 to 4.41; 1 trial, 46 participants; scale: 0 to 108), or patient‐reported itch after six weeks (MD 0.3, 95% CI ‐1.07 to 1.67; 1 trial, 46 participants; scale: 0 to 10). Two split‐body trials (20 participants, 40 sides) also measured these outcomes, using different scales at seven to eight weeks; they reported lower scores with NB‐UVB. One trial reported HRQoL at six weeks (MD 2.9, 95% CI ‐9.57 to 15.37; 1 trial, 46 participants; scale: 30 to 150). One split‐body trial reported no withdrawals due to adverse events over 12 weeks (13 participants). No trials reported IGA. 
NB‐UVB versus PUVA 
We judged the evidence for NB‐UVB compared to PUVA (8‐methoxypsoralen in bath plus UVA) to be very low certainty for all reported outcomes, due to risk of bias and imprecision. There was no evidence of a difference in physician‐assessed signs after six weeks (64.1% reduction with NB‐UVB versus 65.7% reduction with PUVA; 1 trial, 10 participants, 20 sides). There was no evidence of a difference in marked improvement or complete remission after six weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 7.89; 1 trial, 9/10 participants with both treatments). One split‐body trial reported no withdrawals due to adverse events in 10 participants over six weeks. The trials did not report patient‐reported symptoms or HRQoL. 
UVA1 versus PUVA 
There was very low‐certainty evidence, due to serious risk of bias and imprecision, that PUVA (oral 5‐methoxypsoralen plus UVA) reduced physician‐assessed signs more than UVA1 after three weeks (MD 11.3, 95% CI ‐0.21 to 22.81; 1 trial, 40 participants; scale: 0 to 103). The trial did not report patient‐reported symptoms, IGA, HRQoL, or withdrawals due to adverse events. 
There were no eligible trials for the key comparisons of UVA1 or PUVA compared with no treatment. 
Adverse events 
Reported adverse events included low rates of phototoxic reaction, severe irritation, UV burn, bacterial superinfection, disease exacerbation, and eczema herpeticum. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared to placebo or no treatment, NB‐UVB may improve physician‐rated signs, patient‐reported symptoms, and IGA after 12 weeks, without a difference in withdrawal due to adverse events. Evidence for UVA1 compared to NB‐UVB or PUVA, and NB‐UVB compared to PUVA was very low certainty. More information is needed on the safety and effectiveness of all aspects of phototherapy for treating AE. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Light Therapy for Treating Atopic Eczema

## Plain Title

Does light therapy help people with atopic eczema?

## Rationale

**What is atopic eczema?**

Atopic eczema is also called atopic dermatitis. It is a long-term skin condition. The skin becomes red, itchy, and inflamed. This can cause a lot of problems for people who have it. The itching and skin changes can affect daily life.

**What treatments are used?**

Doctors often treat atopic eczema with creams. These creams may contain steroids. Sometimes these creams do not work well enough. Some people cannot use them. When this happens, doctors may try light therapy.

**What is light therapy?**

Light therapy uses special light to treat the skin. Different types of light can be used. The light may help reduce redness and itching.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if light therapy really works. They wanted to know which type of light works best. They also wanted to know if light therapy is safe. This information helps doctors choose the best treatment for their patients.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 32 different studies. These studies tested light therapy in people with atopic eczema. The studies included 1,219 people total.

**Who was in the studies?**

The people in the studies were between 5 and 83 years old. The average age was 28 years. About half were male and half were female. Most people were treated at skin clinics in hospitals.

**How long did the studies last?**

Most studies lasted about 13 weeks. The shortest study was 10 days. The longest study was one year.

**What types of light therapy were tested?**

Many different types of light were tested. These included:
- Narrowband ultraviolet B light (called NB-UVB)
- Ultraviolet A1 light (called UVA1)
- Broadband ultraviolet B light (called BB-UVB)
- PUVA (a medicine plus ultraviolet A light)
- Other types of ultraviolet light

**What were the treatments compared to?**

Light therapy was compared to:
- Fake treatment (placebo)
- No treatment
- Other types of light therapy
- Creams
- Different doses of the same light

## Results

**What did the researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at several things:
- How the skin looked (rated by doctors)
- How much itching people felt
- Overall improvement
- Quality of life
- Side effects

**Main findings for NB-UVB light therapy:**

NB-UVB may help more than fake treatment or no treatment. After 12 weeks:
- The skin looked better when doctors examined it
- More people reported less itching
- More people had moderate or greater improvement

About 2 out of 3 people improved with NB-UVB. Only 1 out of 4 people improved with fake treatment.

**Was NB-UVB safe?**

Very few people stopped treatment because of side effects. The number was about the same for NB-UVB and fake treatment.

**What about other types of light?**

Researchers compared NB-UVB to other light types. They found:
- NB-UVB and UVA1 may work about the same
- NB-UVB and PUVA may work about the same
- More research is needed to be sure

**What side effects happened?**

Some people had mild problems:
- Skin reactions to light
- Skin irritation
- Mild burns
- Skin infections
- Eczema getting worse

These problems did not happen very often.

**How certain are these results?**

The researchers rated the quality of evidence. Most evidence was low or very low quality. This means:
- The studies were small
- Some studies had problems with how they were done
- We need more research to be sure

**What do the results mean?**

NB-UVB light therapy may help people with atopic eczema. It may improve the skin and reduce itching. It appears to be fairly safe. However, we need better studies. We need more information about:
- How well different light types work
- Long-term safety
- Which people benefit most
- How long the benefits last

**Conclusion:**

Light therapy, especially NB-UVB, may be a helpful treatment for atopic eczema. It may work when creams are not enough. More research is needed to know which type of light works best. Doctors and patients should discuss whether light therapy is right for them.",10.1002-14651858.CD013870,"What are the benefits and risks of light therapy for treating atopic eczema (also known as eczema or atopic dermatitis)? 
Key messages 
Narrowband (NB) ultraviolet B (UVB), compared to placebo (a sham treatment), may improve eczema severity (including itch) and may not affect the number of people leaving a study because of unwanted effects. 
We were unable to confidently draw conclusions for other phototherapy (light therapy) treatments. 
Future research needs to assess longer term effectiveness and safety of NB‐UVB and other forms of phototherapy for eczema. 
What is eczema? 
Eczema is a condition that results in dry, itchy patches of inflamed skin. Eczema typically starts in childhood, but can improve with age. Eczema is caused by a combination of genetics and environmental factors, which lead to skin barrier dysfunction. Eczema can negatively impact quality of life, and the societal cost is significant. 
How is eczema treated? 
Eczema treatments are often creams or ointments that reduce itch and redness, applied directly to the skin. If these are unsuccessful, systemic medicines that affect the whole body, or phototherapy are options. Phototherapy can be UVB, ultraviolet A (UVA), or photochemotherapy (PUVA), where phototherapy is given alongside substances that increase sensitivity to UV light. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out whether phototherapy was better than no treatment or other types of treatment for treating eczema, and whether it caused unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated phototherapy compared with no treatment, placebo, other forms of phototherapy, or another type of eczema treatment. Studies could include people of all ages, who had eczema diagnosed by a healthcare professional. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence. 
What did we find? 
We found 32 studies, involving 1219 people with eczema (average age: 28 years), who were recruited from dermatology clinics. Most studies assessed people with skin type II to III (which is classed as white to medium skin colour), and moderate to severe eczema, with which they had lived for many years. Studies included similar numbers of males and females. 
The studies were conducted in Europe, Asia, and Egypt (setting was not reported by seven studies), and lasted, on average, for 13 weeks. Almost half of the studies reported their source of funding; two were linked to commercial sponsors. 
Our included studies mostly assessed NB‐UVB, followed by UVA1, then broadband ultraviolet B; fewer studies investigated other types of phototherapy. The studies compared these treatments to placebo, or no treatment, another type of phototherapy, different doses of the same sort of phototherapy, or other eczema treatments applied to the skin or taken by tablet. 
None of the studies investigated excimer lamp (a source of UV radiation) or heliotherapy (the use of natural sunlight), that were other light therapies in which we were interested. 
What are the main results of our review? 
When compared to placebo, NB‐UVB may:
‐ improve signs of eczema assessed by a healthcare professional (1 study, 41 people);
‐ increase the number of people reporting less severe itching (1 study, 41 people);
‐ increase the number of people reporting moderate or greater improvement of eczema, measured by the Investigator Global Assessment scale (IGA), a 5‐point scale that measures improvement in eczema symptoms (1 study, 40 people); and 
‐ have no effect on the rate of people withdrawing from treatment due to unwanted effects (3 studies, 89 people). 
None of the studies assessing NB‐UVB against placebo measured health‐related quality of life. 
We do not know if NB‐UVB (compared with UVA1 or PUVA) or UVA1 (compared with PUVA) has an effect on the following: 
‐ signs of eczema assessed by a healthcare professional;
‐ patient‐reported eczema symptoms;
‐ IGA;
‐ health‐related quality of life; and
‐ withdrawals due to unwanted effects.
This is because either we are not confident in the evidence, or they were not reported.
We did not identify any studies that investigated UVA1 or PUVA compared with no treatment.
Some studies reported that phototherapy caused some unwanted effects, including skin reactions or irritation, UV burn, worsening of eczema, and skin infections. However, these did not occur in most people. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited, mainly because only a few studies could be included in each comparison, and the studies generally involved only small numbers of people. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to January 2021.

Postoperative administration of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces patient opioid requirements and, in turn, may reduce the incidence and severity of opioid‐induced adverse events (AEs). 
Objectives
To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single‐dose intravenous (IV) ibuprofen, compared with placebo or an active comparator, for moderate‐to‐severe postoperative pain in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases without language restrictions: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS on 10 June 2021. We checked clinical trials registers and reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials that compared a single postoperative dose of intravenous (IV) ibuprofen with placebo or another active treatment, for treating acute postoperative pain in adults following any surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for review inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data.Our primary outcome was the number of participants in each arm achieving at least 50% pain relief over a 4‐ and 6‐hour period. 
Our secondary outcomes were time to, and number of participants using rescue medication; withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and for any other cause; and number of participants reporting or experiencing any AE, serious AEs (SAEs), and specific NSAID‐related or opioid‐related AEs. 
We were not able to carry out any planned meta‐analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Only one study met our inclusion criteria, involving 201 total participants, mostly female (mean age 42 years), undergoing primary, unilateral, distal, first metatarsal bunionectomy (with osteotomy and internal fixation). Ibuprofen 300 mg, placebo or acetaminophen 1000 mg was administered intravenously to participants reporting moderate pain intensity the day after surgery. Since we identified only one study for inclusion, we did not perform any quantitative analyses. The study was at low risk of bias for most domains. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to serious study limitations, indirectness and imprecision. 
Ibuprofen versus placebo 
Findings of the single study found that at both the 4‐hour and 6‐hour assessment period, the proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief was 32% (24/76) for those assigned to ibuprofen and 22% (11/50) for those assigned to placebo. These findings produced a risk ratio (RR) of 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 2.66 versus placebo for at least 50% of maximum pain relief over the 4‐hour and 6‐hour period (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Median time to rescue medication was 101 minutes for ibuprofen and 71 minutes for placebo (1 study, 126 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The number of participants using rescue medication was not reported within the included study. 
During the study (1 study, 126 participants), 58/76 (76%) of participants assigned to ibuprofen and 39/50 (78%) assigned to placebo reported or experienced any adverse event (AE), (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19; low‐certainty evidence). 
No serious AEs (SAEs) were experienced (1 study, 126 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Ibuprofen versus active comparators 
Ibuprofen (300 mg) was similar to the active comparator, IV acetaminophen (1000 mg) at 4 hours and 6 hours (1 study, 126 participants). For those assigned to active control (acetaminophen), the proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief was 35% (26/75) at 4 hours and 31% (23/75) at 6 hours. At 4 hours, these findings produced a RR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.43; very low‐certainty evidence) versus active comparator (acetaminophen). At 6 hours, these findings produced a RR of 1.03 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.66; very low‐certainty evidence) versus active comparator (acetaminophen). 
Median time to rescue medication was 101 minutes for ibuprofen and 125 minutes for the active comparator, acetaminophen (1 study, 151 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The number of participants using rescue medication was not reported within the included study. 
During the study, 58/76 (76%) of participants assigned to ibuprofen and 45/75 (60%) assigned to active control (acetaminophen) reported or experienced any AE, (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.59; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No SAEs were experienced (1 study, 151 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the suggestion that IV ibuprofen is effective and safe for acute postoperative pain in adults.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Intravenous Ibuprofen for Pain After Surgery

## Plain Title
Does ibuprofen given through an IV help adults with pain after surgery?

## Rationale

**What is pain after surgery?**
After surgery, most people feel pain. This pain can range from mild to very bad. Doctors often give strong pain drugs called opioids to help. But opioids can cause problems like feeling sick, being unable to pass stool, or feeling very sleepy.

**What are NSAIDs?**
NSAIDs are pain drugs that work differently than opioids. Ibuprofen is one type of NSAID. Many people take ibuprofen pills at home for headaches or body aches. Doctors can also give ibuprofen through an IV. An IV is a small tube that goes into a vein.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors wanted to know if IV ibuprofen works well for pain after surgery. If it does, patients might need less opioid drugs. This could mean fewer side effects. The researchers thought IV ibuprofen might help reduce pain safely.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
The researchers wanted to see if one dose of IV ibuprofen works better than a fake treatment (placebo). They also wanted to compare it to another pain drug. They looked at how well it reduced pain and what side effects happened.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review of research studies. The researchers looked for all studies that tested IV ibuprofen for pain after surgery. They only found one study that met their rules.

**Who was in the study?**
The study had 201 people. Most were women. The average age was 42 years old. All had foot surgery to fix a bunion. A bunion is a painful bump on the big toe joint.

**What did people in the study receive?**
The day after surgery, people who had moderate pain got one of three treatments through an IV:
- Ibuprofen 300 mg
- A placebo (fake treatment with no drug)
- Acetaminophen 1000 mg (another pain drug)

**How long were people in the study?**
The researchers watched people for 6 hours after they got the IV treatment.

## Results

**What did the study find about ibuprofen versus placebo?**

The study found that ibuprofen worked slightly better than placebo, but the difference was small:
- About 1 in 3 people (32 out of 100) got good pain relief with ibuprofen
- About 1 in 5 people (22 out of 100) got good pain relief with placebo

People who got ibuprofen waited longer before needing more pain drugs. They waited about 101 minutes. People who got placebo waited about 71 minutes.

About 3 out of 4 people had side effects in both groups. No one had serious side effects.

**What did the study find about ibuprofen versus acetaminophen?**

Ibuprofen and acetaminophen worked about the same:
- About 1 in 3 people got good pain relief with either drug

People who got acetaminophen waited a bit longer before needing more pain drugs (125 minutes versus 101 minutes).

More people who got ibuprofen had side effects (3 out of 4) compared to acetaminophen (3 out of 5). No one had serious side effects.

**What do these results mean?**

The researchers could not make strong conclusions. They only found one small study. The study only looked at one type of surgery. The results were not clear enough to know for sure if IV ibuprofen works well.

**Main conclusions:**
There is not enough proof to know if IV ibuprofen works well and is safe for pain after surgery in adults. More research is needed. Doctors need studies with more people and different types of surgery before they can be sure about using IV ibuprofen for pain after surgery.",10.1002-14651858.CD013264,"What are the benefits and risks of a single injection of ibuprofen (an anti‐inflammation medicine) for relieving short‐term pain after surgery in adults?  
Key messages 
‐ There is not enough evidence to determine whether intravenous (injection into a vein) ibuprofen is an effective treatment for adults with pain after surgery or if it can harm them.  
‐ It would be beneficial if future studies on this topic were well‐designed with a large number of patients to determine if ibuprofen is an effective treatment for the management of pain after surgery. 
‐ More evidence is required to establish if ibuprofen causes serious unwanted effects.
Treating short‐term pain after surgery 
Pain is common in the short term (within 6 hours) after surgery (postoperative pain). 
Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, aspirin‐like drugs) are often delivered along with opioids (such as morphine) to treat this type of pain. However, NSAIDs can have side effects. NSAIDS (such as ibuprofen) may result in bleeding (e.g. at the site of an incision or wound) and may result in injury to the kidneys and gut.  
Patients need more and better treatment options to help manage short‐term pain after surgery. There is a lot of concern about using opioids to treat short‐term pain because of the risk that patients can develop unpleasant side effects or opioid over‐use disorder. It is therefore important to weigh the benefits and risks of NSAIDs when considering using them to reduce pain shortly after surgery. 
What did we want to find out? 
Ibuprofen is a NSAID that can be delivered intravenously. We wanted to know if intravenous ibuprofen (delivered by injection or drip) is a helpful treatment option to manage moderate‐to‐severe pain when patients cannot take medicines by mouth.  
What did we do? 
To make the comparison fair, patients in the studies must all have had the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive the ibuprofen or the other treatment.  
We searched the medical literature (clinical studies) up to June 2021, where intravenous ibuprofen was used to treat pain after surgery in adults (aged over 18) and compared against: 
‐ a placebo (a control treatment, such as a bag of saline administered into a vein); or 
‐ another medicine.
What did we find? 
We found only one study which was suitable to include in our review. The study looked at the management of pain after bunionectomy. Bunionectomy is a surgery to remove a bunion at the base of the big toe. This study evaluated 201 people, mostly females. The study compared intravenous ibuprofen to: 
‐ a placebo; or
‐ another medicine, acetaminophen (paracetamol).
We were most interested in learning how many people had their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery.  
Pain reduction 
The study showed that:
‐ more people who received ibuprofen had their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery as compared to those who received placebo; and  
‐ there was little to no difference when ibuprofen was compared to another medicine, acetaminophen, i.e. the numbers of people with pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery  
Need for extra pain medicines (rescue medication) 
Rescue medicine is an extra pain medication if the study medication is not treating the patient's pain well enough. The time (in minutes) to needing rescue medication was longer (delayed) with use of ibuprofen or acetaminophen than for those who received placebo.  
Adverse events 
There was not enough information in this study to assess side effects, but the rate at which they occurred appeared to be similar among all treatments. Very few patients dropped out because of side effects. This is usually the case in studies where patients are only in a study for a short period of time.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We only had results from one relatively small study. This limited our confidence in the evidence. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to June 2021.

Review question 
We investigated the effects of stopping antipsychotic drugs in older people with dementia who had been taking them for three months or longer. 
Background 
People with dementia may have symptoms and behavioural problems that can be distressing and difficult for carers to manage. Such symptoms (often described as neuropsychiatric symptoms, or NPS) include anxiety, apathy, depression, psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), wandering, repeating words or sounds, shouting, and behaving in agitated or aggressive ways, or both. 
Antipsychotic drugs are often prescribed with the aim of controlling these symptoms and behaviours, although most current guidance suggests these drugs should only be used for short periods of time for the most challenging behaviours. This is largely because these drugs are thought to have risks of side effects (including some that are serious), and because many behavioural problems improve without treatment. However, many people with dementia continue to take antipsychotic drugs over long periods of time. 
This review investigated whether it is feasible for older people with dementia and NPS to stop antipsychotic drugs which they have been taking for at least three months. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013. 
Methods 
We searched up to 11 January 2018 for any study that randomly allocated some people with dementia who were taking antipsychotic drugs to continue this treatment and others to stop taking antipsychotic drugs. Study participants were followed up over a period of time to see what happened. 
Results 
We included 10 studies with a total of 632 participants in our review. We added one new study with 19 participants for this update. Most participants lived in nursing homes. The studies varied considerably with regard to the people they included, the methods they used and the outcomes they measured. 
Because the studies were so diverse, it was not possible to combine all the data numerically. We found low‐quality evidence that older people with dementia may be able to stop long‐term antipsychotics without their behavioural problems getting worse. However, in some people who had psychosis, agitation or aggression and who had improved significantly when they first started antipsychotic treatment, we found that stopping the drugs may increase the risk of the behavioural problems getting worse again. On the other hand, agitation decreased after stopping the drugs in some participants whose NPS at the beginning of the studies was relatively mild. 
We did not find enough evidence to know whether stopping antipsychotics has beneficial effects on quality of life, thinking and remembering, or the ability to carry out daily tasks, nor if the risk of harmful events ‐ such as falls ‐ is reduced. We are uncertain whether stopping antipsychotics leads to people living longer. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, evidence was low‐ or very low‐quality. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and that it is possible that other similar research could find something different. The main reasons for this assessment were that there were few studies that included few people, and a risk that results were not fully reported. All included studies had problems recruiting enough participants, making it more difficult for them to detect effects of stopping antipsychotics. 
Conclusions 
Limited evidence suggests that stopping long‐term antipsychotic drug use in older people with dementia and NPS may be done without making their behaviour worse. There may be benefits especially for those with milder NPS. There may be people with more severe symptoms who benefit from continuing treatment, but more research in people with both milder and more severe NPS is needed to be sure about this. The overall conclusions have not changed since the last version of this review and the number of included trials is still low. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Stopping Long-Term Antipsychotic Drugs in Older People with Dementia

## Plain Title
Can older people with dementia safely stop taking antipsychotic drugs they have used for a long time?

## Rationale

**What is dementia and why does it matter?**

People with dementia often have behavior problems. These can be hard to deal with. The problems include:
- Feeling anxious or sad
- Seeing or hearing things that are not there
- Walking around a lot
- Shouting or yelling
- Acting angry or upset

These problems can be hard for the person with dementia. They can also be hard for the people who care for them.

**Why doctors give antipsychotic drugs**

Doctors often give antipsychotic drugs to help control these behaviors. These drugs are meant to calm people down. They are meant to reduce difficult behaviors.

**The problem with long-term use**

Most experts say these drugs should only be used for short times. This is because the drugs can cause harm. Some side effects can be serious. Also, many behavior problems get better on their own over time.

But many people with dementia keep taking these drugs for months or years. Doctors are not sure if this is safe or needed.

**Why this study was needed**

Researchers wanted to know: Can people with dementia safely stop these drugs? Will their behavior get worse if they stop? This study looked at what happens when people stop taking antipsychotic drugs after using them for at least three months.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of research studies. The researchers looked at 10 different studies. These studies included 632 people total.

**Who was in the studies?**

- Older people with dementia
- People who had been taking antipsychotic drugs for at least three months
- Most people lived in nursing homes

**How did the studies work?**

Each study split people into two groups by chance:
- One group kept taking their antipsychotic drugs
- One group stopped taking the drugs

Researchers then watched what happened to both groups over time. They looked at behavior problems and other health issues.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The main finding was good news. Most older people with dementia can probably stop taking antipsychotic drugs. Their behavior does not get worse when they stop.

**Who might have problems stopping?**

Some people may need to keep taking the drugs. This includes people who:
- See or hear things that are not there
- Act very upset or angry
- Got much better when they first started the drugs

For these people, stopping the drugs might make their problems come back.

**Who might do better after stopping?**

Some people actually got better after stopping the drugs. This was true for people whose behavior problems were mild to start with. Their agitation went down after they stopped the drugs.

**What the researchers could not answer**

The studies did not give clear answers about:
- Whether stopping drugs helps people live longer
- Whether it improves quality of life
- Whether it helps with memory or thinking
- Whether it helps people do daily tasks better
- Whether it reduces falls or other harmful events

**Why the evidence is limited**

The quality of evidence was low. This means:
- There were only a few studies
- The studies were small
- The studies were very different from each other
- Some results may not have been fully reported

All the studies had trouble finding enough people to join. This made it harder to know if the results are true.

**What this means**

Most older people with dementia can likely stop long-term antipsychotic drugs safely. Their behavior will probably not get worse. People with mild behavior problems may even get better.

Some people with severe symptoms might need to keep taking the drugs. But more research is needed to know for sure.

Doctors should think carefully about each person. They should consider stopping these drugs when possible. This is especially true for people with mild behavior problems.

More and better research is still needed. Studies should include people with both mild and severe symptoms.",10.1002-14651858.CD007726,"Stopping or continuing long‐term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist undertook a search of the following databases: MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 31 December 2018); Embase Ovid (1980 to 31 December 2018); US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov, to 31 December 2018); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 31 December 2018). We studied reference lists as well as published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
We included diagnostic accuracy study designs that compared a dental imaging method with a reference standard (histology, excavation, enhanced visual examination), studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of single index tests, and studies that directly compared two or more index tests. Studies reporting at both the patient or tooth surface level were included. In vitro and in vivo studies were eligible for inclusion. Studies that explicitly recruited participants with more advanced lesions that were obviously into dentine or frankly cavitated were excluded. We also excluded studies that artificially created carious lesions and those that used an index test during the excavation of dental caries to ascertain the optimum depth of excavation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data independently and in duplicate using a standardised data extraction form and quality assessment based on QUADAS‐2 specific to the clinical context. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy were determined using the bivariate hierarchical method to produce summary points of sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence regions. Comparative accuracy of different radiograph methods was conducted based on indirect and direct comparisons between methods. Potential sources of heterogeneity were pre‐specified and explored visually and more formally through meta‐regression. 
Main results
We included 104 datasets from 77 studies reporting a total of 15,518 tooth sites or surfaces. The most frequently reported imaging methods were analogue radiographs (55 datasets from 51 studies) and digital radiographs (42 datasets from 40 studies) followed by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) (7 datasets from 7 studies). Only 17 studies were of an in vivo study design, carried out in a clinical setting. No studies were considered to be at low risk of bias across all four domains but 16 studies were judged to have low concern for applicability across all domains. The patient selection domain had the largest number of studies judged to be at high risk of bias (43 studies); the index test, reference standard, and flow and timing domains were judged to be at high risk of bias in 30, 12, and 7 studies respectively. 
Studies were synthesised using a hierarchical bivariate method for meta‐analysis. There was substantial variability in the results of the individual studies, with sensitivities that ranged from 0 to 0.96 and specificities from 0 to 1.00. For all imaging methods the estimated summary sensitivity and specificity point was 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.53) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.92), respectively. In a cohort of 1000 tooth surfaces with a prevalence of enamel caries of 63%, this would result in 337 tooth surfaces being classified as disease free when enamel caries was truly present (false negatives), and 43 tooth surfaces being classified as diseased in the absence of enamel caries (false positives). Meta‐regression indicated that measures of accuracy differed according to the imaging method (Chi2(4) = 32.44, P < 0.001), with the highest sensitivity observed for CBCT, and the highest specificity observed for analogue radiographs. None of the specified potential sources of heterogeneity were able to explain the variability in results. No studies included restored teeth in their sample or reported the inclusion of sealants. 
We rated the certainty of the evidence as low for sensitivity and specificity and downgraded two levels in total for risk of bias due to limitations in the design and conduct of the included studies, indirectness arising from the in vitro studies, and the observed inconsistency of the results. 
Authors' conclusions
The design and conduct of studies to determine the diagnostic accuracy of methods to detect and diagnose caries in situ are particularly challenging. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that imaging for the detection or diagnosis of early caries may have poor sensitivity but acceptable specificity, resulting in a relatively high number of false‐negative results with the potential for early disease to progress. If left untreated, the opportunity to provide professional or self‐care practices to arrest or reverse early caries lesions will be missed. The specificity of lesion detection is however relatively high, and one could argue that initiation of non‐invasive management (such as the use of topical fluoride), is probably of low risk. 
CBCT showed superior sensitivity to analogue or digital radiographs but has very limited applicability to the general dental practitioner. However, given the high‐radiation dose, and potential for caries‐like artefacts from existing restorations, its use cannot be justified in routine caries detection. Nonetheless, if early incidental carious lesions are detected in CBCT scans taken for other purposes, these should be reported. CBCT has the potential to be used as a reference standard in diagnostic studies of this type. 
Despite the robust methodology applied in this comprehensive review, the results should be interpreted with some caution due to shortcomings in the design and execution of many of the included studies. Future research should evaluate the comparative accuracy of different methods, be undertaken in a clinical setting, and focus on minimising bias arising from the use of imperfect reference standards in clinical studies. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing X-rays and Other Imaging to Find Early Tooth Decay

## Plain Title
How Well Do X-rays and Other Imaging Methods Find Early Tooth Decay?

## Rationale

### What is early tooth decay?
Tooth decay starts when the hard outer layer of teeth (called enamel) begins to break down. At first, this damage is very small and cannot be seen easily. Finding decay at this early stage is very important. It helps save tooth structure and keep teeth healthy.

### Why was this study needed?
Dentists usually look at teeth with their eyes and tools. They also use X-rays to help find decay. If dentists can find decay very early, they can treat it in gentler ways. This means less drilling and less damage to teeth. It may also cost less money for patients and health care systems.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know how well different imaging methods work. Imaging methods are ways to take pictures of teeth. These include X-rays and other types of scans. The goal was to see which methods best find early decay that is only in the enamel.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not a single study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at many studies that other scientists had already done. They searched medical databases up to December 2018. They found 77 studies that tested imaging methods.

### What did the studies include?
The studies tested 15,518 tooth surfaces in total. Most studies used X-rays taken on film (called analogue X-rays). Others used digital X-rays taken with computers. Some studies used a special type of scan called CBCT. This stands for cone beam computed tomography.

Most studies (60 out of 77) were done in labs, not in dental offices. Only 17 studies tested real patients in clinics.

### How did researchers check if imaging worked?
They compared imaging results to the truth. The truth was found by cutting into teeth, looking very closely, or removing decay. This showed if decay was really there or not.

## Results

### What did the study find?
The imaging methods found about half of early decay cases. Out of 100 teeth with early decay, imaging found decay in only 47 teeth. This means 53 teeth with decay were missed.

The good news is that imaging rarely said decay was there when it was not. Out of 100 healthy teeth, imaging correctly identified 88 as healthy. Only 12 were wrongly labeled as having decay.

### What does this mean for patients?
In a group of 1,000 tooth surfaces where 630 have early decay:
- 337 surfaces with decay would be missed (false negatives)
- 43 surfaces would be wrongly labeled as having decay (false positives)

Missing early decay means it might get worse. Patients would miss the chance to stop or reverse decay with simple treatments like fluoride.

### Which imaging method worked best?
CBCT scans found more decay than regular X-rays. But CBCT uses much more radiation. It also costs more and is not available in most dental offices. Doctors should not use CBCT just to find decay. But if a CBCT scan is taken for another reason, dentists should report any decay they see.

Regular X-rays (both film and digital) were better at correctly identifying healthy teeth.

### How reliable are these results?
The researchers rated the quality of evidence as low. Many studies had problems with how they were done. Most were done in labs, not real dental offices. Results varied a lot between studies.

### What do the researchers conclude?
Imaging methods like X-rays can help find early tooth decay. But they miss many cases of early decay. This could let decay get worse over time. However, when imaging shows decay, it is usually correct. Starting simple treatments like fluoride is safe and helpful.

More research is needed. Future studies should test imaging in real dental offices with real patients. They should also compare different methods directly to see which works best.",10.1002-14651858.CD014545,"Dental imaging methods for the detection of early tooth decay
Why is it important to improve the detection of dental caries (tooth decay)? Dentists often aim to identify tooth decay that has already advanced to a level which needs a filling. If dentists were able to find tooth decay when it has only affected the outer layer of the tooth (enamel) then it is possible to stop the decay from spreading any further and prevent the need for fillings. It is also important to avoid a false‐positive result, when treatment may be given when caries is absent. 
What is the aim of this review?This Cochrane Review aimed to find out how accurate X‐ray images and other types of dental imaging are for detecting early tooth decay as part of the dental 'check‐up' for children and adults who visit their general dentist. Researchers in Cochrane included 77 studies published between 1986 and 2018 to answer this question. 
What was studied in the review?Three main types of dental imaging were studied in this review: analogue or digital radiographs (X‐rays) and three‐dimensional (3D) imaging (cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)). We studied decay on the occlusal surfaces (biting surfaces of the back teeth), the proximal surfaces (tooth surfaces that are next to each other), and smooth surfaces. 
What are the main results of the review?Researchers in Cochrane included 77 studies with a total of 15,518 tooth sites or surfaces, where typically 63% of tooth sites or surfaces had enamel caries. Some of these studies reported on more than one type of imaging, on both the permanent and primary ('milk') teeth or different tooth surfaces, and this gave us 104 sets of data to use. If these methods were to be used by a dentist for a routine dental examination, out of 1000 tooth sites or surfaces seen:• the use of these methods will indicate that 336 tooth sites or surfaces will have early tooth decay, and of these, 43 (13%) will have no disease (incorrect diagnosis ‐ false positive);• of the 664 tooth sites with a result indicating that early tooth decay is absent, 337 (51%) will have early tooth decay (incorrect diagnosis ‐ false negative).This high proportion of false‐negative results means that early signs of decay will be missed. We found evidence that 3D imaging methods were better than analogue or digital radiographs at identifying early disease but that analogue radiographs were better at identifying disease‐free tooth surfaces. 
Please see oralhealth.cochrane.org/imaging-modalities-inform-detection-and-diagnosis-early-caries. 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review?We only included studies that assessed healthy teeth or those that were thought to have early tooth decay. This is because teeth with deep tooth decay would be easier to identify. However, there were some problems with how the studies were conducted. This may result in these methods appearing more accurate than they are, increasing the number of correct results. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low due to how the studies selected their participants and the large number of studies that were carried out in a laboratory setting on extracted teeth, and the variation in the results. 
Who do the results of this review apply to?Studies included in the review were carried out in South America, Europe, Asia, and the US. A large number of studies examined extracted teeth, while clinical studies were completed in dental hospitals or general dental practices. 
What are the implications of this review?Low‐certainty evidence suggests that imaging for the detection or diagnosis of early tooth decay may result in a relatively high proportion of false‐negative results, with the potential for early disease to become more advanced. If left untreated, the opportunity to provide professional or self‐care practices to arrest or reverse early tooth decay will be missed.

Asthma is a respiratory disease characterised by variable airflow limitation and the presence of respiratory symptoms including wheeze, chest tightness, cough and/or dyspnoea. Exercise training is beneficial for people with asthma; however, the response to conventional models of pulmonary rehabilitation is less clear. 
Objectives
To evaluate, in adults with asthma, the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care on exercise performance, asthma control, and quality of life (co‐primary outcomes), incidence of severe asthma exacerbations/hospitalisations, mental health, muscle strength, physical activity levels, inflammatory biomarkers, and adverse events. 
Search methods
We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, from their inception to May 2021, as well as the reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials in which pulmonary rehabilitation was compared to usual care in adults with asthma. Pulmonary rehabilitation must have included a minimum of four weeks (or eight sessions) aerobic training and education or self‐management. Co‐interventions were permitted; however, exercise training alone was not.  
Data collection and analysis
Following the use of Cochrane's Screen4Me workflow, two review authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, extracted study characteristics and outcome data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We contacted study authors to retrieve missing data. We calculated between‐group effects via mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) using a random‐effects model. We evaluated the certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology. 
Main results
We included 10 studies involving 894 participants (range 24 to 412 participants (n = 2 studies involving n > 100, one contributing to meta‐analysis), mean age range 27 to 54 years). We identified one ongoing study and three studies awaiting classification. One study was synthesised narratively, and another involved participants specifically with asthma‐COPD overlap. Most programmes were outpatient‐based, lasting from three to four weeks (inpatient) or eight to 12 weeks (outpatient). Education or self‐management components included breathing retraining and relaxation, nutritional advice and psychological counselling. One programme was specifically tailored for people with severe asthma.  
Pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care may increase maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) after programme completion, but the evidence is very uncertain for data derived using mL/kg/min (MD between groups of 3.63 mL/kg/min, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48 to 5.77; 3 studies; n = 129) and uncertain for data derived from % predicted VO2 max (MD 14.88%, 95% CI 9.66 to 20.1%; 2 studies; n = 60). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care on incremental shuttle walk test distance (MD between groups 74.0 metres, 95% CI 26.4 to 121.4; 1 study; n = 30). Pulmonary rehabilitation may have little to no effect on VO2 max at longer‐term follow up (9 to 12 months), but the evidence is very uncertain (MD −0.69 mL/kg/min, 95% CI −4.79 to 3.42; I2 = 49%; 3 studies; n = 66). 
Pulmonary rehabilitation likely improves functional exercise capacity as measured by 6‐minute walk distance, with MD between groups after programme completion of 79.8 metres (95% CI 66.5 to 93.1; 5 studies; n = 529; moderate certainty evidence). This magnitude of mean change exceeds the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) threshold for people with chronic respiratory disease. The evidence is very uncertain about the longer‐term effects one year after pulmonary rehabilitation for this outcome (MD 52.29 metres, 95% CI 0.7 to 103.88; 2 studies; n = 42). 
Pulmonary rehabilitation may result in a small improvement in asthma control compared to usual care as measured by Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), with an MD between groups of −0.46 (95% CI −0.76 to −0.17; 2 studies; n = 93; low certainty evidence); however, data derived from the Asthma Control Test were very uncertain (MD between groups 3.34, 95% CI −2.32 to 9.01; 2 studies; n = 442). The ACQ finding approximates the MCID of 0.5 points. Pulmonary rehabilitation results in little to no difference in asthma control as measured by ACQ at nine to 12 months follow‐up (MD 0.09, 95% CI −0.35 to 0.53; 2 studies; n = 48; low certainty evidence). 
Pulmonary rehabilitation likely results in a large improvement in quality of life as assessed by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (MD −18.51, 95% CI −20.77 to −16.25; 2 studies; n = 440; moderate certainty evidence), with this magnitude of change exceeding the MCID. However, pulmonary rehabilitation may have little to no effect on Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) total scores, with the evidence being very uncertain (MD 0.87, 95% CI −0.13 to 1.86; 2 studies; n = 442). Longer‐term follow‐up data suggested improvements in quality of life may occur as measured by SGRQ (MD −13.4, 95% CI −15.93 to −10.88; 2 studies; n = 430) but not AQLQ (MD 0.58, 95% CI −0.23 to 1.38; 2 studies; n = 435); however, the evidence is very uncertain. 
One study reported no difference between groups in the proportion of participants who experienced an asthma exacerbation during the intervention period. Data from one study suggest adverse events attributable to the intervention are rare.  
Overall risk of bias was most commonly impacted by performance bias attributed to a lack of participant blinding to knowledge of the intervention. This is inherently challenging to overcome in rehabilitation studies.  
Authors' conclusions
Moderate certainty evidence shows that pulmonary rehabilitation is probably associated with clinically meaningful improvements in functional exercise capacity and quality of life upon programme completion in adults with asthma. The certainty of evidence relating to maximal exercise capacity was very low to low. Pulmonary rehabilitation appears to confer minimal effect on asthma control, although the certainty of evidence is very low to low. Unclear reporting of study methods and small sample sizes limits our certainty in the overall body of evidence, whilst heterogenous study designs and interventions likely contribute to inconsistent findings across clinical outcomes and studies. There remains considerable scope for future research. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Pulmonary Rehabilitation for Adults with Asthma

## Plain Title

Does a structured exercise and education program help adults with asthma?

## Rationale

**What is asthma?**

Asthma is a lung disease. It makes breathing hard at times. People with asthma may wheeze, cough, or feel chest tightness. They may feel short of breath. These symptoms come and go.

**Why is this important?**

Asthma can make daily life hard. It can stop people from being active. It can affect their quality of life.

**What is pulmonary rehabilitation?**

Pulmonary rehabilitation is a special program. It includes exercise training and education. The exercise helps make the lungs and body stronger. The education teaches people how to manage their asthma better.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Doctors know that exercise helps people with asthma. But they were not sure if pulmonary rehabilitation programs work well. These programs are often used for other lung diseases. Researchers wanted to find out if these programs help adults with asthma. They wanted to see if the programs improve fitness, asthma control, and quality of life.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 10 different studies. These studies included 894 adults with asthma. The adults ranged in age from 27 to 54 years old. Some studies had men and women.

**What did the programs include?**

The programs lasted at least 4 weeks. Some lasted 8 to 12 weeks. Most programs were done at a clinic or hospital. One program was done while staying in the hospital for 3 to 4 weeks.

All programs included:
- Exercise training at least twice a week
- Education or self-management lessons

The education covered:
- Breathing exercises and relaxation
- Healthy eating advice
- Mental health support

**What did researchers compare?**

They compared people who did pulmonary rehabilitation to people who got usual care. Usual care means regular doctor visits and normal asthma treatment.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The researchers found several important results.

**Walking ability improved:**

People who did pulmonary rehabilitation could walk much farther. They walked about 80 meters more in 6 minutes. This is a big improvement. It means they had better fitness for daily activities. This result is reliable.

**Quality of life got better:**

People felt their quality of life improved. They scored much better on health surveys. The improvement was large enough to matter in daily life. This result is reliable.

**Asthma control may improve slightly:**

Some people had slightly better asthma control. But the improvement was small. Different tests showed different results. More research is needed to be sure.

**Maximum fitness may improve:**

Some tests showed people could exercise harder. But the results were mixed. Researchers are not certain about this finding.

**Long-term effects are unclear:**

Most improvements were seen right after the program ended. Researchers are not sure if benefits last for a year or more. More studies are needed.

**Safety:**

The programs appeared safe. Very few people had problems from the exercise. One study found no difference in asthma attacks between groups.

**What does this mean?**

Pulmonary rehabilitation programs probably help adults with asthma. They improve fitness and quality of life. These improvements can make daily activities easier.

The programs may help with asthma control a little bit. But more research is needed to be certain.

**What are the limitations?**

Many studies were small. They used different types of programs. This made it hard to compare results. Some studies did not report all their methods clearly. People knew which treatment they got. This could affect the results.

**What comes next?**

More research is needed. Future studies should be larger. They should follow people for longer periods. This will help doctors know if pulmonary rehabilitation should be a standard treatment for asthma.",10.1002-14651858.CD013485,"What are the benefits of supervised programmes of exercise and education (known as pulmonary rehabilitation) compared with usual care for adults with asthma? 
Key messages  
‐ We found that people with asthma who take part in supervised programmes of exercise and education (known as pulmonary rehabilitation) are likely to get fitter (can walk further) and have better wellbeing immediately after completing these programmes compared to those who receive usual care. However, we are not certain if these benefits persist up to one year later. 
‐ Due to a lack of evidence, the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on outcomes such as rates of asthma attacks or hospitalisations, anxiety and depression, or physical activity levels is unclear.  
‐ Larger, well‐designed studies are needed to better estimate the true benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation for adults with asthma. 
What is asthma? 
Asthma is a common lung disease where the breathing tubes can become inflamed and narrowed and may produce extra mucus. People with asthma can experience cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and breathlessness, with those most severely affected experiencing difficulty going about their everyday lives.  
Asthma cannot be cured, but symptoms can be controlled. Different medications can help keep symptoms under control, whilst physical exercise can also help. However, some people with asthma may find it challenging to undertake comprehensive exercise programmes. 
What is pulmonary rehabilitation? 
Supervised programmes of exercise and education (called pulmonary rehabilitation) are commonly used for people with chronic lung conditions and help improve breathing, fitness, and wellbeing. These programmes may be based at hospitals, outpatient clinics, or even at home.  
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a recommended standard of care for many chronic lung conditions; however, its effects in adults with asthma are less clear. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to see how pulmonary rehabilitation affects physical fitness, control of asthma symptoms, and wellbeing of adults with asthma compared to usual clinical care involving no pulmonary rehabilitation. We also wanted to learn how it affects the rate of severe asthma attacks/hospitalisations, mental health (anxiety and depression), muscle strength, physical activity levels, and markers of inflammation (in sputum or blood). Finally, we wanted to see whether it is associated with any unwanted effects.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared pulmonary rehabilitation to usual care in adults with asthma. Treatment must have lasted at least four weeks (or eight or more sessions) and must have included aerobic exercises (such as walking or cycling) and education or self‐management.  
We compared and summarised findings across all eligible studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and size. 
What did we find? 
‐ We found 10 studies involving 894 adults with asthma. 
‐ The studies ranged in size from 24 to 412 people. 
‐ Most studies were conducted in Europe. 
‐ Where reported, most study participants were female, with the average age ranging from 27 to 54 years.  
‐ One study specifically included people with severe forms of asthma. Another study specifically included people who had a condition involving overlapping features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
‐ The way pulmonary rehabilitation was delivered varied across studies. Inpatient programmes lasted 3 to 4 weeks, whilst outpatient programmes lasted 8 to 12 weeks. 
‐ The specific nature of exercise or education components amongst the included studies varied widely. 
Main results 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation probably causes a large increase in physical fitness immediately after completion of the programme, resulting in an ability to walk an average of 80 metres further in 6 minutes than in people who receive usual care. There may be little to no effect on physical fitness measured up to one year later. 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation may result in small improvements in or little to no impact on asthma control immediately after completion of the programme or up to one year later compared to usual care.  
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation probably causes a large improvement in wellbeing as measured by the St George’s Respiratory Disease Questionnaire immediately after completion of the programme. Results may differ slightly according to different quality of life instruments. The effects potentially last up to one year, but results are very uncertain. 
‐ Little to no effect on wellbeing was observed after programme completion or up to nine months follow‐up when the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire was used.  
‐ There was very limited evidence to determine the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on rates of asthma attacks/hospitalisations, measures of anxiety and depression, limb muscle strength, levels of physical activity, or markers of inflammation in the blood or sputum.  
‐ Data from one study suggested pulmonary rehabilitation resulted in no direct unwanted or harmful effects. 
Limitations of the evidence  
Our confidence in the evidence relating to outcomes such as physical fitness, wellbeing, and asthma control is limited due to concerns regarding unclear methods in some studies, the potential for participants or assessors (or both) to have influenced outcomes due to the awareness of assigned treatments, and the varied ways in which pulmonary rehabilitation was delivered. 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to May 2021.

68,10.1002-14651858.CD004019.pub4-abstract.txt,"Osteotomy for treating knee osteoarthritis
Researchers from The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effects of an osteotomy in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Upon searching for all relevant studies until November 2013, they found 21 studies that included up to 1065 people. Their findings are summarised below. 
This review shows that in people with osteoarthritis of the knee:
• osteotomy can improve pain and function, but this is based on changes within a treatment group. No studies compared osteotomy versus conservative treatment; and • no evidence can be found for a preferred osteotomy technique. 
What is osteoarthritis of the knee, and what is an osteotomy?  Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as the knee or the hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen, and this can make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect physical function or ability to use the knee. Two main types of surgery are used to treat patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: knee replacement and osteotomy. 
Osteotomy is surgery in which the bones are cut and realigned. Osteotomy around the knee changes the alignment of the knee. Weight bearing will be shifted from the diseased part to a healthy part of the knee. By 'unloading' the damaged cartilage of the knee, osteotomy may decrease pain, improve function, slow knee deterioration and possibly delay the need for (partial or) total knee replacement surgery. 
What happens to people after an osteotomy for knee osteoarthritis?  Follow‐up of all studies was too short to allow scoring of treatment failure; this refers to a revision to a knee replacement. 
In all studies, people reported less pain and improved knee function and quality of life after any type of high tibial osteotomy. However this comparison is based on differences before and after an osteotomy, not on comparison with non‐operative treatment. Probably no differences in pain and function scores are noted between different osteotomy techniques. 
Rare complications may include thromboembolism and lesions to nerves and vascular structures. 
The most important reasons for reoperation include hardware removal resulting from pain and pin track infection due to the external fixator. This reoperation rate may be higher in patients undergoing another high tibial osteotomy technique compared with those treated with the closing wedge technique. 
Two studies compared high tibial osteotomy versus partial knee replacement. Benefits did not differ between these types of surgery. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Surgery to Realign the Knee Bone in People with Knee Arthritis

## Plain Title
Can surgery to realign the knee bone help people with knee arthritis?

## Rationale

**What is knee arthritis?**

Knee arthritis is a disease that affects the knee joint. The joint loses its cushioning layer, called cartilage. When this happens, the bone tries to fix itself. But instead of helping, the bone grows in the wrong way. This makes the knee painful and unstable. People with knee arthritis often have trouble walking and doing daily tasks.

**What is osteotomy surgery?**

Osteotomy is a type of surgery. Doctors cut the bone and move it to a better position. This changes how the knee lines up. The goal is to shift weight from the damaged part of the knee to a healthier part. This ""unloading"" may reduce pain and help the knee work better. It might also slow down more damage. Osteotomy may delay the need for a full knee replacement.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if osteotomy really helps people with knee arthritis. They also wanted to find out which type of osteotomy works best. This information can help doctors and patients make better choices about treatment.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies about osteotomy for knee arthritis. They searched until November 2013. They found 21 studies. These studies included up to 1065 people total.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included people with knee arthritis. The studies did not give details about age or gender in this summary.

**What did the studies compare?**

Most studies looked at how people felt before and after osteotomy. Some studies compared different types of osteotomy surgery. Two studies compared osteotomy to partial knee replacement. This is when doctors replace only part of the knee joint.

**How long were people followed?**

The studies did not follow people long enough to see if they later needed a full knee replacement.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

After osteotomy surgery, people reported less pain. They also said their knee worked better. Their quality of life improved. This was true for all types of osteotomy.

However, there is an important limitation. No studies compared osteotomy to non-surgical treatment. The results only show changes before and after surgery. We cannot say if osteotomy works better than other treatments like physical therapy or medicine.

**Did one type of osteotomy work better than others?**

The researchers found no clear evidence that one type of osteotomy works better than another. Different techniques seemed to give similar results for pain and function.

**What about osteotomy versus partial knee replacement?**

Two studies compared these two surgeries. Both types of surgery helped about the same amount.

**What problems can happen after osteotomy?**

Serious problems are rare. These can include blood clots and damage to nerves or blood vessels.

Some people need a second surgery. The most common reasons are to remove metal hardware that causes pain or to treat infection. People who have certain types of osteotomy may need this second surgery more often than those who have the closing wedge technique.

**What do these results mean?**

Osteotomy may help reduce pain and improve knee function in people with knee arthritis. However, we need more studies. Future studies should compare osteotomy to non-surgical treatments. This would help us know if surgery is truly better than other options.

The researchers could not say which type of osteotomy works best. More research is needed to answer this question.",10.1002-14651858.CD004019,"Osteotomy for treating knee osteoarthritis
Researchers from The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effects of an osteotomy in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Upon searching for all relevant studies until November 2013, they found 21 studies that included up to 1065 people. Their findings are summarised below. 
This review shows that in people with osteoarthritis of the knee:
• osteotomy can improve pain and function, but this is based on changes within a treatment group. No studies compared osteotomy versus conservative treatment; and • no evidence can be found for a preferred osteotomy technique. 
What is osteoarthritis of the knee, and what is an osteotomy?  Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as the knee or the hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen, and this can make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect physical function or ability to use the knee. Two main types of surgery are used to treat patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: knee replacement and osteotomy. 
Osteotomy is surgery in which the bones are cut and realigned. Osteotomy around the knee changes the alignment of the knee. Weight bearing will be shifted from the diseased part to a healthy part of the knee. By 'unloading' the damaged cartilage of the knee, osteotomy may decrease pain, improve function, slow knee deterioration and possibly delay the need for (partial or) total knee replacement surgery. 
What happens to people after an osteotomy for knee osteoarthritis?  Follow‐up of all studies was too short to allow scoring of treatment failure; this refers to a revision to a knee replacement. 
In all studies, people reported less pain and improved knee function and quality of life after any type of high tibial osteotomy. However this comparison is based on differences before and after an osteotomy, not on comparison with non‐operative treatment. Probably no differences in pain and function scores are noted between different osteotomy techniques. 
Rare complications may include thromboembolism and lesions to nerves and vascular structures. 
The most important reasons for reoperation include hardware removal resulting from pain and pin track infection due to the external fixator. This reoperation rate may be higher in patients undergoing another high tibial osteotomy technique compared with those treated with the closing wedge technique. 
Two studies compared high tibial osteotomy versus partial knee replacement. Benefits did not differ between these types of surgery.

The standard method of diagnosing HIV in infants and children less than 18 months is with a nucleic acid amplification test reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test (NAT RT‐PCR) detecting viral ribonucleic acid (RNA). Laboratory testing using the RT‐PCR platform for HIV infection is limited by poor access, logistical support, and delays in relaying test results and initiating therapy in low‐resource settings. The use of rapid diagnostic tests at or near the point‐of‐care (POC) can increase access to early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants and children less than 18 months of age and timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). 
Objectives
To summarize the diagnostic accuracy of point‐of‐care nucleic acid‐based testing (POC NAT) to detect HIV‐1/HIV‐2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less exposed to HIV infection. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (until 2 February 2021), MEDLINE and Embase (until 1 February 2021), and LILACS and Web of Science (until 2 February 2021) with no language or publication status restriction. We also searched conference websites and clinical trial registries, tracked reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and consulted experts for potentially eligible studies. 
Selection criteria
We defined POC tests as rapid diagnostic tests conducted at or near the patient site. We included any primary study that compared the results of a POC NAT to a reference standard of laboratory NAT RT‐PCR or total nucleic acid testing to detect the presence or absence of HIV infection denoted by HIV viral nucleic acids in infants and children aged 18 months or less who were exposed to HIV‐1/HIV‐2 infection. We included cross‐sectional, prospective, and retrospective study designs and those that provided sufficient data to create the 2 × 2 table to calculate sensitivity and specificity. We excluded diagnostic case control studies with healthy controls. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted information on study characteristics using a pretested standardized data extraction form. We used the QUADAS‐2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool to assess the risk of bias and applicability concerns of the included studies. Two review authors independently selected and assessed the included studies, resolving any disagreements by consensus. The unit of analysis was the participant. We first conducted preliminary exploratory analyses by plotting estimates of sensitivity and specificity from each study on forest plots and in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space. For the overall meta‐analyses, we pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity using the bivariate meta‐analysis model at a common threshold (presence or absence of infection). 
Main results
We identified a total of 12 studies (15 evaluations, 15,120 participants). All studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa. The ages of included infants and children in the evaluations were as follows: at birth (n = 6), ≤ 12 months (n = 3), ≤ 18 months (n = 5), and ≤ 24 months (n = 1). Ten evaluations were field evaluations of the POC NAT test at the point of care, and five were laboratory evaluations of the POC NAT tests.The POC NAT tests evaluated included Alere q HIV‐1/2 Detect qualitative test (recently renamed m‐PIMA q HIV‐1/2 Detect qualitative test) (n = 6), Xpert HIV‐1 qualitative test (n = 6), and SAMBA HIV‐1 qualitative test (n = 3). 
POC NAT pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval (CI)) against laboratory reference standard tests were 98.6% (96.1 to 99.5) (15 evaluations, 1728 participants) and 99.9% (99.7 to 99.9) (15 evaluations, 13,392 participants) in infants and children ≤ 18 months. 
Risk of bias in the included studies was mostly low or unclear due to poor reporting. Five evaluations had some concerns for applicability for the index test, as they were POC tests evaluated in a laboratory setting, but there was no difference detected between settings in sensitivity (−1.3% (95% CI −4.1 to 1.5)); and specificity results were similar. 
Authors' conclusions
For the diagnosis of HIV‐1/HIV‐2 infection, we found the sensitivity and specificity of POC NAT tests to be high in infants and children aged 18 months or less who were exposed to HIV infection.

Testing for HIV in Babies and Young Children Using Quick Tests Done at the Clinic

## Rationale

**What is HIV and why is testing babies important?**

HIV is a virus that attacks the body's defense system. Babies can get HIV from their mothers during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Finding HIV early in babies is very important. When doctors know a baby has HIV, they can start treatment right away. This helps babies live longer, healthier lives.

**What is the problem?**

The usual way to test babies for HIV uses a special lab test. This test looks for the virus in the baby's blood. But this test has problems in many parts of the world. The test must be sent to a lab far away. This takes a long time. Families may wait weeks to get results. Some families never get their results. This delay means babies cannot start treatment quickly.

**What could help?**

Quick tests that work right at the clinic could help. These tests are called point-of-care tests. Doctors can do these tests while families wait. Families can get results the same day. This means babies who have HIV can start treatment faster.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to know if these quick tests work well. They wanted to see if the quick tests find HIV as well as the lab tests do. If the quick tests work well, more babies could get tested and treated quickly.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked at 12 studies from Africa. These studies tested 15,120 babies and young children. All the children were 18 months old or younger. All had been exposed to HIV.

The studies tested three different quick tests:
- Alere q test (now called m-PIMA q test)
- Xpert test  
- SAMBA test

In 10 studies, nurses did the tests at clinics. In 5 studies, lab workers did the tests in labs. All studies compared the quick tests to the standard lab test. This showed if the quick tests gave the right answers.

The studies were done between different years. They included babies of different ages. Some tested newborns. Others tested babies up to 12 months old or 18 months old.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The quick tests worked very well. Out of 100 babies who had HIV, the quick tests found 99 of them. This means the tests almost never missed a baby with HIV.

The tests also worked well for babies without HIV. Out of 10,000 babies without HIV, the tests correctly said 9,990 did not have HIV. Only 10 babies got wrong results saying they had HIV when they did not.

The tests worked just as well at clinics as they did in labs. The tests worked well for all babies 18 months old or younger.

**Why does this matter?**

These results are very good news. The quick tests are accurate. Doctors can trust these tests to find HIV in babies. Using these tests at clinics means:
- Families get results the same day
- Babies with HIV can start treatment right away
- More babies can be tested
- Fewer babies are lost before getting results

**What do the researchers conclude?**

The quick HIV tests work very well for babies and young children. These tests can help find HIV in babies faster. When babies start treatment sooner, they stay healthier. These tests should be used more in clinics around the world.",10.1002-14651858.CD013207,"Point‐of‐care tests for detecting HIV viral molecules in infants and children aged 18 months or less 
Why is improving the diagnosis of HIV infection important? 
It is estimated that 1.5 million infants are still exposed to HIV every year. If left untreated, about 50% to 60% of HIV‐infected infants will die by the age of two years. Children infected before birth are especially at high risk of death. HIV is incurable; however, there are medications that suppress HIV, known as antiretroviral drugs (ART). When HIV is detected early, severe illness and death from HIV‐related infections can be prevented by taking this medication. A test that detects HIV viral genetic molecules quickly and accurately at or near the patient's side (point‐of‐care) therefore can increase access to early appropriate treatment and minimize missing treatments in those whose HIV remains undetected. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of molecular point‐of‐care tests for detecting the main types of HIV infection (HIV‐1/HIV‐2) in infants and children aged 18 months or less. 
What was studied in this review? 
Published reports of molecular point‐of‐care tests with results measured against laboratory viral‐based tests (benchmark). 
What are the main results of this review? 
Twelve studies which completed 15 evaluations involving 15,120 participants compared molecular point‐of‐care tests for diagnosing HIV infection. 
What are the strengths and limitations of this review? 
The review included sufficient studies and participants. All studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa, making the results highly applicable for use in communities where the disease is regularly found and where disease control programmes are often targeted. However, one in three included evaluations of the molecular point‐of‐care tests were conducted in a laboratory setting and not near the patient but there was no difference in the test accuracy between settings. 
To whom do the results of this review apply? 
Infants and children aged 18 months or less who were exposed to HIV infection.
What are the implications of this review? 
In theory, for a population of 1000 children aged 18 months or less where 100 have HIV infection, 100 children will be positive with the molecular point‐of‐care test, of which one will not have the infection (false‐positive result), and 900 will be negative with the molecular point‐of‐care test, of which one will indeed have the infection (false‐negative result). 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 2 February 2021.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung condition characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and limited lung airflow, dyspnoea and recurrent exacerbations. Suboptimal therapy or non‐adherence may result in limited effectiveness of pharmacological treatments and subsequently poor health outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of interventions intended to improve adherence to single or combined pharmacological treatments compared with usual care or interventions that are not intended to improve adherence in people with COPD. 
Search methods
We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase (search date 1 May 2020). We also searched web‐based clinical trial registers. 
Selection criteria
RCTs included adults with COPD diagnosed by established criteria (e.g. Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease). Interventions included change to pharmacological treatment regimens, adherence aids, education, behavioural or psychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy), communication or follow‐up by a health professional (e.g. telephone, text message or face‐to‐face), multi‐component interventions, and interventions to improve inhaler technique. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Working in pairs, four review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We assessed confidence in the evidence for each primary outcome using GRADE. Primary outcomes were adherence, quality of life and hospital service utilisation. Adherence measures included the Adherence among Patients with Chronic Disease questionnaire (APCD). Quality of life measures included the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ). 
Main results
We included 14 trials (2191 participants) in the analysis with follow‐up ranging from six to 52 weeks. Age ranged from 54 to 75 years, and COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. Trials were conducted in the USA, Spain, Germany, Japan, Jordan, Northern Ireland, Iran, South Korea, China and Belgium. Risk of bias was high due to lack of blinding. Evidence certainty was downgraded due to imprecision and small participant numbers. 
Single component interventions 
Six studies (55 to 212 participants) reported single component interventions including changes to pharmacological treatment (different roflumilast doses or different inhaler types), adherence aids (Bluetooth inhaler reminder device), educational (comprehensive verbal instruction), behavioural or psychological (motivational interview). 
Change in dose of roflumilast may result in little to no difference in adherence (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.99; studies = 1, participants = 55; low certainty). A Bluetooth inhaler reminder device did not improve adherence, but comprehensive verbal instruction from a health professional did improve mean adherence (prescription refills) (mean difference (MD) 1.00, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.54). Motivational interview improved mean adherence scores on the APCD scale (MD 22.22, 95% CI 8.42 to 36.02). 
Use of a single inhaler compared to two separate inhalers may have little to no impact on quality of life (SGRQ; MD 0.80, 95% CI –3.12 to 4.72; very low certainty). A Bluetooth inhaler monitoring device may provide a small improvement in quality of life on the CCQ (MD 0.40, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.73; very low certainty). 
Single inhaler use may have little to no impact on the number of people admitted to hospital compared to two separate inhalers (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.90; very low certainty). Single component interventions may have little to no impact on the number of people expereincing adverse events (very low certainty evidence from studies of a change in pharmacotherapy or use of adherence aids). A change in pharmacotherapy may have little to no impact on exacerbations or deaths (very low certainty). 
Multi‐component interventions 
Eight studies (30 to 734 participants) reported multi‐component interventions including tailored care package that included adherence support as a key component or included inhaler technique as a component. 
A multi‐component intervention may result in more people adhering to pharmacotherapy compared to control at 40.5 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.37, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.59; studies = 4, participants = 446; I2 = 0%; low certainty). 
There may be little to no impact on quality of life (SGRQ, Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire, CAT) (studies = 3; low to very low certainty). 
Multi‐component interventions may help to reduce the number of people admitted to hospital for any cause (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.63; studies = 2, participants = 877; low certainty), or COPD‐related hospitalisations (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.34; studies = 2, participants = 220; moderate certainty). There may be a small benefit on people experiencing severe exacerbations. 
There may be little to no effect on adverse events, serious adverse events or deaths, but events were infrequently reported and were rare (low to very low certainty). 
Authors' conclusions
Single component interventions (e.g. education or motivational interviewing provided by a health professional) can help to improve adherence to pharmacotherapy (low to very low certainty). There were slight improvements in quality of life with a Bluetooth inhaler device, but evidence is from one study and very low certainty. Change to pharmacotherapy (e.g. single inhaler instead of two, or different doses of roflumilast) has little impact on hospitalisations or exacerbations (very low certainty). There is no difference in people experiencing adverse events (all‐cause or COPD‐related), or deaths (very low certainty). 
Multi‐component interventions may improve adherence with education, motivational or behavioural components delivered by health professionals (low certainty). There is little to no impact on quality of life (low to very low certainty). They may help reduce the number of people admitted to hospital overall (specifically pharmacist‐led approaches) (low certainty), and fewer people may have COPD‐related hospital admissions (moderately certainty). There may be a small reduction in people experiencing severe exacerbations, but evidence is from one study (low certainty). Limited evidence found no difference in people experiencing adverse events, serious adverse events or deaths (low to very low certainty). 
The evidence presented should be interpreted with caution. Larger studies with more intervention types, especially single interventions, are needed. It is unclear which specific COPD subgroups would benefit, therefore discussions between health professionals and patients may help to determine whether they will help to improve health outcomes. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Helping People with COPD Take Their Medicines as Prescribed

## Plain Title
Do programs that help people with COPD take their medicines work better than usual care?

## Rationale

**What is COPD?**
COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is a long-term lung disease. People with COPD have trouble breathing. They may feel short of breath. They often have flare-ups when their symptoms get worse.

**Why is taking medicine important?**
Doctors prescribe medicines to help people with COPD breathe better. These medicines work best when people take them every day as prescribed. But many people forget to take their medicines. Or they stop taking them. When this happens, the medicines cannot work well. People may feel worse. They may need to go to the hospital more often.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to find out if special programs could help people with COPD take their medicines correctly. They looked at different types of help. Some programs used one method. Others used many methods together. The goal was to see which programs worked best.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 14 studies. These studies included 2,191 adults with COPD. The people in the studies were 54 to 75 years old. Some had mild COPD. Others had very severe COPD. The studies took place in 10 different countries.

Each study tested a different way to help people take their medicines. Some studies lasted 6 weeks. Others lasted up to 52 weeks (one year).

**What did researchers test?**
They tested two main types of programs:

*Single programs* used just one method. These included:
- Changing the type of inhaler people used
- Using reminder devices that connect to phones
- Teaching people about their medicines
- Talking with people to motivate them

*Multi-part programs* used several methods together. These often included:
- Education from nurses or pharmacists
- Help with using inhalers correctly
- Regular check-ins by phone or in person
- Support to solve problems

Researchers compared these programs to usual care. They measured three main things: Did people take their medicines? Did their quality of life improve? Did fewer people go to the hospital?

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**Single programs:**
- Reminder devices did not help much
- But when health workers gave clear instructions, people took their medicines more often
- Talking with people to motivate them also helped
- Using one inhaler instead of two did not make much difference
- These programs did not reduce hospital visits much
- Side effects were rare and similar to usual care

**Multi-part programs:**
- These programs helped more people take their medicines correctly
- About 1 in 3 more people took their medicines as prescribed
- Quality of life did not improve much
- Fewer people went to the hospital for any reason
- Fewer people went to the hospital because of COPD
- Fewer people had severe flare-ups
- Side effects and deaths were rare and similar to usual care

**What do these results mean?**
Programs that include several types of help work better than single programs. The best programs included:
- Education from health workers
- Regular support and check-ins
- Help from pharmacists

These programs helped people take their medicines. They also kept people out of the hospital.

**Important notes:**
The researchers said we need more studies. We need bigger studies with more people. We do not know which people with COPD would benefit most from these programs. People with COPD should talk with their doctors. Together, they can decide which type of help might work best.

The evidence is not perfect. But it shows that extra support can help people with COPD take their medicines and stay healthier.",10.1002-14651858.CD013381,"Which approaches help people with COPD to maintain taking medication as prescribed?
Review question 
Which approaches help people maintain taking prescribed medication(s), improve quality of life and reduce hospital admissions in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? 
Background 
COPD is a lung condition that can cause long‐term breathing problems and includes symptoms such as shortness of breath. Medications do exist that can help but sometimes people do not take them as prescribed. Different approaches could help people to take their medication as prescribed and help improve symptoms or quality of life and reduce hospital admissions. 
We wanted to find out if any approaches could help people with COPD take their medication(s) as prescribed. 
Studies identified and selected 
We searched databases to find the studies. Four people working in pairs looked at the lists of studies separately and agreed on which ones were included. The latest search for studies was conducted in May 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We included studies comparing simple ways to help improve medication use (e.g. different medication doses or single inhalers instead of two separate inhalers) to usual COPD care. We also included studies that tested combination approaches (e.g. information or training from nurses or pharmacists and monitoring medication use). 
What were the key results? 
We included 14 studies (2191 people) in our analysis. No studies were masked (people knew whether they were receiving an approach to help them with adherence or the alternative). Six studies used simple approaches (e.g. change to medication dosage, change to type of inhaler, or a Bluetooth inhaler reminder device), and eight studies used combined approaches (e.g. nurses or pharmacists giving advice or information about how to improve medication use). 
We were uncertain about the effects of a different medication dose on people adhering to medication because it was no different to usual care (one study). Two separate studies found that a Bluetooth inhaler reminder device or a change in oral medication dose did not help to improve adherence. Health professionals involved in giving information may help to improve adherence (one study). This was measured by prescription refills. Motivating people to change their behaviour could help to improve adherence their medication (one study). This was measured by people completing a questionnaire about adherence to their medication. 
One study found that a Bluetooth inhaler device might help to improve quality of life. There may be little to no difference between those using single inhalers in the number of people admitted to hospital compared to those using two separate inhalers (one study). We found no difference between single approaches and usual care on the number of people who had side effects. 
Combined approaches may help to improve the number of people taking their medication, but we were not confident of this finding (four studies). They may have little to no impact on quality of life (three studies). Combined approaches could be beneficial in reducing the number of people with COPD admitted to hospital for any reason or because of COPD symptoms (two studies). 
There was no difference between combined approaches and in the number of people who had adverse events. 
Take home message 
We could not say for certain that simple approaches are useful to help people with COPD to improve medication use because of very limited information. Combined approaches may help people to take their medication(s) as prescribed and can help to reduce the number of people admitted to hospital, however, more information is needed to help answer this question with confidence.

Background 
Acute high altitude illness, also known as acute mountain sickness, may present with a variety of symptoms. It is caused by the decreasing level of oxygen at increasingly high altitudes; and it can be experienced when reaching a high altitude when travelling, hiking or climbing mountains or other elevated areas. People going to altitudes over 4000 metres, females, people younger than mid‐adulthood , and people with a history of migraine are at greater risk of suffering from altitude sickness. The most common symptoms are headache, loss of appetite , insomnia, and nausea. However, severe forms can include confusion, difficulty walking, progressive cough, shortness of breath, and even death. 
Review question 
What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for people suffering from high altitude illness? 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 studies with a total of 468 participants. Most studies included participants with mild or moderate forms of mountain sickness, and only one study included the severe neurological (disorder of the nervous system) form. Follow‐up was usually less than one day. We also identified two ongoing studies. 
Key results 
We found studies evaluating the following interventions: simulated descent with a hyperbaric chamber (medical use of oxygen in a special chamber at greater than atmospheric pressure to increase the availability of oxygen in the body); oxygen; medicines: acetazolamide, dexamethasone, ibuprofen, paracetamol, gabapentin, sumatriptan, nitric oxide, and magnesium sulphate. None of the studies reported the effects of these interventions on all‐cause mortality. The report of complete relief from acute mountain sickness symptoms, and adverse events was infrequent. Studies related to simulated descent with the use of a hyperbaric chamber did not find additional benefits or harms related to this intervention (3 studies, 124 participants). In addition, studies related to administration of medicines found some benefits in terms of reduction of symptoms with the use of acetazolamide (2 studies, 25 participants), and dexamethasone (1 study, 35 participants), without an increase in side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence we found was low, and thus our certainty in the findings is limited. There was insufficient information on how the studies were conducted, and in some cases there was evidence of tampering at some stages of the trials. Furthermore, the number of persons in each study was very small (< 30 participants), and therefore the results were not clear (imprecise). Some studies were not blinded (that is, participants knew what experimental treatment they were receiving), and this could have affected how the participants evaluated their own symptoms. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
What Treatments Work for Mountain Sickness?

## Rationale

**What is mountain sickness?**

Mountain sickness happens when people go to high places. The air has less oxygen at high places. This makes some people feel sick.

**Who gets mountain sickness?**

People who go above 4000 meters are at risk. Women get it more often than men. Young people get it more than older adults. People who get migraine headaches are also at higher risk.

**What does mountain sickness feel like?**

Most people get a headache. They may not want to eat. They may have trouble sleeping. They may feel sick to their stomach. Some people get very sick. They may get confused. They may have trouble walking. They may cough a lot. They may have trouble breathing. Some people can die from it.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Doctors need to know which treatments work best. Many treatments exist for mountain sickness. Researchers wanted to find out which ones help people feel better. They also wanted to know if treatments cause problems or side effects.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This study looked at other studies. Researchers found 13 studies to review. These studies had 468 people in total.

**Who was in these studies?**

Most studies had people with mild mountain sickness. Some studies had people with moderate mountain sickness. Only one study had people with severe brain problems from mountain sickness.

**How long did the studies last?**

Most studies lasted less than one day. Researchers checked on people for a short time.

**What treatments did researchers study?**

They looked at many treatments:
- A special pressure chamber
- Oxygen
- Several medicines

The medicines included acetazolamide, dexamethasone, ibuprofen, paracetamol, gabapentin, sumatriptan, nitric oxide, and magnesium sulphate.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

Researchers found some treatments that may help.

**Pressure chamber:**
Three studies tested a special pressure chamber. This chamber copies being at a lower place. It did not help people feel better. It did not cause harm either. These studies had 124 people.

**Medicines that may help:**
Two medicines seemed to help people feel better.

Acetazolamide helped reduce symptoms. Two studies with 25 people tested this medicine. People felt better after taking it. It did not cause more side effects.

Dexamethasone also helped reduce symptoms. One study with 35 people tested this medicine. People felt better after taking it. It did not cause more side effects.

**What was missing from the studies?**

The studies did not report some important things. They did not say if anyone died. They rarely said if people felt completely better. They rarely reported side effects.

**How good was the evidence?**

The evidence was low quality. This means we cannot be very sure about the results.

**Why was the evidence low quality?**

Several problems existed:
- The studies did not explain their methods well
- Some studies may have had problems with how they were done
- Each study had very few people (less than 30)
- Some people knew which treatment they got
- This may have changed how they rated their symptoms

**What do these results mean?**

Two medicines may help people with mountain sickness. But we need better studies. Better studies would have more people. They would explain their methods clearly. They would report all important outcomes.

Researchers also found two more studies still happening. These may give us more information later.",10.1002-14651858.CD009567,"Treatments for high altitude (mountain) illness
Background 
Acute high altitude illness, also known as acute mountain sickness, may present with a variety of symptoms. It is caused by the decreasing level of oxygen at increasingly high altitudes; and it can be experienced when reaching a high altitude when travelling, hiking or climbing mountains or other elevated areas. People going to altitudes over 4000 metres, females, people younger than mid‐adulthood , and people with a history of migraine are at greater risk of suffering from altitude sickness. The most common symptoms are headache, loss of appetite , insomnia, and nausea. However, severe forms can include confusion, difficulty walking, progressive cough, shortness of breath, and even death. 
Review question 
What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for people suffering from high altitude illness? 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 studies with a total of 468 participants. Most studies included participants with mild or moderate forms of mountain sickness, and only one study included the severe neurological (disorder of the nervous system) form. Follow‐up was usually less than one day. We also identified two ongoing studies. 
Key results 
We found studies evaluating the following interventions: simulated descent with a hyperbaric chamber (medical use of oxygen in a special chamber at greater than atmospheric pressure to increase the availability of oxygen in the body); oxygen; medicines: acetazolamide, dexamethasone, ibuprofen, paracetamol, gabapentin, sumatriptan, nitric oxide, and magnesium sulphate. None of the studies reported the effects of these interventions on all‐cause mortality. The report of complete relief from acute mountain sickness symptoms, and adverse events was infrequent. Studies related to simulated descent with the use of a hyperbaric chamber did not find additional benefits or harms related to this intervention (3 studies, 124 participants). In addition, studies related to administration of medicines found some benefits in terms of reduction of symptoms with the use of acetazolamide (2 studies, 25 participants), and dexamethasone (1 study, 35 participants), without an increase in side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence we found was low, and thus our certainty in the findings is limited. There was insufficient information on how the studies were conducted, and in some cases there was evidence of tampering at some stages of the trials. Furthermore, the number of persons in each study was very small (< 30 participants), and therefore the results were not clear (imprecise). Some studies were not blinded (that is, participants knew what experimental treatment they were receiving), and this could have affected how the participants evaluated their own symptoms.

Heated tobacco products (HTPs) are designed to heat tobacco to a high enough temperature to release aerosol, without burning it or producing smoke. They differ from e‐cigarettes because they heat tobacco leaf/sheet rather than a liquid. Companies who make HTPs claim they produce fewer harmful chemicals than conventional cigarettes. Some people report stopping smoking cigarettes entirely by switching to using HTPs, so clinicians need to know whether they are effective for this purpose and relatively safe. Also, to regulate HTPs appropriately, policymakers should understand their impact on health and on cigarette smoking prevalence. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of HTPs for smoking cessation and the impact of HTPs on smoking prevalence.  
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and six other databases for relevant records to January 2021, together with reference‐checking and contact with study authors and relevant groups. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which people who smoked cigarettes were randomised to switch to exclusive HTP use or a control condition. Eligible outcomes were smoking cessation, adverse events, and selected biomarkers.  RCTs conducted in clinic or in an ambulatory setting were deemed eligible when assessing safety, including those randomising participants to exclusively use HTPs, smoke cigarettes, or attempt abstinence from all tobacco. Time‐series studies were also eligible for inclusion if they examined the population‐level impact of heated tobacco on smoking prevalence or cigarette sales as an indirect measure. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our primary outcome measures were abstinence from smoking at the longest follow‐up point available, adverse events, serious adverse events, and changes in smoking prevalence or cigarette sales. Other outcomes included biomarkers of harm and exposure to toxicants/carcinogens (e.g. NNAL and carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb)). We used a random‐effects Mantel‐Haenszel model to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences on the log‐transformed scale (LMD) with 95% CIs. We pooled data across studies using meta‐analysis where possible. 
Main results
We included 13 completed studies, of which 11 were RCTs assessing safety (2666 participants) and two were time‐series studies. We judged eight RCTs to be at unclear risk of bias and three at high risk. All RCTs were funded by tobacco companies. Median length of follow‐up was 13 weeks. 
No studies reported smoking cessation outcomes. 
There was insufficient evidence for a difference in risk of adverse events between smokers randomised to switch to heated tobacco or continue smoking cigarettes, limited by imprecision and risk of bias (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.15; I2 = 0%; 6 studies, 1713 participants). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether risk of serious adverse events differed between groups due to very serious imprecision and risk of bias (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.94; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 1472 participants). There was moderate‐certainty evidence for lower NNAL and COHb at follow‐up in heated tobacco than cigarette smoking groups, limited by risk of bias (NNAL: LMD −0.81, 95% CI −1.07 to −0.55; I2 = 92%; 10 studies, 1959 participants; COHb: LMD −0.74, 95% CI −0.92 to −0.52; I2 = 96%; 9 studies, 1807 participants). Evidence for additional biomarkers of exposure are reported in the main body of the review. 
There was insufficient evidence for a difference in risk of adverse events in smokers randomised to switch to heated tobacco or attempt abstinence from all tobacco, limited by risk of bias and imprecision (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.46; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 237 participants). Five studies reported that no serious adverse events occurred in either group (533 participants). There was moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, that urine concentrations of NNAL at follow‐up were higher in the heated tobacco use compared with abstinence group (LMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 382 participants). In addition, there was very low‐certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, for higher COHb in the heated tobacco use compared with abstinence group for intention‐to‐treat analyses (LMD 0.69, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.31; 3 studies, 212 participants), but lower COHb in per‐protocol analyses (LMD −0.32, 95% CI −1.04 to 0.39; 2 studies, 170 participants). Evidence concerning additional biomarkers is reported in the main body of the review. 
Data from two time‐series studies showed that the rate of decline in cigarette sales accelerated following the introduction of heated tobacco to market in Japan. This evidence was of very low‐certainty as there was risk of bias, including possible confounding, and cigarette sales are an indirect measure of smoking prevalence. 
Authors' conclusions
No studies reported on cigarette smoking cessation, so the effectiveness of heated tobacco for this purpose remains uncertain. There was insufficient evidence for differences in risk of adverse or serious adverse events between people randomised to switch to heated tobacco, smoke cigarettes, or attempt tobacco abstinence in the short‐term. There was moderate‐certainty evidence that heated tobacco users have lower exposure to toxicants/carcinogens than cigarette smokers and very low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence of higher exposure than those attempting abstinence from  all tobacco. Independently funded research on the effectiveness and safety of HTPs is needed.  
The rate of decline in cigarette sales accelerated after the introduction of heated tobacco to market in Japan but, as data were observational, it is possible other factors caused these changes. Moreover, falls in cigarette sales may not translate to declining smoking prevalence, and changes in Japan may not generalise elsewhere. To clarify the impact of rising heated tobacco use on smoking prevalence, there is a need for time‐series studies that examine this association. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Heated Tobacco Products for Quitting Smoking

## Plain Title
Can heated tobacco products help people stop smoking regular cigarettes, and are they safe?

## Rationale

**What are heated tobacco products?**
Heated tobacco products (also called HTPs) are devices that heat real tobacco. They heat it enough to make a mist you can breathe in. But they do not burn the tobacco or make smoke like regular cigarettes do.

**How are they different from e-cigarettes?**
E-cigarettes heat a liquid. Heated tobacco products heat actual tobacco leaves or sheets instead.

**Why did researchers study these products?**
The companies that make heated tobacco products say they release fewer harmful chemicals than regular cigarettes. Some people say they stopped smoking regular cigarettes by switching to heated tobacco products. Doctors need to know if these products really help people quit smoking. They also need to know if the products are safe. Government officials need this information too. It helps them make good rules about these products.

**What did researchers want to find out?**
Researchers wanted to learn three things:
- Do heated tobacco products help people stop smoking regular cigarettes?
- Are heated tobacco products safe to use?
- Do heated tobacco products change how many people smoke in a community?

## Trial Design

**How did researchers find studies?**
Researchers looked for studies published up to January 2021. They searched many medical databases. They also contacted study authors and other groups for information.

**What kinds of studies did they include?**
Researchers included 13 studies. Eleven studies were tests where people were put into groups by chance. Two studies looked at cigarette sales over time in Japan.

**Who was in these studies?**
The 11 test studies included 2,666 people who smoked cigarettes. Some people were asked to switch to heated tobacco products. Other people kept smoking regular cigarettes. Some people tried to stop using all tobacco.

**How long did the studies last?**
Most studies lasted about 13 weeks (about 3 months).

**Important information about the studies:**
All 11 test studies were paid for by tobacco companies. This means the results might be biased.

## Results

**Did heated tobacco products help people quit smoking?**
None of the studies measured this. We still do not know if heated tobacco products help people stop smoking regular cigarettes.

**Were heated tobacco products safe?**

*Comparing heated tobacco to regular cigarettes:*
- Side effects happened at similar rates in both groups.
- Serious side effects were rare in both groups. We cannot tell if one is safer than the other.
- People using heated tobacco products had lower levels of some harmful chemicals in their bodies. These chemicals can cause cancer. This is good news.

*Comparing heated tobacco to quitting all tobacco:*
- Side effects happened at similar rates in both groups.
- Serious side effects were very rare in both groups.
- People using heated tobacco products had higher levels of harmful chemicals than people who quit all tobacco. This makes sense because they were still using tobacco.

**What happened to cigarette sales in Japan?**
After heated tobacco products came to Japan, cigarette sales dropped faster than before. But we cannot be sure heated tobacco products caused this change. Other things might have caused it. Also, lower cigarette sales might not mean fewer people smoke. People might just buy fewer cigarettes at a time.

**What do these results mean?**
We need more research that tobacco companies do not pay for. We need studies that last longer. We need to know if heated tobacco products really help people quit smoking. We also need to better understand how safe they are over time.

**Word count: 623 words**",10.1002-14651858.CD013790,"Do heated tobacco products help people to quit smoking, are they safe for this purpose, and have they led to falls in smoking rates? 
Key messages 
Heated tobacco probably exposes people to fewer toxins than cigarettes, but possibly more than not using any tobacco. Falls in cigarette sales appeared to speed up following the launch of heated tobacco in Japan, but we are uncertain whether this is caused by people switching from cigarettes to heated tobacco. 
We need more independently funded research into whether heated tobacco helps people stop smoking, whether it results in unwanted effects, and the impact of rising heated tobacco use on smoking rates.  
What are heated tobacco products?  
Heated tobacco products are designed to heat tobacco to a high enough temperature to release vapour, without burning it or producing smoke. They differ from e‐cigarettes because they heat tobacco leaf/sheet rather than a liquid. Many of the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke are created by burning tobacco. So heating not burning tobacco could reduce the amount of chemicals a user ingests. Some people report stopping smoking cigarettes entirely by switching to using heated tobacco. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review  
Because cigarette smoking is addictive, many people find it difficult to stop despite the harm it causes. We aimed to find out whether trying to switch to heated tobacco helps people stop smoking cigarettes, and whether it results in unwanted effects. We also wanted to find out whether rising heated tobacco use has affected smoking rates or cigarette sales. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that reported on the use of heated tobacco for stopping smoking, and on unwanted effects and toxin exposure in people asked to use heated tobacco. Here we only included randomised controlled trials, where treatments were given to people at random. This type of study is considered the most reliable way of determining if a treatment works. Finally, we searched for studies looking at changes in smoking rates and cigarette sales following the launch of heated tobacco to market. We included studies published up to January 2021. 
What we found 
Our search found 13 relevant studies. No studies reported whether heated tobacco helps people stop smoking cigarettes. Eleven trials, all funded by tobacco companies and with 2666 adult smokers, compared unwanted effects and toxin levels in people randomly assigned to use heated tobacco or to continue smoking cigarettes or abstain from tobacco use. 
Two studies looked at how trends in cigarette sales changed following the launch of heated tobacco in Japan. 
What are the results of our review?  
We do not know whether using heated tobacco helps people to stop smoking cigarettes (no studies measured this). 
We are uncertain whether the chances of getting unwanted symptoms from being asked to use heated tobacco are different compared with cigarettes (6 studies, 1713 participants) or no tobacco (2 studies, 237 participants). Serious unwanted symptoms in the short time period studied (average 13 weeks) were rare in all groups, which means we are uncertain about any differences. Toxin levels were probably lower in people using heated tobacco than those smoking cigarettes (10 studies, 1959 participants), but may be higher than in people not using any tobacco products (5 studies, 382 participants). 
The launch of heated tobacco products in Japan may have caused the decline in cigarette sales to speed up over time (two studies), but it is unclear whether the fall in the percentage of people who smoke also sped up because no studies looked at this.  
How reliable are these results? 
Results are based on data from a small number of studies, most of which were funded by tobacco companies.  
Results on unwanted effects are likely to change as more evidence becomes available. However, we are moderately confident that levels of measured toxins are lower in people using heated tobacco than smoking cigarettes, but less confident that levels were higher than in people not using any tobacco. We are also less confident that the launch of heated tobacco caused the fall in cigarette sales to speed up, as results came from a single country.

","# Plain Language Summary: Mental Health Help for People Forced to Leave Their Homes

## Plain Title
A Review of Studies About Mental Health Care for Refugees and People Forced to Move

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people must leave their homes because of war, danger, or other serious problems. These people include refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Refugees and asylum seekers cross borders to find safety. Internally displaced persons move to safer areas within their own country.

**Why is this a problem?**

Being forced to leave home causes great stress. The journey to safety can be dangerous. Starting a new life in an unfamiliar place is hard. These experiences can harm mental health. Many people develop depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder happens after scary or dangerous events. It causes bad memories, fear, and trouble sleeping.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors and helpers need to know what works best for these groups. Mental health treatments that help other people might work differently for involuntary migrants. Researchers wanted to see what studies already exist. They looked at reviews that summarize many studies together. This helps identify what we know and what we still need to learn.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was an overview of systematic reviews. Researchers collected reviews that had already been published. Each review looked at multiple studies about mental health care.

**Who was included?**

The reviews focused on refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Some reviews studied adults. Others studied children. Both men and women were included.

**What did researchers look for?**

They searched for three types of mental health care:
- Mental health promotion helps people stay mentally healthy
- Prevention stops mental health problems before they start
- Treatment helps people who already have mental health problems

**How long did this take?**

This overview collected reviews published over many years. Each original review included studies done at different times.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

Researchers found 23 completed reviews. They also found 15 reviews still in progress. Together, these 23 reviews included 175 different studies.

**What patterns appeared?**

Most reviews focused on refugees and asylum seekers. Very few studied internally displaced persons. More reviews studied adults than children. Most reviews looked at treating post-traumatic stress disorder. Few reviews studied depression or anxiety. Very few studied mental health promotion or prevention.

The reviews mostly examined talk therapy approaches. Common types included Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, and interpersonal therapies. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy helps people change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors. Narrative Exposure Therapy helps people tell their story in a safe way.

**What were the problems?**

Many reviews had quality issues. The biggest problem was poor reporting. Reviews did not clearly explain their methods. This makes it hard to trust the results.

**What does this mean?**

Important gaps exist in the research. We need more studies about:
- Internally displaced persons
- Children and young people
- Depression and anxiety treatment
- Mental health promotion and prevention
- Treatments other than talk therapy

**What are the conclusions?**

The available research does not match what involuntary migrants need. Many groups are understudied. Many types of care are understudied. Future reviews should focus on these missing areas. This will help doctors and helpers provide better care. It will help people forced to leave their homes get the mental health support they need.

Better quality reviews are also needed. Researchers must clearly report their methods. This will make the evidence more reliable and useful.",10.1002-14651858.CD013458,"An overview of systematic reviews on mental health interventions for involuntary migrants

Every year, at least one million children become ill with tuberculosis and around 200,000 children die. Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended rapid molecular tests that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and children with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, at lower health system levels. To inform updated WHO guidelines on molecular assays, we performed a systematic review on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests in children presumed to have active tuberculosis. 
Objectives
Primary objectives 
• To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for (a) pulmonary tuberculosis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; (b) tuberculous meningitis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; (c) lymph node tuberculosis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; and (d) rifampicin resistance in children presumed to have tuberculosis 
‐ For tuberculosis detection, index tests were used as the initial test, replacing standard practice (i.e. smear microscopy or culture) 
‐ For detection of rifampicin resistance, index tests replaced culture‐based drug susceptibility testing as the initial test 
Secondary objectives 
• To compare the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for each of the four target conditions 
• To investigate potential sources of heterogeneity in accuracy estimates
‐ For tuberculosis detection, we considered age, disease severity, smear‐test status, HIV status, clinical setting, specimen type, high tuberculosis burden, and high tuberculosis/HIV burden 
‐ For detection of rifampicin resistance, we considered multi‐drug‐resistant tuberculosis burden 
• To compare multiple Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra results (repeated testing) with the initial Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra result 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) Registry up to 29 April 2019, without language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomized trials, cross‐sectional trials, and cohort studies evaluating Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra in HIV‐positive and HIV‐negative children younger than 15 years. Reference standards comprised culture or a composite reference standard for tuberculosis and drug susceptibility testing or MTBDRplus (molecular assay for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and drug resistance) for rifampicin resistance. We included studies evaluating sputum, gastric aspirate, stool, nasopharyngeal or bronchial lavage specimens (pulmonary tuberculosis), cerebrospinal fluid (tuberculous meningitis), fine needle aspirates, or surgical biopsy tissue (lymph node tuberculosis). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy ‐ Revised (QUADAS‐2). For each target condition, we used the bivariate model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We stratified all analyses by type of reference standard. We assessed certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
For pulmonary tuberculosis, 299 data sets (68,544 participants) were available for analysis; for tuberculous meningitis, 10 data sets (423 participants) were available; for lymph node tuberculosis, 10 data sets (318 participants) were available; and for rifampicin resistance, 14 data sets (326 participants) were available. Thirty‐nine studies (80%) took place in countries with high tuberculosis burden. Risk of bias was low except for the reference standard domain, for which risk of bias was unclear because many studies collected only one specimen for culture. 
Detection of pulmonary tuberculosis 
For sputum specimens, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) verified by culture were 64.6% (55.3% to 72.9%) (23 studies, 493 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and 99.0% (98.1% to 99.5%) (23 studies, 6119 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). For other specimen types (nasopharyngeal aspirate, 4 studies; gastric aspirate, 14 studies; stool, 11 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity ranged between 45.7% and 73.0%, and pooled specificity ranged between 98.1% and 99.6%. 
For sputum specimens, Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) verified by culture were 72.8% (64.7% to 79.6%) (3 studies, 136 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and 97.5% (95.8% to 98.5%) (3 studies, 551 participants; high‐certainty evidence). For nasopharyngeal specimens, Xpert Ultra sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) were 45.7% (28.9% to 63.3%) and 97.5% (93.7% to 99.3%) (1 study, 195 participants). 
For all specimen types, Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra sensitivity were lower against a composite reference standard than against culture. 
Detection of tuberculous meningitis 
For cerebrospinal fluid, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity, verified by culture, were 54.0% (95% CI 27.8% to 78.2%) (6 studies, 28 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 93.8% (95% CI 84.5% to 97.6%) (6 studies, 213 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Detection of lymph node tuberculosis 
For lymph node aspirates or biopsies, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity, verified by culture, were 90.4% (95% CI 55.7% to 98.6%) (6 studies, 68 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 89.8% (95% CI 71.5% to 96.8%) (6 studies, 142 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Detection of rifampicin resistance 
Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 90.0% (67.6% to 97.5%) (6 studies, 20 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and 98.3% (87.7% to 99.8%) (6 studies, 203 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We found Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity to vary by specimen type, with gastric aspirate specimens having the highest sensitivity followed by sputum and stool, and nasopharyngeal specimens the lowest; specificity in all specimens was > 98%. Compared with Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra sensitivity in sputum was higher and specificity slightly lower. Xpert MTB/RIF was accurate for detection of rifampicin resistance. Xpert MTB/RIF was sensitive for diagnosing lymph node tuberculosis. For children with presumed tuberculous meningitis, treatment decisions should be based on the entirety of clinical information and treatment should not be withheld based solely on an Xpert MTB/RIF result. The small numbers of studies and participants, particularly for Xpert Ultra, limits our confidence in the precision of these estimates.

## Plain Title

How Well Do Xpert Tests Detect Tuberculosis and Drug Resistance in Children?

## Rationale

**What is tuberculosis and why does it matter?**

Tuberculosis is a serious lung infection. Each year, over 1 million children get sick with tuberculosis. Around 200,000 children die from it. This makes tuberculosis a major health problem for children worldwide.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need fast and accurate tests to find tuberculosis in children. When doctors find tuberculosis quickly, they can start treatment sooner. This saves lives. Traditional tests can take weeks to show results. Children may get sicker while waiting.

**What are Xpert tests?**

Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are newer, faster tests. These tests can find tuberculosis in just a few hours. They can also tell if the tuberculosis germs resist certain medicines. The World Health Organization recommends these tests for both adults and children.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know how well these Xpert tests work in children. They looked at different types of tuberculosis: lung tuberculosis, brain tuberculosis, and lymph node tuberculosis. They also checked if the tests could find drug-resistant tuberculosis.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at many other studies done before. They combined the results to get a bigger picture.

**Who was included?**

The studies included children under 15 years old. Some children had HIV. Some did not. The children showed signs they might have tuberculosis.

**What did researchers examine?**

Researchers looked at 299 groups of data about lung tuberculosis. They looked at 10 groups about brain tuberculosis. They looked at 10 groups about lymph node tuberculosis. They looked at 14 groups about drug resistance. Most studies (80%) happened in countries where tuberculosis is common.

**What samples were tested?**

For lung tuberculosis: sputum (mucus coughed up), fluid from the stomach, stool, and fluid from the nose or airways.

For brain tuberculosis: fluid from around the brain and spine.

For lymph node tuberculosis: samples taken from swollen lymph nodes.

## Results

**What did the study find about lung tuberculosis?**

For sputum samples, Xpert MTB/RIF found tuberculosis in about 65 out of 100 children who had it. The test correctly said ""no tuberculosis"" in 99 out of 100 children who did not have it. This means the test rarely gives false alarms.

Xpert Ultra worked slightly better on sputum. It found tuberculosis in about 73 out of 100 children who had it. It correctly said ""no tuberculosis"" in about 98 out of 100 children who did not have it.

For other sample types like stomach fluid and stool, the tests found between 46 and 73 out of 100 cases. The tests were very accurate at ruling out tuberculosis.

**What did the study find about brain tuberculosis?**

For brain fluid, Xpert MTB/RIF found tuberculosis in about 54 out of 100 children who had it. This means the test missed many cases. Doctors should not rely only on this test for brain tuberculosis. They should look at all signs and symptoms before deciding on treatment.

**What did the study find about lymph node tuberculosis?**

For lymph node samples, Xpert MTB/RIF found tuberculosis in about 90 out of 100 children who had it. This shows the test works well for this type of tuberculosis.

**What did the study find about drug resistance?**

Xpert MTB/RIF found drug-resistant tuberculosis in 90 out of 100 children who had it. The test was very accurate overall for detecting drug resistance.

**What do these results mean?**

The Xpert tests help doctors diagnose tuberculosis faster in children. The tests work best on sputum and lymph node samples. They work less well on brain fluid. Xpert Ultra appears slightly better than Xpert MTB/RIF for lung tuberculosis. Both tests are good at finding drug resistance.

**Important notes:**

The number of children studied was sometimes small. This means results might change with more research. Doctors should use these tests along with other information about the child's health. They should not make treatment decisions based only on test results, especially for brain tuberculosis.",10.1002-14651858.CD013359,"Xpert tests for active tuberculosis in children
Why is improving the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis important? 
In 2018, at least one million children became ill with tuberculosis and around 200,000 died. When detected early and effectively treated, tuberculosis is largely curable. Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are World Health Organization‐recommended tests that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and children with tuberculosis symptoms. Rifampicin is an important anti‐tuberculosis drug. Not recognizing tuberculosis early may result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, severe illness, and death. A false tuberculosis diagnosis may result in anxiety and unnecessary treatment. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of tests in symptomatic children for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance. 
What was studied in this review? 
Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra, with results measured against culture and a composite reference standard (benchmarks), recognizing that neither reference is perfect in children. 
What are the main results in this review? 
A total of 49 studies were included. For pulmonary tuberculosis, we analysed 299 data sets including information describing nearly 70,000 children. 
For a population of 1000 children:
Xpert MTB/RIF 
‐ where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum (by culture), 74 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 (12%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 926 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 35 (4%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 have tuberculous meningitis (by culture), 86 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 59 (69%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 914 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 23 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 people have lymph node tuberculosis (by culture), 142 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 97 (68%) would not have lymph node tuberculosis (false‐positives); 858 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 5 (1%) would have lymph node TB (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 have rifampicin resistance, 108 would have Xpert MTB/RIF‐rifampicin resistance detected, of whom 18 (17%) would not have rifampicin resistance (false‐positives); 892 would have Xpert MTB/RIF‐rifampicin resistance NOT detected; and 10 (1%) would have rifampicin resistance (false‐negatives) 
Xpert Ultra 
‐ where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum (by culture), 100 would be Xpert Ultra‐positive, of whom 27 (27%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 900 would be Xpert Ultra‐negative; and 27 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
How confident are we in the results of this review? 
We are confident. We included many studies from different countries and settings and used two reference standards. Some studies included only children at referral centres or did not report the setting. Therefore, we could not assess how the tests would work in a primary care setting. 
What children do the results of this review apply to? 
Children with presumed pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, or rifampicin resistance. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The results of the review suggest Xpert tests have the potential to be used to detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. 
‐ The risk of missing a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis confirmed by culture with Xpert MTB/RIF (in sputum) is low (4% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF suggests they do not have tuberculosis) suggesting that only a small number of children with tuberculosis confirmed by culture will not receive treatment. The risk of wrongly diagnosing a child as having tuberculosis is slightly higher (12% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF test suggests they do have tuberculosis). This may result in some of these children receiving unnecessary treatment. 
‐ The risk of missing a diagnosis of rifampicin resistance with Xpert MTB/RIF is low (1% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF suggests they do not have rifampicin resistance) suggesting that only a small number of children with tuberculosis will not receive the appropriate treatment. The risk of wrongly diagnosing a child as rifampicin resistance tuberculosis is higher (17% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF test suggests they do have rifampicin resistance). This may result in some of these children receiving unnecessary treatment.

Preterm infants are susceptible to hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, which may lead to adverse neurodevelopment. The use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices might help in keeping glucose levels in the normal range, and reduce the need for blood sampling. However, the use of CGM might be associated with harms in the preterm infant. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of CGM versus intermittent modalities to measure glycaemia in preterm infants 1. at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia; 2. with proven hypoglycaemia; or 3. with proven hyperglycaemia. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2021, Issue 4); PubMed; Embase; and CINAHL in April 2021. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs and quasi‐RCTs comparing the use of CGM versus intermittent modalities to measure glycaemia in preterm infants at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia; with proven hypoglycaemia; or with proven hyperglycaemia. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed the methodological quality of included trials using Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) criteria (assessing randomization, blinding, loss to follow‐up, and handling of outcome data). We evaluated treatment effects using a fixed‐effect model with risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical data and mean, standard deviation (SD), and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included four trials enrolling 300 infants in our updated review. We included one new study and excluded another previously included study (because the inclusion criteria of the review have been narrowed). We compared the use of CGM to intermittent modalities in preterm infants at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia; however, one of these trials was analyzed separately because CGM was used as a standalone device, without being coupled to a control algorithm as in the other trials. We identified no studies in preterm infants with proven hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia.  
None of the four included trials reported the neurodevelopmental outcome (i.e. the primary outcome of this review), or seizures. The effect of the use of CGM on mortality during hospitalization is uncertain (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.13; RD −0.02, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.03; 230 participants; 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes because of limitations in study design, and imprecision of estimates. One study is ongoing (estimated sample size 60 infants) and planned to be completed in 2022. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to determine if CGM affects preterm infant mortality or morbidities.  We are very uncertain of the safety of CGM and the available management algorithms, and many morbidities remain unreported. Preterm infants at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia were enrolled in all four included studies. No studies have been conducted in preterm infants with proven hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. Long‐term outcomes were not reported. Events of necrotizing enterocolitis, reported in the study published in 2021, were lower in the CGM group. However, the effect of CGM on this outcome remains very uncertain. Clinical trials are required to determine the most effective CGM and glycaemic management regimens in preterm infants before larger studies can be performed to assess the efficacy of CGM for reducing mortality, morbidity, and long‐term neurodevelopmental impairments.

Continuous Glucose Monitors for Checking Blood Sugar Levels in Premature Babies

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Babies born too early (premature babies) often have problems with their blood sugar levels. Their blood sugar can get too high or too low. Both of these problems can harm the baby's brain as it grows and develops.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Doctors usually check blood sugar by taking small blood samples from the baby several times a day. This can be painful and stressful for tiny babies. Researchers wanted to know if a different method would work better. They studied devices called continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs. These devices check blood sugar all the time without needing blood samples. The devices use a tiny sensor placed under the skin.

**Why is this study important?**

Researchers wanted to see if CGMs could help keep blood sugar levels normal in premature babies. They also wanted to know if CGMs were safe to use. If CGMs work well, they might help protect babies' brains and reduce the need for painful blood tests.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at four different studies that other scientists had already done. They combined the results to see what they could learn.

The four studies included 300 premature babies total. All the babies were at risk of having blood sugar problems. Some babies got CGMs to check their blood sugar. Other babies had their blood sugar checked the usual way with blood samples.

The researchers looked at information from studies done up to April 2021. They checked if the babies stayed healthy and if the CGMs were safe to use.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not tell if CGMs help premature babies or not. There was not enough good information to make clear conclusions.

Here is what they found:

- None of the studies looked at how babies' brains developed over time. This was the most important question researchers wanted to answer.
- The studies did not show clearly if CGMs helped babies survive better. The information was too limited.
- The studies did not report on many health problems that can affect premature babies.
- One newer study found fewer cases of a serious gut problem in babies who used CGMs. But researchers are not sure if this finding is reliable.
- No studies looked at babies who already had proven blood sugar problems. All studies only looked at babies at risk.

**What does this mean?**

Researchers cannot say if CGMs are helpful or safe for premature babies yet. The studies done so far are too small and do not answer the most important questions. More research is needed.

**What happens next?**

One more study is still being done. It should finish in 2022 and will include 60 babies. But even with this study, there will not be enough information.

Researchers say we need better studies before we can know if CGMs should be used in premature babies. Future studies need to:
- Include more babies
- Follow babies as they grow to check brain development
- Look at more health problems
- Test different ways of using CGMs

Until better studies are done, doctors cannot be sure if CGMs help premature babies more than regular blood sugar checks.

Review questions 
What are the benefits and harms of the use of subcutaneous (under the skin) sensors for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with or without an algorithm (a set of mathematical rules) to correct too high or too low ​​​​​ levels of blood glucose versus intermittent modalities to measure blood glucose with or without an algorithm to guide the correction of too high or too low blood glucose in preterm infants 1. at risk of too high or too low ​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose; 2. with proven too low ​​​​​​levels of blood glucose; and 3. with proven too high​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose? 
Background 
Newborns born too early ('preterm') are susceptible to levels of blood glucose that are too high or too low. Most preterm babies with these abnormal concentrations  have a full recovery, or only mild problems. For some preterm babies with extremely high or low (or more prolonged) blood glucose, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. 
The aim of this updated review was to assess whether the use of CGM could improve the long‐term development or reduce deaths in preterm newborns. CGM devices are inserted subcutaneously, and provide data on blood glucose in real time. The standard method of measuring blood glucose consists of measuring blood glucose concentrations intermittently by  withdrawing small amounts of blood, often by heel pricks.  
Study characteristicsWe collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer the review question, and found four studies enrolling 300 babies. These studies compared the use of CGM to intermittent measurements in infants at risk of too high or too low ​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose. 
Key results 
None of the four included studies reported on the long‐term neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants. The studies were too small to determine if CGM has an effect on survival. One study is ongoing. Although one study published in 2021 reported the incidence of serious intestinal injury (necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious inflammation of the intestines that can be life threatening) was lower in the CGM group, this finding is very uncertain because the results were very imprecise.  Further research is needed. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was very low due to the overall limited number of studies, with few babies enrolled.

There is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about whether traditional school dental screening can improve dental attendance (can lead to children visiting the dentist more often).

We still need high‐quality studies that measure the impact of screening on oral health over longer periods of time.

Oral diseases, especially tooth decay (called 'dental caries' by dentists), affect children worldwide. If untreated, oral health can deteriorate and negatively impact children's general well‐being. It also has a financial cost for families and society as a whole. 
School dental screening involves a dental professional examining children's mouths and teeth at school and letting parents know about their child's oral condition and treatment needs. It aims to identify oral health concerns at an early stage and prompt parents to seek treatment where required. Whether this actually improves children's oral health is the question we wanted to answer in this review. 
What were the main results of this review? 
Our updated search identified one new study to be included since the last version of the review was published. In total, the review includes eight studies that presented results for 21,290 children. Four studies took place in the UK, two in India, one in the USA and one in Saudi Arabia. The children were 4 to 15 years old. Studies looked at the oral health and dental attendance of children who were screened in school compared to children who did not have screening.

We do not know whether traditional school dental screening improves dental attendance. Studies looking at screening based on specific criteria (e.g. targeted at children not registered with a dentist) suggested it may be slightly more effective than no screening for improving attendance at the dentist. There may be no difference between criteria‐based screening and universal screening for improving dental attendance, but we are very unsure about the results. 
A personalised or specific referral letter to parents may improve dental attendance more than a non‐specific letter, but we are very unsure about the results.

One study comparing different referral letters (with more or less information about dental diseases) found that neither was better than the other for improving dental treatment in children. 
A specific referral letter did not encourage more parents to take their children to the dentist when compared to a letter with generic advice to visit the dentist. 
The eight studies followed up children for 3 to 11 months after they received screening. Therefore, we do not know the effects of screening over a longer period of time. 
None of the studies checked whether there were any negative effects of screening programmes or how much they cost.

","# Plain Language Summary: School Dental Screening Programs for Improving Children's Oral Health

## Plain Title
Do dental check-ups at school help children's teeth and gums stay healthy?

## Rationale

**What is oral health and why does it matter?**

Oral health means how healthy your mouth, throat, teeth, and gums are. Many children around the world have tooth decay. This means their teeth develop holes and damage. When tooth decay is not treated, it can get worse. This can hurt children's overall health and well-being. It also costs families and communities money.

**What is school dental screening?**

School dental screening means a dental worker checks children's mouths and teeth at school. The dental worker then tells parents about their child's oral health. They explain if the child needs treatment. The goal is to find problems early. This might help parents take their child to the dentist sooner.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if checking children's teeth at school actually helps their oral health. They also wanted to know which way of screening works best. Does it help children visit the dentist more often? Does visiting the dentist more lead to better oral health? These questions needed answers.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This review looked at eight different studies. The studies included 21,290 children in total. Four studies happened in the UK. Two studies happened in India. One study happened in the USA. One study happened in Saudi Arabia.

The children in these studies were 4 to 15 years old. Some children got dental screening at school. Other children did not get screening. Researchers compared these two groups. They looked at how often children visited the dentist. They also looked at oral health.

Some studies tested different ways of screening. Some tested different ways of telling parents about results. For example, some parents got advice letters. Other parents got referral letters.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies followed children for 3 to 11 months after screening. This means researchers checked on the children for up to almost one year.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not tell if regular school dental screening helps children visit the dentist more often. There was not enough clear evidence.

Some studies looked at screening based on specific needs. For example, they screened children who did not have a regular dentist. This type of screening might work slightly better than no screening. It might help children visit the dentist more.

The studies compared screening everyone to screening only certain children. The results were very unclear. We cannot tell which works better.

**What about different ways of telling parents?**

One study looked at different types of letters to parents. A letter with personal details about the child might work better than a general letter. But the results were very unclear.

Another study looked at adding extra help. This included teaching about oral health and offering free treatment. This might help more than screening alone. But again, the results were very unclear.

One study compared letters with more or less information about dental diseases. Neither letter worked better than the other.

A specific referral letter did not work better than a general advice letter. Both led to similar numbers of dentist visits.

**What is still unknown?**

The studies only followed children for 3 to 11 months. We do not know what happens after a longer time. We do not know if screening helps oral health in the long run.

None of the studies looked at possible harm from screening programs. None of the studies checked how much screening programs cost.

**What do these results mean?**

There is not enough evidence to know if school dental screening works. We cannot tell if it helps children visit the dentist more. We also cannot tell if more dentist visits lead to better oral health.

We need better studies. These studies should follow children for longer periods. They should measure actual oral health outcomes. They should check for any negative effects. They should look at costs.

Self‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury regardless of degree of suicidal intent or other types of motivation) is a growing problem in most countries, often repeated, and associated with suicide. Evidence assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological agents and/or natural products in the treatment of SH is lacking, especially when compared with the evidence for psychosocial interventions. This review therefore updates a previous Cochrane Review (last published in 2015) on the role of pharmacological interventions for SH in adults.

To assess the effects of pharmacological agents or natural products for SH compared to comparison types of treatment (e.g. placebo or alternative pharmacological treatment) for adults (aged 18 years or older) who engage in SH. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL] and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [CDSR]), together with MEDLINE. Ovid Embase and PsycINFO (to 4 July 2020). 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmacological agents or natural products with placebo/alternative pharmacological treatment in individuals with a recent (within six months of trial entry) episode of SH resulting in presentation to hospital or clinical services. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a repeated episode of SH over a maximum follow‐up period of two years. Secondary outcomes included treatment acceptability, treatment adherence, depression, hopelessness, general functioning, social functioning, suicidal ideation, and suicide. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised trial quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence internals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI. The overall certainty of evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. repetition of SH at post‐intervention) was appraised for each intervention using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included data from seven trials with a total of 574 participants. Participants in these trials were predominately female (63.5%) with a mean age of 35.3 years (standard deviation (SD) 3.1 years). It is uncertain if newer generation antidepressants reduce repetition of SH compared to placebo (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.19; N = 129; k = 2; very low‐certainty evidence). There may be a lower rate of SH repetition for antipsychotics (21%) as compared to placebo (75%) (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.50; N = 30; k = 1; low‐certainty evidence). However, there was no evidence of a difference between antipsychotics compared to another comparator drug/dose for repetition of SH (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.58; N = 53; k = 1; low‐certainty evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference for mood stabilisers compared to placebo for repetition of SH (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.95; N = 167; k = 1; very low‐certainty evidence), or for natural products compared to placebo for repetition of SH (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.62; N = 49; k = 1; lo‐ certainty) evidence. 
Authors' conclusions
Given the low or very low quality of the available evidence, and the small number of trials identified, there is only uncertain evidence regarding pharmacological interventions in patients who engage in SH. More and larger trials of pharmacotherapy are required, preferably using newer agents. These might include evaluation of newer atypical antipsychotics. Further work should also include evaluation of adverse effects of pharmacological agents. Other research could include evaluation of combined pharmacotherapy and psychological treatment. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Medicines for People Who Self-Harm

## Plain Title
Do medicines help adults who harm themselves?

## Rationale

**What is self-harm?**
Self-harm means when a person hurts themselves on purpose. This can include taking too much medicine or injuring their body. People may do this for different reasons. It does not always mean they want to die.

**Why is this a problem?**
Self-harm is becoming more common around the world. Many people who self-harm do it more than once. People who self-harm are also at higher risk of dying by suicide. This makes self-harm a serious health concern.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Doctors want to know if medicines can help people stop self-harming. Many studies have looked at talking therapies for self-harm. But not many studies have tested medicines. Researchers wanted to review all the studies that tested medicines for adults who self-harm. They wanted to see if any medicines work better than fake pills (called placebos) or other medicines.

**What did researchers hope to find?**
The researchers hoped to find out if certain medicines could help stop people from harming themselves again. They also wanted to know if the medicines were safe and if patients would keep taking them.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers find studies?**
The researchers searched medical databases up to July 2020. They looked for studies that tested medicines in adults who self-harm.

**What kind of studies did they include?**
They only included high-quality studies. These studies gave some patients real medicine and other patients fake pills or different medicines. The researchers then compared the results. All patients in the studies had harmed themselves within six months before joining the study. All had gone to a hospital or clinic for help.

**Who was in these studies?**
The researchers found seven studies with 574 people total. Most people in the studies were women (about 6 out of 10 people). The average age was 35 years old.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies followed patients for up to two years.

**What did researchers measure?**
The main thing they measured was whether people harmed themselves again. They also looked at whether patients stayed in treatment, felt less sad or hopeless, and how well they functioned in daily life.

## Results

**What types of medicines were tested?**
The studies tested four types of medicines:
- Newer antidepressants (medicines for sadness)
- Antipsychotics (medicines for serious mental health problems)
- Mood stabilizers (medicines to help keep moods steady)
- Natural products (plant-based treatments)

**What did the studies find?**

For newer antidepressants: The researchers could not tell if these medicines helped. The evidence was too weak to be sure.

For antipsychotics: One small study found these medicines might help. About 2 out of 10 people taking antipsychotics harmed themselves again. But 7 or 8 out of 10 people taking fake pills harmed themselves again. However, this was only one small study with 30 people. Another study compared different doses of antipsychotics. It found no difference between them.

For mood stabilizers: The researchers found no difference between these medicines and fake pills. The evidence was very weak.

For natural products: The researchers found no difference between these products and fake pills. The evidence was weak.

**What do these results mean?**
The researchers cannot say for certain if any medicines help people who self-harm. The studies were too small. The quality of the evidence was low or very low. This means we cannot trust the results completely.

**What do researchers recommend?**
More and bigger studies are needed. Future studies should test newer medicines. They should check if medicines cause bad side effects. They should also test if combining medicines with talking therapy works better. Only then will doctors know which medicines truly help people who self-harm.

**Important note:** This review shows we need much more research before doctors can confidently prescribe medicines for self-harm.",10.1002-14651858.CD013669,"Drugs and natural products for self‐harm in adults
We have reviewed the international literature regarding pharmacological (drug) and natural product (dietary supplementation) treatment trials in the field. A total of seven trials meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. There is little evidence of beneficial effects of either pharmacological or natural product treatments. However, few trials have been conducted and those that have are small, meaning that possible beneficial effects of some therapies cannot be ruled out. 
Why is this review important? 
Self‐harm (SH), which includes intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is strongly linked with suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed. Whilst there has been an increase in the use of psychosocial interventions for SH in adults (which is the focus of a separate review), drug treatments are frequently used in clinical practice. It is therefore important to assess the evidence for their effectiveness. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Hospital administrators (e.g. service providers), health policy officers and third party payers (e.g. health insurers), clinicians working with patients who engage in SH, patients themselves, and their relatives. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review is an update of a previous Cochrane Review from 2015 which found little evidence of beneficial effects of drug treatments on repetition of SH. This updated aims to further evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of drugs and natural products for patients who engage in SH with a broader range of outcomes. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of drug treatments for adults who had recently engaged in SH. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There is currently no clear evidence for the effectiveness of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, or natural products in preventing repetition of SH. 
What should happen next? 
We recommend further trials of drugs for SH patients, possibly in combination with psychological treatment.

Exercise training is commonly recommended for individuals with fibromyalgia. This review is one of a series of reviews about exercise training for fibromyalgia that will replace the review titled ""Exercise for treating fibromyalgia syndrome"", which was first published in 2002. 
Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of mixed exercise training protocols that include two or more types of exercise (aerobic, resistance, flexibility) for adults with fibromyalgia against control (treatment as usual, wait list control), non exercise (e.g. biofeedback), or other exercise (e.g. mixed versus flexibility) interventions. Specific comparisons involving mixed exercise versus other exercises (e.g. resistance, aquatic, aerobic, flexibility, and whole body vibration exercises) were not assessed. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Thesis and Dissertations Abstracts, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Physiotherapy Evidence Databese (PEDro), Current Controlled Trials (to 2013), WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to December 2017, unrestricted by language, to identify all potentially relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia that compared mixed exercise interventions with other or no exercise interventions. Major outcomes were health‐related quality of life (HRQL), pain, stiffness, fatigue, physical function, withdrawals, and adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the quality of evidence for major outcomes using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 29 RCTs (2088 participants; 98% female; average age 51 years) that compared mixed exercise interventions (including at least two of the following: aerobic or cardiorespiratory, resistance or muscle strengthening exercise, and flexibility exercise) versus control (e.g. wait list), non‐exercise (e.g. biofeedback), and other exercise interventions. Design flaws across studies led to selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting biases. We prioritised the findings of mixed exercise compared to control and present them fully here. 
Twenty‐one trials (1253 participants) provided moderate‐quality evidence for all major outcomes but stiffness (low quality). With the exception of withdrawals and adverse events, major outcome measures were self‐reported and expressed on a 0 to 100 scale (lower values are best, negative mean differences (MDs) indicate improvement; we used a clinically important difference between groups of 15% relative difference). Results for mixed exercise versus control show that mean HRQL was 56 and 49 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (13 studies; 610 participants) with absolute improvement of 7% (3% better to 11% better) and relative improvement of 12% (6% better to 18% better). Mean pain was 58.6 and 53 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (15 studies; 832 participants) with absolute improvement of 5% (1% better to 9% better) and relative improvement of 9% (3% better to 15% better). Mean fatigue was 72 and 59 points in the control and exercise groups, respectively (1 study; 493 participants) with absolute improvement of 13% (8% better to 18% better) and relative improvement of 18% (11% better to 24% better). Mean stiffness was 68 and 61 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (5 studies; 261 participants) with absolute improvement of 7% (1% better to 12% better) and relative improvement of 9% (1% better to 17% better). Mean physical function was 49 and 38 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (9 studies; 477 participants) with absolute improvement of 11% (7% better to 15% better) and relative improvement of 22% (14% better to 30% better). Pooled analysis resulted in a moderate‐quality risk ratio for all‐cause withdrawals with similar rates across groups (11 per 100 and 12 per 100 in the control and intervention groups, respectively) (19 studies; 1065 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.51) with an absolute change of 1% (3% fewer to 5% more) and a relative change of 11% (28% fewer to 47% more). Across all 21 studies, no injuries or other adverse events were reported; however some participants experienced increased fibromyalgia symptoms (pain, soreness, or tiredness) during or after exercise. However due to low event rates, we are uncertain of the precise risks with exercise. Mixed exercise may improve HRQL and physical function and may decrease pain and fatigue; all‐cause withdrawal was similar across groups, and mixed exercises may slightly reduce stiffness. For fatigue, physical function, HRQL, and stiffness, we cannot rule in or out a clinically relevant change, as the confidence intervals include both clinically important and unimportant effects. 
We found very low‐quality evidence on long‐term effects. In eight trials, HRQL, fatigue, and physical function improvement persisted at 6 to 52 or more weeks post intervention but improvements in stiffness and pain did not persist. Withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. 
It is uncertain whether mixed versus other non‐exercise or other exercise interventions improve HRQL and physical function or decrease symptoms because the quality of evidence was very low. The interventions were heterogeneous, and results were often based on small single studies. Adverse events with these interventions were not measured, and thus uncertainty surrounds the risk of adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared to control, moderate‐quality evidence indicates that mixed exercise probably improves HRQL, physical function, and fatigue, but this improvement may be small and clinically unimportant for some participants; physical function shows improvement in all participants. Withdrawal was similar across groups. Low‐quality evidence suggests that mixed exercise may slightly improve stiffness. Very low‐quality evidence indicates that we are 'uncertain' whether the long‐term effects of mixed exercise are maintained for all outcomes; all‐cause withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. Compared to other exercise or non‐exercise interventions, we are uncertain about the effects of mixed exercise because we found only very low‐quality evidence obtained from small, very heterogeneous trials. Although mixed exercise appears to be well tolerated (similar withdrawal rates across groups), evidence on adverse events is scarce, so we are uncertain about its safety. We downgraded the evidence from these trials due to imprecision (small trials), selection bias (e.g. allocation), blinding of participants and care providers or outcome assessors, and selective reporting. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Mixed Exercise Training for People with Fibromyalgia

## Plain Title
Does combining different types of exercise help people with fibromyalgia feel better?

## Rationale

**What is fibromyalgia?**
Fibromyalgia is a long-term health problem. It causes pain all over the body. People with fibromyalgia often feel very tired. They may feel stiff. Their muscles may hurt. These symptoms make daily life hard.

**What is mixed exercise?**
Mixed exercise means doing two or more types of exercise together. This can include:
- Aerobic exercise (like walking or swimming)
- Strength training (lifting weights)
- Stretching exercises

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Doctors often tell people with fibromyalgia to exercise. But researchers wanted to know if mixed exercise really helps. They wanted to see if it was better than doing nothing. They also wanted to see if it was safe.

**Why might mixed exercise help?**
Different types of exercise help the body in different ways. Aerobic exercise helps the heart and lungs. Strength training builds muscles. Stretching helps people move more easily. Combining these exercises might help more than doing just one type.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 29 studies done by other scientists. These studies included 2,088 people total. Almost all were women (98 out of 100). The average age was 51 years old. All had fibromyalgia.

**What did the studies compare?**
The studies compared mixed exercise to:
- No exercise (like being on a waiting list)
- Other treatments (like biofeedback)
- Other types of exercise

**How long did the studies last?**
The length of time varied across different studies. Some studies checked on people 6 to 52 weeks after they finished exercising.

## Results

**What did researchers measure?**
Researchers looked at several things:
- Quality of life (how well people felt overall)
- Pain levels
- Tiredness (fatigue)
- Stiffness
- Physical function (how well people could move and do daily tasks)
- How many people dropped out
- Side effects or injuries

**What were the main findings?**

The main results compared mixed exercise to doing no exercise. Researchers used a scale from 0 to 100. Lower numbers mean better results.

*Quality of life:* People who did mixed exercise scored 49 points. People who did no exercise scored 56 points. This means exercise helped by 7 points. This is a small improvement.

*Pain:* People who exercised had pain scores of 53. People who did not exercise scored 58.6. Exercise helped reduce pain by about 5 points. This is a small improvement.

*Tiredness:* People who exercised scored 59. People who did not exercise scored 72. Exercise helped reduce tiredness by 13 points. This is a meaningful improvement.

*Stiffness:* People who exercised scored 61. People who did not exercise scored 68. Exercise helped by 7 points. This is a small improvement.

*Physical function:* People who exercised scored 38. People who did not exercise scored 49. Exercise helped by 11 points. This improvement helps all people who exercise.

*Dropping out:* About 11 to 12 people out of 100 dropped out. This was the same in both groups.

*Side effects:* No serious injuries were reported. Some people felt more pain, soreness, or tiredness during or after exercise. But researchers did not track this carefully in most studies.

**Did the benefits last?**
Some benefits lasted 6 to 52 weeks after people stopped exercising. Quality of life, tiredness, and physical function stayed better. But pain and stiffness improvements did not last.

**What do the results mean?**
Mixed exercise probably helps people with fibromyalgia. It may improve quality of life and physical function. It may reduce pain, tiredness, and stiffness. The improvements are often small. But for physical function, all people showed improvement.

Mixed exercise seems safe. About the same number of people dropped out whether they exercised or not. But more research is needed on side effects.

**What are the limitations?**
Some studies had problems with how they were done. This makes the results less certain. More high-quality studies are needed. Researchers need to track side effects better.",10.1002-14651858.CD013340,"Mixed exercise programmes for adults with fibromyalgia
What is fibromyalgia and what is mixed exercise? 
Fibromyalgia is a condition causing chronic pain and soreness throughout the body. People with this condition often feel depressed, tired, and stiff, and have difficulty sleeping. Mixed exercise is defined as regular sessions of two or more types of exercise including aerobic (walking or cycling), strengthening (lifting weights or pulling against resistance bands), or flexibility (stretching) exercise. 
Study characteristics 
Reviewers searched for studies until December 2017, and found 29 studies (2088 people) conducted in 12 different countries. The average age of study participants was 51 years, and 98% were female. The average exercise programme was 14 weeks long with three sessions of 50 to 60 minutes per week. All exercise programmes were fully or partially supervised. Reviewers were most interested in comparing mixed exercise groups to control groups (19 studies; 1065 people). People in control groups either received no treatment or continued their usual care. 
Key results – mixed exercise vs control 
Each outcome below is measured on a scale that goes from 0 to 100, where lower scores are better. 
Health‐related quality of life (HRQL)  
After 5 to 26 weeks, people who exercised were 7% better (3% better to 11% better) or improved by 7 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their HRQL at 49 points.
People in the control group rated their HRQL at 56 points.
Pain  
After 5 to 26 weeks, people who exercised had 5% less pain (1% better to 9% better) or improved by 5 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their pain at 53 points.
People in the control group rated their pain at 58.6 points.
Tiredness  
After 14 to 24 weeks, people who exercised were 13% less tired (8% better to 18% better) or improved by 13 points on a 100 point scale 
People who exercised rated their tiredness at 59 points.
People in the control group rated their tiredness at 72 points.
Stiffness  
After 16 weeks, people who exercised were 7% less stiff (1% better 1 to 12% better) or improved by 7 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their stiffness at 61 points.
People in the control group rated their stiffness at 68 points.
Ability to do daily activities (physical function)  
After 8 to 24 weeks, people who exercised were 11% better (7% to 15%) or improved by 11 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their physical function at 38 points.
People in the control group rated their physical function at 49 points.
Harms ‐ Some participants experienced increased pain, soreness, or tiredness during or after exercise. Studies reported no injuries or other harms. However, reporting of harms was missing or incomplete in many studies. We are uncertain whether risk is increased with exercise. 
Leaving the study early – 11% of control participants left the study early compared with 12% of exercisers. 
Long‐term effects ‐ Analysis of long‐term effects of HRQL showed maintenance of mixed exercise effects at 6 to 12 weeks and at 13 to 26 weeks but not at 27 to 52 weeks. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that it is uncertain whether mixed exercises improve HRQL in the long term. Withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. 
Other ‐ Reviewers found no evidence that the benefits and harms of mixed exercise were any different from education programmes, cognitive‐behavioural training, biofeedback, medication, or other types of exercise. 
Conclusions and quality of evidence 
Mixed exercise may improve HRQL and the ability to do daily activities, may decrease pain and tiredness, and may be acceptable to individuals with fibromyalgia. Low‐quality evidence suggests that mixed exercise may slightly improve stiffness. When compared to other exercise or non‐exercise interventions, we are uncertain about the effects of mixed exercise. Although mixed exercise appears to be well tolerated (similar numbers of people leaving the study across groups), evidence on harms was scarce, so we are uncertain about its safety. Reviewers considered the quality of evidence to be low to moderate because of small numbers of people in the studies, some issues involving study design, and the low quality of results.

79,10.1002-14651858.CD012129.pub3-abstract.txt,"Background
Perineal trauma, due to spontaneous tears, surgical incision (episiotomy), or in association with operative vaginal birth, is common after vaginal birth, and is often associated with postpartum perineal pain. Birth over an intact perineum may also lead to perineal pain. There are adverse health consequences associated with perineal pain for the women and their babies in the short‐ and long‐term, and the pain may interfere with newborn care and the establishment of breastfeeding. Aspirin has been used in the management of postpartum perineal pain, and its effectiveness and safety should be assessed. This is an update of the review, last published in 2017. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of a single dose of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), including at different doses, in the relief of acute postpartum perineal pain. 
Search methods
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (4 October 2019), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (4 October 2019) and screened reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), assessing single dose aspirin compared with placebo, no treatment, a different dose of aspirin, or single dose paracetamol or acetaminophen, for women with perineal pain in the early postpartum period. We planned to include cluster‐RCTs, but none were identified. We excluded quasi‐RCTs and cross‐over studies. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included RCTs. Data were checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence for the main comparison (aspirin versus placebo) was assessed using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 17 RCTs, 16 of which randomised 1132 women to aspirin or placebo; one RCT did not report numbers of women. Two RCTs (of 16) did not contribute data to meta‐analyses. All women had perineal pain post‐episiotomy, and were not breastfeeding. Studies were published between 1967 and 1997, and the risk of bias was often unclear, due to poor reporting. 
We included four comparisons: aspirin versus placebo (15 RCTs); 300 mg versus 600 mg aspirin (1 RCT); 600 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (2 RCTs); and 300 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (1 RCT). 
Aspirin versus placebo 
Aspirin may result in more women reporting adequate pain relief four to eight hours after administration compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.69 to 2.42; 13 RCTs, 1001 women; low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether aspirin compared with placebo has an effect on the need for additional pain relief (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.37; 10 RCTs, 744 women; very low‐certainty evidence), or maternal adverse effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.06; 14 RCTs, 1067 women; very low‐certainty evidence), four to eight hours after administration. Analyses based on dose did not reveal any clear subgroup differences. 
300 mg versus 600 mg aspirin 
It is uncertain whether over four hours after administration, 300 mg compared with 600 mg aspirin has an effect on adequate pain relief (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.86; 1 RCT, 81 women) or the need for additional pain relief (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.88; 1 RCT, 81 women). There were no maternal adverse effects in either aspirin group. 
600 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin 
It is uncertain whether over four to eight hours after administration, 600 mg compared with 1200 mg aspirin has an effect on adequate pain relief (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.39; 2 RCTs, 121 women), the need for additional pain relief (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.68; 2 RCTs, 121 women), or maternal adverse effects (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52; 2 RCTs, 121 women). 
300 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin 
It is uncertain whether over four hours after administration, 300 mg compared with 1200 mg aspirin has an effect on adequate pain relief (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.32; 1 RCT, 80 women) or need for additional pain relief (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.18; 1 RCT, 80 women). There were no maternal adverse effects in either aspirin group. 
None of the included RCTs reported on neonatal adverse effects.
No RCTs reported on secondary review outcomes of: prolonged hospitalisation due to perineal pain; re‐hospitalisation due to perineal pain; fully breastfeeding at discharge; mixed feeding at discharge; fully breastfeeding at six weeks; mixed feeding at six weeks; perineal pain at six weeks; maternal views; or maternal postpartum depression. 
Authors' conclusions
Single dose aspirin may increase adequate pain relief in women with perineal pain post‐episiotomy compared with placebo. It is uncertain whether aspirin has an effect on the need for additional analgesia, or on maternal adverse effects, compared with placebo. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of study limitations (risk of bias), imprecision, and publication bias. 
Aspirin may be considered for use in non‐breastfeeding women with post‐episiotomy perineal pain. Included RCTs excluded breastfeeding women, so there was no evidence to assess the effects of aspirin on neonatal adverse effects or breastfeeding. 
Future RCTs should be designed to ensure low risk of bias, and address gaps in the evidence, such as the secondary outcomes established for this review. Current research has focused on women with post‐episiotomy pain; future RCTs could be extended to include women with perineal pain associated with spontaneous tears or operative birth. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using Aspirin for Pain Relief After Childbirth

## Plain Title
Does aspirin help relieve pain in the area between the vagina and anus after giving birth?

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
Many women feel pain in the perineum after giving birth. The perineum is the area between the vagina and anus. This pain can happen for several reasons:
- Natural tears during birth
- A cut made by the doctor (called an episiotomy)
- Using tools to help deliver the baby
- Even when the perineum does not tear

### Why is this a problem?
Perineal pain can cause problems for mothers and babies. The pain can make it hard for mothers to care for their newborns. It can also make breastfeeding difficult to start. These problems can last for a short time or a long time.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors sometimes give aspirin to help with perineal pain. Researchers needed to find out if aspirin really works. They also needed to know if aspirin is safe for mothers after birth.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to see if one dose of aspirin helps relieve perineal pain. They also wanted to know if different amounts of aspirin work better than others.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at 17 studies done by other scientists. These studies included 1,132 women total. The studies compared aspirin to fake pills (placebo). Some studies also compared different amounts of aspirin to each other.

### Who was in the studies?
All women in the studies:
- Had just given birth
- Had pain from an episiotomy (a surgical cut)
- Were not breastfeeding

### What did the studies compare?
The studies looked at four main comparisons:
- Aspirin versus fake pills (15 studies)
- 300 mg aspirin versus 600 mg aspirin (1 study)
- 600 mg aspirin versus 1200 mg aspirin (2 studies)
- 300 mg aspirin versus 1200 mg aspirin (1 study)

### When were these studies done?
The studies were published between 1967 and 1997. This means they are quite old.

## Results

### What did researchers find about aspirin versus fake pills?
Aspirin may help more women feel pain relief. About twice as many women felt adequate relief 4 to 8 hours after taking aspirin compared to fake pills.

However, researchers are not sure about other findings:
- Whether aspirin reduces the need for more pain medicine
- Whether aspirin causes side effects in mothers

The researchers could not be very certain about these results. This is because the old studies had problems with how they were done.

### What about different amounts of aspirin?
Researchers could not tell if different amounts of aspirin (300 mg, 600 mg, or 1200 mg) worked better than each other. The studies were too small to know for sure.

### What about side effects in babies?
None of the studies looked at side effects in babies. This is because all the women in the studies were not breastfeeding.

### What else did researchers want to know?
The studies did not report on many important things:
- Whether women stayed in the hospital longer due to pain
- Whether women needed to return to the hospital
- How breastfeeding was going
- Whether women still had pain 6 weeks later
- What women thought about their pain relief
- Whether women felt depressed after birth

### What do the results mean?
Aspirin might help women who have pain from an episiotomy. Doctors could consider giving aspirin to women who are not breastfeeding.

However, there is not enough information about:
- Women who are breastfeeding
- Whether aspirin is safe for babies
- Women with other types of perineal pain

### What is needed next?
Future studies should:
- Be better designed
- Include women who are breastfeeding
- Look at effects on babies
- Study women with different types of perineal tears
- Answer the questions that these old studies did not address

The evidence we have is limited and quite old. More research is needed to help doctors make the best choices for pain relief after childbirth.",10.1002-14651858.CD012129,"Aspirin (single dose) for relief of perineal pain after childbirth
What is the issue? 
Can aspirin be given to women who experience perineal pain following childbirth to relieve the pain, without causing side effects for either the women or their babies? 
Why is this important? 
Many women experience pain in the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus) following childbirth. The perineum may be bruised or torn during childbirth, or have a cut made to help the baby to be born (an episiotomy). After childbirth, perineal pain can interfere with women's ability to care for their newborns and establish breastfeeding. If perineal pain is not relieved effectively, longer‐term problems for women may include painful sexual intercourse, pelvic floor problems resulting in incontinence, prolapse, or chronic perineal pain. Aspirin may be given to women who have perineal pain after childbirth, but its effectiveness and safety had not been assessed in a systematic review. This is an update of a review last published in 2017. This is part of a series of reviews looking at drugs to help relieve perineal pain in first few weeks after childbirth. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in October 2019, and included 17 randomised controlled studies, involving 1132 women, published between 1967 and 1997. All women had perineal pain following an episiotomy (usually within 48 hours after birth), and were not breastfeeding. The women received either aspirin (doses ranging from 300 mg to 1200 mg) or fake pills (placebo), by mouth. The methodological quality of the studies was often unclear. Two studies did not contribute any data for analyses. 
Aspirin compared with placebo may increase adequate pain relief for mothers four to eight hours after administration (low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether aspirin compared with placebo has an effect on the need for additional pain relief, or on adverse effects for mothers, in the four to eight hours after administration (both very low‐certainty evidence). 
The effects of administering 300 mg versus 600 mg aspirin (1 study), 600 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (2 studies), or 300 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (1 study) are uncertain for adequate pain relief, the need for additional pain relief, or adverse effects for the mother. 
No studies reported on adverse effects of aspirin for the baby, or other outcomes we planned to assess: prolonged hospital stay, or readmission to hospital due to perineal pain; perineal pain six weeks after childbirth, women's views, or postpartum depression. 
What does this mean? 
A single dose of aspirin may help with perineal pain following episiotomy for women who are not breastfeeding, when measured four to eight hours after administration. 
We found no information to assess the effects of aspirin for women who are breastfeeding.

Governments and health systems are increasingly using mobile devices to communicate with patients and the public. Targeted digital client communication is when the health system transmits information to particular individuals or groups of people, based on their health or demographic status. Common types of targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or take their medicines. Other types include phone calls, interactive voice response, or multimedia messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. 
Objectives
To explore clients' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile devices on topics related to reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, or adolescent health (RMNCAH). 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (OvidSP), Embase (Ovid), World Health Organization Global Health Library, and POPLINE databases for eligible studies from inception to 3‐6 July 2017 dependant on the database (See appendix 2). 
Selection criteria
We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; that explored clients' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile device in the areas of RMNCAH; and were from any setting globally. 
Data collection and analysis
We used maximum variation purposive sampling for data synthesis, employing a three‐step sampling frame. We conducted a framework thematic analysis using the Supporting the Use of Research Evidence (SURE) framework as our starting point. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach. We used a matrix approach to explore whether potential implementation barriers identified in our synthesis had been addressed in the trials included in the related Cochrane Reviews of effectiveness. 
Main results
We included 35 studies, from a wide range of countries on six continents. Nineteen studies were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income settings and sixteen in high‐income settings. Some of the studies explored the views of people who had experienced the interventions, whereas others were hypothetical in nature, asking what people felt they would like from a digital health intervention. The studies covered a range of digital targeted client communication, for example medication or appointment reminders, prenatal health information, support for smoking cessation while pregnant, or general sexual health information. 
Our synthesis showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence). They also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence). 
However, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes. Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence). Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence). Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence). The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence). Language issues as well as skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence). 
Clients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were also concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence). Some clients suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence). 
Clients wanted messages at a time and frequency that was convenient for them (moderate confidence). They had preferences for different delivery channels (e.g. short message service (SMS) or interactive voice response) (moderate confidence). They also had preferences about message content, including new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (moderate confidence). Clients' views about who sent the digital health communication could influence their views of the programme (moderate confidence). 
For an overview of the findings and our confidence in the evidence, please see the 'Summary of qualitative findings' tables. 
Our matrix shows that many of the trials assessing these types of programmes did not try to address the problems we identified, although this may have been a reporting issue. 
Authors' conclusions
Our synthesis identified several factors that can influence the successful implementation of targeted client communication programmes using mobile devices. These include barriers to use that have equity implications. Programme planners should take these factors into account when designing and implementing programmes. Future trial authors also need to actively address these factors and to report their efforts in their trial publications.

## Plain Title
What Do People Think About Getting Health Messages on Their Mobile Phones?

## Rationale

**What is the health issue?**

Doctors and health systems now send health messages to people's phones. These messages can remind people about doctor visits or taking medicine. They can also give health tips and support.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to learn what people think about getting these phone messages. They wanted to know if people find them helpful. They also wanted to know what problems people have with these messages.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

The researchers looked at messages about pregnancy, babies, children, and teen health. They wanted to understand what works well and what does not work well.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers do this study?**

Researchers looked at 35 studies from around the world. These studies were from many different countries. Some countries were rich and some were poor.

The studies asked people about their thoughts and feelings. Some people had already received health messages on their phones. Other people were asked what they would want from phone messages.

The messages were about different health topics. Some reminded people to take medicine or go to appointments. Others gave tips about pregnancy or how to quit smoking. Some gave information about sexual health.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

People had mixed feelings about getting health messages on their phones.

**What people liked:**

Many people felt supported when they got messages. They felt like someone cared about them. People often shared the messages with family and friends.

**What problems people had:**

Many people faced barriers to using these programs:

- Some people had poor phone service or no internet access.
- Some people did not own a phone. Others lost their phone or it broke.
- Some people could not afford to pay for phone service.
- Some women and teens did not control their own phones. Other family members controlled the phones.
- The cost of messages was a problem. Many people said messages should be free.
- Some people had trouble reading or writing. Others did not know how to use their phones well.
- Language was sometimes a problem.

**Privacy concerns:**

People worried about privacy for sensitive health topics. These topics included HIV, birth control, and abortion. People did not want others to see their private health messages.

People suggested ways to fix privacy problems:
- Use simple language that does not reveal private information
- Let people choose when they get messages
- Let people choose how many messages they get

**What people wanted:**

- Messages at times that work for them
- The right number of messages (not too many)
- Different ways to get messages (like text or voice calls)
- Messages with new information, reminders, and helpful tips
- To know who is sending the messages

**What does this mean?**

The researchers found that phone health messages can help people. But there are many problems that need to be fixed.

People who create these programs need to think about these problems. They need to make sure everyone can use the programs. This includes people who are poor, who cannot read well, or who do not control their own phones.

The programs need to protect people's privacy. They need to be free or low cost. They need to work for people with different needs.

Many studies that test these programs did not report if they tried to fix these problems. Future studies need to address these issues and report what they did.

**Main conclusion:**

Phone health messages can help people feel supported and connected. But program creators must fix barriers that stop some people from using them. This will make the programs fair and helpful for everyone.",10.1002-14651858.CD013447,"What are clients' experiences and perceptions of receiving health information via their mobile phones? 
What is the aim of this synthesis? 
The aim of this Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore clients' views and experiences of being communicated with by the health system through their mobile phone. Our synthesis looked at communication about pregnancy, newborn, and child health, sexual health, and family planning. By synthesis we mean the bringing together and synthesising of results from primary qualitative studies into a larger whole. We collected all relevant studies and included 35 studies in the synthesis. 
This synthesis links to other Cochrane Reviews that assess the effectiveness of this type of targeted digital health communication. 
Key messages 
Many clients like receiving messages from the health services by mobile phone. However, some clients have problems receiving messages due to lack of network access, internet, or phone, or language, reading, or privacy issues. Clients' experiences are also influenced by message timing, frequency, content, and sender. 
What did we study in the synthesis? 
Governments and health systems are starting to use mobile phones to communicate with clients. When the information is targeted at particular people or groups of people, and when the health system decides when and what to communicate, this is called 'digital targeted client communication.' Common types of digital targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or to take their medicines. Other types include phone calls or video messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. 
We looked for studies of clients' views and experiences of targeted communication by mobile phone. We focused on communication with pregnant women and parents of young children, and with adults and teenagers about sexual health and family planning. 
What are the main findings of the synthesis? 
We included 35 studies from around the world. These studies showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed.

Why is it important to know whether someone has Helicobacter pylori? 
Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) is a type of bacteria which may be present in the stomach of some people. H pylori is believed to cause a number of cancers, including stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, and throat cancer. H pylori is also linked with other diseases including stomach ulcers, heart burn, and a bloated feeling. If H pylori is found in an individual, appropriate treatment can be started. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To compare the accuracy of three different types of test for H pylori. These are: urea breath tests, blood tests (the specific blood test is called serology), and stool tests (in faeces). 
What was studied in this review? 
There are two types of urea breath test which use two different forms of carbon known as 13C and 14C, as well as multiple versions of serology and stool tests. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 101 studies which included 11,003 people who were tested for H pylori. Of these 11,003 participants, 5839 (53.1%) had H pylori infection. All the studies used one of the three tests listed above and compared these test results with the diagnosis given by endoscopic biopsy. Endoscopic biopsy involves obtaining tissue from the stomach using a thin flexible tube introduced through the mouth and testing for the presence of H pylori under the microscope. It is currently the most accurate available test, however it causes physical discomfort to the patient, with associated risks for harm. This is in contrast to the alternative non‐invasive tests in this review which are significantly less uncomfortable and have minimal or no risk of harm, making them desirable alternatives if they can be shown to be as accurate at diagnosing H pylori as endoscopic biopsy. Most of the studies included participants with heart burn or similar problems in the stomach and excluded participants who had previously undergone partial removal of the stomach and those having treatment for H pylori. 
Thirty‐four studies (4242 participants) used serology; 29 studies (2988 participants) used stool antigen test; 34 studies (3139 participants) used urea breath test‐13C; 21 studies (1810 participants) used urea breath test‐14C; and two studies (127 participants) used urea breath test but did not report the type of carbon used. Studies varied in the limit they used before saying a test was positive for H pylori infection and the type of stains used to examine the biopsy material. When we looked at all the data we found that urea breath tests were more accurate than blood and stool tests. The results mean that, on average, if 1000 people are tested, there will be 46 people without H pylori who will be misdiagnosed as having H pylori. Also, there will be 30, 42, 86, and 89 people with H pylori infection for whom the diagnosis of H pylori infection will be missed by urea breath test‐13C, urea breath test‐14C, serology, and stool antigen test, respectively. When we looked at the seven studies which compared urea breath test‐13C and serology, or urea breath test‐13C and stool antigen tests in the same participants, the results were uncertain and we cannot tell which test is more accurate. 
How reliable are the results of the studies? 
Except for one study, all the studies were of poor methodological quality, which makes their results unreliable. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
These results apply to children and adults with suspected H pylori infection, but only in those who have not previously undergone stomach operations and those who have not recently had antibiotics or treatment for H pylori infection. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Urea breath tests, blood tests, and stool tests may be suitable for identifying whether someone has H pylori infection. However, the level of the result of urea breath test, blood test, or stool test which should be used to make a diagnosis of H pylori infection remains unclear.

## Plain Title
Comparing Three Simple Tests to Find a Stomach Germ Called H. pylori

## Rationale

### What is H. pylori and why does it matter?

H. pylori is a type of germ that lives in some people's stomachs. This germ can cause serious health problems. It may lead to stomach cancer and other cancers. It can also cause stomach ulcers, heartburn, and bloating.

Finding H. pylori early is important. When doctors know someone has this germ, they can give treatment to get rid of it. This helps prevent future health problems.

### Why was this study needed?

Doctors have several ways to test for H. pylori. The most accurate test uses a thin tube with a camera. The tube goes down through the mouth into the stomach. Doctors take a small piece of stomach tissue. They look at it under a microscope to find the germ.

This tube test is very accurate. But it is uncomfortable for patients. It can also cause harm in some cases.

Doctors wanted to know if simpler tests work just as well. These simpler tests do not cause discomfort. They have little or no risk of harm. The three simple tests are:
- Breath tests (called urea breath tests)
- Blood tests
- Stool tests (testing poop)

This study looked at how well these three simple tests find H. pylori. Researchers wanted to see which test works best.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

Researchers looked at 101 studies done by other scientists. These studies included 11,003 people total. About half of these people (5,839 people) had H. pylori.

All people in these studies took at least one of the three simple tests. They also had the tube test. Researchers compared the simple test results to the tube test results.

### Who was in these studies?

Most people in the studies had heartburn or stomach problems. The studies did not include people who:
- Had part of their stomach removed before
- Were already getting treatment for H. pylori

The studies included both children and adults.

### What types of tests were studied?

The breath test has two types. One uses a form of carbon called 13C. The other uses 14C. Both work the same way. The person drinks a special liquid. Then they breathe into a bag. Doctors test the breath for signs of H. pylori.

Different versions of blood tests and stool tests were also studied.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

The breath tests worked better than blood tests and stool tests. Both types of breath tests (13C and 14C) were more accurate.

### What do these results mean?

Imagine 1,000 people take these tests. Here is what would happen:

**False positives** (test says you have H. pylori but you don't):
- About 46 people would get this wrong result from any of the tests

**Missed cases** (test says you don't have H. pylori but you do):
- 13C breath test would miss 30 people
- 14C breath test would miss 42 people
- Blood test would miss 86 people
- Stool test would miss 89 people

This means breath tests miss fewer cases than the other tests.

### What was unclear?

Seven studies tested the same people with different tests. These studies compared breath tests to blood tests or stool tests. The results from these studies were not clear. Researchers could not tell for sure which test was better.

### How reliable were the studies?

Almost all studies had problems with how they were done. This makes the results less reliable. More high-quality studies are needed.

### What do doctors conclude?

All three types of simple tests may help find H. pylori. Breath tests appear to work best. But doctors still need to learn more. They need to know what test result level means someone truly has H. pylori.

These simple tests work for most children and adults. But they should not be used for people who:
- Had stomach surgery before
- Recently took antibiotics
- Recently had H. pylori treatment

### When was this research done?

Targeted therapies directed at specific driver oncogenes have improved outcomes for individuals with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 5% of lung adenocarcinomas, the most common histologic subtype of NSCLC, harbour rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene leading to constitutive activity of the ALK kinase. Crizotinib was the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) demonstrated to be effective in advanced NSCLC. Next‐generation ALK TKIs have since been developed including ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib, and have been compared with crizotinib or chemotherapy in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). These ALK‐targeted therapies are currently used in clinical practice and are endorsed in multiple clinical oncology guidelines. 
Objectives
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALK inhibitors given as monotherapy to treat advanced ALK‐rearranged NSCLC. 
Search methods
We conducted electronic searches in the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched conference proceedings from the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), and International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) World Conference on Lung Cancer, as well as the reference lists of retrieved articles. All searches were conducted from 2007 until 7 January 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing ALK inhibitors with cytotoxic chemotherapy or another ALK inhibitor in individuals with incurable locally advanced or metastatic pathologically confirmed ALK‐rearranged NSCLC. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, extracted study characteristics and outcome data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for each included study. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Primary outcomes were progression‐free survival (PFS) and adverse events (AE); secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), OS at one year, overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) criteria, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). We performed a meta‐analysis for all outcomes, where appropriate, using the fixed‐effect model. We reported hazard ratios (HR) for PFS, OS, and a composite HRQoL of life outcome (time to deterioration), and risk ratios (RR) for AE, ORR, and one‐year OS. We presented 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and used the I² statistic to investigate heterogeneity. We planned comparisons of 'ALK inhibitor versus chemotherapy' and 'next‐generation ALK inhibitor versus crizotinib’ with subgroup analysis by type of ALK inhibitor, line of treatment, and baseline central nervous system involvement. 
Main results
Eleven studies (2874 participants) met our inclusion criteria: six studies compared an ALK inhibitor (crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib) to chemotherapy, and five studies compared a next‐generation ALK inhibitor (alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib) to crizotinib. We assessed the evidence for most outcomes as of moderate to high certainty. Most studies were at low risk for selection, attrition, and reporting bias; however, no RCTs were blinded, resulting in a high risk of performance and detection bias for outcomes reliant on subjective measurement. 
ALK inhibitor versus chemotherapy 
Treatment with ALK inhibitors resulted in a large increase in PFS compared to chemotherapy (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.52, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, high‐certainty evidence). This was found regardless of line of treatment. 
ALK inhibitors may result in no difference in overall AE rate when compared to chemotherapy (RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.03, 5 RCTs, 1404 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
ALK inhibitors slightly improved OS (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, high‐certainty evidence), despite most included studies having a significant number of participants crossing over from chemotherapy to receive an ALK inhibitor after the study period. 
ALK inhibitors likely increase ORR (RR 2.43, 95% CI 2.16 to 2.75, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) including in measurable baseline brain metastases (RR 4.88, 95% CI 2.18 to 10.95, 3 RCTs, 108 participants) when compared to chemotherapy. ALK inhibitors result in a large increase in the HRQoL measure, time to deterioration (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.60, 5 RCTs, 1504 participants, high‐certainty evidence) when compared to chemotherapy. 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitor versus crizotinib 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors resulted in a large increase in PFS (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.46, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, high‐certainty evidence), particularly in participants with baseline brain metastases. 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors likely result in no difference in overall AE (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) when compared to crizotinib. 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors likely increase OS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and slightly increase ORR (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.25, 5 RCTs, 1229 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) including a response in measurable brain metastases (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.54, 4 RCTs, 138 participants) when compared to crizotinib. 
Studies comparing ALK inhibitors were conducted exclusively or partly in the first‐line setting. 
Authors' conclusions
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors including alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib are the preferred first systemic treatment for individuals with advanced ALK‐rearranged NSCLC. Further trials are ongoing including investigation of first‐line ensartinib. Next‐generation inhibitors have not been compared to each other, and it is unknown which should be used first and what subsequent treatment sequence is optimal. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Targeted Drugs for Advanced Lung Cancer with ALK Gene Changes

## Plain Title

How well do ALK inhibitor drugs work for people with advanced lung cancer that has a specific gene change?

## Rationale

**What is the health condition being studied?**

Lung cancer is a serious disease. The most common type is called non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. About 5 out of every 100 people with this type of lung cancer have a change in a gene called ALK. This gene change makes cancer cells grow and spread.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors now have special drugs called ALK inhibitors that target this gene change. The first drug was crizotinib. Newer drugs have been made since then. These include ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know how well these ALK inhibitor drugs work. They wanted to compare them to standard chemotherapy. They also wanted to compare newer ALK inhibitors to crizotinib. The goal was to find out which treatments work best and are safest for patients.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of 11 different studies. These studies included 2,874 people total. All participants had advanced lung cancer that could not be cured. All had the ALK gene change.

**What did the studies compare?**

Six studies compared ALK inhibitor drugs to chemotherapy. Five studies compared newer ALK inhibitors to crizotinib.

**Who was in the studies?**

All participants had lung cancer that had spread. Their cancer had the ALK gene change. The studies included both men and women. Some people had cancer that had spread to the brain.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time varied by study. Researchers looked at studies done from 2007 to January 2021.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers found important differences between treatments.

**ALK inhibitors compared to chemotherapy:**

ALK inhibitors worked much better than chemotherapy at stopping cancer from getting worse. People taking ALK inhibitors went longer before their cancer grew. This was true whether it was their first treatment or a later treatment.

ALK inhibitors helped people live longer overall. This happened even though many people who started on chemotherapy later switched to an ALK inhibitor.

More people responded to ALK inhibitors than to chemotherapy. About twice as many people saw their tumors shrink. For people with cancer in the brain, almost 5 times as many responded to ALK inhibitors.

People taking ALK inhibitors had better quality of life. They went longer before their symptoms got worse.

Side effects were about the same for both treatments.

**Newer ALK inhibitors compared to crizotinib:**

Newer ALK inhibitors worked much better than crizotinib. Cancer took longer to get worse with newer drugs. This was especially true for people with cancer in the brain.

People taking newer ALK inhibitors lived longer overall. More people responded to newer drugs. Their tumors were more likely to shrink.

For brain tumors, newer drugs worked much better. More than twice as many people with brain cancer responded.

Side effects were about the same for both types of drugs.

**What do these results mean?**

Newer ALK inhibitors like alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib should be the first treatment for people with advanced lung cancer that has the ALK gene change. These drugs work better than both chemotherapy and crizotinib.

**What questions remain?**

The newer ALK inhibitors have not been compared to each other. Doctors do not yet know which newer drug is best. They also do not know the best order to use these drugs if one stops working.

More studies are being done to answer these questions.",10.1002-14651858.CD013453,"Targeted treatment of non‐small cell lung cancer with an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene mutation 
Background 
The most common type of lung cancer is non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). About 5% of NSCLC will be driven by a gene mutation known as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Targeted treatments for those with advanced (not curable) ALK‐mutated NSCLC cancer have been developed and found to be more effective than chemotherapy. The first ALK inhibitor to be developed was crizotinib. Newer ALK‐targeted drugs have also been developed and include ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib. In this review we looked at treatments that target ALK‐mutated NSCLC to find out how well they work. 
Objectives  
The primary objective of this review was to find out whether people with ALK‐mutated NSCLC given treatments targeted towards ALK live longer without recurrence and have fewer side effects than those treated with chemotherapy. We also planned to evaluate whether newer ALK‐targeted drugs achieve this better than crizotinib.  
Study characteristics 
We searched the main medical databases and records of conferences up to 7 January 2021. We found 11 studies (2874 participants): six studies compared an ALK‐targeted drug to chemotherapy, and five studies compared a newer ALK‐targeted drug to crizotinib. The studies were conducted in people with advanced ALK‐mutated NSCLC using these drugs as their first or later treatment. A total of five different ALK inhibitors were used across studies: alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, and lorlatinib. 
Results 
People treated with ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those on chemotherapy. These improvements were also seen in people with cancer that had spread to the brain. People receiving ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer overall, even when some had received chemotherapy first. ALK‐targeted drugs cause a similar number of side effects as chemotherapy. ALK‐targeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size and resulted in a longer time until worsening of symptoms when compared to chemotherapy.  
People treated with newer ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those receiving crizotinib, including in people with cancer involving the brain. People treated with newer ALK‐targeted drugs as first treatment were likely to live longer overall with a similar number of overall side effects. Newer ALK‐targeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size when compared to crizotinib. 
The evidence for most reported measures was of moderate or high certainty.
Conclusions 
The best first treatment for people with incurable ALK‐mutated lung cancer is a newer ALK inhibitor such as alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, or lorlatinib. More studies are needed to determine which of these options is best and what treatment should be used when the cancer grows after these medicines have been given.

83,10.1002-14651858.CD013163.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Conventionally used soybean oil‐based lipid emulsion (S‐LE) have high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and phytosterols that may contribute to adverse effects in preterm infants. The newer lipid emulsions (LE) from different lipid sources are currently available for use in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To compare the safety and efficacy of all LE for parenteral nutrition (PN) in preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation) including preterm infants with surgical conditions or parenteral nutrition‐associated liver disease (PNALD)/cholestasis using direct comparisons and pair‐wise meta‐analyses. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to 18 June 2018), Embase (1974 to 18 July 2018), CINAHL (1982 to 18 June 2018), MIDRIS (1971 to 31 May 2018), conference proceedings, trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO's Trials Registry and Platform), and reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled studies in preterm infants with or without surgical conditions or PNALD within the first six months of life. 
Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis conformed to the methods of Cochrane Neonatal. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence for important outcomes in addition to reporting statistical significance of results. 
Main results
We included 29 studies (n = 2037) in this review. LE were classified in three broad groups: 1. all fish oil‐containing LE including pure fish oil‐LE (F‐LE) and multisource LE (e.g. medium‐chain triglycerides (MCT)‐olive‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (MOFS‐LE), MCT‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (MFS‐LE) and olive‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (OFS‐LE); 2. conventional S‐LE; 3. alternative‐LE (e.g. MCT‐soybean oil‐LE (MS‐LE), olive‐soybean oil‐LE and borage oil‐based LE). 
We considered the following broad comparisons: fish oil LE versus non‐fish oil LE; fish oil LE versus another fish oil LE; alternative‐LE versus S‐LE; alternative‐LE versus another alternative‐LE in preterm infants less than 37 weeks' gestation, preterm infants with surgical conditions and preterm infants with PNALD/cholestasis. Separate subgroup comparisons of each LE preparation were included within these broader groups. 
Most studies in preterm infants used PN for mean duration of four weeks or less and for longer duration in infants with cholestasis or surgical conditions. 
We defined the primary outcome of PNALD/cholestasis as conjugated bilirubin (Cbil) 2 mg/dL or greater and resolution of PNALD/cholestasis as Cbil less than 2 mg/dL. There was heterogeneity in definitions used by the included studies with Cbil cut‐offs ranging from 17.1 μmol/L (1 mg/dL) up to 50 μmol/L (about 3 mg/dL). 
In preterm infants, meta‐analysis found no evidence of a difference in the incidence of PNALD/cholestasis (Cbil cut‐off: 2 mg/dl) between fish oil‐LEs and all non‐fish oil LEs (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 1.56; typical risk difference (RD) –0.03, 95% CI –0.08 to 0.02; 4 studies; n = 328; low‐quality evidence). 
We also considered an outcome allowing for any definition of PNALD (different Cbil cutoffs). In the meta‐analysis for PNALD/cholestasis, using any definition and restricted to low or unclear risk of bias studies, there was no evidence of a difference between fish oil LE and all non‐fish oil LE for incidence of cholestasis (typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.21; typical RD –0.02, 95% CI –0.05 to 0.02; 10 studies; n = 1024; low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of difference in subgroup meta‐analyses of individual LE types in any comparison. 
In preterm infants with surgical conditions or cholestasis, there was only one small study each reporting no evidence of a difference in incidence or resolution of cholestasis respectively with use of a pure F‐LE versus S‐LE (using a Cbil cut‐off of 2 mg/dL). 
In preterm infants with PNALD/cholestasis (using any definition), the meta‐analysis showed significantly less cholestasis with the use of fish oil‐LE compared to S‐LE (typical RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.91; typical RD –0.39, 95% CI –0.65 to –0.12; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3, 95% CI 2 to 9; 2 studies; n = 40; very low‐quality evidence). However, this outcome had a very low number of participants from two small studies with methodological differences, one of which was terminated early, increasing the uncertainty about effect estimates. 
There were no differences between LE types in pair‐wise meta‐analyses for growth in preterm infants. There was paucity of studies in preterm infants with surgical conditions or cholestasis to perform meta‐analyses for growth and most other outcomes. 
In the secondary outcomes for preterm infants, there was no difference between fish‐oil LE and non‐fish oil LE in meta‐analysis for severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (stage 3 or greater, or requiring surgery: typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.16; typical RD –0.03, 95% CI –0.07 to 0.02; 7 studies; n = 731; very low‐quality evidence). There were no differences in the LE types in pair‐wise meta‐analyses for death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), ventilation duration, patent ductus arteriosus, sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, jaundice, hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, intrahepatocellular lipid content and conjugated bilirubin levels in any comparison. 
In surgical infants, one study (n = 19) reported no differences in death, sepsis rates, Cbil and neurodevelopmental outcomes with pure F‐LE versus S‐LE. 
In infants with cholestasis, there were no evidence of differences in death or sepsis in meta‐analyses between fish oil‐LE and S‐LE; (2 studies; n = 40; very low‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
In the current review, we did not find any particular LE with or without fish oil to be better than another LE in preterm infants for prevention of PNALD/cholestasis, growth, mortality, ROP, BPD and other neonatal outcomes. 
In preterm infants with surgical conditions or cholestasis, there is currently insufficient evidence from randomised studies to determine with any certainty if fish oil LEs offer advantage in prevention or resolution of cholestasis or in any other clinical outcome. 
Further research, with larger well‐designed trials, is warranted to evaluate the ideal composition of LE in preterm infants and the role of fish oil‐containing and other LEs in the prevention and resolution of PNALD, ROP and other clinical outcomes. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Types of Fat Solutions Given Through a Vein to Premature Babies

## Plain Title

Comparing Different Fat Solutions for Feeding Premature Babies Through a Vein

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some premature babies cannot eat normally. They need food given through a vein. This is called parenteral nutrition. Fat is an important part of this food.

**What is the current treatment?**

Doctors usually give fat solutions made from soybean oil. However, soybean oil has substances that may harm premature babies. These substances can cause liver problems. The liver helps clean the blood and digest food.

**Why was this study needed?**

Newer fat solutions are now available. Some contain fish oil. Others use different oil sources. Doctors need to know which fat solution works best. They want to prevent liver problems. They also want to help babies grow well.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to compare different fat solutions. They looked at which ones were safest. They checked which ones worked best for premature babies.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 29 studies. These studies included 2,037 premature babies. The babies were born before 37 weeks of pregnancy.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included three groups of babies:
- Premature babies getting food through a vein
- Premature babies who needed surgery
- Premature babies with liver problems from parenteral nutrition

**What did researchers compare?**

They compared three main types of fat solutions:

1. Fish oil solutions (pure fish oil or mixed with other oils)
2. Standard soybean oil solutions
3. Other alternative oil solutions

**How long did the studies last?**

Most babies received the fat solutions for four weeks or less. Babies with liver problems or surgery received them longer.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers measured several things:
- Liver problems (shown by high bilirubin levels in blood)
- How well babies grew
- Death rates
- Eye problems
- Lung problems
- Infections
- Other health issues

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**For premature babies without liver problems:**

Researchers found no clear winner among fat solutions. Fish oil solutions did not work better than other solutions for:
- Preventing liver problems
- Helping babies grow
- Preventing death
- Preventing eye problems
- Preventing lung problems
- Preventing infections

**For premature babies with liver problems:**

Only two small studies looked at this group. These studies suggested fish oil solutions might help. About 2 out of 3 babies improved with fish oil. Only 1 out of 3 babies improved with soybean oil.

However, these studies were very small. The results are uncertain. More research is needed.

**For premature babies needing surgery:**

Only one small study looked at this group. It found no differences between fat solutions.

**What do the results mean?**

No single fat solution proved clearly better than others. All solutions seemed similarly safe for most premature babies.

The evidence quality was low or very low. This means researchers are not very confident about the results.

**What are the conclusions?**

Current evidence does not show that one fat solution is better than another. This applies to preventing liver problems and other health issues in premature babies.

For babies with existing liver problems, fish oil solutions might help. But the evidence is too weak to be certain.

**What happens next?**

Larger, better-designed studies are needed. These studies should test:
- Which fat solution works best for premature babies
- Whether fish oil helps prevent or treat liver problems
- Whether certain fat solutions prevent eye problems
- Long-term effects on baby health

Doctors should continue monitoring premature babies carefully. They should watch for liver problems regardless of which fat solution they use.",10.1002-14651858.CD013163,"Systematic review of lipid emulsions for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants.
Review question: which lipid (fat) emulsions (LE) have the best outcomes in preterm infants with and without liver disease and surgical conditions? 
Background: preterm infants who need nutrition (feeding) through intravenous (into a vein; called parenteral nutrition) lines have been conventionally given pure soybean oil‐based fat emulsions. However, high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and phytosterols in pure soybean oil‐based emulsions may be harmful and contribute to parenteral nutrition‐associated liver disease (PNALD). The newer lipid emulsions (LE) from alternative lipid sources, including fish oil, may potentially improve clinical outcomes in preterm infants by decreasing PUFA content and providing lipid source‐specific benefits. 
Study characteristics: we searched the medical literature and identified 29 studies (including 2037 preterm infants). The evidence is up to date as of 18 June 2018. 
Key findings: in the population of preterm infants, without liver disease or surgical conditions, no particular LE was better than another for growth, liver disease, death, retinopathy (eye disease), infection and chronic lung disease. 
While there was very low quality and limited evidence to suggest that fish oil‐based LE may improve liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease, this evidence was based on a limited number of infants from two small studies, one of which was terminated early, and no certain conclusions can be drawn. 
Conclusions: based on this review, no particular LE is better than another for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants. There currently exists insufficient evidence from well‐designed studies about the benefit of fish oil‐LE for improving liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease or surgical conditions. Further research is required to establish the role of fish oil‐LE for liver disease outcomes in preterm infants and the ideal composition of LE for preterm infants.

Dialysis treatments weigh heavily on patients' physical and psychosocial health. Multiple studies have assessed the potential for exercise training to improve outcomes in adults undergoing dialysis. However, uncertainties exist in its relevance and sustainable benefits for patient‐important outcomes. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and safety of regular structured exercise training in adults undergoing dialysis on patient‐important outcomes including death, cardiovascular events, fatigue, functional capacity, pain, and depression. We also aimed to define the optimal prescription of exercise in adults undergoing dialysis. 
Search methods
In this update, we conducted a systematic search of the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 23 December 2020. The Register includes studies identified from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov as well as kidney‐related journals and the proceedings of major kidney conferences. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of any structured exercise programs of eight weeks or more in adults undergoing maintenance dialysis compared to no exercise or sham exercise. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the search results for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Whenever appropriate, we performed random‐effects meta‐analyses of the mean difference in outcomes. The primary outcomes were death (any cause), cardiovascular events and fatigue. Secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), depression, pain, functional capacity, blood pressure, adherence to the exercise program, and intervention‐related adverse events. 
Main results
We identified 89 studies involving 4291 randomised participants, of which 77 studies (3846 participants) contributed to the meta‐analyses. Seven studies included adults undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Fifty‐six studies reported aerobic exercise interventions, 21 resistance exercise interventions and 19 combined aerobic and resistance training within the same study arm. The interventions lasted from eight weeks to two years and most often took place thrice weekly during dialysis treatments. A single study reported death and no study reported long‐term cardiovascular events. Five studies directly assessed fatigue, 46 reported HRQoL and 16 reported fatigue or pain through their assessment of HRQoL. Thirty‐five studies assessed functional capacity, and 21 reported resting peripheral blood pressure. Twelve studies reported adherence to exercise sessions, and nine reported exercise‐related adverse events. Overall, the quality of the included studies was low and blinding of the participants was generally not feasible due to the nature of the intervention. 
Exercise had uncertain effects on death, cardiovascular events, and the mental component of HRQoL due to the very low certainty of evidence. Compared with sham or no exercise, exercise training for two to 12 months may improve fatigue in adults undergoing dialysis, however, a meta‐analysis could not be conducted. Any exercise training for two to 12 months may improve the physical component of HRQoL (17 studies, 656 participants: MD 4.12, 95% CI 1.88 to 6.37 points on 100 points‐scale; I² = 49%; low certainty evidence). Any exercise training for two to 12 months probably improves depressive symptoms (10 studies, 441 participants: SMD ‐0.65, 95% CI ‐1.07 to ‐0.22; I² = 77%; moderate certainty evidence) and the magnitude of the effect may be greater when maintaining the exercise beyond four months (6 studies, 311 participants: SMD ‐0.30, 95% CI 0.14 to ‐0.74; I² = 71%). Any exercise training for three to 12 months may improve pain (15 studies, 872 participants: MD 5.28 95% CI ‐0.12 to 10.69 points on 100 points‐scale; I² = 63%: low certainty evidence) however, the 95% CI indicates that exercise training may make little or no difference in the level of pain. Any exercise training for two to six months probably improves functional capacity as it increased the distance reached during six minutes of walking (19 studies, 827 participants: MD 49.91 metres, 95% CI 37.22 to 62.59; I² = 34%; moderate certainty evidence) and the number of sit‐to‐stand cycles performed in 30 seconds (MD 2.33 cycles, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.96; moderate certainty evidence). There was insufficient evidence to assess the safety of exercise training for adults undergoing maintenance dialysis. The results were similar for aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and a combination of both aerobic and resistance exercise. 
Authors' conclusions
It is uncertain whether exercise training improves death, cardiovascular events, or the mental component of HRQoL in adults undergoing maintenance dialysis. Exercise training probably improves depressive symptoms, particularly when the intervention is maintained beyond four months. Exercise training is also likely to improve functional capacity. Low certainty evidence suggested that exercise training may improve fatigue, the physical component of quality of life, and pain. The safety of exercise training for adults undergoing dialysis remains uncertain. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Exercise Training for Adults on Dialysis

## Plain Title
Does regular exercise help people who are on dialysis?

## Rationale

**What is dialysis and why is it hard for patients?**

Some people have kidneys that do not work well. These people need dialysis. Dialysis is a treatment that cleans the blood. It does the work that healthy kidneys would do. People on dialysis often feel very tired. They may feel sad or have pain. Their daily life can be hard.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Doctors wanted to know if exercise could help people on dialysis feel better. Exercise might help people have more energy. It might help them feel less sad or in less pain. Exercise might also help them do daily tasks more easily.

**Why might exercise help?**

Exercise can make the body stronger. It can help the heart work better. It can also help people feel happier. Researchers wanted to see if these benefits would help people on dialysis too.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 89 different studies. These studies included 4,291 adults on dialysis. The researchers combined the results from all these studies.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included adults on dialysis. Most people were on a type of dialysis called hemodialysis. Some people were on a type called peritoneal dialysis. Both men and women were in the studies.

**What did people in the studies do?**

Some people did exercise. Some people did not exercise. The researchers compared these two groups. The exercise programs lasted at least eight weeks. Some lasted up to two years. Most people exercised three times each week. Many people exercised during their dialysis treatment.

**What types of exercise did people do?**

Some people did aerobic exercise. This means exercise that makes the heart beat faster. Examples are walking or cycling. Some people did resistance exercise. This means exercise that makes muscles stronger. Examples are lifting weights. Some people did both types of exercise.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found that exercise probably helps in several ways:

**Feeling less sad:** Exercise probably helps people feel less sad or depressed. This benefit may be greater when people exercise for more than four months.

**Doing daily tasks better:** Exercise probably helps people move and function better. People who exercised could walk farther in six minutes. They could also stand up and sit down more times in 30 seconds.

**Feeling less tired:** Exercise may help reduce tiredness. However, only a few studies looked at this.

**Better quality of life:** Exercise may improve how people feel about their physical health. People who exercised felt better about what their body could do.

**Less pain:** Exercise may help reduce pain. However, the results were not completely clear.

**What was unclear?**

The researchers could not tell if exercise helps people live longer. They also could not tell if exercise prevents heart problems. Not enough studies looked at these outcomes. The researchers also could not tell if exercise is completely safe. Not enough studies reported if people got hurt during exercise.

**What do these results mean?**

Exercise training is likely helpful for adults on dialysis. It probably helps them feel less sad. It probably helps them move better and do daily tasks. Exercise may also help with tiredness, physical well-being, and pain. More research is needed to know if exercise helps people live longer. More research is also needed to know if exercise is safe for everyone on dialysis.

What is the issue? 
People undergoing dialysis treatments are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and depression, have a lower quality of life and limited survival than the general population. Furthermore, many people undergoing dialysis have difficulty performing daily activities because they lack the physical capacity and strength to do so. Multiple trials have assessed the potential for exercise training to improve the condition of adults undergoing dialysis, but no consensus has been reached. 
What did we do? 
We searched the medical literature for all randomised trials that assessed structured exercise programs in people undergoing dialysis. We then assessed the quality of those studies and combined their results to draw conclusions regarding the effect of exercise training to improve aspects of physical and mental health that are important to patients undergoing dialysis. 
What did we find? 
We found 89 studies involving 4291 participants. The exercise training programs lasted from eight weeks to two years and most often took place three times a week during the dialysis treatment. We could not determine the impact of exercise training on death, cardiovascular events (such as a heart attack) or mental well‐being. Moderate certainty evidence suggested that exercise training of any type is likely to improve depressive symptoms in adults undergoing dialysis, particularly when the exercise was maintained for longer than four months. Moderate quality evidence also suggested that exercise training may improve people's capacity to perform activities and tasks through the improvement of their capacity to walk and the strength and endurance of their legs. Exercise training may also improve fatigue and the physical aspects of quality of life, but the quality of the evidence was low. We could not conclude on the effect of exercise training on a person's mental well‐being. 
ConclusionsExercise training for people undergoing maintenance dialysis is likely to improve depression and their capacity to perform activities and tasks. Exercise training may also improve fatigue and pain sightly. Exercise training may improve the physical aspects of quality of life, but it is unclear whether it improves a person's mental well‐being. It is unclear whether exercise training reduces the number of deaths or cardiovascular events.

The review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of botulinum toxin type A (BtA) compared to botulinum toxin type B (BtB) in people with involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia. This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review and we assessed the effectiveness (reduction in severity, disability and pain) and safety of BtA versus BtB in cervical dystonia. 
Background 
Cervical dystonia, also called spasmodic torticollis, is a disease that causes undesired, uncontrollable, often painful, abnormal placement of the head. It is a relatively uncommon condition (affecting 57 to 280 people per million) that can be very disabling and can affect a person's quality of life negatively. In most cases the cause is unknown and no cure exists. Since cervical dystonia is normally a long‐term disease it requires long‐term treatment. 
Botulinum toxin (Bt) is a powerful, natural chemical that can cause severe paralysis (an inability to move in the part of the body where it is applied) in animals and humans. It can also be used to treat many conditions, in particular those with involuntary muscle contractions, such as cervical dystonia. Bt is delivered by injections into the muscles that contract to produce the disease. There are different types of Bt, not all are available for treating health conditions. BtA is typically the first‐used treatment in cervical dystonia, but botulinum toxin type B (BtB) is an alternative option. The relative strength of each Bt formulation is variable, and the cost for 200 units varies from GBP 198 to GBP 308. 
Study characteristics 
We performed a rigorous search of the medical literature in October 2016 and found three studies that compared a single treatment session of BtA with BtB. These studies included a total of 270 participants, with on average a moderate disease impairment. The participants remained in the studies for a short period of time ‐ between 16 and 20 weeks after the treatment. The average age of people in the studies was 53.3 years, and they had had cervical dystonia for an average of 6.6 to 7.9 years before taking part in the trials. Most, 63.3%, of the people in the studies were women. All three of the studies were funded by drug manufacturers with possible interests in the results of the studies. 
Key results 
The results show little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the main measures of overall improvement and safety, including the total number of adverse (unwanted or harmful) events. There was also little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the self‐evaluations reported by the study participants. Based on the results we would expect that, out of 1000 people with cervical dystonia treated with BtB, there would be 362 more people who experience dry mouth/sore throat compared to 1000 people treated with BtA. The studies which looked at the duration of effect showed little or no difference between BtA and BtB. None of the studies examined the impact of either Bt on quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
All of the studies included participants that were different to the average person who suffers from cervical dystonia. To be included participants had to have a history of successful treatment with Bt. People with certain types of cervical dystonia, in particular the forms that make the head turn backward or forward, were not allowed to participate in the studies. 
Not enough participants were included across the studies for us to be completely confident in the results for the total number of adverse events, the self‐reported evaluations by participants or the pain assessment. 
The quality of the evidence for overall improvement and total number of adverse events was low. The quality of the evidence for more sore throat/dry mouth in people receiving BtB is moderate. The quality of the evidence where participants gave their self‐assessments is low. 
No definite conclusions can be drawn regarding overall safety and long‐term utility of BtA compared to BtB in cervical dystonia.

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Types of Botulinum Toxin for Treating Twisted Neck (Cervical Dystonia)

## Rationale

**What is cervical dystonia?**
Cervical dystonia is a condition where the neck muscles tighten on their own. This causes the head to twist or turn into odd positions. People cannot control these movements. The condition often causes pain. It can make daily life very hard.

About 57 to 280 people out of every million have this condition. Doctors usually do not know what causes it. There is no cure. Most people have this condition for life. This means they need treatment for many years.

**Why was this study needed?**
Botulinum toxin is a strong natural substance. Doctors inject it into tight muscles. The toxin helps the muscles relax. This can reduce the unwanted head movements.

There are different types of botulinum toxin. Type A (called BtA) is usually tried first. Type B (called BtB) is another choice. Doctors wanted to know which type works better. They also wanted to know which type is safer.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to compare BtA and BtB. They looked at how well each type reduced symptoms. They checked how safe each type was. They wanted to help doctors choose the best treatment for their patients.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at three studies done by other scientists. They combined the results from all three studies. This is called a review.

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included 270 people total. The average age was 53 years. Most people (63 out of 100) were women. People had cervical dystonia for about 7 to 8 years before joining. Most people had moderate symptoms.

**What happened in the studies?**
Each person got one treatment session. Some people got BtA injections. Other people got BtB injections. Doctors watched the patients for 16 to 20 weeks. This is about 4 to 5 months.

**Important notes about the studies:**
All studies only included certain types of patients. People had to have good results from botulinum toxin before. People whose heads tilted far forward or backward could not join. Drug companies paid for all three studies.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

The two types of botulinum toxin worked about the same. There was little difference in how well they helped patients. Both types seemed equally safe overall.

**Dry mouth and sore throat:**
One clear difference was found. People who got BtB had more dry mouth and sore throat. Out of 1,000 people treated with BtB, about 362 more would have this problem. This compares to 1,000 people treated with BtA.

**How long did the treatment work?**
Both types seemed to work for about the same amount of time.

**What was not studied?**
None of the studies looked at quality of life. Researchers do not know if one type helps people feel better in their daily lives.

**How strong is this evidence?**
The evidence quality was low to moderate. This means we cannot be completely sure about the results. The studies did not include enough people. The studies only included certain types of patients. Real-world patients might be different.

**What do these results mean?**

Doctors cannot say for sure which type is better. Both BtA and BtB seem to help about the same amount. BtB causes more dry mouth and sore throat. Doctors and patients should discuss which type to use. More research is needed with more people and longer follow-up time.

The studies were short. They only lasted 4 to 5 months. Cervical dystonia is a lifelong condition. We need studies that last longer. This would show if one type works better over many years.",10.1002-14651858.CD004314,"A comparison of botulinum toxin type A versus botulinum toxin type B for involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia

The tendency for authors to submit, and of journals to accept, manuscripts for publication based on the direction or strength of the study findings has been termed publication bias. 
Objectives
To assess the extent to which publication of a cohort of clinical trials is influenced by the statistical significance, perceived importance, or direction of their results. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Methodology Register (The Cochrane Library [Online] Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to March Week 2 2007), EMBASE (1980 to Week 11 2007) and Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (March 21 2007). We also searched the Science Citation Index (April 2007), checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted researchers to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Studies containing analyses of the association between publication and the statistical significance or direction of the results (trial findings), for a cohort of registered clinical trials. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data. We classified findings as either positive (defined as results classified by the investigators as statistically significant (P < 0.05), or perceived as striking or important, or showing a positive direction of effect) or negative (findings that were not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05), or perceived as unimportant, or showing a negative or null direction in effect). We extracted information on other potential risk factors for failure to publish, when these data were available. 
Main results
Five studies were included. Trials with positive findings were more likely to be published than trials with negative or null findings (odds ratio 3.90; 95% confidence interval 2.68 to 5.68). This corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.78 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.95), assuming that 41% of negative trials are published (the median among the included studies, range = 11% to 85%). In absolute terms, this means that if 41% of negative trials are published, we would expect that 73% of positive trials would be published. 
Two studies assessed time to publication and showed that trials with positive findings tended to be published after four to five years compared to those with negative findings, which were published after six to eight years. Three studies found no statistically significant association between sample size and publication. One study found no significant association between either funding mechanism, investigator rank, or sex and publication. 
Authors' conclusions
Trials with positive findings are published more often, and more quickly, than trials with negative findings. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Studies with positive results get published more often and faster than studies with negative results

## Rationale

**What is publication bias?**
When scientists do medical studies, they write up their findings and send them to journals to be published. Publication bias happens when studies are more likely to get published based on what the results show, rather than how well the study was done.

**Why is this a problem?**
If only studies with positive results get published, doctors and patients may not see the full picture. They might think a treatment works better than it really does. This can lead to poor choices about which treatments to use.

**What did the researchers want to find out?**
The researchers wanted to see if studies with positive results really do get published more often than studies with negative or unclear results. They also wanted to know if positive studies get published faster.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors and patients need to see all study results, both good and bad, to make the best choices about treatments. If publication bias exists, it needs to be measured and understood so we can fix the problem.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a typical medical study with patients. Instead, the researchers looked at other published studies to find patterns.

They searched medical databases for studies that tracked groups of clinical trials from start to finish. They wanted to see which trials got published and which did not.

**What did they look for?**
They looked for studies that followed registered clinical trials over time. They checked whether trials with positive results (showing a treatment worked) were published more often than trials with negative results (showing a treatment did not work or had no clear effect).

**How many studies did they include?**
The researchers found five studies that met their requirements. These five studies tracked many clinical trials over several years.

## Results

**What were the main results?**
Studies with positive findings were much more likely to get published. For every 10 negative studies that got published, about 17 positive studies got published. 

In simpler terms: if 41 out of 100 negative studies got published, then 73 out of 100 positive studies got published. This is a big difference.

**How fast did studies get published?**
Studies with positive results got published faster. Positive studies were published after 4 to 5 years. Negative studies took 6 to 8 years to get published.

**What else did they find?**
The size of the study did not seem to matter. Big studies and small studies had similar chances of getting published.

Who paid for the study, the rank of the researcher, and whether the researcher was male or female did not affect publication rates.

**What does this mean for patients and doctors?**
When doctors look for information about treatments, they may be seeing mostly positive results. The negative results often stay hidden. This means treatments may look better than they really are.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
Publication bias is real and significant. Trials showing positive results are published more often and more quickly than trials showing negative or unclear results.

This creates an unfair picture of how well treatments work. To make good treatment choices, doctors and patients need to see all results, not just the positive ones.

**Why does this matter?**
This study helps us understand a serious problem in medical research. Knowing about publication bias is the first step toward fixing it. Some solutions might include requiring all studies to be registered and reported, regardless of their results.",10.1002-14651858.MR000006,"Publication bias in clinical trials due to statistical significance or direction of trial results 
The validity of a systematic review depends on the methods used to conduct the review. If there is a systematic bias, such that studies with statistically significant or positive findings are more likely to be published and included in systematic reviews than trials with non‐significant findings, then the validity of a review's conclusions can be threatened. 
This methodology review identified five studies that investigated the extent to which the publication of clinical trials (such as those approved by an ethics review board) is influenced by the statistical significance or direction of a trial's results. These studies showed that trials with positive findings (defined either as those that were statistically significant (P < 0.05), or those findings perceived to be important or striking, or those indicating a positive direction of treatment effect), had nearly four times the odds of being published compared to findings that were not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05), or perceived as unimportant, or showing a negative or null direction of treatment effect. This corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.78 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.95), assuming that 41% of negative trials are published.Two studies found that trials with positive findings also tended to be published more quickly than trials with negative findings. The size of the trial (assessed in three studies) and the source of funding, academic rank, and sex of the principal investigator (assessed in one study) did not appear to influence whether a trial was published. 
These results provide support for mandating that clinical trials are registered before recruiting participants so that review authors know about all potentially eligible studies, regardless of their findings. Those carrying out systematic reviews should ensure they assess the potential problems of publication bias in their review and consider methods for addressing this issue by ensuring a comprehensive search for both published and unpublished trials.

Aflatoxins are carcinogenic mycotoxins that contaminate many food crops. Maize and groundnuts are prone to aflatoxin contamination, and are the major sources of human exposure to aflatoxins, due to their high intake as staple foods, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). Observational studies suggest an association between dietary exposure to aflatoxins during pregnancy and early childhood and linear growth in infants and young children. 
Objectives
To assess the effects on pre‐ and postnatal growth outcomes when agricultural and nutritional education interventions during the post‐harvest period that aim to reduce aflatoxin exposure are compared to usual support or no intervention. We assessed this in infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women at the household or community level in LMICs. 
Search methods
In July and August 2019, we searched: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, Africa‐Wide, LILACS, CAB Abstracts, Agricola, and two trials registers. We also checked the bibliographies of the included studies and contacted relevant mycotoxin organisations and researchers for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs of agricultural education and nutritional education interventions of any duration, at the household or community level, aimed at reducing aflatoxin intake by infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women, in LMICs during the post‐harvest period, compared to no intervention or usual support. We excluded studies that followed participants for less than four weeks. We assessed prespecified prenatal (at birth) and postnatal growth outcomes (during infancy, childhood, and adolescence), with linear growth (as the primary outcome), infectious disease morbidity, and unintended consequences. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed study eligibility using prespecified criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included RCTs. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE, and presented the main results in a 'Summary of findings' table. 
Main results
We included three recent cluster‐RCTs reporting the effects of agricultural education plus post‐harvest technologies, compared to usual agricultural support or no intervention. The participants were pregnant women and their children, lactating women and their infants (< 6 months), women of childbearing age, and young children (< 59 months), from rural, subsistence maize‐farming communities in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. 
Two trials randomised villages to the intervention and control groups, including a total of at least 979 mother‐child pairs from 60 villages. The third trial randomised 420 households, including 189 mother‐child pairs and 231 women of childbearing age. Duration of the intervention and follow‐up ranged between five and nine months. Due to risk of attrition bias, the overall risk of bias was unclear in one trial, and high in the other two trials. 
None of the included studies addressed the effects of nutritional education on pre‐ and postnatal growth. 
One trial reported outcomes not prespecified in our review, and we were unable to obtain unpublished growth data from the second trial, even after contacting the authors. The third trial, in lactating women and their infants in Tanzania, reported on the infants' weight‐for‐age z‐score (WAZ) after six months. This trial found that providing agricultural education aimed at changing farmers' post‐harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure, by using demonstrations (e.g. handsorting, de‐hulling of maize, drying sheets, and insecticides), may improve WAZ in infants from these farmers' households, on average, by 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.98; 1 study; 249 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), compared to infants from households where the farmers received routine agricultural extension services. 
Another way of reporting the effect on WAZ is to compare the proportion of underweight infants (WAZ > 2 SD below the reference median value) per group. This trial found that the intervention may reduce the proportion of underweight infants in the intervention households by 6.7% (95% CI ‐12.6 to ‐1.4; 249 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) compared to control households. 
No studies reported on unintended effects of agricultural and nutritional education.
Authors' conclusions
Evidence on the effects on child growth in LMICs of agricultural or nutritional education interventions that reduce aflatoxin exposure was very limited; no included study reported on linear growth. Very low‐certainty evidence suggested that agricultural education aimed at changing farmers' post‐harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure by using demonstrations, may result in an increase in WAZ, when compared to usual or no education.

## Plain Title
Can Teaching Farmers Better Ways to Handle Crops After Harvest Help Children Grow Better by Reducing Harmful Toxins in Food?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Some foods like corn and peanuts can grow harmful toxins called aflatoxins. These toxins are made by mold that grows on crops. Aflatoxins can cause cancer and other health problems.

Many families in poorer countries eat corn and peanuts as their main foods. This means people in these areas may eat aflatoxins often. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children are at special risk.

Some studies show that when pregnant women and young children eat foods with aflatoxins, it may affect how well children grow. Children may not grow as tall or gain weight as they should.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers wanted to know if teaching farmers better ways to handle crops after harvest could help. The goal was to reduce aflatoxins in food. If families ate less aflatoxins, children might grow better.

The researchers looked for studies that tested this idea. They wanted to see if education programs really helped children grow.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study this?
The researchers searched for studies done in poorer countries. They looked for studies that:
- Taught farmers or families how to reduce aflatoxins in food
- Focused on the time after crops are harvested
- Measured how well children grew

They found three studies from Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. All three studies were done in rural farming areas where families grow corn as their main crop.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included:
- Pregnant women and their babies
- Nursing mothers and their infants (under 6 months old)
- Women who could have children
- Young children (under 5 years old)

The studies included about 1,400 people total. They lived in 60 villages or 420 households.

### What did the studies test?
The studies taught farmers better ways to handle corn after harvest. Teachers showed farmers how to:
- Sort corn by hand to remove bad pieces
- Remove corn hulls
- Use drying sheets
- Use bug spray to keep insects away

Some farmers got this special teaching. Other farmers got regular farming advice or no special help.

The studies lasted 5 to 9 months.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers could only use results from one study. This study was done in Tanzania with nursing mothers and their babies.

The study measured baby weight after 6 months. Babies whose families got the special teaching about handling corn weighed more than other babies. The difference was small but may be important.

The study also looked at how many babies were underweight. Fewer babies were underweight in families that got the special teaching. About 7 fewer babies out of every 100 were underweight.

### What does this mean?
Teaching farmers better ways to handle corn after harvest may help babies gain more weight. This could mean the babies ate less aflatoxins.

However, the researchers say this evidence is very uncertain. Only one small study showed this result. More research is needed to be sure.

### What was missing?
None of the studies measured how tall children grew. This was the main thing researchers wanted to know.

The studies did not test teaching families about nutrition. They only tested teaching about farming.

The studies did not report any bad effects from the teaching programs.

### What do we still need to know?
We need more and better studies to know if these programs really help children grow. Future studies should measure child height and follow families for longer times.",10.1002-14651858.CD013376,"Reducing aflatoxin intake with agricultural and nutritional education to improve growth of infants and children in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
Review question 
Does providing agricultural and nutritional education about how to reduce the intake of aflatoxins (from contaminated food crops) in households and communities in low and middle‐income countries (LMICs) improve the growth of infants and children compared to usual or no education? 
Background 
Aflatoxins are toxins produced by moulds that contaminate food crops. Maize and groundnuts are the major dietary sources of aflatoxins, as they are eaten in large amounts by many people living in LMICs. Some research from LMICs suggests that there may be a link between aflatoxin intake during pregnancy and early childhood, and growth in infants and young children. 
Study Characteristics 
We included three trials, conducted in pregnant and breastfeeding women (1168 mother‐child pairs), women of childbearing age (N = 231), and infants and young children (< 59 months old), from rural, subsistence maize‐farming communities in Kenya, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. One trial in Tanzania, at unclear risk of bias overall, provided data for this review, since one trial did not report any outcomes relevant to this review, and we were unable to obtain unpublished growth data for another, even after contacting the study authors. 
The trial, conducted in breastfeeding women and their babies, studied the effects of agricultural education (demonstrations to change farmers' practices after harvesting their maize crops to reduce aflatoxins (for example, by handsorting and de‐hulling the maize, using drying sheets and insecticides) on the babies' weight, standardised for age (weight‐for‐age z‐score (WAZ)), after six months (the z‐score measures the difference between these babies and the median of a population of similar babies). Farmers in the control group received routine services from agriculture extension workers. 
Key results 
Very low‐certainty evidence from one trial suggested that the WAZ of 128 children from farmers' households who received agricultural education may improve by a z‐score of 0.57, compared to 121 children from households where farmers only received routine services. This means that a baby girl in the intervention group, with a healthy weight, would gain about 450 to 690 grams more weight between three to nine months, compared to a baby girl in the control group. This is a meaningful difference. 
Another way of measuring the effect is to compare the proportion of underweight infants (WAZ ≥ 2 standard deviations below the reference median value) per group, after the intervention. In this case, agricultural education may reduce the proportion of underweight children, on average, by 6.7% (very low‐certainty evidence), compared to routine services. 
None of the included studies addressed the effects of nutritional education on length of height, or on unintended effects of agricultural or nutritional education. 
Evidence about the effects on child growth of agricultural or nutritional education interventions that reduce aflatoxin exposure in LMICs was very limited. Data from one trial suggested that agricultural education, aimed at changing farmers' post‐harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure, may result in the babies' increased weight‐for‐age, compared to usual or no education. 
The literature was searched to August 2019.
Quality of the evidence 
We have very little confidence in the results. The true effect may be substantially different.

Plasmodium vivax (P vivax) is a focus of malaria elimination. It is important because P vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection are co‐endemic in some areas. There are asymptomatic carriers of P vivax, and the treatment for P vivax and Plasmodium ovale malaria differs from that used in other types of malaria. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) will help distinguish P vivax from other malaria species to help treatment and elimination. There are RDTs available that detect P vivax parasitaemia through the detection of P vivax‐specific lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) antigens. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for detecting P vivax malaria infection in people living in malaria‐endemic areas who present to ambulatory healthcare facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria; and to identify which types and brands of commercial tests best detect P vivax malaria. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases up to 30 July 2019: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S), both in the Web of Science. 
Selection criteria
Studies comparing RDTs with a reference standard (microscopy or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) in blood samples from patients attending ambulatory health facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria in P vivax‐endemic areas. 
Data collection and analysis
For each included study, two review authors independently extracted data using a pre‐piloted data extraction form. The methodological quality of the studies were assessed using a tailored Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 (QUADAS‐2) tool. We grouped studies according to commercial brand of the RDT and performed meta‐analysis when appropriate. The results given by the index tests were based on the antibody affinity (referred to as the strength of the bond between an antibody and an antigen) and avidity (referred to as the strength of the overall bond between a multivalent antibody and multiple antigens). All analyses were stratified by the type of reference standard. The bivariate model was used to estimate the pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), this model was simplified when studies were few. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 10 studies that assessed the accuracy of six different RDT brands (CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test, Falcivax Device Rapid test, Immuno‐Rapid Malaria Pf/Pv test, SD Bioline Malaria Ag Pf/Pv test, OnSite Pf/Pv test and Test Malaria Pf/Pv rapid test) for detecting P vivax malaria. One study directly compared the accuracy of two RDT brands. Of the 10 studies, six used microscopy, one used PCR, two used both microscopy and PCR separately and one used microscopy corrected by PCR as the reference standard. Four of the studies were conducted in Ethiopia, two in India, and one each in Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia and Sudan. 
The studies often did not report how patients were selected. In the patient selection domain, we judged the risk of bias as unclear for nine studies. We judged all studies to be of unclear applicability concern. In the index test domain, we judged most studies to be at low risk of bias, but we judged nine studies to be of unclear applicability concern. There was poor reporting on lot testing, how the RDTs were stored, and background parasitaemia density (a key variable determining diagnostic accuracy of RDTs). Only half of the included studies were judged to be at low risk of bias in the reference standard domain, Studies often did not report whether the results of the reference standard could classify the target condition or whether investigators knew the results of the RDT when interpreting the results of the reference standard. All 10 studies were judged to be at low risk of bias in the flow and timing domain. 
Only two brands were evaluated by more than one study. Four studies evaluated the CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test against microscopy and two studies evaluated the Falcivax Device Rapid test against microscopy. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 99% (95% CI 94% to 100%; 251 patients, moderate‐certainty evidence) and 99% (95% CI 99% to 100%; 2147 patients, moderate‐certainty evidence) for CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test. 
For a prevalence of 20%, about 206 people will have a positive CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test result and the remaining 794 people will have a negative result. Of the 206 people with positive results, eight will be incorrect (false positives), and of the 794 people with a negative result, two would be incorrect (false negative). 
For the Falcivax Device Rapid test, the pooled sensitivity was 77% (95% CI: 53% to 91%, 89 patients, low‐certainty evidence) and the pooled specificity was 99% (95% CI: 98% to 100%, 621 patients, moderate‐certainty evidence), respectively. For a prevalence of 20%, about 162 people will have a positive Falcivax Device Rapid test result and the remaining 838 people will have a negative result. Of the 162 people with positive results, eight will be incorrect (false positives), and of the 838 people with a negative result, 46 would be incorrect (false negative). 
Authors' conclusions
The CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test was found to be highly sensitive and specific in comparison to microscopy for detecting P vivax in ambulatory healthcare in endemic settings, with moderate‐certainty evidence. The number of studies included in this review was limited to 10 studies and we were able to estimate the accuracy of 2 out of 6 RDT brands included, the CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test and the Falcivax Device Rapid test. Thus, the differences in sensitivity and specificity between all the RDT brands could not be assessed. More high‐quality studies in endemic field settings are needed to assess and compare the accuracy of RDTs designed to detect P vivax.

## Plain Title
How Well Do Rapid Tests Detect Vivax Malaria in People with Symptoms?

## Rationale

**What is vivax malaria?**
Malaria is a disease spread by mosquitoes. There are different types of malaria. One type is called vivax malaria. It is caused by a germ called *Plasmodium vivax*.

**Why is this important?**
Vivax malaria is found in many parts of the world. It often occurs in the same places as another type of malaria called falciparum malaria. Some people carry vivax malaria germs but feel fine. They have no symptoms. Vivax malaria needs different treatment than other types of malaria. Doctors need to know which type of malaria a person has. This helps them give the right treatment.

**What are rapid tests?**
Rapid tests are quick tests done with a drop of blood. They can show results in about 15 to 20 minutes. These tests look for special markers made by malaria germs. For vivax malaria, the tests look for a marker called LDH.

**Why was this study needed?**
Health workers need fast and accurate tests. This helps them treat patients correctly. It also helps stop malaria from spreading. Researchers wanted to know how well rapid tests work for vivax malaria. They wanted to find out which test brands work best.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a single study. Researchers looked at 10 different studies done by other scientists. They combined the results from all these studies.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included people who:
- Lived in areas where malaria is common
- Went to health clinics with symptoms that could be malaria
- Had symptoms like fever, chills, or headache

The studies were done in six countries. These were Ethiopia, India, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, and Sudan.

**What did researchers compare?**
Researchers compared rapid tests to other methods. The other methods were:
- Looking at blood under a microscope
- Using a lab test called PCR

These methods are more accurate but take longer. They are called reference standards.

**What rapid tests were studied?**
The studies looked at six different brands of rapid tests. The most studied brands were:
- CareStart Malaria test (4 studies)
- Falcivax Device Rapid test (2 studies)

## Results

**What did the study find?**

**CareStart Malaria test:**
This test worked very well. Out of 100 people with vivax malaria, the test found 99 people correctly. It missed only 1 person. Out of 100 people without vivax malaria, the test correctly said 99 people did not have it. It gave wrong results for only 1 person.

Here is another way to understand this: Imagine 1,000 people get tested. About 200 have vivax malaria. The CareStart test would find 198 of these 200 people. It would miss 2 people. Of the 800 people without malaria, it would correctly identify 792. It would wrongly say 8 people have malaria when they do not.

**Falcivax Device Rapid test:**
This test did not work as well. Out of 100 people with vivax malaria, it found only 77 people. It missed 23 people. However, it was good at identifying people without malaria. Out of 100 people without vivax malaria, it correctly identified 99 people.

Using the same example: Of 1,000 people tested, the Falcivax test would find 154 of the 200 people with malaria. It would miss 46 people. Of the 800 people without malaria, it would correctly identify 792. It would wrongly say 8 people have malaria.

**What does this mean?**
The CareStart test is very accurate for detecting vivax malaria. Doctors can trust its results. The Falcivax test misses too many people who have malaria. This could be dangerous because these people would not get treatment.

**What are the limitations?**
Only 10 studies were available. Only 2 test brands had enough studies to compare. More research is needed to test other brands. Some studies did not clearly explain how they chose patients. Some did not report important details about how tests were stored.

**Conclusions:**
The CareStart Malaria test works very well for detecting vivax malaria in people with symptoms. Health workers can use it with confidence. More studies are needed to test other rapid test brands.",10.1002-14651858.CD013218,"Rapid tests for diagnosing malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax in people living in areas where malaria is very common 
What is the aim of the review? 
Malaria infection is caused mainly by two species of malaria parasite: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The aim of this review was to evaluate rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to diagnose P vivax infection. 
Why are rapid tests for P vivax malaria important? 
For clinical management, knowing which parasite species is causing the malaria is important as the drug treatments differ. For P vivax infection, an additional drug is required to eliminate the infection from the liver. For public health control of malaria, we know that P falciparum is declining over the previous 15 years, and infections from P vivax have therefore increased in importance. 
What was studied in this review? 
RDTs provide results quickly and are often as a dipstick. We studied RDTs that specifically test for P vivax malaria. RDTs are simple to use, point‐of‐care tests. They are suitable for use in rural settings by primary healthcare workers, using drop of blood on the dipstick that causes colour change and a distinct line that indicates a positive test result. Healthcare workers in rural areas can perform RDTs for P vivax without needing a laboratory or special equipment. We wanted to find out which brands of RDTs were the most accurate for diagnosing P vivax malaria. We compared the new tests against the standard form of diagnosis with microscopy, and also more recent methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR): a molecular method to identify P vivax DNA in blood samples. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We included 10 studies that looked at the accuracy of six diagnostic test brands for detecting P vivax malaria in people with suspected malaria symptoms. The studies were conducted in Ethiopia (four studies), India (two studies) and Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, and Sudan (one study each). 
Compared with microscopy, the Care Start Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test performed well with 99% sensitivity and specificity (four studies). This means that: 
• for every 100 people tested who have P vivax malaria, one person will have a negative test result, and might not receive the right treatment soon enough; 
• for every 100 people tested who do not have P vivax malaria, one will have a positive result, and might receive unnecessary treatment. 
Compared with microscopy, the Falcivax Device Rapid test had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 99% (two studies). This means that: 
• For every 100 people tested who have P vivax malaria, 23 people will have a negative test result; and, 
• for every 100 people tested who do not have P vivax malaria, one person will have a positive result. 
We are moderately confident (certain) in the accuracy results for the Care Start Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test. The results are from a small number of studies (four), so our findings may change when results from further studies become available. 
We are less confident in the accuracy results for the Falcivax Device Rapid test, because these came from only two studies. Our findings for this test will probably change when results from further studies become available. 
Our results are based on a small number of studies, so we could not reliably assess all six brands of antibody test or compare their accuracy. Most studies included in this review had limitations: it was not clear how people were selected for testing, or how the study results were assessed and checked, which could have affected the results. Some rapid antibody tests were investigated by only one study. Some studies did not report clearly how common P malaria was in the area where the study was done. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies published up to 30 July 2019.

Inability to communicate in a manner that can be understood causes extreme distress for people requiring an artificial airway and has implications for care quality and patient safety. Options for aided communication include non‐vocal, speech‐generating, and voice‐enabling aids. 
Objectives
To assess effectiveness of communication aids for people requiring an artificial airway (endotracheal or tracheostomy tube), defined as the proportion of people able to: use a non‐vocal communication aid to communicate at least one symptom, need, or preference; or use a voice‐enabling communication aid to phonate to produce at least one intelligible word. 
To assess time to communication/phonation; perceptions of communication; communication quality/success; quality of life; psychological distress; length of stay and costs; and adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (Wiley version), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), three other databases, and grey literature from inception to 30 July 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs, controlled non‐randomised parallel group, and before‐after studies evaluating communication aids used in adults with an artificial airway. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 11 studies (1931 participants) conducted in intensive care units (ICUs). Eight evaluated non‐vocal communication aids and three voice‐enabling aids. Usual care was the comparator for all. For six studies, this comprised no aid; usual care in the remaining five studies comprised use of various communication aids. 
Overall, our confidence in results regarding effectiveness of communication interventions was very low due to imprecision, measurement heterogeneity, inconsistency in results, and most studies at high or unclear risk of bias across multiple domains. 
No non‐vocal aid studies reported our primary outcome. We are uncertain of the effects of early use of a voice‐enabling aid compared to routine use on ability to phonate at least one intelligible word (risk ratio (RR) 3.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 50.08; 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Compared to usual care without aids, we are uncertain about effects of a non‐vocal aid (communication board) on patient satisfaction (standardised mean difference (SMD) 2.92, 95% CI 1.52 to 4.33; 4 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No studies of non‐vocal aids reported quality of life. Low‐certainty evidence from two studies suggests early use of a voice‐enabling aid may have no effect on quality of life (MD 2.27, 95% CI –7.21 to 11.75). Conceptual differences in measures of psychological distress precluded data pooling; however, intervention arm participants reported less distress suggesting there might be benefit, but our certainty in the evidence is very low. 
Low‐certainty evidence suggest voice‐enabling aids have little or no effect on ICU length of stay; we were unable to determine effects of non‐vocal aids. Three studies reported different adverse events (physical restraint use, bleeding following tracheostomy, and respiratory parameters indicating respiratory decompensation). Adverse event rates were similar between arms in all three studies. However, uncertainty remains as to any harm associated with communication aids. 
Authors' conclusions
Due to a lack of high‐quality studies, imprecision, inconsistency of results, and measurement heterogeneity,  the evidence provides insufficient information to guide practice as to which communication aid is more appropriate and when to use them. Understanding effectiveness of communication aids would benefit from development of a core outcome measurement set. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Communication Aids for People with Breathing Tubes

## Plain Title
Do communication aids help people who have breathing tubes in their throat to communicate better?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Some people need a breathing tube placed in their throat to help them breathe. These tubes are called artificial airways. The tubes can go through the mouth or through a small opening in the neck.

People with these tubes cannot speak normally. This makes them very upset and worried. They cannot tell doctors and nurses what they need or how they feel. This can make their care less safe.

### What are communication aids?
Communication aids are tools that help people communicate without speaking. There are two main types:
- Non-vocal aids: These include picture boards and writing tools. People point or write to share their needs.
- Voice-enabling aids: These are special devices that let people make sounds or words even with a breathing tube in place.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers wanted to find out if these communication aids actually help. They wanted to know which aids work best. They also wanted to know when to use them. This information could help doctors and nurses choose the right tools for their patients.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked for all studies that tested communication aids in adults with breathing tubes. They searched medical databases up to July 2020. They found 11 studies to review.

### Who was in these studies?
All studies included adults who had breathing tubes. These people were in intensive care units (ICUs). ICUs are hospital areas for very sick patients. The studies included 1,931 people in total.

### What did the studies test?
Eight studies tested non-vocal aids like picture boards. Three studies tested voice-enabling devices. All studies compared these aids to usual care. In some studies, usual care meant no aids at all. In other studies, usual care meant using various simple communication tools.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

The researchers could not be certain about most results. This was because:
- The studies had problems with how they were done
- The studies measured things in different ways
- The studies showed different results from each other
- Most studies were small

### Main findings about communication ability:
The researchers could not tell if voice-enabling aids help people speak at least one clear word. The evidence was too uncertain.

Studies of non-vocal aids did not measure if people could communicate at least one symptom or need.

### Main findings about patient satisfaction:
Patients might be more satisfied when using picture boards compared to no aids. However, the researchers were very uncertain about this finding.

### Main findings about quality of life:
Studies did not measure quality of life for non-vocal aids. For voice-enabling aids, early use probably makes little or no difference to quality of life.

### Main findings about distress:
People using communication aids might feel less distressed. However, the researchers were very uncertain about this finding.

### Main findings about length of hospital stay:
Voice-enabling aids probably make little or no difference to how long people stay in the ICU.

### Main findings about safety:
Three studies looked at harmful effects. These included use of physical restraints, bleeding, and breathing problems. Harmful effects happened at similar rates whether people used aids or not. However, researchers still do not know for certain if these aids are completely safe.

### What do these results mean?
The evidence does not give clear answers about which communication aids work best. The evidence does not tell us when to use them. More high-quality studies are needed. These studies should measure outcomes in the same way. This would help doctors and nurses choose the best communication tools for their patients.

**Word count: 617**",10.1002-14651858.CD013379,"Strategies to help adults with a breathing tube to communicate
What is the issue? 
Patients needing a machine to support breathing cannot speak due to a tube delivering gas to the lungs bypassing their voice box. Patients mouth words, gesture, and use facial expressions. However, these are very difficult to understand. Weakened muscles and difficulty concentrating, which are common in critical illness, makes using aids such as writing equipment or communication boards difficult. Consistent evidence on which communication aids are effective is lacking. 
Why is this important? 
Difficulty communicating places people at increased risk of harm, causes distress to patients and family, and causes stress for healthcare staff. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies (to 30 July 2020) exploring aids used to help people with a breathing tube to communicate. We found 11 studies involving 1931 participants admitted to intensive care units. We also looked for studies involving people needing a breathing tube and living at home or in long‐term care, but found none. Eight studies used communication boards or apps. Three studies used aids that help a patient to speak with the breathing tube in place. All studies compared the communication aid to routine communication practices. For six studies, routine practice did not include use of any type of communication aid. For the remaining five studies, usual care comprised a range of communication aids routinely used in the participating intensive care units including a communication board, paper notepad, and routine timing of the use of speech aids. We are unsure about whether the early use of aids to help with speaking may increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood or shorten the time to be able to speak. The evidence was of very low quality. 
Similarly, compared to routine care in which an aid is not used, we are uncertain about the effects of communication boards on patient satisfaction. We are not sure about the effect on psychological distress and quality of life due to uncertainty in the evidence. Communication aids that help people to speak may have little or no effect on intensive care unit length of stay (low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of possible harms  with use of communication aids as only three studies reported this, and all measured different adverse events, and two were very small studies. 
What does this mean? 
We are unsure whether using speaking aids in intensive care might increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood. Use of communication boards may increase patient satisfaction, but we are not sure of these findings because of very low‐quality evidence. This means further studies are likely to change our understanding of the effects of communication aids. More studies are needed to understand the effects of communication aids, particularly effects on psychological well‐being and people's ability to communicate.

Joint replacements are common procedures and treatment of choice for those with intractable joint pain and disability arising from arthropathy of the hip or knee. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is considered integral to the outcome of joint replacement. 
Objectives
To assess the evidence for effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation on activity and participation in adults following hip or knee joint replacement for chronic arthropathy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL up to September 2006. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared organised multidisciplinary rehabilitation with routine services following hip or knee replacement, and included outcome measures of activity and participation in accordance with the International Classification of Functioning, Health and Disability (ICF). 
Data collection and analysis
Four authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality of included trials. 
Main results
Five trials (619 participants) met the inclusion criteria; two addressed inpatient rehabilitation (261 participants) and three (358 participants) home‐based settings. There were no trials addressing outpatient centre‐based programmes. Pooling of data was not possible due to differences in study design and outcomes used. Methodological assessment showed all trials were of low quality. For inpatient settings early commencement of rehabilitation and clinical pathways led to more rapid attainment of functional milestones (disability) (Functional Independence Measure (FIM) transfer WMD 0.5, 95% CI 0.15, 0.85, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 6, FIM ambulation WMD 1.55 (95%CI 0.96, 2.14), NNTB = 3), shorter hospital stay, fewer post‐operative complications and reduced costs in the first three to four months. Home‐based multidisciplinary care improved functional gain (Oxford Hip Score (OHS) WMD at 6 months ‐7.00 (95%CI ‐10.36, ‐3.64), NNT = 2 and quality of life (QoL) and reduced hospital stay in the medium term (six months). No trials addressed longer‐term outcomes following hip replacement only. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the heterogeneity and the low quality of the included trials that precluded pooled meta‐analysis, there is silver level evidence that following hip or knee joint replacement, early multidisciplinary rehabilitation can improve outcomes at the level of activity and participation. The optimal intensity, frequency and effects of rehabilitation over a longer period and associated social costs need further study. Future research should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials, and use of standardised outcome measures, so that results can be pooled for statistical analysis. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Does Team-Based Rehab Help People After Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**
Many people have long-lasting pain and trouble moving their hip or knee joints. This pain can make daily tasks very hard. When other treatments do not work, doctors replace the damaged joint with a man-made one. This is called joint replacement surgery.

**Why was this study needed?**
After joint replacement surgery, patients need help to get moving again. Many doctors believe that working with a team of health experts is the best way to help patients recover. This team might include doctors, nurses, physical therapists, and other health workers. They work together to create a care plan. However, researchers wanted to know if this team approach really works better than regular care.

**What did researchers want to find out?**
The researchers wanted to see if team-based rehab helps patients move better and do more activities after hip or knee replacement surgery. They wanted to compare team care with regular care that patients normally receive.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at other studies that had already been done. They searched medical databases up to September 2006. They only included studies that were well-designed research trials.

**Who was in the studies?**
The review included 5 studies with 619 adults total. All patients had hip or knee replacement surgery. Two studies looked at rehab in the hospital with 261 patients. Three studies looked at rehab at home with 358 patients.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies followed patients for different lengths of time. Some tracked patients for 3 to 4 months. Others followed patients for 6 months after surgery.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

For patients in the hospital:
- Team-based rehab helped patients move and walk better in the first few months.
- Patients could get out of bed and walk sooner.
- Patients left the hospital faster.
- Patients had fewer problems after surgery.
- This type of care cost less money.

For patients at home:
- Team-based care at home helped patients move better at 6 months.
- Patients felt their quality of life was better.
- Patients spent less time in the hospital.

**What does this mean?**
Team-based rehab can help patients recover better after joint replacement surgery. Starting rehab early seems to help patients the most. Patients can move better and do more daily activities.

**What are the limits of these findings?**
The studies reviewed had some problems. The quality of the studies was low. Each study was done differently. Each study measured results in different ways. This made it hard to combine the results. No studies looked at results longer than 6 months. More research is needed to know:
- How often patients should do rehab
- How long rehab should last
- If the benefits last a long time
- What the full costs are

**What do the researchers conclude?**
Team-based rehab that starts early can help patients after hip or knee replacement. It can help them move better and do more activities. However, better studies are needed. Future studies should use the same ways to measure results. This would help doctors know the best way to help patients recover.

Joint replacements are common procedures and treatment of choice for those with intractable joint pain and disability arising from arthropathy of the hip or knee. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is considered integral to the outcome of joint replacement. 
Five trials (619 participants) met the inclusion criteria; two addressed inpatient rehabilitation (261 participants) and three (358 participants) home‐based settings. There were no trials addressing outpatient centre‐based programmes. Pooling of data was not possible due to differences in study design and outcomes used. Methodological assessment showed all trials were of low quality. For inpatient settings early commencement of rehabilitation and clinical pathways led to more rapid attainment of functional milestones (disability) (Functional Independence Measure (FIM) transfer WMD 0.5, 95% CI 0.15, 0.85, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 6, FIM ambulation WMD 1.55 (95%CI 0.96, 2.14), NNTB = 3), shorter hospital stay, fewer post‐operative complications and reduced costs in the first three to four months. Home‐based multidisciplinary care improved functional gain (Oxford Hip Score (OHS) WMD at 6 months ‐7.00 (95%CI ‐10.36, ‐3.64), NNT = 2 and quality of life (QoL) and reduced hospital stay in the medium term (six months). No trials addressed longer‐term outcomes following hip replacement only. 
Based on the heterogeneity and the low quality of the included trials that precluded pooled meta‐analysis, there is silver level evidence that following hip or knee joint replacement, early multidisciplinary rehabilitation can improve outcomes at the level of activity and participation. The optimal intensity, frequency and effects of rehabilitation over a longer period and associated social costs need further study. Future research should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials, and use of standardised outcome measures, so that results can be pooled for statistical analysis.

Dementia is a chronic condition which progressively affects memory and other cognitive functions, social behaviour, and ability to carry out daily activities. To date, no treatment is clearly effective in preventing progression of the disease, and most treatments are symptomatic, often aiming to improve people's psychological symptoms or behaviours which are challenging for carers. A range of new therapeutic strategies has been evaluated in research, and the use of trained animals in therapy sessions, termed animal‐assisted therapy (AAT), is receiving increasing attention. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of animal‐assisted therapy for people with dementia.
Search methods
We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register on 5 September 2019. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of major healthcare databases, trial registries, and grey literature sources. We also searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), ISI Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO's trial registry portal. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials, and randomised cross‐over trials that compared AAT versus no AAT, AAT using live animals versus alternatives such as robots or toys, or AAT versus any other active intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data using the standard methods of Cochrane Dementia. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the retrieved records. We expressed our results using mean difference (MD), standardised mean difference (SMD), and risk ratio (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) where appropriate. 
Main results
We included nine RCTs from 10 reports. All nine studies were conducted in Europe and the US. Six studies were parallel‐group, individually randomised RCTs; one was a randomised cross‐over trial; and two were cluster‐RCTs that were possibly related where randomisation took place at the level of the day care and nursing home. We identified two ongoing trials from trial registries. 
There were three comparisons: AAT versus no AAT (standard care or various non‐animal‐related activities), AAT using live animals versus robotic animals, and AAT using live animals versus the use of a soft animal toy. The studies evaluated 305 participants with dementia. One study used horses and the remainder used dogs as the therapy animal. The duration of the intervention ranged from six weeks to six months, and the therapy sessions lasted between 10 and 90 minutes each, with a frequency ranging from one session every two weeks to two sessions per week. There was a wide variety of instruments used to measure the outcomes. All studies were at high risk of performance bias and unclear risk of selection bias. Our certainty about the results for all major outcomes was very low to moderate. 
Comparing AAT versus no AAT, participants who received AAT may be slightly less depressed after the intervention (MD –2.87, 95% CI –5.24 to –0.50; 2 studies, 83 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but they did not appear to have improved quality of life (MD 0.45, 95% CI –1.28 to 2.18; 3 studies, 164 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no clear differences in all other major outcomes, including social functioning (MD –0.40, 95% CI –3.41 to 2.61; 1 study, 58 participants; low‐certainty evidence), problematic behaviour (SMD –0.34, 95% CI –0.98 to 0.30; 3 studies, 142 participants; very‐low‐certainty evidence), agitation (SMD –0.39, 95% CI –0.89 to 0.10; 3 studies, 143 participants; very‐low‐certainty evidence), activities of daily living (MD 4.65, 95% CI –16.05 to 25.35; 1 study, 37 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and self‐care ability (MD 2.20, 95% CI –1.23 to 5.63; 1 study, 58 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There were no data on adverse events. 
Comparing AAT using live animals versus robotic animals, one study (68 participants) found mixed effects on social function, with longer duration of physical contact but shorter duration of talking in participants who received AAT using live animals versus robotic animals (median: 93 seconds with live versus 28 seconds with robotic for physical contact; 164 seconds with live versus 206 seconds with robotic for talk directed at a person; 263 seconds with live versus 307 seconds with robotic for talk in total). Another study showed no clear differences between groups in behaviour measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MD –6.96, 95% CI –14.58 to 0.66; 78 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or quality of life (MD –2.42, 95% CI –5.71 to 0.87; 78 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There were no data on the other outcomes. 
Comparing AAT using live animals versus a soft toy cat, one study (64 participants) evaluated only social functioning, in the form of duration of contact and talking. The data were expressed as median and interquartile ranges. Duration of contact was slightly longer in participants in the AAT group and duration of talking slightly longer in those exposed to the toy cat. This was low‐certainty evidence. 
Authors' conclusions
We found low‐certainty evidence that AAT may slightly reduce depressive symptoms in people with dementia. We found no clear evidence that AAT affects other outcomes in this population, with our certainty in the evidence ranging from very‐low to moderate depending on the outcome. We found no evidence on safety or effects on the animals. Therefore, clear conclusions cannot yet be drawn about the overall benefits and risks of AAT in people with dementia. Further well‐conducted RCTs are needed to improve the certainty of the evidence. In view of the difficulty in achieving blinding of participants and personnel in such trials, future RCTs should work on blinding outcome assessors, document allocation methods clearly, and include major patient‐important outcomes such as affect, emotional and social functioning, quality of life, adverse events, and outcomes for animals. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Animal-Assisted Therapy for People with Dementia

## Plain Title
Can therapy sessions with trained animals help people with dementia?

## Rationale

**What is dementia?**
Dementia is a long-term brain condition. It slowly gets worse over time. People with dementia have trouble with memory and thinking. They may also have changes in mood and behavior. Daily tasks become harder to do.

**Current treatments**
Right now, no treatment can stop dementia from getting worse. Most treatments try to help with symptoms. These include mood problems or difficult behaviors. Doctors and researchers keep looking for new ways to help.

**What is animal-assisted therapy?**
Animal-assisted therapy, or AAT, uses trained animals during therapy sessions. Dogs, cats, and horses are common therapy animals. A trained person guides the sessions. People spend time with the animals. They may pet, talk to, or care for them.

**Why study this treatment?**
Researchers wanted to know if AAT could help people with dementia. They thought spending time with animals might improve mood. It might also help with social skills and quality of life. This study looked at whether AAT really works and if it is safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at nine different studies. These studies were done in Europe and the United States. All studies used a strong research method. People were put into groups by chance. Some got AAT. Others did not.

**Who was in the studies?**
A total of 305 people with dementia took part. Most studies used dogs as therapy animals. One study used horses.

**What did researchers compare?**
They looked at three main comparisons:
- AAT versus no AAT (regular care or other activities without animals)
- AAT with real animals versus robot animals
- AAT with real animals versus soft toy animals

**How long did the studies last?**
The therapy lasted from six weeks to six months. Sessions were 10 to 90 minutes long. Some people had sessions once every two weeks. Others had sessions twice per week.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**AAT versus no AAT:**
People who received AAT may have felt slightly less sad or depressed. However, their quality of life did not clearly improve. The studies found no clear differences in:
- Social skills and interactions
- Problem behaviors
- Agitation or restlessness
- Ability to do daily tasks like eating or dressing
- Self-care abilities

The studies did not report on safety or harmful effects.

**AAT with real animals versus robot animals:**
Results were mixed. People with real animals had more physical contact. But they talked less than people with robot animals. There were no clear differences in behavior problems or quality of life.

**AAT with real animals versus toy animals:**
People with real animals had slightly more physical contact. People with toy animals talked slightly more. Only one small study looked at this.

**What do these results mean?**
The evidence suggests AAT might help reduce sadness a little bit. But researchers are not very certain about this finding. They are also not certain about effects on other symptoms. More research is needed.

**Study limitations:**
The studies had some problems. People knew whether they were getting AAT or not. This could affect results. The studies were small. They used different ways to measure outcomes. This made it hard to compare results.

**What comes next?**
Researchers need to do more and better studies. Future studies should:
- Include more people
- Measure outcomes in standard ways
- Report on safety for both people and animals
- Look at mood, social skills, and quality of life

**Bottom line:**
AAT may help reduce depression slightly in people with dementia. But we need more research to know for sure. We also need to learn if AAT is safe. Right now, we cannot make strong conclusions about whether AAT helps people with dementia.",10.1002-14651858.CD013243,"Animal‐assisted therapy for people with dementia
Review question 
Do therapy sessions that involve live animals help people with dementia?
Background 
Dementia is an increasingly common condition across the world. People with dementia have progressive loss of the ability to think, remember, and communicate; to manage their daily activities; and to mix successfully with other people. Many people with dementia also develop depression and related problems. To date, no treatment has proven able to cure the disease or stop it from getting worse. However, many treatments are in use which aim to improve the well‐being of people with dementia and the people who look after them. Animal‐assisted therapy (AAT) is one of the types of treatment that has been studied. It is thought that animals could help people with dementia by providing companionship and support in daily activities and that this might lead to improvements in physical and mental health, including better mood and fewer problematic behaviours. 
Search date 
We searched medical databases to September 2019.
Key characteristics of included studies 
We included nine randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), involving 305 people with dementia, which compared AAT to a control treatment (either usual care or an alternative treatment). All studies took place in Europe or the US. Seven studies compared AAT to usual care or to another activity which had nothing to do with animals. Two studies compared AAT (using live animals) to the use of robotic animals. One study compared AAT to the use of a soft toy cat. There were some features of the studies which could have biased the results. Study participants and care staff knew what treatment a person was receiving and this might have affected some results. Also, it was not always clear that the randomisation to treatments had been done as well as possible. 
Funding sources 
The studies received funding from various sources, including research grants (four studies), personal donation (one study), and support from an institute that promotes AAT (two studies). Two studies did not describe how they were funded. 
Key results 
We found evidence from two studies with 83 participants that people with dementia who had AAT were possibly slightly less depressed at the end of treatment than people who had standard care or other interventions not related to animals. We also found evidence from three studies with 164 participants that people who received AAT had no clear difference in their quality of life compared to those who did not. However, we found no evidence of an effect on social functioning (interactions with their environment and families), behaviour, agitation, activities of daily living, self‐care ability or balance. There were no clear differences when AAT was compared with the use of a robotic animal in two studies with 156 participants (in social functioning, behaviour, and quality of life), or with the use of a soft toy cat in one study with 64 participants (in social functioning). There were no data on harmful effects of the treatment on the participants and nothing was reported about the effect on the animals in any study. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We took several factors into account when deciding how certain we could be of our results. In this review, two main factors reduced our level of certainty. First, for all the outcomes we looked at, there was only a small number of studies and participants. Second, we thought there was a significant risk that all of the results could have been biased by the way the studies were designed or conducted. For a few outcomes, our confidence was also reduced by inconsistent results between studies. Overall, our certainty about the results ranged from very low to moderate. 
Conclusions 
AAT may slightly reduce depressive symptoms. Otherwise, no conclusions can yet be drawn on whether AAT is beneficial or safe for people with dementia. The small size of the included studies, and the diversity of outcomes and outcome measures, were major issues. We recommend further well‐conducted studies with the inclusion of important outcomes such as emotional and social well‐being, quality of life, side effects, and effects on the animals.

Work disability such as sickness absence is common in people with depression.
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing work disability in employees with depressive disorders. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO until April 4th 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs of work‐directed and clinical interventions for depressed people that included sickness absence days or being off work as an outcome. We also analysed the effects on depression and work functioning. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted the data and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) or risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to pool study results in studies we judged to be sufficiently similar.  
Main results
In this update, we added 23 new studies. In total, we included 45 studies with 88 study arms, involving 12,109 participants with either a major depressive disorder or a high level of depressive symptoms. 
Risk of bias 
The most common types of bias risk were detection bias (27 studies) and attrition bias (22 studies), both for the outcome of sickness absence. 
Work‐directed interventions 
Work‐directed interventionscombined with clinical interventions 
A combination of a work‐directed intervention and a clinical intervention probably reduces sickness absence days within the first year of follow‐up (SMD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.38 to ‐0.12; 9 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). This translates back to 0.5 fewer (95% CI ‐0.7 to ‐0.2) sick leave days in the past two weeks or 25 fewer days during one year (95% CI ‐37.5 to ‐11.8). The intervention does not lead to fewer persons being off work beyond one year follow‐up (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.83; 2 studies, high‐certainty evidence). The intervention may reduce depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.01; 8 studies, low‐certainty evidence) and probably has a small effect on work functioning (SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.06; 5 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence) within the first year of follow‐up.  
Stand alone work‐directed interventions 
A specific work‐directed intervention alone may increase the number of sickness absence days compared with work‐directed care as usual (SMD 0.39, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.74; 2 studies, low‐certainty evidence) but probably does not lead to more people being off work within the first year of follow‐up (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.11; 1 study, moderate‐certainty evidence) or beyond (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; 2 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence). There is probably no effect on depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.10, 95% ‐0.30 CI to 0.10; 4 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence) within the first year of follow‐up and there may be no effect on depressive symptoms beyond that time (SMD 0.18, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.49; 1 study, low‐certainty evidence). The intervention may also not lead to better work functioning (SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.90 to 0.26; 1 study, low‐certainty evidence) within the first year of follow‐up.   
Psychological interventions 
A psychological intervention, either face‐to‐face, or an E‐mental health intervention, with or without professional guidance, may reduce the number of sickness absence days, compared with care as usual (SMD ‐0.15, 95% CI ‐0.28 to ‐0.03; 9 studies, low‐certainty evidence). It may also reduce depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐0.45 to ‐0.15, 8 studies, low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether these psychological interventions improve work ability (SMD ‐0.15 95% CI ‐0.46 to 0.57; 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Psychological interventioncombined with antidepressant medication 
Two studies compared the effect of a psychological intervention combined with antidepressants to antidepressants alone. One study combined psychodynamic therapy with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) medication and another combined telephone‐administered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). We are uncertain if this intervention reduces the number of sickness absence days (SMD ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐0.99 to 0.24; 2 studies, very low‐certainty evidence) but found that there may be no effect on depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.50 to 0.12; 2 studies, low‐certainty evidence). 
Antidepressant medication only 
Three studies compared the effectiveness of SSRI to selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medication on reducing sickness absence and yielded highly inconsistent results. 
Improved care 
Overall, interventions to improve care did not lead to fewer sickness absence days, compared to care as usual (SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.06; 7 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence). However, in studies with a low risk of bias, the intervention probably leads to fewer sickness absence days in the first year of follow‐up (SMD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.35 to ‐0.05; 2 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). Improved care probably leads to fewer depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.35 to ‐0.07; 7 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence) but may possibly lead to a decrease in work‐functioning (SMD 0.5, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66; 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Exercise 
Supervised strength exercise may reduce sickness absence, compared to relaxation (SMD ‐1.11; 95% CI ‐1.68 to ‐0.54; one study, low‐certainty evidence). However, aerobic exercise probably is not more effective than relaxation or stretching (SMD ‐0.06; 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.24; 2 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence). Both studies found no differences between the two conditions in depressive symptoms. 
Authors' conclusions
A combination of a work‐directed intervention and a clinical intervention probably reduces the number of sickness absence days, but at the end of one year or longer follow‐up, this does not lead to more people in the intervention group being at work. The intervention may also reduce depressive symptoms and probably increases work functioning more than care as usual. Specific work‐directed interventions may not be more effective than usual work‐directed care alone. Psychological interventions may reduce the number of sickness absence days, compared with care as usual. Interventions to improve clinical care probably lead to lower sickness absence and lower levels of depression, compared with care as usual. There was no evidence of a difference in effect on sickness absence of one antidepressant medication compared to another. Further research is needed to assess which combination of work‐directed and clinical interventions works best. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Helping People with Depression Return to Work

## Plain Title
Can treatments help people with depression take less time off work?

## Rationale

**What is depression and why does it matter?**

Depression is a common mental health problem. People with depression often feel very sad, tired, and have trouble doing daily tasks. Depression can make it hard to work. Many people with depression need to take time off from their jobs because they feel too unwell to work. This is called sick leave or sickness absence.

**Why was this study needed?**

Taking time off work can be hard for people with depression. They may worry about money. They may feel isolated from coworkers. Being off work for a long time can make it harder to go back. Doctors and researchers want to find the best ways to help people with depression stay at work or return to work sooner.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if different treatments could help people with depression take less time off work. They looked at many types of treatments. Some treatments focused on helping people at their workplace. Other treatments focused on treating depression symptoms. Some treatments combined both approaches.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not one single study. Instead, researchers looked at 45 different studies that other scientists had done. Together, these studies included 12,109 people with depression.

**Who was in these studies?**

All participants had depression. Some had been diagnosed by a doctor with major depression. Others had high levels of depression symptoms. The studies included both men and women of different ages who were employed.

**What treatments did researchers look at?**

Researchers examined several types of treatments:
- Work-focused help combined with depression treatment
- Work-focused help alone
- Talk therapy (counseling)
- Talk therapy combined with antidepressant medicine
- Antidepressant medicine alone
- Better overall care from doctors
- Exercise programs

**How long did the studies last?**

Most studies followed people for one year. Some studies followed people for longer than one year.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

**Work help plus depression treatment works best**

When people got both work-focused help and depression treatment together, they took less time off work. In one year, people took about 25 fewer sick days. This approach probably helps more than usual care. It may also reduce depression symptoms. It probably helps people work better when they are at work.

However, after one year, this treatment did not lead to more people being back at work.

**Work help alone may not be enough**

Getting only work-focused help may not reduce sick days. It may even lead to more sick days compared to usual work support. It probably does not reduce depression symptoms.

**Talk therapy may help**

Talk therapy may help people take fewer sick days than usual care. This includes face-to-face counseling or online therapy programs. Talk therapy may also reduce depression symptoms.

**Talk therapy plus medicine**

Researchers are not sure if combining talk therapy with antidepressant medicine reduces sick days more than medicine alone. More research is needed.

**Comparing different medicines**

Studies compared different types of antidepressant medicines. The results were very mixed. Researchers could not tell if one medicine was better than another for reducing sick days.

**Better overall care helps**

When doctors provided better overall care for depression, people probably took fewer sick days. This approach probably reduced depression symptoms too.

**Exercise may help**

Strength training exercise may reduce sick days more than relaxation. However, aerobic exercise (like running or walking) probably does not reduce sick days more than relaxation or stretching.

**What do these results mean?**

The best approach seems to be combining work-focused help with depression treatment. This helps people take less time off work in the first year. It may also help reduce depression symptoms and improve how well people can do their jobs.

**What is still unknown?**

Researchers need to learn which specific combinations of treatments work best. They also need to understand why treatments help people take less sick time but do not always help more people return to work after one year.",10.1002-14651858.CD006237,"What are the best ways to help people with depression go back to work?
What is depression? 
Depression is a common mental health problem that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in people, activities, and things that were once enjoyable. A person with depression may feel tearful, irritable, or tired most of the time, and may have problems with sleep, concentration, and memory. 
Depression may affect people's ability to work. People with depression may be absent from work (off sick), or feel less able to cope with working. 
Going back to work 
Reducing depressive symptoms may help people with depression to go back to work. Treatments include medications and psychological (talking) therapies, or a combination of both. Changes at the workplace could also help, such as: 
changing a person's tasks or working hours;
supporting them in a gradual return to work; or
helping them to cope better with certain work situations.
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
Work can improve a person's physical and mental well‑being; it helps build confidence and self‐esteem, allows people to socialise, and provides money. We wanted to find out if workplace changes and clinical programmes could help people with depression to return to work. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at whether workplace changes and clinical programmes affected the amount of sick leave taken by people with depression. Clinical programmes included: medicines (anti‐depressants); psychological therapies; improved healthcare by doctors; and other programmes such as exercise and diet.  
Search date: we included evidence published up to 4 April 2020. 
What we found 
We found 45 studies in 12,109 people with depression. The studies took place in Europe (34 studies), the USA (8), Australia (2) and Canada (1). 
The effects of 'care as usual' were compared with those of workplace changes and clinical programmes to find out: 
how many days people with depression were on sick leave
how many people with depression were off work;
people's symptoms of depression; and
how well people with depression could cope with their work.
What are the results of our review? 
Our main findings within the first year of follow‐up, for workplace changes or treatments compared with usual care, are listed below. 
Workplace changes combined with a clinical programme:
probably reduce the number of days on sick leave (on average, by 25 days for each person over one year; 9 studies; 1292 participants); 
do not reduce the number of people off work (2 studies; 1025 participants);
may reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1091 participants); and
may improve ability to cope with work (5 studies; 926 participants).
Workplace changes alone:
may increase the number of days on sick leave (2 studies, 130 participants);
probably do not lead to more people off work (1 study; 226 participants);
probably do not affect symptoms of depression (4 studies; 390 participants); and
may not improve ability to cope with work (1 study; 48 participants).
Improved healthcare alone:
probably reduces the number of days on sick leave, by 20 days (in two, well‐conducted studies in 692 participants, although not in all 7 studies, in 1912 participants); 
probably reduces symptoms of depression (7 studies; 1808 participants); and
may reduce ability to cope with work (1 study; 604 participants).
Psychological therapies alone:
may reduce the number of days off work, by 15 days (9 studies; 1649 participants); and 
may reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1255 participants).
We are uncertain if psychological therapies alone affect people's ability to cope with work (1 study; 58 participants). 
How reliable are these results? 
Our confidence in these results is mostly moderate to low. Some findings are based on small numbers of studies, in small numbers of participants. We also found limitations in the ways some studies were designed, conducted and reported. 
Key messages 
Combining workplace changes with a clinical programme probably helps people with depression to return to work more quickly and to take fewer days off sick. We need more evidence to assess which combination of workplace changes and clinical programmes works best. 
Improved healthcare probably also helps people with depression to take fewer days off sick.

93,10.1002-14651858.CD013191-abstract.txt,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is important to guide appropriate management and improve morbidity and survival. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually a localised skin cancer but with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue, whereas cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma are higher risk skin cancers with the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death. When used in conjunction with clinical or dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, or both, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) may help to identify cancers eligible for non‐surgical treatment without the need for a diagnostic biopsy, particularly in people with suspected BCC. Any potential benefit must be balanced against the risk of any misdiagnoses. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of RCM for the detection of BCC, cSCC, or any skin cancer in adults with any suspicious lesion and lesions that are difficult to diagnose (equivocal); and to compare its accuracy with that of usual practice (visual inspection or dermoscopy, or both). 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design that evaluated the accuracy of RCM alone, or RCM in comparison to visual inspection or dermoscopy, or both, in adults with lesions suspicious for skin cancer compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up, or both. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. For computation of likely numbers of true‐positive, false‐positive, false‐negative, and true‐negative findings in the 'Summary of findings' tables, we applied summary sensitivity and specificity estimates to lower quartile, median and upper quartiles of the prevalence observed in the study groups. We also investigated the impact of observer experience. 
Main results
The review included 10 studies reporting on 11 study cohorts. All 11 cohorts reported data for the detection of BCC, including 2037 lesions (464 with BCC); and four cohorts reported data for the detection of cSCC, including 834 lesions (71 with cSCC). Only one study also reported data for the detection of BCC or cSCC using dermoscopy, limiting comparisons between RCM and dermoscopy. Studies were at high or unclear risk of bias across almost all methodological quality domains, and were of high or unclear concern regarding applicability of the evidence. Selective participant recruitment, unclear blinding of the reference test, and exclusions due to image quality or technical difficulties were observed. It was unclear whether studies were representative of populations eligible for testing with RCM, and test interpretation was often undertaken using images, remotely from the participant and the interpreter blinded to clinical information that would normally be available in practice. 
Meta‐analysis found RCM to be more sensitive but less specific for the detection of BCC in studies of participants with equivocal lesions (sensitivity 94%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 79% to 98%; specificity 85%, 95% CI 72% to 92%; 3 studies) compared to studies that included any suspicious lesion (sensitivity 76%, 95% CI 45% to 92%; specificity 95%, 95% CI 66% to 99%; 4 studies), although CIs were wide. At the median prevalence of disease of 12.5% observed in studies including any suspicious lesion, applying these results to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions results in 30 BCCs missed with 44 false‐positive results (lesions misdiagnosed as BCCs). At the median prevalence of disease of 15% observed in studies of equivocal lesions, nine BCCs would be missed with 128 false‐positive results in a population of 1000 lesions. Across both sets of studies, up to 15% of these false‐positive lesions were observed to be melanomas mistaken for BCCs. There was some suggestion of higher sensitivities in studies with more experienced observers. Summary sensitivity and specificity could not be estimated for the detection of cSCC due to paucity of data. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence for the use of RCM for the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC in either population group. A possible role for RCM in clinical practice is as a tool to avoid diagnostic biopsies in lesions with a relatively high clinical suspicion of BCC. The potential for, and consequences of, misclassification of other skin cancers such as melanoma as BCCs requires further research. Importantly, data are lacking that compare RCM to standard clinical practice (with or without dermoscopy). 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using a Special Microscope to Detect Skin Cancer

## Plain Title

Can a special skin microscope help doctors find skin cancer without needing to take a skin sample?

## Rationale

**What is skin cancer and why does it matter?**

Skin cancer comes in different types. Some types stay in one place. Others can spread to other parts of the body and may cause death. Finding skin cancer early helps doctors treat it better and helps patients live longer and healthier lives.

**What are the different types of skin cancer?**

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) usually stays in one spot. But it can grow into nearby skin and cause damage. Squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma are more serious. These types can spread to other body parts.

**What is the problem?**

Doctors usually need to cut out a small piece of skin to test it. This is called a biopsy. A biopsy tells doctors if a spot is cancer. But biopsies leave scars and can be uncomfortable for patients.

**What is reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM)?**

RCM is a special microscope that looks deep into the skin without cutting it. It takes detailed pictures of skin cells. Doctors hope this tool can help them find skin cancer without doing a biopsy.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if RCM works well to find skin cancer. They wanted to see if it could replace biopsies for some patients. This would help patients avoid unnecessary cuts and scars.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Researchers looked at 10 different studies that other scientists had done. They combined the results to see the big picture.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included adults with spots on their skin that might be cancer. Some spots looked clearly suspicious. Other spots were hard to diagnose. Doctors were not sure what they were.

In total, researchers looked at data from over 2,000 skin spots. Of these spots, 464 were BCC and 71 were cSCC.

**What did researchers measure?**

They checked how well RCM found real skin cancers. They also checked how often RCM said a spot was cancer when it was not.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The results were mixed. RCM worked differently depending on the type of spots being checked.

**For hard-to-diagnose spots:**

RCM found 94 out of 100 BCCs. This is very good. But it also said 15 out of 100 normal spots were cancer when they were not. This means some patients might get treated when they do not need it.

In a group of 1,000 spots where 150 are actually BCC, RCM would miss 9 BCCs. It would also wrongly identify 128 normal spots as cancer.

**For any suspicious spot:**

RCM found 76 out of 100 BCCs. This means it missed more cancers. But it was better at identifying normal spots. It only said 5 out of 100 normal spots were cancer when they were not.

In a group of 1,000 spots where 125 are actually BCC, RCM would miss 30 BCCs. It would wrongly identify 44 normal spots as cancer.

**An important concern:**

Some of the spots wrongly called BCC were actually melanoma. Melanoma is a more dangerous type of skin cancer. Up to 15 out of 100 wrong diagnoses were melanomas. This is a serious problem because melanoma needs different treatment.

**What about squamous cell carcinoma?**

There was not enough information to know if RCM works well for finding cSCC.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

There is not enough proof that RCM works well enough to replace biopsies. More research is needed. RCM might help doctors avoid some biopsies when they are fairly sure a spot is BCC. But doctors must be careful not to miss melanomas or other serious cancers.

The studies had some problems. Some did not include the right mix of patients. Some doctors looking at the pictures did not have all the information they would normally have. This makes it hard to know how well RCM would work in real life.

**What is still needed?**

More studies need to compare RCM to what doctors normally do. This includes looking at the skin with their eyes and using a hand-held magnifier called a dermoscope.",10.1002-14651858.CD013191,"What is the diagnostic accuracy of reflectance confocal microscopy for the detection of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in adults? 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is on its own or compared to inspection of a skin lesion with the naked eye alone or using a hand‐held microscope called dermoscopy for diagnosing two common forms of keratinocyte skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in adults. Review authors in Cochrane included 10 studies to answer this question. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer. BCC and cSCC are usually localised skin cancers. Making the correct diagnosis is important because mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. A missed diagnosis of BCC (known as a false‐negative result) can result in the missed BCC growing and causing disfigurement. A missed diagnosis of cSCC is more serious as it could spread to other parts of the body. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary biopsy or treatment and can cause discomfort and worry to patients. 
What was studied in the review? 
Microscopic techniques are used by skin cancer specialists to provide a more detailed, magnified examination of suspicious skin lesions than can be achieved using the naked eye alone. Currently, dermoscopy is used by doctors as part of the examination of suspicious skin lesions. RCM is a new microscopic technique to increase the magnification. It is a hand‐held device or static unit using infrared light that can visualise deeper layers of the skin when compared with dermoscopy. Both techniques are painless procedures, but RCM is more expensive, time consuming, and requires additional specialised training. Dermoscopy can be used by general practitioners (GP) whereas RCM is likely to only be used by hospital specialists for people who have been referred with a skin lesion that is suspected to be a skin cancer. We wanted to see if RCM should be used instead of, or as well as, inspection of a skin lesion with the naked eye alone or using dermoscopy to diagnose BCC or cSCC. The accuracy of the test was looked at when used on people with any suspicious skin lesion and also in people with skin lesions that were tricky to diagnose. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 10 studies that included information on 11 groups of people with lesions suspicious for skin cancer. The main results were based on seven of the 11 sets of data: four in any lesion suspicious for skin cancer and three in particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions. 
For the comparison of RCM versus dermoscopy, we found four sets of data that included 912 suspicious skin lesions. The results suggested that in a group of 1000 people with any suspicious lesion, of whom 125 (12.5%) really do have BCC: 
‐ an estimated 139 people will have an RCM result indicating BCC is present;
‐ of these, 44 (32%) people will not have BCC (false‐positive results) including one person with a melanoma mistaken for a BCC; 
‐ of the 861 people with an RCM result indicating that BCC is not present, 30 (3%) will actually have BCC. 
The review also included three sets of data on people that had 668 particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions, one comparing RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that if RCM was to be used by skin specialists in a group of 1000 people, of whom 150 (15%) really do have BCC: 
‐ an estimated 269 people will have an RCM result indicating BCC is present;
‐ of these, 128 (48%) people will not have a BCC (known as a false‐positive result), including as many as 19 people with melanomas mistaken for BCCs; 
‐ of the 732 people with an RCM result indicating that BCC is not present, nine (1%) will actually have BCC. 
There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of RCM for the detection of cSCC in either population group. 
How reliable are the results of this review? 
There was a lot of variation in the results of the studies in this review. Poor reporting of study conduct made assessment of the reliability of studies difficult. It was unclear whether studies were representative of populations eligible for testing with RCM, and test interpretation was often undertaken using images, remotely from the patient and the interpreter blinded to clinical information that would normally be available in practice. Only one study compared the accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM. Most studies were conducted by specialist research teams with high levels of training and experience with RCM, meaning that RCM may appear better than it would be when used in everyday practice. Most studies reported diagnosis based on observers' subjective views, which might not be the same for people using the technique in everyday practice. In nine studies, the diagnosis of skin cancer was made by a skin biopsy or by following up those people over time to make sure they remained negative for skin cancer*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had skin cancer. In one study, the absence of skin cancer was made by experts looking at the skin, a method that may be less reliable for deciding whether patients really had skin cancer. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Five studies were carried out in Europe (61%), and the rest in Asia, Oceania, North America, or more than one continent. The average ages of people who took part ranged from 41 to 65 years. The percentage of people with BCC in these studies ranged from 6% to 83% (a middle value of 12% for any suspicious lesion and 15% for difficult to diagnose skin lesions). For studies of RCM used for cSCC, the percentage of people with cSCC ranged between 4% and 13%. In many studies it was not clear what tests people taking part had received before RCM. 
What are the implications of this review? 
There was not enough good evidence to support the use of RCM for the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC outside of research studies. There was a lot of variation and uncertainty in results and in the ways studies were carried out, reducing the reliability of findings. Using RCM might avoid the need for a diagnostic biopsy in people who see a doctor with a high suspicion of a BCC lesion, but more research is needed to confirm this. Such research should compare RCM to dermoscopy in well‐described groups of people with suspicious skin lesions and they must say whether other skin cancers end up being missed or being wrongly classified as BCC. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses).

Mechanical ventilation is a potentially painful and discomforting intervention that is widely used in neonatal intensive care. Newborn infants demonstrate increased sensitivity to pain, which may affect clinical and neurodevelopmental outcomes. The use of drugs that reduce pain might be important in improving survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of opioid analgesics for neonates (term or preterm) receiving mechanical ventilation compared to placebo or no drug, other opioids, or other analgesics or sedatives. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 9), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 29 September 2020); Embase (1980 to 29 September 2020); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 29 September 2020). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing opioids to placebo or no drug, to other opioids, or to other analgesics or sedatives in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. We excluded cross‐over trials. We included term (≥ 37 weeks' gestational age) and preterm (< 37 weeks' gestational age) newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. We included any duration of drug treatment and any dosage given continuously or as bolus; we excluded studies that gave opioids to ventilated infants for procedures. 
Data collection and analysis
For each of the included trials, we independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, types of opioids) using Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) criteria and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomisation, blinding, completeness of follow‐up). We evaluated treatment effects using a fixed‐effect model with risk ratio (RR) for categorical data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included 23 studies (enrolling 2023 infants) published between 1992 and 2019. Fifteen studies (1632 infants) compared the use of morphine or fentanyl versus placebo or no intervention. Four studies included both term and preterm infants, and one study only term infants; all other studies included only preterm infants, with five studies including only very preterm infants. We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) Scale in the first 12 hours after infusion (MD ‐5.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐6.88 to ‐4.59; 50 participants, 2 studies) and between 12 and 48 hours after infusion (MD ‐0.98, 95% CI ‐1.35 to ‐0.61; 963 participants, 3 studies) because of limitations in study design, high heterogeneity (inconsistency), and imprecision of estimates (very low‐certainty evidence ‐ GRADE). The use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing duration of mechanical ventilation (MD 0.23 days, 95% CI ‐0.38 to 0.83; 1259 participants, 7 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence because of unclear risk of bias in most studies) and neonatal mortality (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.55; 1189 participants, 5 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence because of imprecision of estimates). We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.39 to 10.29; 78 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence because of serious imprecision of the estimates and indirectness). Limited data were available for the other comparisons (i.e. two studies (54 infants) on morphine versus midazolam, three (222 infants) on morphine versus fentanyl, and one each on morphine versus diamorphine (88 infants), morphine versus remifentanil (20 infants), fentanyl versus sufentanil (20 infants), and fentanyl versus remifentanil (24 infants)). For these comparisons, no meta‐analysis was conducted because outcomes were reported by one study. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on pain and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months; the use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and neonatal mortality. Data on the other comparisons planned in this review (opioids versus analgesics; opioids versus other opioids) are extremely limited and do not allow any conclusions. In the absence of firm evidence to support a routine policy, opioids should be used selectively ‐ based on clinical judgement and evaluation of pain indicators ‐ although pain measurement in newborns has limitations. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Pain Relief Drugs for Newborn Babies on Breathing Machines

## Plain Title
Do pain relief drugs help newborn babies who need breathing machines?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Many newborn babies need help breathing. Doctors use a machine called a ventilator to help them breathe. This machine pushes air into the baby's lungs through a tube.

Being on a breathing machine can hurt and feel very bad. Newborn babies feel pain more strongly than older children or adults. This pain may harm how babies grow and develop their brains.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors want to know if pain relief drugs can help these babies. These drugs are called opioids. Morphine and fentanyl are two common opioids.

The main question was: Do these pain drugs help babies on breathing machines feel better? Do they help babies get well faster? Do they help babies grow and develop normally?

**Why might these drugs help?**

Opioids are strong pain relief drugs. They work by blocking pain signals in the body. Doctors thought these drugs might help babies feel more comfortable. This might help babies heal better and have fewer problems later in life.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 23 different studies. These studies included 2,023 babies in total. The studies were done between 1992 and 2019.

**Who was in the studies?**

Most studies included babies born too early (preterm babies). Some studies included babies born at the right time (term babies). All babies needed breathing machines.

**What did researchers compare?**

The main comparison was between:
- Babies who got opioid drugs (morphine or fentanyl)
- Babies who got a fake drug or no drug at all

Some studies also compared different types of opioid drugs to each other.

**How long did the studies last?**

The time babies spent in each study varied. Some studies lasted just a few days. Others followed babies for up to 2 years.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers are not sure if opioids reduce pain in newborn babies. The studies showed mixed results. Some studies said opioids helped with pain. Other studies did not show this benefit.

**Did opioids help babies get better faster?**

Probably not. Babies who got opioids stayed on breathing machines about the same amount of time as babies who did not get opioids.

**Did opioids help babies survive?**

Probably not. About the same number of babies died in both groups. This means opioids did not help more babies survive.

**Did opioids help babies develop normally?**

The researchers are not sure. Only one small study looked at how babies developed at 18 to 24 months old. This study was too small to give clear answers.

**What about comparing different opioid drugs?**

Very few studies compared different opioid drugs to each other. There is not enough information to say if one drug works better than another.

**What do these results mean?**

The evidence is not strong enough to say all babies on breathing machines should get opioid drugs. Doctors should decide for each baby based on:
- How the baby looks and acts
- Signs that the baby might be in pain
- Their medical judgment

However, measuring pain in newborn babies is hard. This makes it difficult for doctors to know when babies need pain relief.

**What are the main conclusions?**

Opioid pain drugs might not help all newborn babies on breathing machines. These drugs probably do not help babies get off breathing machines faster. They probably do not help more babies survive.

Doctors should use these drugs carefully. They should only give them to babies who seem to be in pain. More research is needed to find better ways to help these tiny patients.",10.1002-14651858.CD013732,"Opioids for newborns receiving mechanical ventilation
Review question 
Do drugs such as morphine and fentanyl (opioids) save lives, reduce pain, or improve the long‐term development of newborns needing breathing machines (mechanical ventilators)?Background 
Breathing machines are widely used for newborn full‐term (≥ 37 weeks' gestational age) and preterm (< 37 weeks' gestational age) babies with breathing problems. Breathing machines may cause babies pain. Moreover, their use requires the presence and suctioning of a tube placed in the baby's trachea (which connects the larynx to the bronchi of the lungs), thus causing additional pain and distress. Since newborn babies are very sensitive to pain, which may have a bad effect on future development, pain reduction with drugs (including opioids such as morphine and fentanyl) might be very important. Pain in babies is assessed by adults by using different scales, which focus on the baby's appearance and behaviour, and on other parameters. Study characteristicsWe collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found 23 studies enrolling 2023 babies. In most studies, babies were born before the due date (before 37 weeks' gestational age). Eight studies compared the use of morphine versus placebo (a substance with no therapeutic value) or no intervention, and seven versus fentanyl. We analysed the other studies separately because researchers compared the use of these two drugs with other opioids or other analgesics. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on pain and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months; use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and neonatal mortality. Further research is needed. 
Certainty of evidence 
The certainty of evidence is very low to moderate because overall only a small number of studies have looked at this intervention, few babies were included in these studies, and some studies could have been better designed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?

Abdominal aortic graft infections are a major complication following abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery, with high morbidity and mortality rates. They can be treated surgically or conservatively using medical management. The two most common surgical techniques are in situ replacement of the graft and extra‐anatomical bypass. Medical management most commonly consists of a course of long‐term antibiotics. There is currently no consensus on which intervention (extra‐anatomical bypass, in situ replacement, or medical) is the most effective in managing abdominal aortic graft infections. Whilst in emergency or complex situations such as graft rupture surgical management is the only option, in non‐emergency situations it is often personal preference that influences the clinician's decision‐making. 
Objectives
To assess and compare the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 2 December 2019. We also reviewed the bibliographies of the studies identified by the search and contacted specialists in the field and study authors to request information on any possible unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We aimed to include all randomised controlled trials that used surgical or medical interventions to treat abdominal aortic graft infections. The definitions of abdominal aortic graft infections were accepted as presented in the individual studies, and included secondary infection due to aortoenteric fistula. We excluded studies presenting data on prosthetic graft infections in general, unless data specific to abdominal aortic graft infections could be isolated. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed all studies identified by the search. We planned to independently assess risk of bias of the included trials and to evaluate the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our main outcomes were overall mortality, amputation, graft re‐infection, overall graft‐related complications, graft‐related mortality, acute limb ischaemia, and re‐intervention. 
Main results
We identified no randomised controlled trials to conduct meta‐analysis.
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions to support any treatment over the other. Multicentre clinical trials are required to compare different treatments for the condition. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
What is the best way to treat infections in blood vessel grafts placed in the belly area?

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
Some people have a weak spot in a large blood vessel in their belly called the aorta. Doctors fix this with surgery by placing a man-made tube called a graft. Sometimes, this graft can get infected. This is a very serious problem.

### Why is this a burden for patients?
When a graft gets infected, it can make people very sick. Many people die from this problem. It causes a lot of pain and suffering. Patients need treatment to fight the infection and stay alive.

### What treatments are available?
Doctors can treat graft infections in three main ways:
- Surgery to remove the infected graft and put in a new one in the same spot
- Surgery to remove the infected graft and put in a new one in a different path around the infection
- Medicine treatment using drugs that kill germs, given for a long time

### Why was this study needed?
Right now, doctors do not agree on which treatment works best. In emergencies, surgery is the only choice. But when there is time to plan, doctors choose based on what they prefer. There is no clear proof about which treatment saves more lives or works better. This study wanted to find out which treatment is best by looking at all the research done so far.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
The researchers looked for all high-quality studies that tested different treatments for graft infections in the belly area. They searched medical databases and trial records up to December 2019. They wanted to find studies that:
- Tested surgery or medicine treatments
- Included patients with infected grafts in the belly area
- Compared different treatments to see which worked better

The researchers planned to combine results from all the studies they found. This would help show which treatment works best overall.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers found no high-quality studies to review. They could not find any studies that properly compared the different treatments. Without these studies, they could not answer their question.

### What does this mean for patients?
Right now, there is no clear proof that one treatment is better than another. Doctors must still choose treatments based on their own experience and judgment. Each patient's situation is different, so doctors consider many factors when deciding on treatment.

### What are the conclusions?
More research is urgently needed. Large studies that include many hospitals should compare the different treatments. These studies should track:
- How many patients survive
- How many need more surgery
- How many get infected again
- What problems happen with the grafts
- How many patients lose a leg
- How many have blood flow problems

Until better studies are done, we cannot say which treatment is best. Patients should talk with their doctors about all treatment options. Together, they can decide what is best for each person's situation.

### Why is this important?
Graft infections are life-threatening. Patients and doctors need clear information about which treatments work best. Good research studies will help doctors make better choices. This could save lives and help patients have better outcomes.",10.1002-14651858.CD013469,"Surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections
Background 
Abdominal aortic graft infections are a serious complication following aortic aneurysm surgery. They can be managed in two ways: either with surgery or medical management. Surgery is currently the mainstay of treatment and is usually performed by two methods, one of which involves removing and replacing the infected graft, and the other bypassing the infected graft. Medical management commonly involves a long‐term course of antibiotics. Medical management avoids the risk of potential complications of surgery, but requires use of antibiotics for several months, or even lifelong. There is currently no agreement on which intervention (surgical or medical) is the most effective in managing abdominal aortic graft infections. In emergency or complex situations such as graft rupture, surgical management is the only option, whilst for those unfit for surgery, medical management is the preferred option. However, in non‐emergency situations, it is often personal preference that influences the healthcare provider's decision‐making. This review aimed to assess and compare the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) to December 2019. We found no trials that met our inclusion criteria. Hence there is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions relating to the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. 
Conclusion 
Multicentre randomised controlled trials are required to identify the most effective method of treating aortic graft infection. By doing this, 'gold standard' guidelines can be formulated so that all patients can receive the same level of treatment without regard for where they are being treated.

Severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The definitive management for severe AS is aortic valve replacement (AVR). The choice of transcatheter approach versus open‐heart surgery for AVR in people with severe AS and low surgical risk remains a matter of debate. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in people with severe AS and low surgical risk. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 29 April 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We searched all databases from inception to present and imposed no restriction on language or date of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs that compared TAVI and SAVR in adults (18 years of age or older) with severe AS and low surgical risk. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias in the studies included. We analysed dichotomous data using the risk ratio (RR) and continuous data using the mean difference (MD), with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Our outcomes of interest were assessed in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow‐up). Primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, stroke, and rehospitalisation. Secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac death, length of hospital stay (LOS), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, new‐onset atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury (AKI), and any bleeding. 
Main results
We identified four studies (13 reports), with 2818 participants, and one ongoing study. Overall certainty of evidence ranged from high to very low. 
There is probably little or no difference between TAVI and SAVR for the following short‐term outcomes: all‐cause mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.44; SAVR 11 deaths per 1000, TAVI 8 deaths per 1000 (95% CI 4 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25; SAVR 21 strokes per 1000, TAVI 16 strokes per 1000 (95% CI 9 to 27); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); MI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.58; SAVR 14 MI per 1000, TAVI 11 MI per 1000 (95% CI 6 to 21); 2748 participants; 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); and cardiac death (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.56; SAVR 10 cardiac deaths per 1000, TAVI 7 cardiac deaths per 1000 (95% CI 3 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
TAVI may reduce the risk of short‐term rehospitalisation, although the confidence interval also includes the possibility of no difference in risk between groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06; SAVR 30 cases per 1000, TAVI 19 cases per 1000 (95% CI 12 to 32); 2468 participants; 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
TAVI, compared with SAVR, probably increases the risk of PPM implantation (RR 3.65, 95% CI 1.50 to 8.87; SAVR 47 per 1000, TAVI 170 cases per 1000 (95% CI 70 to 413); number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 7; 2683 participants; 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the LOS in days, although it appears to be associated with shorter LOS. 
TAVI, compared with SAVR, reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.30; 2683 participants; 3 studies), AKI (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.58; 2753 participants; 4 studies), and bleeding (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62; 2753 participants; 4 studies) (all high‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Our meta‐analysis indicates that, in the short term, TAVI probably has little or no mortality difference compared to SAVR for severe AS in individuals with low surgical risk. Similarly, there is probably little or no difference in risk of stroke, MI, and cardiac death between the two approaches. TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation, but we are uncertain about the effects on LOS. TAVI reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation, AKI, and bleeding. However, this benefit is offset by the increased risk of PPM implantation. Long‐term follow‐up data are needed to further assess and validate these outcomes, especially durability, in the low surgical risk population. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Ways to Replace a Heart Valve in People at Low Risk

## Plain Title

Comparing catheter-based and open-heart surgery methods for replacing damaged heart valves in people at low risk from surgery

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

The aortic valve is a door-like structure in the heart that controls blood flow. When this valve becomes narrow and stiff (a condition called aortic stenosis), it cannot open properly. This makes the heart work much harder to pump blood through the body. Severe aortic stenosis causes many people to become sick and can lead to death. It is a major health problem around the world.

**What is the treatment?**

The only way to fix severe aortic stenosis is to replace the damaged valve. Doctors can do this in two ways:

1. Open-heart surgery (called SAVR): Doctors open the chest and replace the valve while the heart is stopped.
2. Catheter-based procedure (called TAVI): Doctors insert a thin tube through a blood vessel and place a new valve without opening the chest.

**Why was this study needed?**

TAVI was first used for people who were too sick for open-heart surgery. Now doctors want to know if TAVI works well for healthier people who are at low risk from surgery. This study compared both methods to see which works better for these low-risk patients.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at four studies that compared TAVI and SAVR. These studies included 2,818 adults (18 years or older) with severe aortic stenosis who were healthy enough for either type of procedure.

The researchers checked what happened to patients during their hospital stay and up to 30 days after their procedure. They looked at deaths, strokes, heart attacks, and other health problems. They also checked how long patients stayed in the hospital.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The researchers found that both methods work about the same for the most important outcomes:

**Deaths and major problems:** TAVI and SAVR had similar rates of death, stroke, heart attack, and death from heart problems in the first 30 days. Out of every 1,000 people treated with SAVR, 11 died. With TAVI, about 8 out of 1,000 died. This small difference could be due to chance.

**Hospital stays:** TAVI may reduce the need to go back to the hospital, but the researchers are not completely certain about this finding.

**Benefits of TAVI:** People who had TAVI had fewer of these problems:
- Irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation): Much less common with TAVI
- Kidney problems: Much less common with TAVI  
- Bleeding: Much less common with TAVI

**Drawbacks of TAVI:** People who had TAVI were more likely to need a pacemaker. A pacemaker is a small device that helps control the heartbeat. Out of every 1,000 people, 47 who had SAVR needed a pacemaker. With TAVI, 170 out of 1,000 needed one.

**What does this mean?**

For people at low risk from surgery, both TAVI and SAVR work well for replacing damaged heart valves. The choice between them involves trade-offs. TAVI causes less bleeding, fewer kidney problems, and less irregular heartbeat. However, TAVI increases the chance of needing a pacemaker.

**What is still unknown?**

These results only show what happened in the first 30 days. Doctors need more studies that follow patients for many years. This will show how long the new valves last and whether one method is better over time.",10.1002-14651858.CD013319,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement in people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk 
Review question 
Does transcatheter approach, compared to open‐heart surgery, for aortic valve replacement improve outcomes in people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk? 
Background 
Aortic stenosis (AS) is the narrowing of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins). It typically gets worse over time. Its severity can be divided into mild, moderate, severe, and very severe; and it is distinguishable by ultrasound scan of the heart and other clinical features. Once it has become severe, treatment primarily involves surgery to replace the valve. An alternative approach is to use transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This approach improves outcomes in individuals who are inoperable or at a high to intermediate risk for surgery. However, it remains unclear if TAVI is beneficial to those who have severe AS and are at a low surgical risk. 
Search Date 
The evidence is current to April 2019. We searched the literature and found a total of 3092 citations that were potentially relevant. After reviewing each of these, we found 13 published articles describing four clinical trials that could help us answer our question. 
Study characteristics 
The four clinical trials included 2818 participants who were randomly allocated to undergo either TAVI or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The trials were multicentre and took place in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the USA, Denmark, and Sweden. 
Key Results 
Moderate‐certainty evidence from clinical trials shows that, in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow‐up), there is probably little or no difference between TAVI compared with SAVR in risk of death due to any cause, stroke (insult to the brain), myocardial infarction (injury or death of heart muscle), or death due to cardiac causes (e.g. myocardial infarction or failure of the heart muscle pump). Low‐certainty evidence shows that TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation compared with SAVR. We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the length of hospital stay, although it appears to be associated with shorter duration of hospitalisation. High‐certainty evidence shows that fewer people had atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heart rhythm), acute kidney injury (insult to the kidney), and bleeding when they underwent TAVI, compared with SAVR. However, moderate‐certainty evidence shows that TAVI probably increases the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (a device that is placed to artificially set the heart rhythm), compared with SAVR. 
Quality of the evidence 
We consider the overall quality of evidence to be moderate for most relevant outcomes (death, stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and risk of permanent pacemaker implantation), with the exception of rehospitalisation (low‐quality evidence) and length of hospital stay (very low quality evidence). The evidence for atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and bleeding was of high quality.

Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease. People with asthma have inflammation of their airways that causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness and chest tightness, with or without a cough. Statins possess multiple therapeutic effects, including lowering lipid levels in the blood. Statins are reported to have a potential role as an adjunct treatment in asthma. However, comprehensive evidence of the benefits and harms of using statins is required to facilitate decision making. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of statins as an adjunct therapy for asthma in adults and children. 
Search methods
We searched for studies in the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid SP and Embase Ovid SP, from their inception dates We handsearched the proceedings of major respiratory conferences. We also searched clinical trials registries for completed, ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews to identify additional studies. 
The search is current to 7 February 2020.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel‐group design that assessed statins for at least 12 weeks' duration. We considered all participants with a clinical diagnosis of asthma to be eligible, regardless of age, sex, disease severity and previous or current treatment. We planned to include studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened and selected the studies, extracted outcome data and intervention characteristics from included studies, and assessed risk of bias according to standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We resolved any disagreement through discussion. 
Main results
We found only one trial involving a total of 60 people living with asthma. The trial compared the effect of atorvastatin with a placebo (dummy treatment containing lactose) in treating people with chronic asthma. The trial did not report data for the primary outcomes or adverse events. There was uncertainty about the relative effect on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in the atorvastatin group compared with the placebo group. The study did not report serious adverse effects for the interventions. The included study had internal discrepancies in its reported data. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence was of very low certainty, so we are unable to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of statins to treat asthma. High‐quality RCTs are needed to assess the effect of statins on people with asthma. Well‐designed multicentre trials with larger samples and longer duration of treatment are required, which assess outcomes such as adverse events, hospital utilisation and costs, to provide better quality evidence. Future studies that include subgroups of obese people with asthma are also required. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Statins as an Add-On Treatment for Asthma

## Plain Title
Can statin drugs help treat asthma when added to regular asthma medicines?

## Rationale

**What is asthma?**
Asthma is a long-term lung disease that many people have. People with asthma have swelling in their airways. This swelling causes problems like:
- Wheezing (a whistling sound when breathing)
- Trouble breathing
- Tight feeling in the chest
- Coughing (sometimes)

These problems come and go over time.

**What are statins?**
Statins are drugs that doctors often give to lower fat levels in the blood. But statins can do other helpful things in the body too.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Some early reports suggested that statins might help people with asthma. Researchers wanted to find out if adding statins to regular asthma treatment could help people breathe better. They also wanted to know if statins are safe for people with asthma.

Doctors need clear facts about whether statins work for asthma. They also need to know about any side effects. This information helps doctors make good choices about treating their patients.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers look for studies?**
The researchers searched for studies where:
- People with asthma took statins or a fake pill (called a placebo)
- The study lasted at least 12 weeks
- Researchers picked who got statins or placebo by chance (like flipping a coin)

They looked for studies with people of any age or sex. They included people with mild or severe asthma.

**What did they find?**
The researchers found only one study that met their rules. This study had 60 people with long-term asthma. The study tested a statin drug called atorvastatin. Some people took atorvastatin. Other people took a fake pill made of lactose (milk sugar).

The study was small. It did not last very long.

## Results

**What did the study show?**
The researchers could not tell if statins helped people with asthma. Here is why:
- The one study found had problems with its data
- The numbers in the study did not match up
- The study did not report important information

The study looked at how well people could breathe. But the results were unclear. The researchers could not say if statins made breathing better or worse.

**What about safety?**
The study did not report if people had bad side effects from the statin. This means we do not know if statins are safe for people with asthma.

**What do these results mean?**
Right now, we do not have good proof that statins help treat asthma. We also do not know if they are safe to use for asthma.

The proof we have is very weak. Doctors cannot use this information to decide about treating patients.

**What is needed next?**
We need better studies to answer this question. Future studies should:
- Include many more people
- Last longer
- Take place in many hospitals or clinics
- Report all side effects clearly
- Look at hospital visits and costs
- Include people who are overweight and have asthma

Only good studies with many people can give us clear answers. Then doctors will know if statins can help people with asthma.

**Bottom line:**
We cannot say if statins help people with asthma. We need more and better research to find out.",10.1002-14651858.CD013268,"Statins for asthma
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of statins in people with asthma.
Background 
Asthma is a common chronic (persistent) airway disease. Asthma is caused by inflammation in the lungs and bronchoconstriction (tightening of the small tubes in the lungs in response to a trigger such as pollen or cold air). Inflammation and bronchoconstriction cause airflow obstruction (narrowing and blockage). People with asthma experience recurrent attacks of wheezing, difficultly in breathing, and chest tightness, with or without a cough. 
Statins are anti‐inflammatory medicines. We wanted to review the evidence for statins because the theory is that their anti‐inflammatory properties will help people with asthma. We wanted to discover whether using statin therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care alone or different types of statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin). 
Study characteristics 
We found only one trial that assessed atorvastatin (a type of statin drug) and placebo (dummy treatment) in 60 adults with asthma over a period of 12 weeks. These people had chronic asthma (persistent airway disease) when they started treatment. 
Key results 
We found that the statin (atorvastatin) did not result in any clear improvement in lung function in people with asthma, but may be better in asthma control than the dummy drug. However, because there is only one trial, we cannot draw firm conclusions. 
The trial did not report on adverse effects or severe adverse effects (harms). We are uncertain whether statins may  have beneficial effects on relieving asthma or whether they may increase the risk of adverse events or non‐serious adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low certainty, so we cannot draw firm conclusions about whether statins are helpful and safe to be used by people with asthma. 
The evidence is current to 7 February 2020.

What is the issue? 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer that women get.
Women with early breast cancer who choose to keep their breast need to have radiotherapy (RT) as well as surgery to remove the cancer to make sure it does not regrow in the breast. RT is treatment with high energy x‐rays. Having RT for breast cancer usually means 15 to 30 visits to the RT department, five times per week. 
If breast cancer does regrow in the same breast (called local recurrence), it tends to come back in the area it was removed from. Women can also grow a new cancer (new 'elsewhere primary') in another part of the same breast. We are not sure if the RT given to stop cancer regrowth where the first cancer was, stops the growth of 'elsewhere primaries.' 
Why does it matter? 
We always want to treat the smallest area we can with RT because this means fewer side effects. Treating only part of the breast could mean that RT might be able to be used again in another part of the same breast if needed. New ways of giving RT mean that treating part of the breast can be done with fewer treatments. This is likely to be easier for women and cost less money. 
What did we compare? 
We asked if giving RT to part of the breast (called partial breast irradiation (PBI)) is as good as giving RT to the whole breast. PBI can be given with a shortened treatment duration (called accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)). 
For this treatment to be acceptable, it would need to control the cancer as well as giving RT to the whole breast does. It would also be important that the PBI gives about the same side effects and breast appearance as treating the whole breast. 
What did we find? 
We found nine studies, which involved 15,187 women. Our evidence is current to 27 August 2020. Local recurrence is probably slightly more common with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence) and the breast appearance (scored by doctors and nurses) was probably worse with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence). There is probably little difference in survival (high‐quality evidence). Late radiation fibrosis (change in breast appearance and feel) is probably increased with APBI/PBI. There are probably few differences in breast cancer‐related deaths and spread of breast cancer around the body with the use of APBI/PBI. The use of APBI/PBI makes little difference to how many women need mastectomy (removal of the whole breast) because of unacceptable late side effects or local recurrence. 
What do our findings mean? 
This means that at the moment, PBI does not give the same cancer control in the breast as treating the whole breast, but the difference is small. It may cause worse side effects. There are seven big ongoing studies that will be important to answer this question. We hope to have a clearer answer in the next update of this review. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Partial Breast Irradiation for Early Breast Cancer

## Plain Title

Comparing radiation treatment to part of the breast versus the whole breast in women with early breast cancer

## Rationale

**What is breast cancer and why does it matter?**

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. When found early, many women choose to keep their breast. After surgery to remove the cancer, they need radiation treatment. This helps stop the cancer from coming back.

**What is radiation treatment?**

Radiation treatment uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. It is also called RT. Women usually need to visit the hospital 15 to 30 times over several weeks. They go five days each week.

**Why might the cancer come back?**

When breast cancer grows again in the same breast, doctors call this local recurrence. It usually comes back in the same area where it was removed. Sometimes a new cancer can grow in a different part of the same breast.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Doctors want to treat the smallest area possible with radiation. This causes fewer side effects for women. If doctors only treat part of the breast, they might be able to use radiation again later if needed. New methods allow doctors to treat part of the breast with fewer visits. This is easier for women and costs less money.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if treating part of the breast works as well as treating the whole breast. They wanted to make sure the cancer stays away. They also wanted to check if side effects and how the breast looks afterward are about the same.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at nine different studies. These studies included 15,187 women with early breast cancer. All women had surgery to remove their cancer and chose to keep their breast.

**What did researchers compare?**

Some women got radiation to their whole breast. Other women got radiation to only part of their breast. This is called partial breast irradiation or PBI. When PBI is given with fewer treatments, it is called APBI.

**When was this information collected?**

The researchers looked at all available studies up to August 27, 2020.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The researchers found several important things:

**Cancer coming back:** Cancer came back in the breast slightly more often with APBI or PBI. The difference was small but noticeable.

**How long women lived:** There was probably little difference in how long women lived. Both treatments worked about the same for overall survival.

**How the breast looked:** Doctors and nurses said the breast looked slightly worse after APBI or PBI. The breast also felt different more often. This is called fibrosis.

**Deaths from breast cancer:** About the same number of women died from breast cancer with both treatments.

**Cancer spreading:** Cancer spread to other parts of the body about the same amount with both treatments.

**Needing more surgery:** About the same number of women needed their whole breast removed later. This happened because of side effects or cancer coming back.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Right now, treating part of the breast does not control cancer quite as well as treating the whole breast. The difference is small. It may cause slightly worse side effects. The breast may not look or feel as good afterward.

**What happens next?**

Seven large studies are still ongoing. These studies will help answer this question better. Researchers hope to have clearer answers when they update this review.

**Why is this important?**

Women and their doctors need good information to make the best choice. Some women may prefer fewer treatment visits even if there is a small increase in risk. Other women may prefer the treatment that controls cancer best. This review helps women understand the trade-offs between the two options.",10.1002-14651858.CD007077,"Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer

Hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a leading cause of mortality and long‐term neurological sequelae, affecting thousands of children worldwide. Current therapies to treat HIE are limited to cooling. Stem cell‐based therapies offer a potential therapeutic approach to repair or regenerate injured brain tissue. These preclinical findings have now culminated in ongoing human neonatal trials. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of stem cell‐based interventions for the treatment of hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in newborn infants. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 8 June 2020), Embase (1980 to 8 June 2020), and CINAHL (1982 to 8 June 2020). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials and cluster trials comparing 1) stem cell‐based interventions (any type) compared to control (placebo or no treatment); 2) use of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) of type (e.g. number of doses or passages) or source (e.g. autologous versus allogeneic, or bone marrow versus cord) versus MSCs of other type or source; 3) use of stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of type (e.g. mononuclear cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, neural stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and inducible pluripotent stem cells) or source (e.g. autologous versus allogeneic, or bone marrow versus cord) versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of other type or source; or 4) MSCs versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs. 
Data collection and analysis
For each of the included trials, two authors independently planned to extract data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, type and source of MSCs or other stem cell‐based interventions) and assess the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomisation, blinding, completeness of follow‐up). The primary outcomes considered in this review are all‐cause neonatal mortality, major neurodevelopmental disability, death or major neurodevelopmental disability assessed at 18 to 24 months of age. We planned to use the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
Our search strategy yielded 616 references. Two review authors independently assessed all references for inclusion. We did not find any completed studies for inclusion. Fifteen RCTs are currently registered and ongoing. We describe the three studies we excluded. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently no evidence from randomised trials that assesses the benefit or harms of stem cell‐based interventions for the prevention of morbidity and mortality following hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy in newborn infants. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Stem Cell Treatment for Brain Injury in Newborn Babies

## Plain Title
Can stem cells help treat brain injury in newborn babies caused by lack of oxygen?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?

Some babies do not get enough oxygen during or after birth. This can hurt the baby's brain. Doctors call this problem HIE (a brain injury from low oxygen). This is a serious problem that affects thousands of babies around the world each year.

### What does this condition cause?

Babies with this brain injury may die. Some babies who survive may have long-term problems. These problems can include trouble moving, learning, or thinking as they grow up.

### What treatments are available now?

Right now, doctors can only cool the baby's body. This cooling helps some babies. But many babies still have problems even with cooling. Doctors need better ways to help these babies.

### What is the new treatment being studied?

Scientists think stem cells might help. Stem cells are special cells in the body. They can grow into many different types of cells. They might be able to fix or replace hurt brain cells.

### Why study this treatment?

Tests in animals showed that stem cells might help repair brain damage. Because of these good results, doctors want to test stem cells in babies. This study looked at all the research done so far. The goal was to see if stem cells are safe and helpful for babies with brain injury from low oxygen.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers look for studies?

The researchers searched for all studies about stem cells for newborn babies with brain injury. They looked in medical databases. They searched up to June 2020. They wanted to find studies that tested stem cells in real babies.

### What kind of studies did they look for?

They looked for studies that:
- Gave some babies stem cells
- Gave other babies no stem cells or fake treatment
- Compared the two groups of babies

### What did they want to measure?

They wanted to know:
- How many babies died
- How many babies had serious problems with movement or thinking
- Whether stem cells were safe

### What types of babies would be in these studies?

The studies would include newborn babies who had brain injury from low oxygen during or after birth.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

The researchers found no completed studies. They looked at 616 research papers. None of these papers reported finished studies that tested stem cells in babies with brain injury.

### Are there any studies happening now?

Yes. The researchers found 15 studies that are happening right now. These studies are testing stem cells in babies. But none of these studies are finished yet. We do not have results from them.

### What does this mean?

Right now, we do not know if stem cells help babies with brain injury from low oxygen. We also do not know if stem cells are safe for these babies. We need to wait for the ongoing studies to finish.

### What do the researchers conclude?

There is no proof yet that stem cells help or harm babies with this type of brain injury. Doctors should not use stem cells to treat these babies outside of research studies. We need more research to answer this important question.

### Why is this important?

Many babies suffer from brain injury due to low oxygen. Current treatments do not help all babies. Stem cells might offer hope. But we must test them carefully first. The ongoing studies will help us learn if stem cells are a good treatment option for these babies.",10.1002-14651858.CD013202,"Stem cell‐based therapies following poor brain oxygenation at birth (hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy) in newborns 
Review question 
Do stem cell‐based therapies save the lives, or improve the long‐term development, of newborns who have poor brain oxygenation at birth ('hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy')? 
Background 
Lack of oxygen at birth may damage the brain of the newborn. Babies with less severe brain damage may make a full recovery or only have mild problems. For other babies with more serious damage, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. For instance, some of these babies develop cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, or other problems. We currently have  only cooling as an approach to treat this condition. The aim of this review was to assess if stem cell‐based therapies could reduce death and improve the long‐term development of newborns with poor brain oxygenation at birth. During stem cell‐based therapy, stem cells are given to the baby, for instance through injections. These stem cells may have come from humans or animals and may have been taken from cord blood, bone marrow or other parts of the body. These cells then repair the brain cells that the lack of oxygen has damaged. 
Key results 
We were not able to include any studies in our review. We identified three potential studies, but we excluded them due to the way they were designed which meant that their results could not answer our review question (phase 1 studies). Fifteen studies are ongoing. 
How up to date is this review?

Melanoma accounts for a small proportion of all skin cancer cases but is responsible for most skin cancer‐related deaths. Early detection and treatment can improve survival. Smartphone applications are readily accessible and potentially offer an instant risk assessment of the likelihood of malignancy so that the right people seek further medical attention from a clinician for more detailed assessment of the lesion. There is, however, a risk that melanomas will be missed and treatment delayed if the application reassures the user that their lesion is low risk. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone applications to rule out cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in adults with concerns about suspicious skin lesions. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design evaluating smartphone applications intended for use by individuals in a community setting who have lesions that might be suspicious for melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants versus a reference standard of histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up and expert opinion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). Due to scarcity of data and poor quality of studies, we did not perform a meta‐analysis for this review. For illustrative purposes, we plotted estimates of sensitivity and specificity on coupled forest plots for each application under consideration. 
Main results
This review reports on two cohorts of lesions published in two studies. Both studies were at high risk of bias from selective participant recruitment and high rates of non‐evaluable images. Concerns about applicability of findings were high due to inclusion only of lesions already selected for excision in a dermatology clinic setting, and image acquisition by clinicians rather than by smartphone app users. 
We report data for five mobile phone applications and 332 suspicious skin lesions with 86 melanomas across the two studies. Across the four artificial intelligence‐based applications that classified lesion images (photographs) as melanomas (one application) or as high risk or 'problematic' lesions (three applications) using a pre‐programmed algorithm, sensitivities ranged from 7% (95% CI 2% to 16%) to 73% (95% CI 52% to 88%) and specificities from 37% (95% CI 29% to 46%) to 94% (95% CI 87% to 97%). The single application using store‐and‐forward review of lesion images by a dermatologist had a sensitivity of 98% (95% CI 90% to 100%) and specificity of 30% (95% CI 22% to 40%). 
The number of test failures (lesion images analysed by the applications but classed as 'unevaluable' and excluded by the study authors) ranged from 3 to 31 (or 2% to 18% of lesions analysed). The store‐and‐forward application had one of the highest rates of test failure (15%). At least one melanoma was classed as unevaluable in three of the four application evaluations. 
Authors' conclusions
Smartphone applications using artificial intelligence‐based analysis have not yet demonstrated sufficient promise in terms of accuracy, and they are associated with a high likelihood of missing melanomas. Applications based on store‐and‐forward images could have a potential role in the timely presentation of people with potentially malignant lesions by facilitating active self‐management health practices and early engagement of those with suspicious skin lesions; however, they may incur a significant increase in resource and workload. Given the paucity of evidence and low methodological quality of existing studies, it is not possible to draw any implications for practice. Nevertheless, this is a rapidly advancing field, and new and better applications with robust reporting of studies could change these conclusions substantially. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Smartphone Apps That Check Skin Spots for Melanoma

## Plain Title
Can smartphone apps help people check if a skin spot might be melanoma?

## Rationale

**What is melanoma and why does it matter?**
Melanoma is a type of skin cancer. It does not happen as often as other skin cancers. But it causes most deaths from skin cancer. Finding melanoma early helps people survive. Getting treatment quickly is very important.

**Why study smartphone apps for melanoma?**
Many people now have smartphones. Apps on phones could help people check worrying skin spots right away. The app could tell someone if they need to see a doctor. This might help people get treatment faster.

**What is the problem?**
There is a risk with these apps. An app might say a skin spot is safe when it is not. This could make someone wait too long to see a doctor. The melanoma could get worse during this time.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know if smartphone apps work well. Can these apps correctly tell if a skin spot might be melanoma? Can they help people decide when to see a doctor?

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**
Researchers looked at studies done by other scientists. They searched for all studies about smartphone apps that check skin spots. They looked at studies published up to August 2016.

**What kinds of apps did they study?**
The researchers found two studies. These studies tested five different smartphone apps. The apps worked in two ways:

- Four apps used computer programs to look at photos of skin spots. The computer decided if the spot looked risky.
- One app sent photos to a real skin doctor. The doctor looked at the photos and gave advice.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included 332 skin spots from adults. These spots looked suspicious. Doctors had already decided to remove these spots. Out of all the spots, 86 were melanoma.

**How long did the studies last?**
The original studies do not tell us how long people were followed.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The four apps using computer programs did not work well:
- They found between 7 and 73 out of 100 melanomas.
- This means they missed many melanomas.
- They also said many safe spots were risky.

The app that sent photos to a doctor worked better:
- It found 98 out of 100 melanomas.
- But it also said many safe spots were risky.
- This would send many people to the doctor who did not need to go.

**What problems did the apps have?**

Many photos could not be used. The apps said between 2 and 18 out of 100 photos were too poor to check. The app using a real doctor had this problem often. Some melanomas were in these bad photos. This means some cancers were missed because of poor photo quality.

**What problems did the studies have?**

The studies had serious problems:
- Doctors took the photos, not regular people.
- All skin spots were already picked by doctors to be removed.
- This does not show how apps work in real life.
- Real people would take their own photos of many different spots.

**What do the results mean?**

Apps using computer programs are not good enough yet. They miss too many melanomas. This could be dangerous for people.

Apps that send photos to doctors might help some people. They could help people decide to see a doctor sooner. But many people would go to the doctor when they do not need to. This would create a lot of extra work for doctors.

**What do researchers conclude?**

Right now, there is not enough good information about these apps. The studies were not done well enough. We cannot say if people should use these apps.

But this field is changing fast. New apps might work much better. Better studies are needed to test new apps properly.

**Word count: 683**",10.1002-14651858.CD013192,"How accurate are smartphone applications ('apps') for detecting melanoma in adults?
What is the aim of the review? 
We wanted to find out how well smartphone applications can help the general public understand whether their skin lesions might be melanoma. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of malignant melanoma skin cancer important? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. Not recognising a melanoma (a false negative test result) could delay seeking appropriate advice and surgery to remove it. This increases the risk of the cancer spreading to other organs in the body and possibly causing death. Diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not present (a false positive result) may cause anxiety and lead to unnecessary surgery and further investigations. 
What was studied in the review? 
Specialised applications ('apps') that provide advice on skin lesions or moles that might cause people concern are widely available for smartphones. Some apps allow people to photograph any skin lesion they might be worried about and then receive guidance on whether to get medical advice. Apps may automatically classify lesions as high or low risk, while others can act as store‐and‐forward devices where images are sent to an experienced professional, such as a dermatologist, who then makes a risk assessment based on the photo. Cochrane researchers found two studies, evaluating five apps that used automated analysis of images and one that used a store‐and‐forward approach, to evaluate suspicious skin lesions. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included two studies with 332 lesions, including 86 melanomas, analysed by at least one smartphone application. Both studies used photographs of moles or skin lesions that were about to be removed because doctors had already decided they could be melanomas. The photographs were taken by doctors instead of people taking pictures of their lesions with their own smartphones. For these reasons, we are not able to make a reliable estimate about how well the apps actually work. 
Four apps that produce an immediate (automated) assessment of a skin lesion or mole that has been photographed by the smartphone missed between 7 and 55 melanomas. 
One app that sends the photograph of a mole or skin lesion to a dermatologist for assessment missed only one melanoma. Another 6 melanomas examined by the dermatologist via the application were not classified as high risk; instead the dermatologist was not able to classify the lesion as either 'atypical' (possibly a melanoma) or 'typical' (definitely not a melanoma). 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The small number and poor quality of included studies reduces the reliability of findings. The people included were not typical of those who would use the applications in real life. The final diagnosis of melanoma was made by histology, which is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had melanoma*. However, the studies excluded between 2% and 18% of images because the applications failed to produce a recommendation. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies took place in the USA and Germany. They did not report key patient information such as age and gender. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma was 18% and 35%, much higher than that observed in community settings. The definition of eligible patients was narrow in comparison to likely users of the applications. The photographs used were taken by doctors rather than by smartphone users, which seriously impacts the applicability of results. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Current smartphone applications using automated analysis are observed to have a high chance of missing melanomas (false negatives). Store‐and‐forward image applications could have a potential role in the timely identification of people with potentially malignant lesions by facilitating early engagement of those with suspicious skin lesions, but they have resource and workload implications. 
The development of applications to help identify people who might have melanoma is a fast‐moving field. The emergence of new applications, higher quality and better reported studies could change the conclusions of this review substantially. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.

The prevalence of non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life expectancy and increases risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the requirement for liver transplantation. Uncertainty surrounds relative benefits and harms of various nutritional supplements in NAFLD. Currently no nutritional supplement is recommended for people with NAFLD. 
Objectives
• To assess the benefits and harms of different nutritional supplements for treatment of NAFLD through a network meta‐analysis• To generate rankings of different nutritional supplements according to their safety and efficacy 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until February 2021 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with NAFLD. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) for people with NAFLD, irrespective of method of diagnosis, age and diabetic status of participants, or presence of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. 
Data collection and analysis
We performed a network meta‐analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods whenever possible and calculated differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available‐case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. 
Main results
We included in the review a total of 202 randomised clinical trials (14,200 participants). Nineteen trials were at low risk of bias. A total of 32 different interventions were compared in these trials. A total of 115 trials (7732 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The remaining trials did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. 
Follow‐up ranged from 1 month to 28 months. The follow‐up period in trials that reported clinical outcomes was 2 months to 28 months. During this follow‐up period, clinical events related to NAFLD such as mortality, liver cirrhosis, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver‐related mortality were sparse. 
We did not calculate effect estimates for mortality because of sparse data (zero events for at least one of the groups in the trial). None of the trials reported that they measured overall health‐related quality of life using a validated scale. The evidence is very uncertain about effects of interventions on serious adverse events (number of people or number of events). 
We are very uncertain about effects on adverse events of most of the supplements that we investigated, as the evidence is of very low certainty. However, people taking PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) may be more likely to experience an adverse event than those not receiving an active intervention (network meta‐analysis results: OR 4.44, 95% CrI 2.40 to 8.48; low‐certainty evidence; 4 trials, 203 participants; direct evidence: OR 4.43, 95% CrI 2.43 to 8.42). People who take other supplements (a category that includes nutritional supplements other than vitamins, fatty acids, phospholipids, and antioxidants) had higher numbers of adverse events than those not receiving an active intervention (network meta‐analysis: rate ratio 1.73, 95% CrI 1.26 to 2.41; 6 trials, 291 participants; direct evidence: rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.25 to 2.40; low‐certainty evidence). 
Data were sparse (zero events in all groups in the trial) for liver transplantation, liver decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. So, we did not perform formal analysis for these outcomes. The evidence is very uncertain about effects of other antioxidants (antioxidants other than vitamins) compared to no active intervention on liver cirrhosis (HR 1.68, 95% CrI 0.23 to 15.10; 1 trial, 99 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
The evidence is very uncertain about effects of interventions in any of the remaining comparisons, or data were sparse (with zero events in at least one of the groups), precluding formal calculations of effect estimates. 
Data were probably because of the very short follow‐up period (2 months to 28 months). It takes follow‐up of 8 to 28 years to detect differences in mortality between people with NAFLD and the general population. Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in clinical outcomes are noted in trials providing less than 5 to 10 years of follow‐up. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about effects of nutritional supplementation compared to no additional intervention on all clinical outcomes for people with non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease. 
Accordingly, high‐quality randomised comparative clinical trials with adequate follow‐up are needed. We propose registry‐based randomised clinical trials or cohort multiple randomised clinical trials (study design in which multiple interventions are trialed within large longitudinal cohorts of patients to gain efficiencies and align trials more closely to standard clinical practice) comparing interventions such as vitamin E, prebiotics/probiotics/synbiotics, PUFAs, and no nutritional supplementation. The reason for the choice of interventions is the impact of these interventions on indirect outcomes, which may translate to clinical benefit. Outcomes in such trials should be mortality, health‐related quality of life, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and resource utilisation measures including costs of intervention and decreased healthcare utilisation after minimum follow‐up of 8 years (to find meaningful differences in clinically important outcomes). 
","# Plain Language Summary: Nutritional Supplements for Non-Alcohol-Related Fatty Liver Disease

## Plain Title

Do nutritional supplements help people with fatty liver disease not caused by alcohol?

## Rationale

**What is fatty liver disease?**

Fatty liver disease happens when too much fat builds up in the liver. When this is not caused by drinking alcohol, it is called non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease, or NAFLD. Between 19 and 33 out of every 100 people have this condition.

**Why is this a problem?**

NAFLD can shorten how long people live. It can lead to serious liver problems. The liver can become scarred (called cirrhosis). People may develop liver cancer. Some people may need a new liver (called a liver transplant).

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors do not know if nutritional supplements can help people with NAFLD. Right now, no supplements are recommended for this condition. Researchers wanted to find out if any supplements work and if they are safe.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to see if nutritional supplements could help treat NAFLD. They wanted to know which supplements work best. They also wanted to know if supplements cause harm.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 202 studies that tested nutritional supplements. These studies included 14,200 people with NAFLD. The studies tested 32 different supplements.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included people of different ages with NAFLD. Some people had diabetes and some did not. The studies included both men and women. The way doctors found NAFLD in these people varied.

**How long did the studies last?**

People stayed in the studies from 1 month to 28 months. Most studies lasted less than 2 years.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not tell if nutritional supplements help people with NAFLD. The evidence was very uncertain for almost all outcomes.

**What about deaths and serious liver problems?**

Very few people died during these studies. Very few people developed serious liver problems like cirrhosis, liver cancer, or needed a liver transplant. This is because the studies were too short. It takes 8 to 28 years to see if NAFLD causes death. Most studies only lasted 1 to 2 years.

**What about quality of life?**

None of the studies measured how supplements affected people's daily lives or how they felt overall.

**What about side effects?**

Most supplements did not seem to cause more side effects than taking no supplement. However, the evidence was very uncertain.

Two types of supplements may cause more side effects:
- PUFA (a type of fatty acid): People taking this may be more likely to have side effects.
- Other supplements (not vitamins or fatty acids): People taking these had more side effects.

**Why was the evidence uncertain?**

The studies were too short. People need to be followed for at least 8 years to see real differences. Most studies only lasted 1 to 2 years. Also, many studies had problems with how they were done.

**What do the results mean?**

Researchers cannot say if nutritional supplements help or harm people with NAFLD. The studies were not long enough or well done enough to answer this question.

**What is needed next?**

Better studies are needed. These studies should:
- Follow people for at least 8 years
- Test supplements like vitamin E, probiotics, and fatty acids
- Measure important outcomes like death, quality of life, and serious liver problems
- Include many people
- Be done carefully

**Bottom line**

Right now, we do not know if nutritional supplements help people with fatty liver disease. We do not know if they are safe. More research is needed before doctors can recommend supplements for this condition.",10.1002-14651858.CD013157,"Nutritional supplementation for people with non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease
What is the aim of this Cochrane Review?To find out if any form of nutritional supplementation decreases effects of non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease on lifespan, health‐related quality of life, chronic liver disease, and its complications, and whether nutritional supplementation causes any harm. 
Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an accumulation of fat in the liver of people who have no history of significant alcohol consumption, use of medicines, disease such as hepatitis C virus infection, or other conditions such as starvation that can damage the liver. Fatty liver can lead to liver damage resulting in inflammation (non‐alcohol‐related steatohepatitis, or NASH) or liver scarring (liver cirrhosis). Various medical treatments have been tried for treatment of NAFLD. However, no current evidence suggests that any of them work. Nutritional supplementation has the potential to decrease liver damage, but whether this occurs is currently unclear. The authors of this review collected and analysed all relevant randomised clinical trials with the aim of finding out what is the best treatment. They found 202 randomised clinical trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups). During analysis of data, review authors used standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time. In addition, review authors used advanced techniques that allow comparison of multiple treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network (or indirect) meta‐analysis'). 
Date of literature searchFebruary 2021. 
Key messagesOnly 19 trials were at low risk of bias, and because of this, uncertainty about the findings of this review is considerable. Studies that reported clinically important liver damage or its complications studied participants for a period of 2 months to 28 months. During this period, clinically important outcomes related to NAFLD such as death, liver‐related complications such as liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver decompensation (complications caused by scarring of the liver), liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), and death due to liver disease were rare, even without any treatment. No evidence suggests that any nutritional supplementation decreased these. A possible reason for complications of liver disease being rare in trial participants may be the short follow‐up period given in these trials (participants were followed only for a period of 2 months to 28 months). Liver‐related complications due to NAFLD develop over 8 to 28 years. Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in clinical outcomes can be noted in trials with less than 5 to 10 years of follow‐up. 
What was studied in the Review?This Review looked at people of any sex, age, and ethnic origin, with non‐alcohol‐related liver disease. Review authors excluded studies of people with previous liver transplantation. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 7 to 61 years. Participants were given different treatments including various vitamins and other nutritional supplements. Review authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death, quality of life, serious and non‐serious adverse events, severe liver damage, complications resulting from severe liver damage, liver cancer, and death due to liver damage ('clinical outcomes').What were the main results of the Review?The 202 studies included 14,200 participants. Study data were sparse. In all, 115 studies with 7732 participants provided data for analyses. Follow‐up of trial participants ranged from 1 month to 28 months (2 months to 28 months for trials that reported clinical outcomes). The Review shows the following.‐ The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about effects of interventions on all clinical outcomes.‐ Well‐designed trials that collect data over longer follow‐up times are needed in the future to find out the best nutritional supplementation (if any) for people with NAFLD.

## Plain Title
Comparing Antibiotic Treatments for Lung Infections in Hospitalized Adults

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Pneumonia is a serious lung infection. When people get pneumonia outside of hospitals or clinics, doctors call it community-acquired pneumonia, or CAP.

**What causes it?**
Many different germs can cause CAP. Doctors group these germs into two types: ""typical"" and ""atypical."" The most common typical germ is called Streptococcus pneumoniae. The atypical germs include Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae.

**Why is this a problem?**
Doctors usually cannot tell which germ caused the pneumonia. So they must guess which antibiotic to use. Most doctors give antibiotics that work against both typical and atypical germs. However, no one has proven that covering atypical germs is really needed.

**Why was this study needed?**
Current treatment guidelines say to cover both types of germs. But earlier research showed no clear benefit from covering atypical germs. The researchers wanted to update their review to see if newer studies changed this finding.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This was not a single new study. Instead, researchers looked at 28 existing studies. They combined the results to get a clearer answer. This type of review is called a Cochrane review.

**Who was studied?**
The review included 5,939 adult patients. All patients were in the hospital with CAP.

**What did researchers compare?**
Researchers compared two groups of patients:
- One group got antibiotics that work against atypical germs
- The other group got antibiotics that do not work against atypical germs

**What did researchers measure?**
They looked at several outcomes:
- How many patients died
- How many patients got better
- How many patients had side effects
- How many patients had to stop treatment due to side effects

## Results

**What were the main results?**
The antibiotics that covered atypical germs did not work better than those that did not. The key findings were:

- Death rates were the same in both groups
- The number of patients who got better was the same in both groups
- The total number of side effects was similar in both groups
- The number of patients who stopped treatment was similar in both groups
- Patients taking antibiotics for atypical germs had fewer stomach problems

**What does this mean for patients?**
For most hospitalized adults with CAP, antibiotics that cover atypical germs may not be necessary. Antibiotics that only cover typical germs appear to work just as well.

**What are the limitations?**
This review has some important limitations:

Only one study tested the main question doctors face. That question is: should I add an atypical antibiotic to a typical one? Most studies compared one atypical antibiotic alone to one typical antibiotic alone.

Most studies (17 out of 27) were open label. This means doctors and patients knew which treatment was given. This can affect results.

Drug companies paid for 21 of the 27 studies. Almost all of these were paid for by the company that made the atypical antibiotic. This could create bias in the results.

**What do the researchers conclude?**
Based on current evidence, antibiotics covering atypical germs do not appear better than those that do not. However, more high-quality studies are needed. These studies should directly compare adding an atypical antibiotic to not adding one.",10.1002-14651858.CD004418,"Initial antibiotic treatment for coverage of 'atypical' pathogens for community‐acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults

Germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage (GMH‐IVH) remains a substantial issue in neonatal intensive care units worldwide. Current therapies to prevent or treat GMH‐IVH are limited. Stem cell‐based therapies offer a potential therapeutic approach to repair, restore, and/or regenerate injured brain tissue. These preclinical findings have now culminated in ongoing human neonatal studies. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of stem cell‐based interventions for prevention or treatment of germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage (GM‐IVH) in preterm infants. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 1), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 7 January 2019); Embase (1980 to 7 January 2019); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 7 January 2019). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We attempted to identify randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials, and cluster trials comparing (1) stem cell‐based interventions versus control; (2) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of type or source versus MSCs of other type or source; (3) stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of type or source versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of other type or source; or (4) MSCs versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs. For prevention studies, we included extremely preterm infants (less than 28 weeks' gestation), 24 hours of age or less, without ultrasound diagnosis of GM‐IVH; for treatment studies, we included preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation), of any postnatal age, with ultrasound diagnosis of GM‐IVH. 
Data collection and analysis
For each of the included trials, two review authors independently planned to extract data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, type and source of MSCs, other stem cell‐based interventions) and assess the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomisation, blinding, completeness of follow‐up). Primary outcomes considered in this review are all‐cause neonatal mortality, major neurodevelopmental disability, GM‐IVH, and extension of pre‐existing non‐severe GM‐IVH. We planned to use the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
Our search strategy yielded 769 references. We did not find any completed studies for inclusion. One randomised controlled trial is currently registered and ongoing. Five phase 1 trials are described in the excluded studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently no evidence is available to show the benefits or harms of stem cell‐based interventions for treatment or prevention of GM‐IVH in preterm infants.

## Plain Title
Stem Cell Treatment to Prevent or Treat Brain Bleeding in Premature Babies: A Review of Available Studies

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some premature babies develop bleeding in their brain. This is called germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage, or GMH-IVH for short. This type of brain bleeding happens in a specific part of the brain. It is common in babies born very early.

Brain bleeding can cause serious problems for babies. It can lead to brain damage. It can affect how a baby grows and learns. Some babies may die from this bleeding. This is a major concern in hospitals that care for newborn babies.

**Why was this study needed?**

Right now, doctors have very few ways to prevent or treat this brain bleeding. Researchers are looking for new treatments that could help these babies.

Stem cells are special cells that can help repair damaged body parts. Scientists think stem cells might be able to fix injured brain tissue. They might help the brain heal, grow back, or work better after bleeding occurs.

Early research in animals showed that stem cells might help. Because of these promising results, researchers have started testing stem cells in human babies. This review was needed to see if any completed studies show whether stem cell treatment works for premature babies with brain bleeding.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers look for studies?**

The researchers searched medical databases for studies. They looked for studies published up to January 2019. They searched in many different places where medical research is stored.

**What kind of studies were they looking for?**

They wanted to find studies that compared stem cell treatment to no stem cell treatment. They also looked for studies comparing different types of stem cells.

For prevention studies, they wanted studies with very premature babies. These babies would be born before 28 weeks of pregnancy. The babies would be less than 24 hours old. They would not yet have brain bleeding.

For treatment studies, they wanted studies with any premature baby. These babies would be born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. They would already have brain bleeding shown on a brain scan.

**What did researchers plan to measure?**

They planned to look at several important outcomes. These included how many babies died. They also wanted to know about brain development problems. They planned to check if brain bleeding happened or got worse.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found 769 possible studies to review. However, they did not find any completed studies that met their requirements.

They found one study that is currently happening. This study is still enrolling babies and collecting information.

They also found five early safety studies. These studies were testing if stem cell treatment is safe. But these studies did not meet the requirements for this review.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, there is no evidence to show if stem cell treatment helps premature babies with brain bleeding. There is also no evidence about possible harms from this treatment.

**What are the conclusions?**

More research is needed. Doctors cannot yet say if stem cell treatment prevents or treats brain bleeding in premature babies. Families and doctors must wait for completed studies before knowing if this treatment works.

The ongoing study may provide answers in the future. Until then, stem cell treatment for brain bleeding in premature babies remains experimental.

Review question 
Do stem cell‐based therapies save the lives or improve the long‐term development of preterm newborns who have or may develop bleeding to the brain (""germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage"")? 
Background 
Newborns born too early (""preterm""), especially babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, sometimes develop bleeding to the brain. Babies with less severe bleeding may make a full recovery or may have only mild problems. For other babies with more serious bleeding, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. For instance, some of these babies develop cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, or other problems. Currently no approaches are available to prevent or treat this condition.   
The aim of this review was to assess whether stem cell‐based therapies could reduce death and improve the long‐term development of newborns born too early. During cell stem‐based therapy, stem cells are given to the baby, for instance, through injection. These stem cells may have come from humans or animals and may have been taken from cord blood, bone marrow, or other parts of the body. These cells then repair the brain cells that have been damaged by bleeding.  
Key results 
We were not able to include any studies in our review. We did identify five studies, but we excluded them because of the way they were designed, which meant that their results could not answer our review question (all were ""phase 1"" studies).

There are many accepted airway clearance techniques (ACTs) for managing the respiratory health of people with cystic fibrosis (CF); none of which demonstrate superiority. Other Cochrane Reviews have reported short‐term effects related to mucus transport, but no evidence supporting long‐term benefits. Exercise is an alternative ACT thought to produce shearing forces within the lung parenchyma, which enhances mucociliary clearance and the removal of viscous secretions. 
Recent evidence suggests that some people with CF are using exercise as a substitute for traditional ACTs, yet there is no agreed recommendation for this. Additionally, one of the top 10 research questions identified by people with CF is whether exercise can replace other ACTs. 
Systematically reviewing the evidence for exercise as a safe and effective ACT will help people with CF decide whether to incorporate this strategy into their treatment plans and potentially reduce their treatment burden. The timing of this review is especially pertinent given the shifting landscape of CF management with the advent of highly‐effective small molecule therapies, which are changing the way people with CF are cared for. 
Objectives
To compare the effect of exercise to other ACTs for improving respiratory function and other clinical outcomes in people with CF and to assess the potential adverse effects associated with this ACT. 
Search methods
On 28 February 2022, we searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
We searched online clinical trial registries on 15 February 2022.
We emailed authors of studies awaiting classification or potentially eligible abstracts for additional information on 1 February 2021. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled studies (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing exercise to another ACT in people with CF for at least two treatment sessions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for the included studies. They assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Review authors contacted investigators for further relevant information regarding their publications. 
Main results
We included four RCTs. The 86 participants had a wide range of disease severity (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ranged from 54% to 95%) and were 7 to 41 years old. Two RCTs were cross‐over and two were parallel in design. Participants in one RCT were hospitalised with an acute respiratory exacerbation, whilst the participants in three RCTs were clinically stable. All four RCTs compared exercise either alone or in combination with another ACT, but these were too diverse to allow us to combine results. The certainty of the evidence was very low; we downgraded it due to low participant numbers and high or unclear risks of bias across all domains. 
Exercise versus active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) 
One cross‐over trial (18 participants) compared exercise alone to ACBT. There was no change from baseline in our primary outcome FEV1, although it increased in the exercise group before returning to baseline after 30 minutes; we are unsure if exercise affected FEV1 as the evidence is very low‐certainty. Similar results were seen for other measures of lung function. No adverse events occurred during the exercise sessions (very low‐certainty evidence). We are unsure if ACBT was perceived to be more effective or was the preferred ACT (very low‐certainty evidence). 24‐hour sputum volume was less in the exercise group than with ACBT (secondary outcome). Exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics were not reported. 
Exercise plus postural drainage and percussion (PD&P) versus PD&P only 
Two trials (55 participants) compared exercise and PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial narratively reported a greater increase in FEV1 % predicted with PD&P alone. At six months, the other trial reported a greater increase with exercise combined with PD&P, but did not provide data for the PD&P group. We are uncertain whether exercise with PD&P improves FEV1 as the certainty of evidence is very low. Other measures of lung function did not show clear evidence of effect. One trial reported no difference in exercise capacity (maximal work rate) after two weeks. No adverse events were reported (1 trial, 17 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Adherence was high, with all PD&P sessions and 96% of exercise sessions completed (1 trial, 17 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There was no difference between groups in 24‐hour sputum volume or in the mean duration of hospitalisation, although the six‐month trial reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Quality of life, ACT preference and need for antibiotics were not reported. 
Exercise versus underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP) 
One trial (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group (very low‐certainty evidence). Trial investigators reported that participants perceived exercise as more fatiguing but also more enjoyable than bubble PEP (very low‐certainty evidence). There were no differences found in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The trial did not report the primary outcomes (FEV1, quality of life, exercise capacity) or the secondary outcomes (other measures of lung function, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations). 
Authors' conclusions
As one of the top 10 research questions identified by clinicians and people with CF, it is important to systematically review the literature regarding whether or not exercise is an acceptable and effective ACT, and whether it can replace traditional methods. We identified an insufficient number of trials to conclude whether or not exercise is a suitable alternative ACT, and the diverse design of included trials did not allow for meta‐analysis of results. The evidence is very low‐certainty, so we are uncertain about the effectiveness of exercise as an ACT. Longer studies examining outcomes that are important to people with CF are required to answer this question. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Can Exercise Help Clear Mucus from the Lungs in People with Cystic Fibrosis?

## Plain Title

Can exercise replace other breathing treatments to help clear mucus from the lungs in people with cystic fibrosis?

## Rationale

**What is cystic fibrosis and why is this important?**

Cystic fibrosis is a disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs. This mucus makes it hard to breathe. It can also cause lung infections. People with cystic fibrosis need to clear this mucus from their lungs every day.

**Current treatments**

There are many ways to help clear mucus from the lungs. These are called airway clearance techniques. They include special breathing exercises and chest physical therapy. People with cystic fibrosis often spend a lot of time doing these treatments each day. This can feel like a burden.

**Why study exercise?**

Exercise might help shake loose the sticky mucus in the lungs. This could help people cough it up more easily. Some people with cystic fibrosis already use exercise instead of other treatments. However, doctors are not sure if this is safe or if it works well.

**Why this study was needed**

People with cystic fibrosis and their doctors want to know if exercise can replace other mucus-clearing treatments. This was one of the top 10 research questions they identified. If exercise works, it might reduce the time people spend on daily treatments. This study looked at all the research done so far to answer this question.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

The researchers searched for all studies that compared exercise to other airway clearance techniques. They found four studies that met their requirements.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 86 people with cystic fibrosis. These people were between 7 and 41 years old. Some had mild lung disease. Others had more severe lung disease. In one study, people were in the hospital with a lung infection. In three studies, people were healthy and stable.

**What did the studies compare?**

The four studies compared different things:
- One study compared exercise alone to a breathing technique called ACBT
- Two studies compared exercise plus chest physical therapy to chest physical therapy alone
- One study compared exercise to an underwater breathing device

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies lasted different amounts of time. Some lasted only two weeks. One lasted six months.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not combine the results from all four studies. This is because the studies were too different from each other. The studies were also small and had problems with how they were done.

**Exercise compared to breathing techniques (ACBT)**

One study with 18 people found:
- Lung function stayed about the same with both treatments
- No one had problems during exercise
- People coughed up less mucus over 24 hours with exercise
- People seemed to prefer the breathing technique over exercise

**Exercise plus chest physical therapy compared to chest physical therapy alone**

Two studies with 55 people found:
- Results about lung function were unclear and mixed
- No one had problems with the treatments
- People completed almost all their treatment sessions
- One study found fewer hospital visits in the exercise group

**Exercise compared to underwater breathing device**

One study with 13 people found:
- No one had problems with either treatment
- People found exercise more tiring but more fun
- Both treatments helped clear about the same amount of mucus

**Overall conclusions**

The researchers are uncertain whether exercise works as well as other treatments. The evidence quality was very low. This means we cannot be confident in the results. The studies were too small and too different from each other.

**What does this mean?**

More research is needed to answer whether exercise can replace other airway clearance techniques. Future studies should be longer. They should include more people. They should measure things that matter most to people with cystic fibrosis, like quality of life and how they feel day to day.

Right now, people with cystic fibrosis should talk to their doctors before replacing their current treatments with exercise.",10.1002-14651858.CD013285,"Exercise versus airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
Can exercise replace other methods of airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? 
Background 
CF affects many systems in the body, mainly the respiratory system. It causes a build‐up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs which causes irritation and damage to the lining of the airways. CF treatment involves chest physiotherapy, also called airway clearance, which uses a range of devices or techniques to get rid of this mucus. It has been suggested that exercise may have a similar effect. Exercising results in a person taking different volumes and depths of breaths. This leads to pressure changes and forces within the airways that move secretions out of the lungs. We compared the effect on lung function of exercise versus other techniques, to see if exercise is a suitable alternative for people with CF. We wanted to answer our review question to potentially reduce their treatment burden. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 15 February 2022.
Study characteristics 
We searched the literature for studies where people received at least two treatment sessions of exercise or another airway clearance technique, and report on four studies including 86 people with CF in the review. The people in the studies were aged between 7 and 41 years and had varying degrees of disease severity. Three studies included people who were clinically well and one study included people admitted to hospital for a chest infection. The studies lasted between four days and six months and compared exercise (alone or in combination with another airway clearance technique) to other techniques. Two studies compared exercise with postural drainage and percussion (PD&P), one study compared exercise with the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) and one study compared exercise with underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP), also known as bubble PEP. Three studies received financial support from funding bodies such as the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, the Buffalo Foundation and the Romanian National Council for Scientific Research in Higher Education. 
Key results 
We did not find enough evidence to conclude whether or not exercise can replace other methods of airway clearance. We did not find any evidence to suggest that exercise was either better or worse than other methods to improve lung function or clear mucus from the airways, although exercising did improve people's exercise ability, and it was the preferred choice of treatment in one study. None of the studies reported any negative effects of exercise therapy. None of the studies evaluated quality of life or the need for extra antibiotic treatment. One study did suggest that exercise alone was less effective at clearing sputum than ACBT. 
Exercise versus ACBT 
One study (18 participants) found that a measure of lung function temporarily (up to 30 minutes) increased in the exercise group only, otherwise there was no difference between the ACBT or the exercise group. No adverse events were reported, and it is not certain if ACBT was thought to be more effective or was preferred. The exercise group produced less sputum than the ACBT group. The study did not report on exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics. 
Exercise plus PD&P versus PD&P alone 
Two studies (55 participants) compared exercise plus PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial described a greater increase in lung function with PD&P alone, while at six months the second study reported a greater increase with exercise plus PD&P (but did not provide data for the PD&P group). One study reported no side effects at all, and also reported no difference between groups in exercise capacity (maximal work rate), sputum volume or the average length of time spent in hospital. Conversely, the second study reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Neither study reported on quality of life, preference and the need for antibiotics. 
Exercise versus uPEP 
One study (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group and investigators reported that those taking part thought that, while exercise was more tiring, it was also more enjoyable than bubble PEP. We found no differences in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The study did not report on lung function, quality of life, exercise capacity, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Overall, we had very little confidence in the evidence because all four studies had few participants and two studies only presented results as a shortened report given at a conference.  
We do not think the fact that participants and people measuring the outcomes knew which treatment the participants were receiving influenced the results of outcomes such as lung function and sputum weight. We do not think the fact that these studies were financed should influence the interpretation of the results in this review.

Review question 
Should oxygen be used for people with lung scarring conditions, known as interstitial lung disease (ILD), whose oxygen levels drop when they exercise? 
Background 
Many people with ILD have a drop in their oxygen levels when they are moving about. This is because of their lung scarring. Oxygen can be given, to be used only when people are moving about, to prevent this drop. This is called ambulatory oxygen. This may help to improve symptoms of breathlessness and their ability to exercise. It may also improve their quality of life. This Cochrane review examined the evidence for any effect of ambulatory oxygen on the ability to exercise, breathlessness and quality of life. Cochrane researchers searched the available evidence up to 4th May 2016. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We included only three studies, which had a total of 98 participants with ILD. All three studies compared the effects of both oxygen and air in all participants while they did an exercise test, while preventing them from knowing which treatment they were being given. Two studies showed no helpful effects on the ability to exercise or on symptoms of breathlessness. One study showed that participants could exercise for longer with oxygen. None of these studies looked at the effect of oxygen on quality of life, survival, the cost of oxygen treatment or its effects on hospital admissions. No adverse events were reported in any of the studies. 
We also looked for studies of oxygen given after exercise in people with ILD (""short burst oxygen""), but did not find any studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
There were some problems with the way these studies were conducted. The included studies were small. Also, two studies did not make sure that the amount of oxygen given was enough to prevent a drop in oxygen levels when the participants were exercising. This could mean that they were not given enough oxygen. The overall quality of evidence in this review was low. 
Conclusions 
We cannot tell from these studies if ambulatory oxygen is helpful in people with ILD. More research is needed, which should look at the effect of ambulatory oxygen on exercise, breathlessness and also on quality of life in people with ILD. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using Oxygen During Activities for People with Lung Scarring

## Plain Title
Does Using Oxygen During Activity Help People with Scarred Lungs?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people have scars in their lungs. Doctors call this lung scarring or ILD. When people with lung scars move around or exercise, the oxygen in their blood often drops too low. This happens because the scars stop their lungs from working well.

**What problems does this cause?**

When oxygen levels drop, people feel very short of breath. They cannot do as much activity. This makes daily life hard. Simple tasks like walking or climbing stairs become difficult.

**What treatment was studied?**

Doctors can give oxygen to people when they move around. This is called ambulatory oxygen. People breathe in extra oxygen through a tube in their nose. They only use it when they are active, not when they rest.

**Why study this treatment?**

Researchers wanted to know if ambulatory oxygen helps people with lung scars. They thought it might help people exercise longer. It might make breathing easier. It might also make their quality of life better. This study looked at all the research done on this topic to find answers.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked for all studies about oxygen use in people with lung scars. They searched for studies up to May 2016.

**Who was in the studies?**

The researchers found three studies. These studies included 98 people total. All these people had lung scarring. Their oxygen levels dropped when they exercised.

**How were the studies done?**

All three studies tested both oxygen and regular air. Each person tried both treatments. The people did not know which one they were getting. This made the test fair. People did exercise tests while breathing oxygen or air. Researchers measured how long they could exercise. They also asked about breathing problems.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies only looked at single exercise sessions. They did not follow people over many weeks or months.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The three studies showed different results. Two studies found no helpful effects. People did not exercise longer with oxygen. They did not feel less short of breath. One study found that people could exercise longer when using oxygen.

**What was not studied?**

None of these studies looked at quality of life. They did not look at how long people lived. They did not study the cost of oxygen treatment. They did not check if oxygen affected hospital visits. The researchers also looked for studies about oxygen used right after exercise. They found no studies on this topic.

**Were there any problems?**

No one reported any bad effects from using oxygen in these studies.

**What were the problems with these studies?**

The studies had some issues. They were very small. Only 98 people total were included. Two studies did not give enough oxygen. The oxygen amount was not high enough to keep oxygen levels normal during exercise. This means people might not have gotten the help they needed. Because of these problems, the quality of evidence was low.

**What do the results mean?**

We cannot tell if ambulatory oxygen helps people with lung scars. The studies were too small and had too many problems. We need better research to know if this treatment works.

**What happens next?**

More research is needed. New studies should include more people. They should make sure people get enough oxygen. They should measure exercise ability and breathing problems. They should also look at quality of life. These studies would help doctors know if ambulatory oxygen really helps people with lung scars.",10.1002-14651858.CD011716,"Use of oxygen during activities for people with lung scarring conditions
Review question 
Should oxygen be used for people with lung scarring conditions, known as interstitial lung disease (ILD), whose oxygen levels drop when they exercise? 
Background 
Many people with ILD have a drop in their oxygen levels when they are moving about. This is because of their lung scarring. Oxygen can be given, to be used only when people are moving about, to prevent this drop. This is called ambulatory oxygen. This may help to improve symptoms of breathlessness and their ability to exercise. It may also improve their quality of life.

Individuals dying of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) may experience distressing symptoms such as breathlessness or delirium. Palliative symptom management can alleviate symptoms and improve the quality of life of patients. Various treatment options such as opioids or breathing techniques have been discussed for use in COVID‐19 patients. However, guidance on symptom management of COVID‐19 patients in palliative care has often been derived from clinical experiences and guidelines for the treatment of patients with other illnesses. An understanding of the effectiveness of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological palliative interventions to manage specific symptoms of COVID‐19 patients is required. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in individuals with COVID‐19. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), medRxiv); Web of Science Core Collection (Science Citation Index Expanded, Emerging Sources); CINAHL; WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease; and COAP Living Evidence on COVID‐19 to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions until 23 March 2021. 
We screened the reference lists of relevant review articles and current treatment guidelines for further literature. 
Selection criteria
We followed standard Cochrane methodology as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 
We included studies evaluating palliative symptom management for individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID‐19 receiving interventions for palliative symptom control, with no restrictions regarding comorbidities, age, gender, or ethnicity. Interventions comprised pharmacological as well as non‐pharmacological treatment (e.g. acupressure, physical therapy, relaxation, or breathing techniques). We searched for the following types of studies: randomized controlled trials (RCT), quasi‐RCTs, controlled clinical trials, controlled before‐after studies, interrupted time series (with comparison group), prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies, (nested) case‐control studies, and cross‐sectional studies. 
We searched for studies comparing pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control with standard care. 
We excluded studies evaluating palliative interventions for symptoms caused by other terminal illnesses. If studies enrolled populations with or exposed to multiple diseases, we would only include these if the authors provided subgroup data for individuals with COVID‐19. We excluded studies investigating interventions for symptom control in a curative setting, for example patients receiving life‐prolonging therapies such as invasive ventilation.  
Data collection and analysis
We used a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for non‐randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) to assess bias in the included studies. We included the following outcomes: symptom relief (primary outcome); quality of life; symptom burden; satisfaction of patients, caregivers, and relatives; serious adverse events; and grade 3 to 4 adverse events. 
We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
As meta‐analysis was not possible, we used tabulation to synthesize the studies and histograms to display the outcomes.  
Main results
Overall, we identified four uncontrolled retrospective cohort studies investigating pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in hospitalized patients and patients in nursing homes. None of the studies included a comparator. We rated the risk of bias high across all studies. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary outcome symptom relief, downgrading mainly for high risk of bias due to confounding and unblinded outcome assessors. 
Pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control 
We identified four uncontrolled retrospective cohort studies (five references) investigating pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control. Two references used the same register to form their cohorts, and study investigators confirmed a partial overlap of participants. We therefore do not know the exact number of participants, but individual reports included 61 to 2105 participants. Participants received multimodal pharmacological interventions: opioids, neuroleptics, anticholinergics, and benzodiazepines for relieving dyspnea (breathlessness), delirium, anxiety, pain, audible upper airway secretions, respiratory secretions, nausea, cough, and unspecified symptoms.  
Primary outcome: symptom relief 
All identified studies reported this outcome. For all symptoms (dyspnea, delirium, anxiety, pain, audible upper airway secretions, respiratory secretions, nausea, cough, and unspecified symptoms), a majority of interventions were rated as completely or partially effective by outcome assessors (treating clinicians or nursing staff). Interventions used in the studies were opioids, neuroleptics, anticholinergics, and benzodiazepines.  
We are very uncertain about the effect of pharmacological interventions on symptom relief (very low‐certainty evidence). The initial rating of the certainty of evidence was low since we only identified uncontrolled NRSIs. Our main reason for downgrading the certainty of evidence was high risk of bias due to confounding and unblinded outcome assessors. We therefore did not find evidence to confidently support or refute whether pharmacological interventions may be effective for palliative symptom relief in COVID‐19 patients. 
Secondary outcomes 
We planned to include the following outcomes: quality of life; symptom burden; satisfaction of patients, caregivers, and relatives; serious adverse events; and grade 3 to 4 adverse events. 
We did not find any data for these outcomes, or any other information on the efficacy and safety of used interventions. 
Non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control 
None of the identified studies used non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control. 
Authors' conclusions
We found very low certainty evidence for the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom relief in COVID‐19 patients. We found no evidence on the safety of pharmacological interventions or efficacy and safety of non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in COVID‐19 patients. The evidence presented here has no specific implications for palliative symptom control in COVID‐19 patients because we cannot draw any conclusions about the effectiveness or safety based on the identified evidence. More evidence is needed to guide clinicians, nursing staff, and caregivers when treating symptoms of COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. Specifically, future studies ought to investigate palliative symptom control in prospectively registered studies, using an active‐controlled setting, assess patient‐reported outcomes, and clearly define interventions. 
The publication of the results of ongoing studies will necessitate an update of this review. The conclusions of an updated review could differ from those of the present review and may allow for a better judgement regarding pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in COVID‐19 patients.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments to Help COVID-19 Patients Feel More Comfortable at End of Life

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?

Some people with COVID-19 become very sick and may die from the disease. Near the end of life, these patients often have distressing symptoms. They may have trouble breathing. They may feel confused or anxious. They may have pain.

### What is palliative care?

Palliative care means treating symptoms to help patients feel more comfortable. The goal is not to cure the disease. The goal is to improve quality of life and reduce suffering.

### Why was this study needed?

Doctors and nurses need to know which treatments work best to help COVID-19 patients feel better at the end of life. Many current guidelines are based on treating other diseases, not COVID-19. Researchers wanted to find out if medicines and other treatments actually help control symptoms in COVID-19 patients receiving palliative care.

### What treatments might help?

Doctors have used several types of medicines. These include opioids for pain and breathing problems. They also use other drugs to reduce anxiety and confusion. Non-medicine treatments like breathing exercises or massage might also help. But we need to know if these treatments really work and if they are safe.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

This was a review study. Researchers looked for all published studies about symptom control in COVID-19 patients receiving palliative care. They searched medical databases up to March 2021.

### What types of studies did they look for?

They looked for any study that tested treatments for symptoms in COVID-19 patients. This included studies with medicine treatments and non-medicine treatments.

### Who were the patients?

The researchers looked for studies with COVID-19 patients of any age or gender. These patients were receiving palliative care, not treatments to cure the disease. Some patients were in hospitals. Others were in nursing homes.

## Results

### What studies did the researchers find?

The researchers found only 4 small studies. All 4 studies looked at medicines for symptom control. The studies included between 61 and 2,105 patients. Some of the studies used the same group of patients, so the exact total number is unclear.

### What medicines were used?

Patients received several types of medicines:
- Opioids (strong pain medicines)
- Neuroleptics (medicines for confusion)
- Anticholinergics (medicines for breathing secretions)
- Benzodiazepines (medicines for anxiety)

These medicines were used to treat many symptoms. These included trouble breathing, confusion, anxiety, pain, breathing secretions, nausea, and cough.

### What were the main results?

In most cases, doctors and nurses said the medicines helped. They rated the treatments as completely or partially effective for relieving symptoms.

However, the researchers could not be certain about these results. The studies had major problems:
- None of the studies compared the medicines to other treatments
- Doctors and nurses rated the results, not patients
- The studies were not well designed
- The quality of evidence was very low

### What about safety?

None of the studies reported information about side effects or safety problems.

### What about non-medicine treatments?

The researchers found no studies testing non-medicine treatments like breathing exercises or massage.

### What do these results mean?

The researchers cannot say for certain whether these medicines help COVID-19 patients feel better at the end of life. The evidence is too weak to make recommendations. We also do not know if the treatments are safe.

More and better studies are needed. Future studies should:
- Compare different treatments
- Ask patients how they feel, not just doctors
- Follow patients over time
- Clearly describe what treatments were used

Until better studies are done, doctors must rely on their experience and guidelines from treating other diseases. The researchers plan to update this review when new studies are published.",10.1002-14651858.CD015061,"Which treatments are best for symptoms in COVID‐19 patients at the end of life?
The burden of symptoms at the end of life of COVID‐19 patients and helpful treatments 
COVID‐19 patients may show symptoms such as breathlessness or delirium at the end of life. The goal of palliative medicine is to relieve such symptoms with specific treatments. Treatments can be drugs, for example opioids, or non‐drugs, such as breathing techniques or relaxation.  
What was the aim of our review? 
To explore how well different interventions (drugs and non‐drugs) work for the treatment of palliative symptoms in COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. We included patients of all ages and with all comorbidities (additional medical conditions).  
What type of studies did we search for? 
We searched selected medical databases and trial registries until 23 March 2021. We included studies looking at how well different palliative treatments work to relieve COVID‐19‐associated symptoms at the end of life. We wanted to compare studies investigating different medicines or therapies, but we only found studies without a comparison group. Only one study reported the specific drugs used for individual symptoms. 
Key results 
We found four studies that were published in five papers. Individual papers included between 61 and 2105 participants, and two papers partially reported on the same participants. All of the included studies investigated different drug treatments for palliative symptom management in people with COVID‐19. 
Drugs for symptom control at the end of life 
All of the included studies reported on the effectiveness of palliative care for symptom relief. In all studies, clinicians or nursing staff rated symptom relief rather than the patients themselves. Since the quality of the evidence was very low, we do not know the true effect of drug treatments on symptom relief and have very low confidence in the results of the studies. We did not find any data on quality of life; symptom burden; satisfaction of patients, caregivers, and relatives; or safety of the drug treatments. 
Non‐drug therapies for symptom control at the end of life 
We did not find any data on the benefits and harms of non‐drug therapies for symptom control of COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. 
Conclusions 
Based on our findings, we could not draw any conclusions on palliative symptom control of people with COVID‐19. Future studies need to be designed better so that we can determine which treatments work for symptom control in people with COVID‐19.

Endotracheal intubation is a commonly performed procedure in neonates, the risks of which are well‐described. Some endotracheal tubes (ETT) are equipped with a cuff that can be inflated after insertion of the ETT in the airway to limit leak or aspiration. Cuffed ETTs have been shown in larger children and adults to reduce gas leak around the ETT, ETT exchange, accidental extubation, and exposure of healthcare workers to anesthetic gas during surgery. With improved understanding of neonatal airway anatomy and the widespread use of cuffed ETTs by anesthesiologists, the use of cuffed tubes is increasing in neonates. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of cuffed ETTs (inflated or non‐inflated) compared to uncuffed ETTs for respiratory support in neonates. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, and CINAHL on 20 August 2021; we also searched trial registers and checked reference lists to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster‐randomized trials comparing cuffed (inflated and non‐inflated) versus uncuffed ETTs in newborns. We sought to compare 1. inflated, cuffed versus uncuffed ETT; 2. non‐inflated, cuffed versus uncuffed ETT; and 3. inflated, cuffed versus non‐inflated, cuffed ETT. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. Two review authors independently assessed studies identified by the search strategy for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We identified one eligible RCT for inclusion that compared the use of cuffed (inflated if ETT leak greater than 20% with cuff pressure 20 cm H2O or less) versus uncuffed ETT. The author provided a spreadsheet with individual data. Among 76 infants in the original manuscript, 69 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this Cochrane Review. We found possible bias due to lack of blinding and other bias. 
We are very uncertain about frequency of postextubation stridor, because the confidence intervals (CI) of the risk ratio (RR) were very wide (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.35 to 5.25; risk difference (RD) 0.03, −0.11 to 0.18; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No neonate was diagnosed with postextubation subglottic stenosis; however, endoscopy was not available to confirm the clinical diagnosis. 
We are very uncertain about reintubation for stridor or subglottic stenosis because the CIs of the RR were very wide (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.49; RD −0.03, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.05; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No neonate had surgical intervention (e.g. endoscopic balloon dilation, cricoid split, tracheostomy) for stridor or subglottic stenosis (1 study, 69 participants). 
Neonates randomized to cuffed ETT may be less likely to have a reintubation for any reason (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.45; RD −0.39, 95% CI −0.57 to −0.21; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome 3, 95% CI 2 to 5; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
We are very uncertain about accidental extubation because the CIs of the RR were wide (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.12 to 5.46; RD −0.01, 95% CI −0.12 to 0.10; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
We are very uncertain about all‐cause mortality during initial hospitalization because the CIs of the RR were extremely wide (RR 2.46, 95% CI 0.10 to 58.39; RD 0.03, 95% CI −0.05 to 0.10; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
There is one ongoing trial. We classified two studies as awaiting classification because outcome data were not reported separately for newborns and older infants. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence for comparing cuffed versus uncuffed ETTs in neonates is limited by a small number of babies in a single RCT with possible bias. There is very low certainty evidence for all outcomes of this review. CIs of the estimate for postextubation stridor were wide. No neonate had clinical evidence for subglottic stenosis; however, endoscopy results were not available to assess the anatomy. 
Additional RCTs are necessary to evaluate the benefits and harms of cuffed ETTs (inflated and non‐inflated) in the neonatal population. These studies must include neonates and be conducted both for short‐term use (in the setting of the operating room) and chronic use (in the setting of chronic lung disease) of cuffed ETTs. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Breathing Tubes With and Without Cuffs for Newborn Babies

## Plain Title

Do breathing tubes with cuffs work better and are they safer than tubes without cuffs for newborn babies?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some newborn babies need help breathing. Doctors place a tube down the baby's throat and into the airway. This is called a breathing tube. The tube connects to a machine that helps the baby breathe.

**What are breathing tubes with cuffs?**

Some breathing tubes have a small balloon near the end. This balloon is called a cuff. Doctors can fill the cuff with air after placing the tube. The filled cuff helps seal the airway. This may stop air from leaking out around the tube.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Doctors often use tubes without cuffs in newborns. But tubes with cuffs work well in older children and adults. These tubes may:
- Stop air from leaking
- Reduce the need to change tubes
- Prevent tubes from coming out by accident

Researchers wanted to know if tubes with cuffs are safe and helpful for newborn babies.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies that compared:
- Breathing tubes with cuffs versus tubes without cuffs in newborns

They searched medical databases in August 2021.

**What did they find?**

They found only one study that met their needs. This study included 69 newborn babies. The study compared:
- Tubes with cuffs (filled with air only if needed) versus tubes without cuffs

The babies were divided into two groups by chance. One group got tubes with cuffs. The other group got tubes without cuffs.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers are very unsure about most results. This is because:
- Only one small study was available
- The study had some problems with how it was done

Here is what they found:

**Throat swelling after removing the tube:**
About 1 in 10 babies had throat swelling. This happened in both groups. Researchers cannot tell if one tube type is better.

**Severe throat narrowing:**
No babies had this problem in either group. However, doctors did not use cameras to check inside the throat.

**Needing a new tube for throat problems:**
Very few babies needed a new tube for throat swelling. Researchers cannot tell if one tube type is better.

**Surgery for throat problems:**
No babies needed surgery in either group.

**Needing a new tube for any reason:**
Babies with cuffed tubes may need fewer new tubes. About 4 in 10 babies with regular tubes needed a new tube. Only about 1 in 50 babies with cuffed tubes needed a new tube. This means cuffed tubes might help. But researchers are still very unsure.

**Tube coming out by accident:**
About 1 in 10 babies had this happen in both groups. Researchers cannot tell if one tube type is better.

**Death:**
Very few babies died in either group. Researchers cannot tell if one tube type is safer.

**What does this mean?**

There is not enough information to know if breathing tubes with cuffs are better or safer than tubes without cuffs for newborn babies. More studies are needed.

**What happens next?**

Researchers need to do more studies with more babies. These studies should test:
- Tubes with cuffs that are filled with air
- Tubes with cuffs that are not filled with air
- Short-term use during surgery
- Long-term use for babies with lung problems

These studies will help doctors know which tube type is best for newborn babies.",10.1002-14651858.CD013736,"Cuffed versus uncuffed endotracheal tubes for neonates
Background: newborn babies rarely need a tube placed in the windpipe; however, this may occur before a procedure or to help with breathing. The tube may or may not have a cuff. The standard of care in newborn babies is a tube without a cuff. Cuffed tubes are used more frequently in older babies and children to reduce leaks of gas around the tube, the risk of aspiration (breathing food, saliva, or stomach contents into the airways or lungs), the need to change the tube, or the tube coming out. 
Review question: in this review, we evaluated the evidence for or against using a cuffed tube in newborn babies. 
Study characteristics: we collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found one study enrolling 76 babies, of whom 69 met eligibility for this review. This review is up‐to‐date as of 20 August 2021. 
Key results: there is not enough evidence for or against tubes with a cuff to prevent airway problems. Newborn babies who have a tube with a cuff may require less frequent replacement of the tube for any reason and less frequent replacement of the tube to find the correct size than babies who had a tube without a cuff. 
Reliability of the evidence: we judged the reliability of the evidence to be very low. This is because only a few babies were in a single trial and there was possible bias. There is one ongoing trial. We classified two studies as awaiting classification because outcome data were not reported separately for newborns and older infants.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X‐linked recessive disorder characterised by progressive muscle weakness beginning in early childhood. Respiratory failure and weak cough develop in all patients as a consequence of muscle weakness leading to a risk of atelectasis, pneumonia, or the need for ventilatory support. There is no curative treatment for DMD. Corticosteroids are the only pharmacological intervention proven to delay the onset and progression of muscle weakness and thus respiratory decline in DMD. Antioxidant treatment has been proposed to try to reduce muscle weakness in general, and respiratory decline in particular.  
Objectives
To assess the effects of antioxidant agents on preventing respiratory decline in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy during the respiratory decline phase of the condition.  
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers to 23 March 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We included male patients with a diagnosis of DMD who had respiratory decline evidenced by a forced vital capacity (FVC%) less than 80% but greater than 30% of predicted values, receiving any antioxidant agent compared with other therapies for the management of DMD or placebo.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened studies for eligibility, assessed risk of bias of studies, and extracted data. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. The primary outcomes were FVC and hospitalisation due to respiratory infections. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, adverse events, change in muscle function, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow (PEF).  
Main results
We included one study with 66 participants who were not co‐treated with corticosteroids, which was the only study to contribute data to our main analysis. We also included a study that enrolled 255 participants treated with corticosteroids, which was only available as a press release without numerical results. The studies were parallel‐group RCTs that assessed the effect of idebenone on respiratory function compared to placebo. The trial that contributed numerical data included patients with a mean (standard deviation) age of 14.3 (2.7) years at the time of inclusion, with a documented diagnosis of DMD or severe dystrophinopathy with clinical features consistent with typical DMD. The overall risk of bias across most outcomes was similar and judged as 'low'.  
Idebenone may result in a slightly less of a decline in FVC from baseline to one year compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 3.28%, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.41 to 6.97; 64 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and probably has little or no effect on change in quality of life (MD −3.80, 95% CI −10.09 to 2.49; 63 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), range 0 to 100, 0 = worst, 100 = best quality of life). As a related but secondary outcome, idebenone may result in less of a decline from baseline in FEV1 (MD 8.28%, 95% CI 0.89 to 15.67; 53 participants) and PEF (MD 6.27%, 95% CI 0.61 to 11.93; 1 trial, 64 participants) compared to placebo. 
Idebenone was associated with fewer serious adverse events (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.04; 66 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and little to no difference in non‐serious adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; 66 participants; low‐certainty evidence) compared to placebo. Idebenone may result in little to no difference in change in arm muscle function (MD −2.45 N, 95% CI −8.60 to 3.70 for elbow flexors and MD −1.06 N, 95% CI −6.77 to 4.65 for elbow extensors; both 52 participants) compared to placebo. We found no studies evaluating the outcome hospitalisation due to respiratory infection.  
The second trial, involving 255 participants, for which data were available only as a press release without numerical data, was prematurely discontinued due to futility after an interim efficacy analysis based on FVC. There were no safety concerns. 
The certainty of the evidence was low for most outcomes due to imprecision and publication bias (the lack of a full report of the larger trial, which was prematurely terminated). 
Authors' conclusions
Idebenone is the only antioxidant agent tested in RCTs for preventing respiratory decline in people with DMD for which evidence was available for assessment. Idebenone may result in slightly less of a decline in FVC and less of a decline in FEV1 and PEF, but probably has little to no measurable effect on change in quality of life. Idebenone is associated with fewer serious adverse events than placebo. Idebenone may result in little to no difference in change in muscle function. 
Discontinuation due to the futility of the SIDEROS trial and its expanded access programmes may indicate that idebenone research in this condition is no longer needed, but we await the trial data. Further research is needed to establish the effect of different antioxidant agents on preventing respiratory decline in people with DMD during the respiratory decline phase of the condition.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Antioxidants to Help Breathing in Boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

## Plain Title

Can antioxidant medicines help boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy breathe better?

## Rationale

**What is Duchenne muscular dystrophy?**

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disease that only affects boys. It causes muscles to get weaker over time. The disease starts when boys are young children.

**What problems does DMD cause?**

As boys with DMD get older, their breathing muscles get weak. This makes it hard to breathe and cough. Weak coughing can lead to lung infections. Some boys need machines to help them breathe.

**What treatments are available?**

There is no cure for DMD. Doctors give boys steroid medicines to slow down muscle weakness. This helps boys stay stronger for longer.

**Why was this study needed?**

Scientists think antioxidant medicines might help protect muscles. Antioxidants are substances that may reduce damage inside the body. Researchers wanted to test if antioxidants could help boys with DMD breathe better.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

The researchers wanted to know if antioxidant medicines could slow down breathing problems in boys with DMD.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

The researchers looked for all studies that tested antioxidants in boys with DMD. They found two studies that tested a medicine called idebenone.

**Who was in the main study?**

The main study included 66 boys with DMD. The boys were about 14 years old. Their breathing was already getting weaker. They were not taking steroid medicines.

**What did the study do?**

Half the boys took idebenone pills. The other half took fake pills (called placebo). Neither the boys nor the doctors knew who got which pills. This makes the test fair.

**How long did the study last?**

The boys stayed in the study for one year.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers measured how much air the boys could breathe out. This test is called forced vital capacity or FVC. They also checked quality of life, side effects, and muscle strength.

## Results

**What did the study find about breathing?**

Boys who took idebenone had slightly less decline in breathing ability after one year. Their breathing got worse more slowly than boys who took placebo. The difference was small.

**What about quality of life?**

Idebenone probably did not change how boys felt about their daily life. Both groups had similar quality of life scores.

**Were there side effects?**

Idebenone was safe. Boys who took idebenone had fewer serious side effects than boys who took placebo. Both groups had about the same number of minor side effects.

**What about muscle strength?**

Idebenone did not change arm muscle strength. Both groups had similar results.

**What about lung infections?**

The study did not measure hospital stays for lung infections.

**What about the second study?**

A larger study with 255 boys was stopped early. The researchers stopped it because idebenone was not working well enough. There were no safety problems. Full results from this study are not yet available.

**What do these results mean?**

Idebenone may slow breathing decline slightly in boys with DMD. But the benefit is small. It does not improve quality of life or muscle strength. Idebenone appears safe to use.

**What do researchers conclude?**

More research is needed. Scientists should test other antioxidant medicines. They need to find better ways to help boys with DMD breathe easier.

**Important note:**

These results only apply to boys who were not taking steroid medicines. Most boys with DMD now take steroids. We need more studies in boys who take steroids.",10.1002-14651858.CD013720,"Antioxidants to prevent respiratory decline in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Review question 
What are the effects (benefits and harms) of antioxidants for preventing breathing problems becoming worse in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)? 
Background 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited condition where boys show signs of muscle weakness in early childhood that become worse over time. The muscles used in breathing become involved, which leads to shortness of breath and the need for artificial ventilation (a machine to support breathing). Treatment with antioxidants has been proposed to slow down the loss of muscle strength and the decline in breathing. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the evidence up to 23 March 2021. We included two studies in boys with DMD whose breathing was affected. Both studies compared the antioxidant medicine idebenone with a dummy medicine. One study included 66 participants between 10 and 18 years of age. The participants in this study were not receiving corticosteroids (medicines shown to be beneficial in DMD). The other study involved 255 children with DMD who were also taking corticosteroids. This study was stopped early for lack of benefit. The full results of the study are not yet available. 
Study funding sources 
The studies were sponsored by Santhera Pharmaceuticals, the maker of idebenone.
Key results 
Idebenone may result in slightly less of a decline in forced vital capacity (a measure of lung capacity), but probably has little or no effect on quality of life in patients with worsening breathing. Idebenone may result in less of a decline in the ability to force air out of the lungs and airways (based on tests of forced expiratory volume in the first second and peak expiratory flow). Idebenone was associated with fewer serious side effects than the dummy drug and has little or no effect on non‐serious side effects. Idebenone may have little or no effect on muscle function (arm strength). We found no studies that looked at hospitalisation due to respiratory infection. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the evidence was low.

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is the most common acute leukaemia affecting adults. Most patients diagnosed with AML are at advanced age and present with co‐morbidities, so that intensive therapy such as stem cell transplantation (SCT) is impossible to provide or is accompanied by high risks for serious adverse events and treatment‐related mortality. Especially for these patients, it is necessary to find out whether all‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an intermediate of vitamin A inducing terminal differentiation of leukaemic cell lines, added to chemotherapy confers increased benefit or harm when compared with the same chemotherapy alone. 
Objectives
This review aims to determine benefits and harms of ATRA in addition to chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone for adults with AML (not those with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (non‐APL)). 
Search methods
We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, study registries and relevant conference proceedings up to July 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also contacted experts for unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus ATRA in patients with all stages of AML. We excluded trials if less than 80% of participants were adults or participants with AML, and if no subgroup data were available. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were included, if they had a refractory anaemia and more than 20% of blasts. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. We used hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) and disease‐free survival (DFS; instead of the pre‐planned event‐free survival, as this outcome was not reported), and we calculated risk ratios (RR) for the other outcomes quality of life, on‐study mortality and adverse events. We presented all measures with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE methods. 
Main results
Our search resulted in 2192 potentially relevant references, of which we included eight trials with 28 publications assessing 3998 patients. Overall, we judged the potential risk of bias of the eight included trials as moderate. Two of eight trials were published as abstracts only. All the included trials used different chemotherapy schedules and one trial only evaluated the effect of the hypomethylating agent decitabine, a drug know to affect epigenetics, in combination with ATRA. 
The addition of ATRA to chemotherapy resulted in probably little or no difference in OS compared to chemotherapy only (2985 participants; HR 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.02); moderate‐certainty evidence). Based on a mortality rate at 24 months of 70% with chemotherapy alone, the mortality rate with chemotherapy plus ATRA was 68% (95% CI 65% to 71%). 
For DFS, complete response rate (CRR) and on‐study mortality there was probably little or no difference between treatment groups (DFS: 1258 participants, HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; CRR: 3081 participants, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.09; on‐study mortality: 2839 participants, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.30, all moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Three trials with 1428 participants reported the adverse events 'infection' and 'cardiac toxicity': There was probably no, or little difference in terms of infection rate between participants receiving ATRA or not (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether ATRA decreases cardiac toxicity (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.90; P = 0.02, very low certainty‐evidence, however, cardiac toxicity was low).  Rates and severity of diarrhoea and nausea/vomiting were assessed in two trials with 337 patients and we are uncertain whether there is a difference between treatment arms (diarrhoea: RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.47; nausea/vomiting: RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.85; both very low‐certainty evidence). 
Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence for a difference between participants receiving ATRA in addition to chemotherapy or chemotherapy only for the outcome OS. Regarding DFS, CRR and on‐study mortality, there is probably no evidence for a difference between treatment groups. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events are comparable to chemotherapy only. 
As quality of life has not been evaluated in any of the included trials, further research is needed to clarify the effect of ATRA on quality of life. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Adding Vitamin A to Chemotherapy for Adults with Acute Myeloid Leukemia

## Plain Title

Does adding a vitamin A-based drug to chemotherapy help adults with acute myeloid leukemia live longer?

## Rationale

**What is acute myeloid leukemia?**

Acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, is a type of blood cancer. It is the most common fast-growing blood cancer in adults. AML causes the body to make too many abnormal white blood cells. These bad cells crowd out healthy blood cells.

**Why is this a problem?**

Many people with AML are older adults. They often have other health problems too. This makes strong treatments like stem cell transplants very risky. Some patients cannot have these treatments at all. Doctors need safer treatment options for these patients.

**What is ATRA?**

ATRA stands for all-trans retinoic acid. It comes from vitamin A. In lab tests, ATRA helps cancer cells grow up into normal cells. This stops them from growing out of control.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know if adding ATRA to regular chemotherapy would help patients live longer. They also wanted to know if it was safe. This study looked at whether ATRA plus chemotherapy works better than chemotherapy alone.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 8 different studies. These studies included 3,998 adults with AML. The researchers did not do new tests on patients. Instead, they combined results from studies that other doctors had already done.

**Who was in these studies?**

All patients were adults with AML. Most were older adults. They did not have a special type of leukemia called acute promyelocytic leukemia.

**What did the studies compare?**

Some patients got chemotherapy alone. Other patients got chemotherapy plus ATRA. Doctors then compared how well each group did. Each study used different chemotherapy drugs. One study used a drug called decitabine instead of regular chemotherapy.

**How long did the studies last?**

The researchers looked at studies done up to July 2018. Different studies followed patients for different amounts of time.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found that ATRA probably does not help patients live longer. They looked at how many patients were alive after 24 months.

- With chemotherapy alone: 30 out of 100 patients were alive
- With chemotherapy plus ATRA: 32 out of 100 patients were alive

This small difference could be due to chance.

**Other important findings:**

The study looked at several other outcomes:

- Time before cancer came back: ATRA made little or no difference
- Number of patients whose cancer went away: ATRA made little or no difference
- Deaths during treatment: ATRA made little or no difference

**What about side effects?**

The researchers looked at harmful effects from treatment:

- Infections: ATRA probably did not increase infections
- Heart problems: ATRA might reduce heart problems, but heart problems were rare in both groups
- Diarrhea and nausea: The researchers are not sure if ATRA causes more of these problems

**What was not studied?**

None of the studies asked patients about their quality of life. This means we do not know if ATRA helps patients feel better day to day.

**What do these results mean?**

Adding ATRA to chemotherapy does not appear to help adults with AML live longer. It does not seem to cause more side effects than chemotherapy alone. But it also does not seem to provide extra benefits.

**What is still needed?**

More research is needed to understand how ATRA affects quality of life. Future studies should ask patients how they feel during treatment. This information would help doctors and patients make better treatment choices.

**Bottom line:**

Based on current evidence, adding ATRA to chemotherapy does not improve outcomes for adults with AML. Doctors and patients should discuss other treatment options.",10.1002-14651858.CD011960,"Treatment with all‐trans retinoic acid in addition to chemotherapy for adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (non‐APL) 
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aims to determine benefits and harms of all‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in addition to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone for adults with AML. We did not evaluate participants with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found eight studies. 
Key messages 
The addition of ATRA to chemotherapy did not show relevant differences in terms of overall survival (OS), but the subgroup analyses showed that there is potential benefit for ATRA in combination with a certain chemotherapeutic called decitabine , for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who already had successful chemotherapy and now receive therapy for maintenance. We assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate for OS, disease‐free‐survival and on‐study mortality. 
Rates of toxicities were low, therefore certainty of evidence is 'very low' to 'low' for the adverse events diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting and cardiac toxicity. For the adverse event infection, we judged the certainty of evidence as moderate. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events with additional ATRA are comparable to chemotherapy only. 
Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.
What was studied in this review? 
Acute myeloid leukaemia is a life‐threatening type of cancer that starts in the blood‐forming cells of the bone marrow and can cause many different signs and symptoms. It is classified into several subtypes, of which one subtype, acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is treated differently to the other subtypes. 
Almost 60% of patients are older than 65 years at the time of diagnosis. Because of advanced age and accompanying diseases an intensive therapy with high‐dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation often is not possible or is accompanied by high risks for serious adverse events and treatment‐related mortality. For these reasons it would be important to know a less intensive and dangerous therapy for older patients. 
All‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an intermediate product of vitamin A, had been integrated into treatment regimens for APL by the end of the 1980s. It is administered orally and is generally well tolerated but can induce a severe, life‐threatening complication called differentiation syndrome, which includes breathing difficulties and fever. 
The literature provides contradictory data about the benefit of ATRA for patients with AML. It has been reported to increase the sensitivity of AML cell lines to chemotherapy by reducing one protein, which is associated with poor response to chemotherapy and therefore is related to a poor prognosis.These reports have led to the assumption that ATRA added to chemotherapy may improve outcomes and might replace or reduce the intensity of chemotherapy for patients with AML. 
What are the main results of this review? 
We found eight relevant studies with almost 4000 patients in total, conducted in the UK, Germany and France. These studies compared chemotherapy in combination with ATRA with chemotherapy alone in adult patients (over 18 years) with AML. All the included trials used different chemotherapy schedules, as there are several types of chemotherapy regimens for AML. Only in one trial did participants receive a newer drug, decitabine, which has been licensed for the treatment of AML since 2012. 
Adding ATRA to chemotherapy probably makes little or no difference to OS. ATRA may be potentially beneficial in combination with decitabine, for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who receive therapy for maintenance, but these findings need to be explored by further research. 
For disease‐free‐survival, complete response rate and on‐study mortality there was probably no or little difference between treatment groups. 
The combination of ATRA probably did not lead to a higher infection rate. Regarding cardiac toxicity and diarrhoea, the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low, so we are uncertain whether the addition of ATRA is beneficial. 
Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.

## Plain Title
Comparing Birth Control Patches and Vaginal Rings to Birth Control Pills

## Rationale

**What is birth control and why do women need it?**

Birth control helps women prevent pregnancy when they do not want to become pregnant. Many women use birth control pills, which they must take every day. Missing pills can make them less effective.

**What other birth control options exist?**

Two other birth control methods are the skin patch and the vaginal ring. The skin patch is a small, thin sticker that women place on their skin. The vaginal ring is a soft, light device that women put inside their birth canal. Both the patch and ring contain two hormones: estrogen and progestin. These are the same hormones found in birth control pills.

**Why study these methods?**

Women might use patches and rings more correctly than pills. This is because patches and rings do not need to be used every day. Researchers wanted to know if these methods work as well as pills to prevent pregnancy. They also wanted to know if these methods are safe and if women like using them.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 18 different studies. Six studies tested the skin patch. Twelve studies tested the vaginal ring. In these studies, some women used patches or rings. Other women used birth control pills. The researchers then compared the results.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included women who needed birth control. The studies did not give details about the women's ages or other health information.

**How long did the studies last?**

The report does not say how long women stayed in each study.

## Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers found that patches, rings, and pills all work about the same to prevent pregnancy. All three methods had similar pregnancy rates.

**Did women use their birth control correctly?**

Women who used the patch said they used it more correctly than women who used pills. However, only half of the patch studies checked if women used their method correctly or if they got pregnant. Most of the ring studies did check these things.

**Did women stay in the studies?**

Women who used the patch were more likely to quit the study early than women who used pills. Women who used the ring were not more likely to quit early.

**What side effects did women have?**

Women who used the patch had more problems than women who used pills. These problems included:
- Breast pain or discomfort
- Painful periods
- Feeling sick to their stomach
- Throwing up

Women who used the ring had different side effects. Compared to women who used pills, ring users had:
- More vaginal irritation
- More vaginal discharge
- Less nausea
- Less acne
- Less irritability
- Less depression
- Fewer emotional changes
- Fewer bleeding problems

**How good was the information?**

The quality of information from the patch studies was low. The quality of information from the ring studies was moderate. Some studies did not explain how they put women into groups. Some studies lost track of many women. Some studies did not measure outcomes well.

**What do these results mean?**

Patches, rings, and pills all prevent pregnancy about equally well. Women may use patches more correctly than pills because patches do not need daily use. Rings and pills have different side effects. Women can choose the method that works best for them. Future studies should better track if women use their birth control correctly.",10.1002-14651858.CD003552,"Skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control

Loss of olfactory function is well recognised as a symptom of COVID‐19 infection, and the pandemic has resulted in a large number of individuals with abnormalities in their sense of smell. For many, the condition is temporary and resolves within two to four weeks. However, in a significant minority the symptoms persist. At present, it is not known whether early intervention with any form of treatment (such as medication or olfactory training) can promote recovery and prevent persisting olfactory disturbance. This is an update of the 2021 review with four studies added. 
Objectives
1) To evaluate the benefits and harms of any intervention versus no treatment for people with acute olfactory dysfunction due to COVID‐19 infection.  
2) To keep the evidence up‐to‐date, using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the latest search was 20 October 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with COVID‐19 related olfactory disturbance, which had been present for less than four weeks. We included any intervention compared to no treatment or placebo.  
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were the presence of normal olfactory function, serious adverse effects and change in sense of smell. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of parosmia, change in sense of taste, disease‐related quality of life and other adverse effects (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

We included five studies with 691 participants. The studies evaluated the following interventions: intranasal corticosteroid sprays, intranasal corticosteroid drops, intranasal hypertonic saline and zinc sulphate.  
Intranasal corticosteroid spray compared to no intervention/placebo  
We included three studies with 288 participants who had olfactory dysfunction for less than four weeks following COVID‐19. 
Presence of normal olfactory function 
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of intranasal corticosteroid spray on both self‐rated recovery of olfactory function and recovery of olfactory function using psychophysical tests at up to four weeks follow‐up (self‐rated: risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.68; 1 study; 100 participants; psychophysical testing: RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.63; 1 study; 77 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).  
Change in sense of smell 
The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of intranasal corticosteroid spray on self‐rated change in the sense of smell (at less than 4 weeks: mean difference (MD) 0.5 points lower, 95% CI 1.38 lower to 0.38 higher; 1 study; 77 participants; at > 4 weeks to 3 months: MD 2.4 points higher, 95% CI 1.32 higher to 3.48 higher; 1 study; 100 participants; very low‐certainty evidence, rated on a scale of 1 to 10, higher scores mean better olfactory function). Intranasal corticosteroids may make little or no difference to the change in sense of smell when assessed with psychophysical testing (MD 0.2 points, 95% CI 2.06 points lower to 2.06 points higher; 1 study; 77 participants; low‐certainty evidence, 0‐ to 24‐point scale, higher scores mean better olfactory function).  
Serious adverse effects 
The authors of one study reported no adverse effects, but their intention to collect these data was not pre‐specified so we are uncertain if these were systematically sought and identified. The remaining two studies did not report on adverse effects.  
Intranasal corticosteroid drops compared to no intervention/placebo  
We included one study with 248 participants who had olfactory dysfunction for ≤ 15 days following COVID‐19. 
Presence of normal olfactory function 
Intranasal corticosteroid drops may make little or no difference to self‐rated recovery at > 4 weeks to 3 months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.11; 1 study; 248 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No other outcomes were assessed by this study.  
Data on the use of hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and the use of zinc sulphate to prevent persistent olfactory dysfunction are included in the full text of the review. 
Authors' conclusions
There is very limited evidence available on the efficacy and harms of treatments for preventing persistent olfactory dysfunction following COVID‐19 infection. However, we have identified a number of ongoing trials in this area. As this is a living systematic review we will update the data regularly, as new results become available. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments to Prevent Long-Term Smell Loss After COVID-19

## Plain Title
Can early treatment help people recover their sense of smell after COVID-19?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Many people lose their sense of smell when they get COVID-19. For most people, their sense of smell comes back within 2 to 4 weeks. But some people have smell problems that last much longer. This can make life harder. People may not enjoy food. They may not smell danger like smoke or gas.

### Why did researchers do this study?
Researchers wanted to know if early treatment helps. They wanted to see if treating people right away stops long-term smell loss. They looked at different treatments like nose sprays and other medicines.

### What did researchers hope to find?
They hoped to find a treatment that helps people get their sense of smell back faster. They wanted to prevent smell problems from lasting a long time.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked for studies that tested treatments for smell loss. They only included good quality studies. These studies compared people who got treatment to people who did not.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included 691 adults with COVID-19. All of them had lost their sense of smell. Their smell loss had started less than 4 weeks before joining the study.

### What treatments were tested?
Researchers looked at four types of treatments:
- Steroid nose spray
- Steroid nose drops
- Salty water nose rinse
- Zinc pills

### How long did the studies last?
Most studies followed people for 4 weeks to 3 months.

## Results

### What did researchers find?

**Steroid Nose Spray**
Three studies tested steroid nose spray in 288 people. The results were unclear. Researchers could not tell if the spray helped people get their sense of smell back. Some studies showed possible benefits. Other studies showed no difference. The evidence was too weak to be sure.

One study asked people to rate their sense of smell on a scale from 1 to 10. The spray did not make a clear difference. No serious side effects were reported. But researchers did not look for side effects in a careful way.

**Steroid Nose Drops**
One study tested steroid nose drops in 248 people. The drops probably did not help much. People who used drops recovered about the same as people who did not. This study did not look at side effects.

**Other Treatments**
Some studies looked at salty water nose rinse and zinc pills. But there was not enough information to know if these treatments work.

### What does this mean?
Right now, we do not know if early treatment prevents long-term smell loss after COVID-19. The studies were small. The results were unclear. More research is needed.

### What happens next?
Many new studies are happening now. Researchers will keep looking for new results. They will add new information to this review as it becomes available. This will help doctors know the best way to help patients.

### Why is this important?
Millions of people have had COVID-19. Many have lost their sense of smell. Finding a treatment that works could help many people. It could prevent long-term problems. It could improve quality of life.

Why this is important 
COVID‐19 has been found to cause problems with the sense of smell. Sometimes this is a reduction in the ability to smell things, and sometimes it is a complete loss of the sense of smell. For many people this recovers in a short time, but for others it may last for weeks or months. This review considers whether there are treatments that people might take as soon as they have lost their sense of smell (within four weeks of the symptoms starting), to try and stop this becoming a long‐standing problem. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
We searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature to summarise the results. We also looked at how certain the evidence was, considering things like the size of the studies and how they were carried out. Based on this, we classed the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found five studies that had been completed. 
Intranasal corticosteroids compared to no treatment  
Three studies looked at this treatment. 
Nasal corticosteroid spray might make little or no difference to the sense of smell when measured with specific tests (rather than when asking people about their sense of smell). 
The rest of the evidence was of very low certainty, so we do not know whether a nasal corticosteroid spray is better or worse than no treatment at: 
‐ helping the sense of smell get back to normal (either people feeling that their sense of smell is back to normal, or having a normal sense of smell according to specific tests); 
‐ making people feel that their sense of smell has improved;
‐ causing any unwanted side effects.
Intranasal corticosteroid drops compared to placebo (dummy treatment) 
One study looked at this treatment.
Intranasal corticosteroid drops might not make any difference to the number of people who think their sense of smell has recovered at 30 days.  
We did find a number of other studies that are being carried out, but no results from these studies were available yet to be included in this review. 
What this means 
We do not know whether using a nasal corticosteroid spray or nasal drops has any benefit in preventing longer‐term loss of the sense of smell that is related to COVID‐19, or whether they may cause any harm. This review is a 'living systematic review' ‐ meaning that we will keep checking for new studies that might be relevant, and the review will be continually updated when any extra results are available. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to October 2021.

Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is characterized by tachypnea and signs of respiratory distress. Transient tachypnea typically appears within the first two hours of life in term and late preterm newborns. Supportive management might be sufficient. Non‐invasive (i.e. without endotracheal intubation) respiratory support may, however, be administered to reduce respiratory distress during TTN. In addition, non‐invasive respiratory support might improve clearance of lung liquid thus reducing the effort required to breathe, improving respiratory distress and potentially reducing the duration of tachypnea. 
Objectives
To assess benefits and harms of non‐invasive respiratory support for the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1996 to 19 February 2019), Embase (1980 to 19 February 2019) and CINAHL (1982 to 19 February 2019). We applied no language restrictions. We searched clinical trial registries for ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials, quasi‐randomized controlled trials and cluster trials on non‐invasive respiratory support provided to infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age or more and less than three days of age with transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Data collection and analysis
For each of the included trials, two review authors independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, duration of oxygen therapy, need for continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] and need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, etc.) and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomization, blinding, completeness of follow‐up). The primary outcomes considered in this review were need for mechanical ventilation and pneumothorax. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included three trials (150 infants) comparing either CPAP to free‐flow oxygen, nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation to nasal CPAP, or nasal high‐frequency percussive ventilation versus nasal CPAP. Due to these different comparisons and to high clinical heterogeneity in the baseline clinical characteristics, we did not pool the three studies. The use of CPAP versus free oxygen did not improve the primary outcomes of this review: need for mechanical ventilation (risk ratio [RR] 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01 to 6.99; 1 study, 64 participants); and pneumothorax (not estimable, no cases occurred). Among secondary outcomes, CPAP reduced the duration of tachypnea as compared to free oxygen (mean difference [MD] −21.10 hours, 95% CI −22.92 to −19.28; 1 study, 64 participants). Nasal intermittent ventilation did not reduce the need for mechanical ventilation as compared with CPAP (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 32.72; 1 study, 40 participants) or the incidence of pneumothorax (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.90; 1 study, 40 participants); duration of tachypnea did not differ (MD 4.30, 95% CI −19.14 to 27.74; 1 study, 40 participants). In the study comparing nasal high‐frequency ventilation to CPAP, no cases of mechanical ventilation of pneumothorax occurred (not estimable; 1 study, 46 participants); duration of tachypnea was reduced in the nasal high‐frequency ventilation group (MD −4.53, 95% CI −5.64 to −3.42; 1 study, 46 participants). The quality of the evidence was very low due to the imprecision of the estimates and unclear risk of bias for detection bias and high risk of bias for reporting bias. Tests for heterogeneity were not applicable for any of the analyses as no studies were pooled. Two trials are ongoing. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to establish the benefit and harms of non‐invasive respiratory support in the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. Though two of the included trials showed a shorter duration of tachypnea, clinically relevant outcomes did not differ amongst the groups. Given the limited and low quality of the evidence available, it was impossible to determine whether non‐invasive respiratory support was safe or effective for the treatment of transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Breathing Support for Newborns with Fast Breathing

## Plain Title

Does breathing support without a breathing tube help newborns who have fast breathing that goes away on its own?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some newborn babies breathe very fast right after birth. This is called transient tachypnea of the newborn, or TTN. ""Transient"" means it goes away on its own. ""Tachypnea"" means fast breathing. This usually starts within the first two hours after a baby is born.

**Why does this happen?**

Babies with TTN have extra fluid in their lungs. This fluid makes it hard for them to breathe. The babies work harder to breathe and breathe faster than normal. This can be scary for parents and uncomfortable for babies.

**What treatments are available?**

Most babies with TTN get better on their own with basic care. However, doctors sometimes give breathing support to help these babies. One type of support is called CPAP. CPAP stands for continuous positive airway pressure. It gently pushes air into the baby's nose to help keep the lungs open. Other types of breathing support are also used.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if breathing support helps babies with TTN. They wanted to see if it makes babies feel better faster. They also wanted to make sure these treatments are safe. The breathing support might help clear the extra fluid from the lungs. This could help babies breathe easier and get better faster.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies that tested breathing support in newborns with TTN. They found three studies with 150 babies total.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included babies who were:
- Born at 34 weeks of pregnancy or later
- Less than three days old
- Diagnosed with TTN

**What did the studies compare?**

Each study compared different treatments:
- Study 1: CPAP versus oxygen given through a tube near the nose
- Study 2: Nasal intermittent ventilation versus CPAP
- Study 3: Nasal high-frequency ventilation versus CPAP

All these treatments give breathing support without putting a tube down the baby's throat.

**How long were babies in the studies?**

Babies stayed in the studies until their fast breathing got better. This usually took a few days.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not combine results from the three studies. This is because each study tested different treatments. Also, the babies in each study were different from each other.

**Main findings:**

The studies looked at two important safety questions:
- Did babies need a breathing tube put down their throat?
- Did babies get air leaks in their lungs (called pneumothorax)?

The breathing support treatments did not change these outcomes. The results were unclear.

**Other findings:**

Two studies found that breathing support helped babies stop breathing fast sooner:
- CPAP helped babies recover about 21 hours faster than oxygen alone
- High-frequency ventilation helped babies recover about 5 hours faster than CPAP

One study found no difference in recovery time.

**Quality of the evidence:**

The quality of evidence was very low. This means we cannot be sure about the results. The studies were small. They had some problems with how they were done. More research is needed.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, there is not enough proof to know if breathing support helps or harms babies with TTN. Some studies showed babies got better faster. But the important safety outcomes did not show clear differences.

**Conclusions from the researchers:**

Doctors cannot yet say for certain whether breathing support is safe or helpful for babies with TTN. The evidence available is limited and low quality. More and better studies are needed to answer this question. Two more studies are currently being done. These may provide better answers in the future.",10.1002-14651858.CD013231,"The use of respiratory support without endotracheal tube (i.e. non‐invasive) in babies to manage rapid breathing (transient tachypnea of the newborn) 
Review question 
Does the use of respiratory support without endotracheal tube (i.e. non‐invasive) in babies with rapid breathing (transient tachypnea of the newborn) improve lung function and reduce the need for invasive respiratory support with an endotracheal tube? 
Background 
Transient tachypnea (abnormally rapid breathing) of the newborn is characterized by high respiratory rate (more than 60 breaths per minute) and signs of respiratory distress (difficulty in breathing). It typically appears within the first two hours of life in infants born at or after 34 weeks' gestational age. Although transient tachypnea of the newborn usually improves without treatment, it might be associated with wheezing in late childhood. The idea behind using non‐invasive respiratory support for transient tachypnea of the newborn consists of reducing fluid from small cavities within the lungs called the alveoli and providing support to the baby with breathing difficulties. This review reports and critically analyzes the available evidence on the benefit and harms of non‐invasive respiratory support in the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Study characteristics 
We identified and included three studies (150 newborns in total) comparing the use of non‐invasive respiratory support with oxygen (one study), or different types of non‐invasive respiratory support (two studies). We found two ongoing studies. Evidence is up to date as of February 2019. 
Results 
The very limited available evidence cannot answer our review question. Non‐invasive respiratory support did not improve lung function or reduce the need for respiratory support.

","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Does a Blood-Thinning Drug Called Antithrombin Prevent Brain Bleeding in Babies Born Very Early?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Babies born very early (before 32 weeks of pregnancy) often have serious health problems. One common problem is bleeding in the brain. Doctors call this ""intraventricular hemorrhage."" This bleeding can cause lasting harm to the baby.

**Why does this happen?**

Very early babies have low levels of a natural substance called antithrombin in their blood. Antithrombin helps control how blood clots. When babies don't have enough antithrombin, their blood may not work properly.

**What was the main idea being tested?**

Some doctors thought that giving antithrombin as a medicine might help prevent brain bleeding in very early babies. An earlier study suggested this might work. Antithrombin is a type of drug that stops blood from clotting too much.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors needed to know if giving antithrombin to very early babies actually helps prevent brain bleeding. This review looked at all the research studies done on this topic. The goal was to see if the evidence shows that antithrombin works and is safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a systematic review. That means researchers looked at all the studies that tested antithrombin in very early babies. They combined the results to see what the evidence shows.

**Who was in the studies?**

The review included two research studies. Together, these studies had 182 babies. All the babies were born very early, before 32 weeks of pregnancy. These babies weighed very little at birth.

**What did the studies compare?**

Some babies got antithrombin as a medicine. Other babies got a placebo. A placebo is a fake treatment that looks like the real medicine but has no active drug. The placebos used were sugar water or albumin solution.

**How long did the studies last?**

The review does not specify exact time periods. The studies followed the babies to check for brain bleeding and other health problems.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The studies showed that antithrombin did not reduce brain bleeding in very early babies. It also did not reduce the number of babies who died. Antithrombin did not improve any other important health outcomes either.

**Why are these results important?**

The results suggest that antithrombin may not help prevent brain bleeding in very early babies. However, the researchers only found two small studies. Only 182 babies were included in total. This is not enough information to be completely sure.

**What do the results mean?**

The evidence is too limited to give a clear answer. Antithrombin might help, or it might not help. It might even cause harm. Doctors cannot tell from these studies alone.

**What are the main conclusions?**

More research is needed. The current evidence does not prove that antithrombin prevents brain bleeding in very early babies. Doctors should not use antithrombin for this purpose until better evidence is available. The studies were too small to show clear benefits or risks.

**What should happen next?**

Larger studies with more babies are needed. These studies would give clearer answers about whether antithrombin works and is safe for very early babies.",10.1002-14651858.CD011636,"The use of the anticoagulant antithrombin to reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain) in very preterm infants

Systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), also referred to as hormone therapy, has long been the primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Additional agents have been reserved for the castrate‐resistant disease stage when ADT start becoming less effective. Abiraterone is an agent with an established role in that disease stage, which has only recently been evaluated in the hormone‐sensitive setting. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of early abiraterone acetate, in combination with systemic ADT, for newly diagnosed metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, two trials registries, grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to 15 May 2020. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials, in which men diagnosed with hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer were administered abiraterone acetate and prednisolone with ADT or ADT alone. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analysesusing a random‐effects model. We rated the quality of evidence according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results
The search identified two randomized controlled trials (RCT), with 2201 men, who were assigned to receive either abiraterone acetate 1000 mg once daily and low dose prednisone (5mg) in addition to ADT, or ADT alone. In the LATITUDE trial, the median age and range of men in the intervention group was 68 (38 to 89) years, and 67 (33 to 92) years in the control group. Nearly all of the men in this study (97.6%) had prostate cancer with a Gleason score of at least 8 (ISUP grade group 4). 
Primary outcomes 
The addition of abiraterone acetate to ADT reduces the probability of death from any cause compared to ADT alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 0.73; 2 RCTs, 2201 men; high certainty of evidence); this corresponds to 163 fewer deaths per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (210 fewer to 115 fewer) at five years. 
Abiraterone acetate in addition to ADT probably results in little to no difference in quality of life compared to ADT alone, measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐prostate total score (FACT‐P; range 0 to 156; higher values indicates better quality of life), at 12 months (mean difference [MD] 2.90 points, 95% CI 0.11 to 5.60; 1 RCT, 838 men; moderate certainty of evidence). 
Secondary outcomes 
Abiraterone plus ADT increases the risk of grades III to V adverse events compared to ADT alone (risk ratio [RR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.47; 1 RCT, 1199 men; high certainty of evidence); this corresponds to 162 more grade III to V events per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (105 more to 224 more) at a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
Abiraterone acetate in addition to ADT probably reduces the probability of death due to prostate cancer compared to ADT alone (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.68; 2 RCTs, 2201 men; moderate certainty of evidence). This corresponds to 120 fewer death from prostate cancer per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (95% CI 145 fewer to 90 fewer) after a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
The addition of abiraterone acetate to ADT probably decreases the probability of disease progression compared to ADT alone (HR 0.35, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.49; 2 RCTs, 2097 men; moderate certainty of evidence). This corresponds to 369 fewer incidences of disease progression per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (456 fewer to 256 fewer) after a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
The addition of abiraterone acetate to ADT probably increases the risk of discontinuing treatment due to adverse events compared to ADT alone (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.92; 1 RCT, 1199 men; moderate certainty of evidence). This corresponds to 51 more men (95% CI 17 more to 93 more) discontinuing treatment because of adverse events per 1000 men treated with abiraterone acetate and ADT compared to ADT alone after a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
Authors' conclusions
The addition of abiraterone acetate to androgen deprivation therapy improves overall survival but probably not quality of life. It probably also extends disease‐specific survival, and delays disease progression compared to androgen deprivation therapy alone. However, the risk of grades III to V adverse events is increased, and probably, so is the risk of discontinuing treatment due to adverse events. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Adding Abiraterone to Hormone Therapy for Men with Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer That Has Spread

## Rationale

**What is prostate cancer and why is it a problem?**

Prostate cancer is a disease where cancer cells grow in the prostate gland. The prostate is a small gland in men that sits below the bladder. When prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body, doctors call this ""metastatic"" cancer. This spreading makes the disease harder to treat and can shorten a person's life.

**What is the standard treatment?**

For many years, doctors have treated prostate cancer that has spread using hormone therapy. This treatment is also called androgen deprivation therapy or ADT. It works by lowering male hormones that help cancer cells grow. ADT helps control the cancer for a while, but it does not cure it.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors usually save stronger drugs for later, when hormone therapy stops working well. But researchers wanted to know if adding a drug called abiraterone acetate right from the start might help men live longer. This study tested whether giving abiraterone plus hormone therapy works better than hormone therapy alone for men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at two studies that included 2,201 men total. The men were split into two groups by chance. One group received abiraterone (1,000 mg once daily) plus a low dose of prednisone (5 mg) along with standard hormone therapy. The other group received only standard hormone therapy.

**Who was in the study?**

The men in the study were between 33 and 92 years old. Most were around 67 to 68 years old. All the men had prostate cancer that had spread to other parts of their body. Nearly all the men (98 out of 100) had aggressive cancer with a high Gleason score.

**How long did the study last?**

Researchers followed the men for about 30 months (2.5 years). Some men stayed in the study for up to 5 years.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The study found several important things about adding abiraterone to hormone therapy:

**Living longer:** Men who took abiraterone plus hormone therapy lived longer than men who took hormone therapy alone. Out of 1,000 men treated for 5 years, 163 fewer men died when they received the combination treatment. This was a clear benefit.

**Quality of life:** Adding abiraterone probably did not change how men felt about their quality of life. Researchers measured this at 12 months using a special survey. Both groups reported similar scores.

**Cancer-specific survival:** Men taking abiraterone were less likely to die from prostate cancer. Out of 1,000 men, 120 fewer died from prostate cancer over 30 months.

**Slowing cancer growth:** The combination treatment slowed down cancer growth much better. Out of 1,000 men, 369 fewer had their cancer get worse over 30 months.

**Side effects:** Men taking abiraterone had more serious side effects. Out of 1,000 men, 162 more had severe side effects (grades 3 to 5). These are side effects that need medical attention or can be life-threatening.

**Stopping treatment:** More men stopped taking abiraterone because of side effects. Out of 1,000 men, 51 more stopped treatment early compared to those taking hormone therapy alone.

**What do these results mean?**

Adding abiraterone to hormone therapy helps men with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer live longer. It also keeps the cancer under control for a longer time. However, this benefit comes with more side effects. Some men had to stop treatment because the side effects were too difficult to manage.

Doctors and patients should discuss these benefits and risks together. The treatment helps men live longer but may cause more health problems along the way. Each man needs to decide with his doctor if this treatment is right for him.",10.1002-14651858.CD013245,"Adding abiraterone acetate to androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer 
Review question 
The aim of this review was to find out what the effect of adding abiraterone was, in men with prostate cancer, who were receiving and still responding to hormone therapy. 
Background 
Abiraterone acetate is a medication that blocks the effect of male sex hormones, and thereby, slows down prostate cancer growth.  
More than 15% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer present with disease that has spread beyond the prostate. Another 15% to 30% of men who undergo primary treatment will experience a return of their cancer. Hormone therapy (drugs to reduce the level of male hormones) has been the main treatment for advanced disease, but this does not work forever. Recent studies have looked at whether drugs that block the growth of prostate cancer cells, such as abiraterone acetate, can improve how men do. 
Study characteristics 
We found two studies (specifically, studies in which 'chance' decided what treatment men got), with a total of 2201 men. The studies compared abiraterone acetate and hormone therapy to hormone therapy alone. In one of the studies, most of the included men had high risk prostate cancer, and had previously undergone local treatment. In the other study, most men had not had previous treatment to their prostate. The evidence is current to 15 May 2020. 
Key results 
Adding abiraterone acetate to hormone therapy improves overall survival but probably not quality of life. It probably improves cancer‐specific survival and reduces disease progression. However, there is also an increase in severe and life‐threatening side effects, likely leading to discontinued treatment, with the addition of abiraterone acetate. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence to be high for overall survival (time to death from any cause), and severe and life‐threatening side effects. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the actual effect for these outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was moderate for quality of life, cancer‐specific survival (time to death from prostate cancer), time to disease progression, and discontinued treatment due to adverse events. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the actual effect, but there were some limitations in the studies that reduced our confidence in the results.

The target population was individuals, regardless of age, who received a temporary or permanent enterostomy for any reason in either the elective (planned) or the emergency setting. 
Key results 
The results found inconclusive results between the two techniques for the risk of parastomal herniation (11 studies, 924 participants), stomal prolapse (1 study, 145 participants), ileus or stenosis (1 study, 60 participants), and skin irritation (1 study, 60 participants). 
Neither technique was found to be better than the other for any of the stoma‐related outcomes of interest. 
None of the studies measured other stoma‐related problems, or death.
Quality of the evidence 
We downgraded the quality of the evidence to moderate, low, or very low, because of high risk of bias, small sample sizes, few events, and diversity across studies. 
Conclusion 
Based on the current knowledge presented in this review, there is no evidence to support the use of one stoma formation technique over the other. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Ways to Create a Stoma: Placing It Next to or Through the Stomach Muscle

## Rationale

**What is a stoma and why do people need one?**

A stoma is an opening made in the belly during surgery. It lets waste from the bowel or urine leave the body. Doctors create a stoma when the normal path for waste is blocked or not working.

**What problems can happen with a stoma?**

One common problem is a parastomal hernia. This happens when tissue or organs push through a weak spot in the belly wall near the stoma. This bulge can cause pain and other issues for patients. It is one of the most common problems people with stomas face.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors use two main ways to create a stoma. One way places the stoma next to a belly muscle called the rectus abdominis. The other way pulls the stoma through this muscle. Doctors were not sure which way was better at preventing hernias and other stoma problems.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if one method caused fewer hernias than the other. They also wanted to see if one method led to fewer other stoma problems.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 11 earlier studies done by other doctors. They combined the results to find patterns.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 924 people total. These were adults and children of any age. All of them needed a stoma for different reasons. Some surgeries were planned ahead of time. Others were done in emergencies.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared two groups of patients:
- One group had stomas placed next to the belly muscle
- The other group had stomas placed through the belly muscle

**How long were people followed?**

The studies followed patients for different amounts of time after their surgery. This let doctors see if problems developed later.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not find clear proof that one method was better than the other.

**Main findings included:**
- Both methods had similar rates of hernias
- Both methods had similar rates of other stoma problems
- Problems looked at included the stoma pushing out too far, blockages, and skin irritation

**What does this mean for patients?**

Right now, neither method appears to work better. Patients can trust their doctor to choose the best method for their situation.

**Why are the results uncertain?**

The quality of evidence was not very strong. Here is why:
- Most studies were small with few patients
- The studies were not all done the same way
- Only one study assigned patients randomly to each method
- The studies had some flaws in how they were done

**What do researchers conclude?**

Based on current knowledge, doctors cannot say one method is better. Both ways of creating a stoma seem equally safe. More research with better study methods is needed. Future studies could change what doctors recommend.

**What was not studied?**

The studies did not look at death rates. They also did not measure some other stoma problems that can happen.

**Bottom line:**

Doctors can use either method to create a stoma. The choice may depend on each patient's specific needs. More high-quality research would help doctors make better choices in the future.",10.1002-14651858.CD009487,"Lateral pararectal versus transrectal stoma placement for prevention of parastomal herniation

Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is a widely used method to treat renal and ureteral stone. It fragments stones into smaller pieces that are then able to pass spontaneously down the ureter and into the bladder. Alpha‐blockers may assist in promoting the passage of stone fragments, but their effectiveness remains uncertain.  
Objectives
To assess the effects of alpha‐blockers as adjuvant medical expulsive therapy plus usual care compared to placebo and usual care or usual care alone in adults undergoing shock wave lithotripsy for renal or ureteral stones. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive literature search of the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, several clinical trial registries and grey literature for published and unpublished studies irrespective of language. The date of the most recent search was 27 February 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials of adults undergoing SWL. Participants in the intervention group had to have received an alpha‐blocker as adjuvant medical expulsive therapy plus usual care. For the comparator group, we considered studies in which participants received placebo. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion/exclusion, and performed data abstraction and risk of bias assessment. We conducted meta‐analysis for the identified dichotomous and continuous outcomes using RevManWeb according to Cochrane methods using a random‐effects model. We judged the certainty of evidence on a per outcome basis using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 40 studies with 4793 participants randomized to usual care and an alpha‐blocker versus usual care alone. Only four studies were placebo controlled. The mean age of participants was 28.6 to 56.8 years and the mean stone size prior to SWL was 7.1 mm to 13.2 mm. The most widely used alpha‐blocker was tamsulosin; others were silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin and alfuzosin.  
Alpha‐blockers may improve clearance of stone fragments after SWL (risk ratio (RR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.23; I² = 78%; studies = 36; participants = 4084; low certainty evidence). Based on the stone clearance rate of 69.3% observed in the control arm, an alpha‐blocker may increase stone clearance to 80.4%. This corresponds to 111 more (62 more to 159 more) participants per 1000 clearing their stone fragments. 
Alpha‐blockers may reduce the need for auxiliary treatments after SWL (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00; I² = 16%; studies = 12; participants = 1251; low certainty evidence), but also includes the possibility of no effect. Based on a rate of auxiliary treatments in the usual care arm of 9.7%, alpha‐blockers may reduce the rate to 6.5%. This corresponds 32 fewer (53 fewer to 0 fewer) participants per 1000 undergoing auxiliary treatments. 
Alpha‐blockers may reduce major adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.80; I² = 0%; studies = 7; participants = 747; low certainty evidence). Major adverse events occurred in 25.8% of participants in the usual care group; alpha‐blockers would reduce this to 15.5%. This corresponds to 103 fewer (139 fewer to 52 fewer) major adverse events per 1000 with alpha‐blocker treatment. None of the reported major adverse events appeared drug‐related; most were emergency room visits or rehospitalizations. 
Alpha‐blockers may reduce stone clearance time in days (mean difference (MD) –3.74, 95% CI –5.25 to –2.23; I² = 86%; studies = 14; participants = 1790; low certainty evidence). We found no evidence for the outcome of quality of life. 
For those outcomes for which we were able to perform subgroup analyses, we found no evidence of interaction with stone location, stone size or type of alpha‐blocker. We were unable to conduct an analysis by lithotripter type. The results were also largely unchanged when the analyses were limited to placebo controlled studies and those in which participants explicitly only received a single SWL session. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on low certainty evidence, adjuvant alpha‐blocker therapy following SWL in addition to usual care may result in improved stone clearance, less need for auxiliary treatments, fewer major adverse events and a reduced stone clearance time compared to usual care alone. We did not find evidence for quality of life. The low certainty of evidence means that our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Alpha-Blockers to Help Pass Kidney Stones After Shock Wave Treatment

## Plain Title

Do Alpha-Blocker Drugs Help Adults Pass Kidney Stones After Shock Wave Treatment?

## Rationale

**What are kidney stones and why are they a problem?**

Kidney stones are hard lumps that form inside the kidneys or tubes that carry urine. They can cause severe pain and make it hard to pass urine. Many people need treatment to break up or remove these stones.

**What is shock wave treatment?**

Doctors often use shock wave treatment to break kidney stones into smaller pieces. This treatment is called shock wave lithotripsy or SWL. The shock waves break the stones from outside the body. The small pieces then need to pass out of the body through urine.

**What are alpha-blockers?**

Alpha-blockers are drugs that relax muscles in the urinary tubes. This may help stone pieces pass more easily.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors were not sure if alpha-blockers really help after shock wave treatment. This study looked at all the research to find out if these drugs work.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 40 studies from around the world. They combined the results to get a clearer answer.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 4,793 adults with kidney stones. Their ages ranged from 29 to 57 years old. The stones were between 7 and 13 millimeters in size before treatment.

**What treatments did people get?**

Half the people got usual care plus an alpha-blocker drug. The other half got only usual care. The most common alpha-blocker used was tamsulosin. Other drugs used were silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin, and alfuzosin.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies tracked people until their stone pieces passed or they needed more treatment.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers found that alpha-blockers may help in several ways:

**Passing stone pieces:** Alpha-blockers may help more people pass all their stone pieces. Without the drug, 693 out of 1,000 people passed their stones. With the drug, 804 out of 1,000 people passed their stones. This means 111 more people out of 1,000 cleared their stones.

**Need for more treatment:** Alpha-blockers may reduce the need for more treatments. Without the drug, 97 out of 1,000 people needed more treatment. With the drug, 65 out of 1,000 people needed more treatment. This means 32 fewer people out of 1,000 needed extra treatment.

**Side effects:** Alpha-blockers may reduce serious problems. Without the drug, 258 out of 1,000 people had serious problems. With the drug, 155 out of 1,000 people had serious problems. This means 103 fewer people out of 1,000 had serious problems. These problems were mostly emergency room visits or hospital stays. None were caused by the drug itself.

**Time to pass stones:** Alpha-blockers may help people pass stones about 4 days faster.

**Quality of life:** The studies did not measure how people felt during treatment.

**How certain are these results?**

The researchers rated the certainty of these findings as low. This means the true effects might be different from what they found. More research is needed to be sure.

**What do these results mean?**

Alpha-blockers may help adults pass kidney stone pieces after shock wave treatment. They may work for stones in different locations and of different sizes. The drugs appear safe based on these studies.

**What should happen next?**

Doctors and patients can use this information when deciding on treatment. More high-quality studies would help doctors be more certain about these benefits.",10.1002-14651858.CD013393,"After using shock waves to break up kidney stones, do medicines called alpha‑blockers help to get rid of the stone fragments? 
What are kidney stones? 
Waste products in the blood can sometimes form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. These can build up over time to form a hard stone‐like lump, called a kidney stone. 
Kidney stones can develop in both kidneys especially in people with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain medicines, or if people do not drink enough water or fluids. Stones can cause severe pain, fever and a kidney infection if they block the ureter. 
Treatments for kidney stones 
Most stones are small enough to pass out in the urine: drinking plenty of water and other fluids will help. Larger kidney stones may be too big to pass out naturally and are usually removed by surgery. 
Shock wave lithotripsy is a non‐surgical way to treat stones in the kidney or ureter. High energy sound waves are applied to the outside of the body to break kidney stones into smaller pieces. After shock wave treatment, medicines called alpha‐blockers are sometimes given to help the stone fragments pass out naturally. 
Alpha‐blockers work by relaxing muscles and helping to keep blood vessels open. They are usually used to treat high blood pressure and problems with storing and passing urine in men who have an enlarged prostate gland. Alpha‐blockers may relax the muscle in the ureters, which might help to get rid of kidney stones and fragments.              
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out how well alpha‐blockers work to help kidney stone fragments pass out in the urine. We also wanted to find out about potential unwanted effects that might be associated with alpha‐blockers. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at giving alpha‐blockers to adults, after shock wave treatment, to clear kidney stone fragments. 
We looked for randomized controlled studies, in which the treatments that people received were decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to 27 February 2020. 
What we found 
We found 40 studies including 4793 people who had shock wave treatment to break up their kidney stones. Most of the studies were done in Asia; some were in Europe, Africa and South America. Most studies did not report their sources of funding. 
The studies compared giving an alpha‐blocker with giving a placebo (dummy) treatment or usual care (could include antibiotics, painkillers and fluids given by mouth or through a drip). 
Tamsulosin was the most commonly studied alpha‐blocker; the others were silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin and alfuzosin. 
What are the results of our review? 
Compared with usual care or a placebo treatment, alpha‐blockers may:
clear kidney stones in more people: in 111 more people for every 1000 people treated (36 studies); 
clear stones faster: by nearly four days (14 studies);
reduce the need for extra treatments to clear stones: in 32 fewer people for every 1000 people treated (12 studies); and 
cause fewer unwanted effects: affecting 103 fewer people for every 1000 people treated (seven studies). 
Most unwanted effects were emergency visits to hospitals, and people going back into hospital for stone related problems. Unwanted effects were more common in people who had usual care or a placebo treatment than in people given alpha‐blockers. 
None of the studies looked at people's quality of life (well‐being).
How reliable are these results? 
We are uncertain about these results because they were based on studies in which it was unclear how people were chosen to take part; it was unclear if results were reported fully; some results were inconsistent and in some studies the results varied widely.  Our results are likely to change if further evidence becomes available. 
Conclusions 
Giving an alpha‐blocker after shock wave treatment to break up kidney stones might clear the fragments faster, in more people and reduce the need for extra treatments. Alpha‑blockers might cause fewer unwanted effects than usual care or a placebo.

Interleukin‐1 (IL‐1) blocking agents have been used for treating severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), on the premise that their immunomodulatory effect might be beneficial in people with COVID‐19. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of IL‐1 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo on effectiveness and safety outcomes in people with COVID‐19. 
We will update this assessment regularly.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the COVID‐19 L‐OVE Platform (search date 5 November 2021). These sources are maintained through regular searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, trial registers and other sources. We also checked the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, regulatory agency websites, Retraction Watch (search date 3 November 2021). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IL‐1 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo for people with COVID‐19, regardless of disease severity. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed Cochrane methodology. The protocol was amended to reduce the number of outcomes considered. Two researchers independently screened and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the critical outcomes of clinical improvement (Day 28; ≥ D60); WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above (i.e. the proportion of participants with mechanical ventilation +/‐ additional organ support OR death) (D28; ≥ D60); all‐cause mortality (D28; ≥ D60); incidence of any adverse events; and incidence of serious adverse events. 
Main results
We identified four RCTs of anakinra (three published in peer‐reviewed journals, one reported as a preprint) and two RCTs of canakinumab (published in peer‐reviewed journals). All trials were multicentre (2 to 133 centres). Two trials stopped early (one due to futility and one as the trigger for inferiority was met). The median/mean age range varied from 58 to 68 years; the proportion of men varied from 58% to 77%. All participants were hospitalised; 67% to 100% were on oxygen at baseline but not intubated; between 0% and 33% were intubated at baseline. We identified a further 16 registered trials with no results available, of which 15 assessed anakinra (four completed, four terminated, five ongoing, three not recruiting) and one (completed) trial assessed canakinumab. 
Effectiveness of anakinra for people with COVID‐19  
Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in clinical improvement at D28 (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.20; 3 RCTs, 837 participants; absolute effect: 59 more per 1000 (from 22 fewer to 147 more); moderate‐certainty evidence. 
The evidence is uncertain about an effect of anakinra on 1) the proportion of participants with a WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above at D28 (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.22; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 55 fewer per 1000 (from 107 fewer to 37 more); low‐certainty evidence) and ≥ D60 (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.96; 1 RCT, 606 participants; absolute effect: 47 fewer per 1000 (from 72 fewer to 4 fewer) low‐certainty evidence); and 2) all‐cause mortality at D28 (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.39; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 32 fewer per 1000 (from 68 fewer to 40 more); low‐certainty evidence).

","# Plain Language Summary: IL-1 Blocking Drugs for COVID-19

## Plain Title

Do drugs that block IL-1 (a protein in the immune system) help people with COVID-19?

## Rationale

**What is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?**

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus. Some people get very sick with COVID-19. They may need help breathing or may die. When people get COVID-19, their body fights the virus. Sometimes the body's defense system works too hard. This can harm the body.

**What are IL-1 blocking drugs?**

IL-1 is a protein in the body. It helps the body fight infections. But too much IL-1 can cause harm. IL-1 blocking drugs stop IL-1 from working. Two IL-1 blocking drugs are anakinra and canakinumab.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know if IL-1 blocking drugs could help people with COVID-19. They thought these drugs might calm down the body's defense system. This might help sick people get better.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies that tested IL-1 blocking drugs in people with COVID-19. They found 6 studies. Four studies tested anakinra. Two studies tested canakinumab.

**Who was in these studies?**

All people in the studies were in the hospital with COVID-19. Most people were between 58 and 68 years old. Most people were men (58 to 77 out of 100). Most people needed oxygen but were not on breathing machines. Some people were on breathing machines.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared IL-1 blocking drugs to regular care or fake treatment (placebo). Researchers watched patients for 28 days or longer. They checked if people got better, if they needed breathing machines, if they died, and if they had side effects.

## Results

**What did the researchers find about anakinra?**

Anakinra probably does not help people get better faster at 28 days. The evidence is uncertain about whether anakinra reduces the need for breathing machines. The evidence is uncertain about whether anakinra reduces death at 28 days. The evidence is very uncertain about effects after 60 days or more.

Anakinra probably does not cause more side effects. The evidence is uncertain about serious side effects.

**What did the researchers find about canakinumab?**

Canakinumab probably does not help people get better faster at 28 days. The evidence is uncertain about whether canakinumab reduces the need for breathing machines. The evidence is uncertain about whether canakinumab reduces death at 28 days. The evidence is very uncertain about death after 60 days or more.

Canakinumab probably does not cause more side effects. The evidence is uncertain about serious side effects.

**What do these results mean?**

The researchers did not find clear proof that IL-1 blocking drugs help people with COVID-19. For many outcomes, the evidence was uncertain or very uncertain. This means we cannot be sure about the effects.

**What happens next?**

Sixteen more studies are registered but have no results yet. Four studies are done. Four studies stopped early. The researchers will update their findings as new information becomes available.

**Conclusion**

Based on current evidence, IL-1 blocking drugs like anakinra and canakinumab do not appear to provide important benefits for people with COVID-19. More research is needed to be certain about these findings.",10.1002-14651858.CD015308,"Are medicines that block interleukin‐1 (a protein involved in immune responses) effective treatments for COVID‐19 and do they cause unwanted effects? 
Key messages 
• Overall, we did not find sufficient evidence to show that medicines that block interleukin‐1 (a protein involved in immune responses) are effective treatments for people with COVID‐19, or whether they cause unwanted effects. 
• We found 16 studies with unpublished results. We will update this review when new data are available. 
• In future, we need high‐quality studies to evaluate medicines that block interleukin‐1 to treat COVID‐19.  
What is interleukin‐1 and what is its role in COVID‐19? 
Interleukin‐1 (IL‐1) is a type of protein called a cytokine, which helps to regulate the body’s immune system. In particular, IL‐1 triggers inflammation to help fight infection. In COVID‐19, as the immune system fights the virus, the lungs and airways become inflamed, causing breathing difficulties. However, in some people, the immune system can over‐react (called a ‘cytokine storm’) and produce dangerously high levels of inflammation and tissue damage. This can lead to severe breathing difficulties, organ failure and death. 
What are interleukin‐1 ‘blockers’? 
IL‐1 blockers are medicines that stop IL‐1 from working by blocking signals from IL‐1 to other parts of the immune system. This reduces inflammation and may help the immune system to fight COVID‐19. In turn, this may reduce the need for breathing support with a ventilator (a machine that breathes for a patient) and reduce the number of deaths from COVID‐19. Three IL‐1 blockers are available: anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if IL‐1 blockers are effective treatments for people with COVID‐19, compared with standard care alone or with placebo (a dummy treatment that appears identical to the medicine being tested but without any active medicine). We were particularly interested in the effects of IL‐1 blockers on: 
•  whether people’s symptoms got better or worse;
•  how many people died; and
•  any unwanted effects and serious unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the effects of IL‐1 blockers to treat people with COVID‐19 compared with standard care alone or with placebo. People in the studies could have suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 of any severity (mild, moderate or severe), and be any age or sex. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found six studies with 2132 people. Four studies assessed anakinra (1633 people) and two assessed canakinumab (499 people). People in the studies were aged between 58 and 68 years old on average, and the majority were men. All the people in the studies were in hospital, mainly with moderate to critical COVID‐19. The studies varied in size, from 45 to 2253 people. At the start of the studies, 67% to 100% of people were receiving oxygen, and 0% to 33% were on a ventilator. 
We also found 16 studies that have not yet published their results.
Anakinra compared to usual care and placebo to treat people with COVID‐19 
• Anakinra probably results in little or no improvement in COVID‐19 symptoms (defined as improvement on a clinical scale or discharge from hospital) at 28 days after treatment (three studies, 837 people) but we do not know if it makes a difference at 60 days (one study, 115 people). 
• We do not know if anakinra makes a difference to the number of deaths at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 722 people) or at 60 days (four studies, 1633 people). 
• Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in any unwanted effects at 28 days after treatment, but we are not sure about its effect on serious unwanted effects (two studies, 722 people).  
Canakinumab compared to usual care and placebo to treat people with COVID‐19 
• Canakinumab probably results in little or no improvement in COVID‐19 symptoms (defined as improvement on a clinical scale or discharge from hospital) at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 499 people).  
• We do not know if canakinumab makes a difference to the number of deaths at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 499 people) or at 60 days (one study, 45 people).  
• Canakinumab probably results in little or no increase in any unwanted effects (one study, 454 people), but we are not sure about its effect on serious unwanted effects (two studies, 499 people) at 28 days.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. All the people in the studies were hospitalised, but some were more seriously ill than others ‐ some studies only included people on a ventilator. Usual care also differed between studies, and studies measured and reported their results using different methods.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 5 November 2021.

Diabetes and vascular disease are the leading causes of lower limb amputation. Currently, 463 million adults are living with diabetes, and 202 million with peripheral vascular disease, worldwide. When a lower limb amputation is considered, preservation of the knee in a below‐knee amputation allows for superior functional recovery when compared with amputation at a higher level. When a below‐knee amputation is not feasible, the most common alternative performed is an above‐knee amputation. Another possible option, which is less commonly performed, is a through‐knee amputation which may offer some potential functional benefits over an above‐knee amputation. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of through‐knee amputation compared to above‐knee amputation on clinical and rehabilitation outcomes and complication rates for all patients undergoing vascular and non‐vascular major lower limb amputation. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases; the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register to 17 February 2021. 
We undertook reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing through‐knee amputation and above‐knee amputation were eligible for inclusion in this study. Primary outcomes were uncomplicated primary wound healing and prosthetic limb fitting. Secondary outcomes included time taken to achieve independent mobility with a prosthesis, health‐related quality of life, walking speed, pain, and 30‐day survival. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed all records identified by the search. Data collection and extraction were planned in line with recommendations outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We planned to assess the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We did not identify RCTs that met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Authors' conclusions
No RCTs have been conducted to determine comparative clinical or rehabilitation outcomes of through‐knee amputation and above‐knee amputation, or complication rates. It is unknown whether either of these approaches offers improved outcomes for patients. RCTs are needed to guide practice and to ensure the best outcomes for this patient group. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Types of Leg Amputation: Through-Knee Versus Above-Knee

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?
Some people need to have part of their leg removed due to illness. This is called an amputation. The most common reasons for leg amputation are diabetes and blood vessel disease. Right now, about 463 million adults around the world have diabetes. Another 202 million have blood vessel disease in their legs.

### What are the different types of amputation?
When doctors need to remove part of a leg, they try to save as much as possible. The best option is to cut below the knee. This helps people move better after surgery. But sometimes, cutting below the knee is not possible. When this happens, doctors have two choices:
- Cut above the knee (this is the most common choice)
- Cut through the knee (this is done less often)

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors think that cutting through the knee might help patients more than cutting above the knee. People who have their leg cut through the knee might be able to move around better. They might also have fewer problems after surgery. But no one has done a careful study to find out if this is true. The researchers wanted to find all the studies that compared these two types of amputation. They wanted to know which type works better for patients.

## Trial Design

### How did the researchers look for studies?
The researchers searched for studies that compared the two types of amputation. They looked in many medical databases and trial records. They searched up until February 17, 2021. They looked for studies where patients were randomly assigned to get one type of amputation or the other. This type of study is called a randomized controlled trial. It is the best way to compare two treatments.

### What did they want to find out?
The researchers wanted to know:
- How well the wound heals after surgery
- How many patients can use an artificial leg
- How long it takes to walk on their own with an artificial leg
- How patients feel about their quality of life
- How fast patients can walk
- How much pain patients have
- How many patients survive for 30 days after surgery

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers did not find any studies that met their requirements. They found no randomized controlled trials comparing through-knee amputation to above-knee amputation. This means there are no high-quality studies to help doctors decide which type of amputation is better.

### What does this mean for patients?
Right now, doctors do not have good evidence to guide their choice. They do not know if cutting through the knee or above the knee gives better results. They do not know which type helps patients heal faster. They do not know which type helps patients walk better with an artificial leg.

### What needs to happen next?
The researchers say that good studies are urgently needed. These studies should randomly assign patients to one type of amputation or the other. Then doctors can compare the results. This will help doctors make the best choice for their patients. It will help ensure that patients get the best possible outcome after amputation.

### Conclusion
No studies have properly compared these two types of leg amputation. More research is needed to find out which type works better for patients.",10.1002-14651858.CD013839,"Does surgical removal of the lower leg (amputation) through the knee offer patients improved surgical recovery and better rehabilitation than amputation above the knee? 
Background 
Each year, thousands of people worldwide need to have their lower leg surgically removed (lower limb amputation) due to problems such as blockages in blood vessels (vascular disease), diabetes, and injury. When an amputation is planned, a surgeon needs to decide how high up the leg to go, and therefore how much leg to leave behind. This decision is based on a balance between leaving as much of the leg as possible to improve a person’s ability to walk with an artificial leg (prosthesis) and removing anything that will not survive or go on to heal. If possible, a surgeon will prefer to preserve the knee, as having a working knee of one's own ensures a person’s best chance of walking. In some cases, this is not possible, and currently almost all people in this situation will have an amputation in the middle of the thigh (above the knee). However, another option is an amputation that can be performed through the knee joint itself. This carries potential advantages, as all of the muscles controlling movements of the thighbone are undamaged. A longer remaining leg would be expected to act as a lever to reduce the effort of swinging a prosthetic limb during walking and to aid sitting balance and transfer from bed to chair. By avoiding cutting the muscles, it is possible to minimise the physical trauma of surgery, allowing a procedure with reduced blood loss and less procedure time. In addition, the end of the thighbone and in some cases the knee cap remain. These bones can support the body’s weight at the end of the remaining limb through the same mechanism as kneeling down. On the other hand, some surgeons think that problems with healing may be more common with this approach. It is unclear whether amputation through the knee may therefore be a better operation, allowing improved recovery, greater likelihood of being able to walk with an artificial leg, and better quality of life, or whether it is associated with worse outcomes due to wound healing failure and the need for further surgery. The aim of this review was to look at the best available evidence to see how these operations compare.  
This review searched for studies that looked at whether through‐the‐knee or above‐the‐knee amputation resulted in better wound healing after amputation, improved patient survival, and reduced pain (clinical outcomes), as well as better rates of prosthesis use, walking speed, and quality of life (rehabilitation outcomes). 
Study characteristics and key results 
A thorough search of the available literature was performed (up to 17 February 2021) to find studies comparing through‐knee with above‐knee amputation. We identified no studies comparing these two procedures. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We were unable to assess the certainty of evidence because of the absence of studies included in this review. 
Conclusion 
Due to a lack of randomised trials, we are unable to determine if through‐knee amputations have different outcomes from above‐knee amputations. High‐quality randomised controlled trials are required to provide evidence on this topic.

How an ocular burn damages the eye 
The cornea is the transparent window of the eye that helps focus light to form an image of the outside world. For the cornea to remain transparent, it must have a healthy surface layer of epithelium, a stable tear film, and an absence of blood vessels. The epithelium is the moist cellular layer that covers the cornea, the white part of the eye, and the inside of the eyelids. The epithelium that covers the cornea is different from the epithelium of the conjunctiva. It is maintained in this state by a population of specialised stem cells found at the margin of the cornea (the limbus). In the normal eye, corneal epithelial cells slowly migrate from the limbus towards the centre of the cornea. 
A burn to the eye initially damages the surface epithelial layer, but it can also damage the deeper structures of the eye and the eyelids. A characteristic of an acute burn is an epithelial defect. This defect can fully recover after a minor burn. However, if the burn damages the stem cells of a segment of the limbus, the normal epithelium central to that area may not recover. The cornea is then covered by a functionally different type of epithelium derived from the peripheral conjunctiva, which may take weeks or months, and the cornea can become hazy and vascularised. In the absence of any epithelial covering, an additional risk is that the deeper tissues of the exposed cornea (stroma) may become progressively thinner and eventually perforate. The more extensive the damage to the limbus (measured in clock hours), the worse the outcome. The abnormal surface of the cornea, as well as haze and damage to structures within the eye (iris, lens, retina, optic nerve), can all lead to loss of vision. 
Treatments for ocular burns 
A burn to the surface of the eye is an emergency, and the eye must be washed immediately with water or saline to remove any chemical agents. The amount of damage to the epithelium (an epithelial defect) and the blood vessels at the edge of the cornea are measured, estimating the risk of future complications. The eye is then treated with medicines to reduce the risk of further complications and help the epithelial layer recover. Some doctors also use an amniotic tissue membrane placed over the surface of the eye. The amniotic membrane is the sac that surrounds a baby as it develops inside its mother. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to know whether using an amniotic membrane with medicines is better than just medicines. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies in which an amniotic membrane was used to treat eyes that had been burned. We then looked for studies comparing eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane patch with eyes treated using only medicines. We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which the treatment that people received was decided at random because these studies give the most reliable evidence about the effect of treatment. We assessed the treatment of moderate burns and severe burns separately, because they have different outcomes. We measured whether the treatment worked by comparing the proportion of eyes in which the epithelium over the cornea had failed to recover 21 days after the injury, visual function at the end of treatment, the presence of abnormal new blood vessels on the cornea, scarring between the cornea and the lids, the time taken for the epithelium to heal and adverse events in the intervention and control groups. We assessed the risk of bias in the randomised controlled study findings across pre‐specified domains. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to evaluate certainty of evidence include risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias.  
What we found 
We found two randomised controlled studies comparing the effect of medicines with the addition of an amniotic membrane patch inserted within seven days of the injury against medicines alone. One study suggested that treatment with amnion may be beneficial in moderate burns, but we found the certainty of the evidence to be low due to a high risk of bias and serious imprecision. For severe burns, there were no important differences between eyes that received an amniotic membrane and eyes that did not.  
Conclusions 
There is only uncertain evidence from randomised controlled studies of an important difference in healing between eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane within seven days of an ocular burn and eyes that are treated only with medicines. Further research is needed to identify the best treatment for acute burns to the eye to reduce the risk of potentially devastating consequences and visual loss.

","# Plain Language Summary: Amniotic Membrane Treatment for Eye Burns

## Plain Title
Does Using Amniotic Membrane Help Eyes Heal Better After a Burn?

## Rationale

**What happens when the eye gets burned?**

The cornea is the clear front part of the eye. It helps you see clearly. When the eye gets burned, the outer layer of cells can be damaged. This outer layer is called the epithelium.

Minor burns may heal on their own. But serious burns can damage special cells at the edge of the cornea. These special cells help keep the cornea healthy. When these cells are damaged, the cornea may not heal properly.

**What problems can eye burns cause?**

After a serious burn, the cornea may become cloudy. New blood vessels may grow where they should not be. The cornea may become thin and develop a hole. All of these problems can cause vision loss.

The more damage to the edge of the cornea, the worse the outcome.

**How are eye burns treated?**

Eye burns are an emergency. The eye must be washed right away with water. This removes any chemicals. Doctors then give medicines to help the eye heal.

Some doctors also place a special tissue over the eye. This tissue is called amniotic membrane. It comes from the sac that holds a baby before birth.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to know if using amniotic membrane with medicines works better than using medicines alone.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

Researchers looked for studies that tested amniotic membrane treatment. They wanted studies where patients were put into groups by chance. This type of study gives the most reliable results.

The researchers found two studies. These studies compared two groups:
- One group got medicines plus amniotic membrane
- One group got medicines only

The amniotic membrane was placed on the eye within seven days after the burn.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included people who had burned their eyes. Some had moderate burns. Others had severe burns. The researchers looked at these two groups separately.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers checked several things:
- Did the outer layer of the eye heal within 21 days?
- How well could patients see at the end of treatment?
- Did new blood vessels grow on the cornea?
- Did scars form between the cornea and eyelids?
- How long did healing take?
- Did any side effects happen?

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers found only two studies. These studies had some problems with how they were done.

**For moderate burns:**
One study suggested amniotic membrane might help. But the researchers were not very confident in this result. The study had a high risk of errors.

**For severe burns:**
There was no important difference between the two groups. Eyes treated with amniotic membrane healed about the same as eyes treated with medicines only.

**What do these results mean?**

The evidence is uncertain. We cannot say for sure if amniotic membrane helps eyes heal better after a burn.

**Why is the evidence uncertain?**

Only two studies were found. The studies had problems in how they were designed. The number of patients was small. This makes the results less reliable.

**What are the conclusions?**

More research is needed. Scientists need to find the best way to treat eye burns. Eye burns can cause serious vision loss. Better treatments could help prevent this.

**How current is this information?**

Researchers last searched for studies in September 2021.

We found two randomised controlled studies comparing the effect of medicines with the addition of an amniotic membrane patch inserted within seven days of the injury against medicines alone. One study suggested that treatment with amnion may be beneficial in moderate burns, but we found the certainty of the evidence to be low due to a high risk of bias and serious imprecision. For severe burns, there were no important differences between eyes that received an amniotic membrane and eyes that did not.  
Conclusions 
There is only uncertain evidence from randomised controlled studies of an important difference in healing between eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane within seven days of an ocular burn and eyes that are treated only with medicines. Further research is needed to identify the best treatment for acute burns to the eye to reduce the risk of potentially devastating consequences and visual loss.

New minimal invasive surgeries have been suggested as alternative options to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy is a new technology that uses targeted, controlled water vapour energy (steam) to create necrotic tissue in the prostate. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and the Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings published up to 18 February 2020, with no restriction on the language or status of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, and non‐randomised observational prospective studies with concurrent comparison groups, in which men with BPH underwent convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy, another active therapy, or a sham procedure. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We had planned to perform statistical analyses using a random‐effects model, and interpret them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the certainty of the evidence according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included a single, industry‐sponsored RCT, with 197 randomised men, that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to a sham procedure. The mean age 62.9 years, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was 21.97, and the mean prostate volume was 45.4 mL. We only found short‐term data, measured up to three months. 
Primary outcomes 
Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may improve urologic symptom scores more than a sham procedure, measured on a IPSS scale (0 to 35; higher score represents worse urological symptoms) by a mean difference (MD) of ‐6.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐9.06 to ‐4.74; 195 men; low‐certainty evidence), and likely improves quality of life (QoL), measured on a IPSS‐QoL scale (0 to 6; higher score represents worse QoL), by a MD of ‐1.2 (95% CI ‐1.66 to ‐0.74; 195 men; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on major adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 6.79, 95% CI 0.39 to 117.00; 197 men; very low‐certainty evidence) assessed by the Clavien‐Dindo classification system of III, IV, and V complications. 
Secondary outcomes 
We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on retreatment (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.06 to 32.86; 197 men; very low‐certainty evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may have little to no effect on erectile function (MD 0.4, 95% CI ‐1.91 to 2.71; 130 men; low‐certainty evidence) and ejaculatory function (MD 0.5, 95% CI ‐0.83 to 1.83; 130 men; low‐certainty evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may increase minor adverse events assessed by the Clavien‐Dindo classification system of Grade I and II complications (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.11; 197 men; low‐certainty evidence). This would correspond to 434 minor adverse events per 1000 men (95% CI 264 more to 714 more). We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on acute urinary retention (RR 4.98, 95% CI 0.28 to 86.63; 197 men; very low‐certainty evidence). It likely greatly increases the rate of men requiring indwelling urinary catheters (RR 35.58, 95% CI 15.37 to 82.36; 197 men; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
We were unable to perform any of the predefined secondary analyses.
We found no evidence for other comparisons, such as convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy versus TURP or other minimal invasive procedures. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared to a sham procedure, urologic symptom scores and quality of life appear to improve with convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy, but we are very uncertain about major adverse events. The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, with study limitations and imprecision being the most common reasons for rating down. These findings are based on a single industry‐sponsored study, with three‐month short‐term follow‐up. We did not find any studies comparing convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to any other active treatment form, such as TURP. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Water Vapor Therapy for Enlarged Prostate Problems in Men

## Plain Title

Does water vapor (steam) therapy help men with enlarged prostate and urinary problems?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Many men develop an enlarged prostate as they age. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH. The prostate is a small gland that sits below the bladder in men. When it gets bigger, it can press on the tube that carries urine out of the body. This causes problems like:
- Trouble starting to urinate
- Weak urine stream
- Needing to urinate often, especially at night
- Feeling like the bladder is not empty

These problems can make daily life difficult and affect quality of life.

**What is the treatment being studied?**

Doctors have used surgery to treat enlarged prostates for many years. The most common surgery is called TURP. But doctors are now looking for treatments that are less invasive and easier on patients.

One new treatment uses water vapor, which is steam. Doctors insert a small device into the prostate. The device releases controlled bursts of steam. The steam heats up prostate tissue and destroys some of it. This makes the prostate smaller and reduces pressure on the urinary tube.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if this steam therapy actually works. They wanted to see if it helps men urinate better and improves their quality of life. They also wanted to know if the treatment is safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a randomized controlled trial. This means researchers divided men into two groups by chance, like flipping a coin. One group got the real steam treatment. The other group got a fake treatment (called a sham procedure). Neither the men nor the doctors knew who got which treatment at first. This helps make the results more reliable.

**Who was in the study?**

The study included 197 men. Their average age was about 63 years old. All the men had:
- Enlarged prostates (average size was 45 mL)
- Moderate to severe urinary problems

**How long did the study last?**

The study followed men for 3 months after treatment. This is considered short-term follow-up.

**Important note:** The company that makes the steam therapy device paid for this study.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

Researchers measured urinary symptoms using a score from 0 to 35. Higher scores mean worse symptoms.

- Men who got steam therapy had symptoms improve by about 7 points more than men who got the fake treatment
- This suggests steam therapy may help reduce urinary problems

Researchers also measured quality of life using a score from 0 to 6. Higher scores mean worse quality of life.

- Men who got steam therapy had quality of life improve by about 1 point more than men who got the fake treatment
- This suggests steam therapy likely improves how men feel about their condition

**What about side effects?**

The study found mixed results about safety:

- Researchers are very uncertain about serious complications. Too few men had serious problems to know for sure
- Minor side effects were more common with steam therapy. About 434 out of 1000 men had minor problems
- Many more men needed a temporary catheter (a tube to drain urine) after steam therapy compared to fake treatment
- The treatment did not seem to affect sexual function or ejaculation

**What does this mean?**

Steam therapy may help improve urinary symptoms and quality of life in men with enlarged prostates. However, there are important limitations:

- Only one study was available
- The study only followed men for 3 months
- Researchers are uncertain about serious side effects
- No studies compared steam therapy to standard surgery (TURP) or other treatments

**Conclusions**

More research is needed with longer follow-up times. Studies comparing steam therapy to other treatments would help doctors and patients make better decisions. Men considering this treatment should talk with their doctors about the potential benefits and risks.",10.1002-14651858.CD013251,"Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia 
Review Question 
What are the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy in men with bothersome urinary symptoms because of an enlarged prostate? 
Background 
Prostate enlargement is common in older men, and can cause bothersome urinary symptoms, such as having to pass their water (voiding) often, a weak stream while voiding, or dribbling. If lifestyle changes and medications don't help, a variety of surgical procedures, including transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), can improve these symptoms. They may also cause unwanted effects, such as problems with ejaculation or erections. Recently, a new procedure called 'convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy' has become available. It is unclear how it compares to other treatments, such as TURP. 
Study characteristics  We found a single study, with 197 men, that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to a sham procedure (men were made to believe they received treatment, while in reality, they did not), funded by the device company. The men's average age was 62.9 years, and most had a moderate degree of bothersome urinary symptoms. 
We found no studies that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to another form of active treatment, such as TURP that men with an enlarged prostate and bothersome symptoms might otherwise choose. 
Key results 
Compared to a sham procedure, and with a three‐month follow‐up, convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may improve urinary symptoms (low certainty of evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy also likely improves quality of life (moderate certainty of evidence). We are very uncertain whether serious unwanted side effects are more common or not (very low certainty of evidence). Men's erections and ejaculations may be similar in men who have convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy and those who receive the sham procedure (low certainty of evidence). 
Findings of this review are up to date until 18 February 2020.
Certainty of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes to be moderate, low or very low. Reasons for not being so confident had to do with the study design and the study size.

121,10.1002-14651858.CD013168.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is used to treat aorto‐iliac and isolated iliac aneurysms in selected patients, and prospective studies have shown advantages compared with open surgical repair, mainly in the first years of follow‐up. Although this technique produces good results, anatomic issues (such as common iliac artery ectasia or an aneurysm that involves the iliac bifurcation) can make EVAR more complex and challenging and can lead to an inadequate distal seal zone for the stent‐graft. Inadequate distal fixation in the common iliac arteries can lead to a type Ib endoleak. To avoid this complication, one of the most commonly used techniques is unilateral or bilateral internal iliac artery occlusion and extension of the iliac limb stent‐graft to the external iliac arteries with or without embolisation of the internal iliac artery. However, this occlusion is not without harm and is associated with ischaemic complications in the pelvic territory such as buttock claudication, sexual dysfunction, ischaemic colitis, gluteal necrosis, and spinal cord injury. 
New endovascular devices and alternative techniques such as iliac branch devices and the sandwich technique have been described to maintain pelvic perfusion and decrease complications, achieving revascularisation of the internal iliac arteries in patients not suitable for an adequate seal zone in the common iliac arteries. These approaches may also preserve the quality of life of treated individuals and may decrease other serious complications including spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis, thereby decreasing the morbidity and mortality of EVAR. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion during endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialists searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 28 August 2019. The review authors searched Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) and the Indice Bibliográfico Español de Ciencias de la Salud (IBECS) on 28 August 2019 and contacted specialists in the field and manufacturers to identify relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared internal iliac artery revascularisation with internal iliac artery occlusion for patients undergoing endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed identified studies for potential inclusion in the review. We used standard methodological procedures in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions. 
Main results
We identified no RCTs that met the inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
We found no RCTs that compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation. High‐quality studies that evaluate the best strategy for managing endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms with inadequate distal seal zones in the common iliac artery are needed. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Ways to Treat Blood Vessel Bulges in the Pelvis Area During Minimally Invasive Surgery

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people develop bulges in their blood vessels called aneurysms. These bulges can happen in the large blood vessels in the belly and pelvis area. If these bulges grow too large, they can burst and cause serious bleeding that can be life-threatening.

**What are the treatment options?**

Doctors can fix these bulges using a less invasive surgery. They insert a special tube called a stent-graft through small cuts. This tube supports the weak blood vessel from the inside. However, sometimes the shape of the blood vessels makes this repair tricky. The main challenge happens near a blood vessel called the internal iliac artery, which supplies blood to the pelvis, buttocks, and bowel.

**Why is this a problem?**

When doctors cannot secure the stent-graft properly, they often block the internal iliac artery. This blocking can cause problems like:
- Pain in the buttocks when walking
- Sexual problems
- Bowel damage
- Muscle death in the buttocks
- Spinal cord injury

**What is the potential solution?**

Newer techniques allow doctors to keep blood flowing through the internal iliac artery instead of blocking it. These methods use special devices that branch off to maintain blood flow. Keeping this blood vessel open might prevent the problems listed above and improve patients' quality of life.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to find out which approach works better: keeping the internal iliac artery open or blocking it. They wanted to know which method causes fewer problems and helps patients more.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers look for studies?**

The researchers searched medical databases up to August 2019. They looked for studies that compared the two treatment approaches. They wanted to find studies where patients were randomly assigned to receive either treatment. Random assignment helps ensure fair comparisons between treatments.

**What kind of studies were they looking for?**

They wanted studies that included:
- Adults with bulges in blood vessels in the belly and pelvis area
- Patients getting minimally invasive surgery with stent-grafts
- Comparison between keeping the internal iliac artery open versus blocking it
- Information about complications and patient outcomes

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found no studies that met their requirements. They could not find any studies where patients were randomly assigned to receive one treatment or the other.

**What does this mean?**

Without proper studies, doctors do not have strong evidence to guide their treatment choices. Currently, doctors must decide which approach to use based on their experience and less reliable types of studies.

**What are the conclusions?**

More research is needed. High-quality studies must compare these two approaches. These studies should:
- Randomly assign patients to each treatment group
- Track complications and problems
- Measure patient quality of life
- Follow patients over time

Until such studies are done, doctors and patients cannot know for certain which treatment approach is better. This makes it harder to choose the best treatment for each patient.

**Why does this matter?**

Patients with these blood vessel bulges need the safest and most effective treatment. Better research would help doctors make informed decisions. This could lead to fewer complications and better outcomes for patients. Future studies should focus on answering this important question to improve patient care.",10.1002-14651858.CD013168,"Internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms 
Background 
An aorto‐iliac aneurysm is a dilatation (aneurysm) of the aorta, the main large blood vessel in the body, which carries blood out from the heart to all organs and iliac arteries (distal branches of the aorta). The aneurysm can grow and burst (rupture), which leads to severe bleeding and is frequently fatal; an estimated 15,000 deaths occur each year from ruptured aortic abdominal aneurysms in the USA alone. To avoid this complication, the aorto‐iliac aneurysm should be repaired when the maximum diameter of the aorta reaches 5 cm to 5.5 cm, or when the maximum diameter of the common iliac arteries reaches 3 cm to 4 cm. 
Endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms is one approach that is used to manage this condition: a tube (stent‐graft) is placed inside the aorto‐iliac aneurysm, so that blood flows through the stent‐graft and no longer into the aneurysm, excluding it from the circulation. To achieve a successful deployment of the stent‐graft, a good seal zone (fixation zone) is needed in the aorta (proximal) and in the common iliac arteries (distal). However, in 40% of patients, the distal seal zone in the common iliac arteries is inadequate. In these cases, most commonly the stent‐graft is extended to the external iliac artery and the internal iliac artery is blocked (occluded). However, this obstruction (occlusion) is not without harms: the internal iliac artery supplies blood to the pelvic organs (rectum, bladder, and reproductive organs) and the pelvic muscles, and occlusion is associated with complications in the pelvic area such as buttock claudication (cramping pain in the buttock during exercise), sexual dysfunction, and spinal cord injury. 
New endovascular devices and techniques such as iliac branch devices have emerged to maintain blood flow into the internal iliac artery. These special stent‐grafts position the distal seal zone within the external iliac artery, and a side branch of the graft allows for revascularisation of the internal iliac artery, while excluding the aneurysm from the circulation, promoting an adequate distal seal zone, and maintaining pelvic circulation. This may also preserve the quality of life of treated individuals and may reduce serious complications including spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis. 
This review aimed to assess the effects of internal iliac artery revascularisation compared with internal iliac artery occlusion during endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We searched for evidence that directly compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. Our searches up to 28 August 2019 did not identify any randomised controlled trials (clinical studies in which people are randomly (by chance alone) put into one of several intervention groups) that met our criteria. Studies are needed to help vascular and endovascular surgeons choose the best option for endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms with an inadequate distal fixation zone. 
Conclusion 
We found no RCTs that compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. High‐quality studies that evaluate the best strategy for managing the endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms with inadequate distal seal zones in the common iliac artery are needed.

The role of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment for COVID‐19 has been a subject of considerable discussion. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for COVID‐19 based on randomised controlled trials is required. 
Objectives
To assess whether vitamin D supplementation is effective and safe for the treatment of COVID‐19 in comparison to an active comparator, placebo, or standard of care alone, and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions to 11 March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. 
We excluded studies investigating preventive effects, or studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)). 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following prioritised outcome categories: individuals with moderate or severe COVID‐19: all‐cause mortality, clinical status, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events, and for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease: all‐cause mortality, development of severe clinical COVID‐19 symptoms, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events. 
Main results
We identified three RCTs with 356 participants, of whom 183 received vitamin D. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical progression scale, two studies investigated participants with moderate or severe disease, and one study individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease. The control groups consisted of placebo treatment or standard of care alone. 
Effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19 and moderate to severe disease 
We included two studies with 313 participants. Due to substantial clinical and methodological diversity of both studies, we were not able to pool data. Vitamin D status was unknown in one study, whereas the other study reported data for vitamin D deficient participants. One study administered multiple doses of oral calcifediol at days 1, 3 and 7,  whereas the other study gave a single high dose of oral cholecalciferol at baseline. We assessed one study with low risk of bias for effectiveness outcomes, and the other with some concerns about randomisation and selective reporting. 
All‐cause mortality at hospital discharge (313 participants) 
We found two studies reporting data for this outcome. One study reported no deaths when treated with vitamin D out of 50 participants, compared to two deaths out of 26 participants in the control group (Risk ratio (RR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.13). The other study reported nine deaths out of 119 individuals in the vitamin D group, whereas six participants out of 118 died in the placebo group (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.04]. We are very uncertain whether vitamin D has an effect on all‐cause mortality at hospital discharge (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Clinical status assessed by the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (237 participants) 
We found one study reporting data for this outcome. Nine out of 119 participants needed invasive mechanical ventilation when treated with vitamin D, compared to 17 out of 118 participants in the placebo group (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.13). Vitamin D supplementation may decrease need for invasive mechanical ventilation, but the evidence is uncertain (low‐certainty evidence). 
Quality of life 
We did not find data for quality of life.
Safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19 and moderate to severe disease 
We did not include data from one study, because assessment of serious adverse events was not described and we are concerned that data might have been inconsistently measured. This study reported vomiting in one out of 119 participants immediately after vitamin D intake (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.30). We are very uncertain whether vitamin D supplementation is associated with higher risk for adverse events (very low‐certainty). 
Effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19 and asymptomatic or mild disease 
We found one study including 40 individuals, which did not report our prioritised outcomes, but instead data for viral clearance, inflammatory markers, and vitamin D serum levels. The authors reported no events of hypercalcaemia, but recording and assessment of further adverse events remains unclear. Authors administered oral cholecalciferol in daily doses for at least 14 days, and continued with weekly doses if vitamin D blood levels were > 50 ng/mL. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment of COVID‐19. The evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of COVID‐19 is very uncertain. Moreover, we found only limited safety information, and were concerned about consistency in measurement and recording of these outcomes. 
There was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity of included studies, mainly because of different supplementation strategies, formulations, vitamin D status of participants, and reported outcomes. 
There is an urgent need for well‐designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with an appropriate randomisation procedure, comparability of study arms and preferably double‐blinding. We identified 21 ongoing and three completed studies without published results, which indicates that these needs will be addressed and that our findings are subject to change in the future. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Vitamin D as a Treatment for COVID-19

## Plain Title
Does vitamin D help treat people who have COVID-19?

## Rationale

**What is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?**
COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus. Some people get very sick from COVID-19. They may need help breathing or may die. Doctors want to find treatments that work.

**Why study vitamin D?**
Vitamin D is something our bodies need to stay healthy. We get it from sun and food. Some people think vitamin D might help fight COVID-19. Many people have talked about using vitamin D to treat COVID-19.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors needed to know if vitamin D really helps people with COVID-19. They wanted to look at all the research done so far. This would help them know if vitamin D is safe and if it works.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was not one single study. The researchers looked at many studies done by other doctors. They searched for all studies about vitamin D and COVID-19. They only used studies that were done in a careful way. These studies gave some people vitamin D. They gave other people a fake pill or regular care only. Then they compared the results.

**Who was in these studies?**
The researchers found three studies. These studies had 356 people total. Of these people, 183 got vitamin D. Two studies had people with moderate or severe COVID-19. These people were quite sick. One study had people with mild COVID-19 or no symptoms. These people were not very sick.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies followed people until they left the hospital. One study gave vitamin D for at least 14 days.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The three studies were very different from each other. They used different amounts of vitamin D. They gave it in different ways. They looked at different things. This made it hard to combine the results.

**For people with moderate or severe COVID-19:**

*Did vitamin D prevent death?*
Two studies looked at death rates. The results were very unclear. In one study, no one died who took vitamin D (out of 50 people). Two people died who did not take it (out of 26 people). In the other study, 9 people died who took vitamin D (out of 119 people). Six people died who did not take it (out of 118 people). The researchers cannot say if vitamin D helps prevent death.

*Did vitamin D help with breathing problems?*
One study looked at people who needed breathing machines. Nine people who took vitamin D needed breathing machines (out of 119 people). Seventeen people who did not take vitamin D needed breathing machines (out of 118 people). Vitamin D might help reduce the need for breathing machines. But the researchers are not sure.

*Did vitamin D improve quality of life?*
No studies looked at this.

**Was vitamin D safe?**

The studies did not give much information about safety. One person threw up after taking vitamin D. The researchers are not sure if vitamin D causes problems. The studies did not measure safety well enough.

**For people with mild or no symptoms:**

One small study had 40 people with mild COVID-19. This study did not look at death or severe illness. It looked at other things instead. The researchers could not answer questions about vitamin D for mild cases.

**What do these results mean?**

Right now, there is not enough proof to know if vitamin D helps treat COVID-19. The researchers are very uncertain about the results. They also do not have enough information about safety.

The studies were too different from each other. They need better studies to get clear answers. The researchers found 21 more studies happening now. These new studies may give better answers in the future.

**Important note:**
The researchers will keep looking for new studies. They will update their findings as more information becomes available.",10.1002-14651858.CD015043,"Is vitamin D an effective and safe treatment for COVID‐19?
Key messages 
‐ We did not find enough, good‐quality evidence to judge whether vitamin D is an effective or safe treatment for adults with COVID‐19. 
‐ We need more research on this topic. Future research should focus on well‐designed studies with robust methods. 
‐ We identified 21 studies on this topic that are ongoing. We will update this review when more evidence becomes available. 
What is the link between vitamin D and COVID‐19? 
Some studies have shown that people who are in hospital with severe COVID‐19 also have low levels of  vitamin D (vitamin D deficiency). However, the risk factors for developing severe COVID‐19 are the same as those for developing vitamin D deficiency, so it is difficult to tell if vitamin D deficiency itself is a risk factor for severe COVID‐19. Risk factors include general ill‐health, a poor diet, and pre‐existing health conditions, such as diabetes, and liver and kidney disease. 
Vitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. It helps to regulate blood sugar, the heart and blood vessels, and the lungs and airways. It also has a role in boosting the body’s immune system. These are areas affected by COVID‐19, so giving vitamin D to people with COVID‐19 might help them to recover more quickly or have the disease less severely. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out the effects of giving vitamin D to adults with confirmed COVID‐19 on the following: 
‐ death from any cause;
‐ improvement or worsening of the patient’s condition;
‐ unwanted effects; and
‐ quality of life.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the use of vitamin D as a treatment for adults with confirmed COVID‐19 compared with a placebo (sham treatment) or another treatment. Vitamin D could be given in any form and in any dose. 
We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found three studies with 356 participants. One study took place in Brazil, and the other two in Spain. Two studies had participants with severe COVID‐19 and one had participants with mild COVID‐19 or with no symptoms. All the participants tested positive for COVID‐19 with a laboratory test called ‘PCR’, which is currently the most accurate test available. 
The studies gave their participants different doses of vitamin D. They used different timings from each other, from one large dose in one study to several smaller doses over 14 days in another study. Only two studies said that their participants were vitamin D‐deficient. The other study did not say anything about their participants’ vitamin D status. 
Deaths from any causeWe do not know whether vitamin D helps to prevent death from COVID‐19. Two studies (in participants with severe COVID‐19) provided evidence about deaths from any cause. One reported no deaths in the 50 participants who had received vitamin D, but two  deaths in the 26 participants who received the hospital’s usual COVID‐19 treatment. The other study reported nine deaths in 119 participants who had been given vitamin D and six deaths in the 118 participants given placebo. These studies were too different from each other to allow us to draw any conclusions. 
Patient’s conditionVitamin D may reduce the need for patients to be put on a ventilator to help them breathe, but the evidence is uncertain. One study (in participants with severe COVID‐19) reported that nine out of 119 participants given vitamin D had to be put on a ventilator and 17 out of 118 given a placebo needed a ventilator. 
Unwanted effectsWe do not know whether vitamin D causes unwanted effects. Only one study (in participants with severe COVID‐19) reported data on unwanted effects in a way that we could use. It found that one participant out of 119 vomited shortly after being given vitamin D. 
Quality of lifeNone of the studies reported quality of life. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is very limited because the studies gave different doses of vitamin D at different times from each other, did not all report participants’ vitamin D status, and did not measure and record their results using consistent methods. 
We found little evidence on unwanted effects and none on quality of life.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 11 March 2021.

Background and review question 
Health authorities and non‐governmental organisations often use mass media interventions (e.g. leaflets, radio and TV advertisements, posters and social media) to encourage healthier behaviours related to physical activity, dietary patterns, tobacco use or alcohol consumption, among others. In this review, we consider the effects of mass media interventions targeted towards ethnic minorities. A targeted intervention is designed for and considers the characteristics of a specific group, ideally providing ethnic minority groups equal opportunities and resources to access information, life skills, and opportunities to make healthier choices. However, we do not know whether targeted mass media strategies are more effective in reaching and influencing ethnic minorities than mass media strategies developed for the general population. 
Study characteristics 
We found six studies, all from the USA, four of which targeted African Americans and two which targeted Latino or Chinese immigrants. Of the studies, four were experimental (1693 volunteers) and two reported the results of large, targeted campaigns run in whole communities and cities. The evidence is current to August 2016. 
Key results 
The available evidence is insufficient to conclude whether targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups are more, less or equally effective in changing health behaviours than general mass media interventions. Only one study compared participants' smoking habits and intentions to quit following the receipt of either a culturally adapted smoking advice booklet or a booklet developed for the general population. They found little or no differences in smoking behaviours between the groups. 
When compared to no mass media intervention, a targeted mass media intervention may increase the number of calls to smoking quit lines, but the effect on health behaviours is unclear. This conclusion is based on findings from three studies. One study gave participants access to a series of 12 live shows on cable TV with information on how to maintain a healthy weight through diet and physical activity. Compared to women who did not watch the shows, participants reported slightly increased physical activity and some positive changes to their dietary patterns; however, their body weight was no different over time. Two other studies were large‐scale targeted campaigns in which smokers were encouraged to call a quit line for smoking cessation advice. The number of telephone calls from the target population increased considerably during the campaign. 
This review also compared targeted mass media interventions versus mass media interventions with added personal interactions. These findings, based on three studies, were inconclusive. 
None of the studies reported whether the interventions could have had any adverse effects, such as possible stigmatisation or increased resistance to messages. 
Further studies directly comparing targeted mass media interventions with general mass media interventions would be useful. Few studies have investigated the effects of targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups who primarily speak a non‐dominant language. 
Quality of the evidence 
Our confidence in the evidence of effect on all main outcomes is low to very low. This means that the true effect may be different or substantially different from the results presented in this review. We have moderate confidence in the estimated increase in the number of calls to smoking quit lines. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do Health Messages Designed for Specific Ethnic Groups Help People Make Healthier Choices?

## Rationale

**What is the health issue?**
Many people need help making healthier choices about food, exercise, smoking, and drinking. Health groups often use mass media to share health messages. Mass media means things like TV ads, radio shows, posters, leaflets, and social media posts.

**What are ethnic minorities?**
Ethnic minorities are groups of people who share the same culture, language, or background. These groups are smaller in number than the main population in their country.

**Why is this important?**
Health messages are usually made for everyone. But ethnic minority groups may have different languages, beliefs, and ways of life. Messages designed just for them might work better. These targeted messages consider the specific needs of each group. They aim to give all people equal chances to learn about health and make better choices.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know if health messages made for specific ethnic groups work better than general health messages. They also wanted to know if these targeted messages help people change their health habits.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**
Researchers looked for studies that tested targeted health messages. They found six studies, all done in the United States.

**Who was in the studies?**
Four studies focused on African Americans. Two studies focused on Latino people or Chinese immigrants. Four studies had 1,693 volunteers who agreed to take part. Two studies looked at large campaigns in whole cities.

**What did the studies test?**
The studies tested different types of health messages. Some were about quitting smoking. Others were about eating better and exercising more. Some studies gave people special booklets. Others used TV shows or large advertising campaigns.

**How long did the studies last?**
The review does not give exact times. Different studies lasted different amounts of time. Some tracked people for weeks or months.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

The researchers could not tell if targeted health messages work better than general messages. Only one study compared the two types directly. That study looked at smoking booklets. One booklet was made for a specific ethnic group. The other was made for everyone. People in both groups smoked about the same amount after reading the booklets.

**Do targeted messages work better than no messages at all?**

Maybe, but the answer is not clear. Three studies compared targeted messages to no messages:

One study showed TV programs about healthy eating and exercise. Women who watched the shows exercised a bit more. They also made some better food choices. But their weight did not change.

Two studies ran large campaigns to help smokers quit. The campaigns told people to call a phone help line. Many more people from the target groups called during the campaigns. But researchers do not know if these people actually quit smoking.

**What about combining messages with personal help?**

Three studies looked at this question. Some people got targeted messages plus personal support. Others got only the messages. The results were unclear. Researchers could not tell which approach worked better.

**Were there any problems?**

None of the studies checked for bad effects. Targeted messages might sometimes cause problems. For example, they might make people feel singled out. Or people might ignore messages they think are not for them. The studies did not look at these issues.

**How sure are researchers about these findings?**

Researchers have low confidence in most findings. This means the true effects might be quite different. They have moderate confidence that targeted campaigns increased calls to quit lines.

**What is needed next?**

More studies are needed. These studies should directly compare targeted messages to general messages. Very few studies have looked at ethnic groups who speak a different language than most people in their country. More research on these groups would be helpful.

Review Question 
How accurate are urine test in detecting endometriosis? Can any urine test be accurate enough to replace or reduce the need for surgery in the diagnosis of endometriosis? 
Background 
Women with endometriosis have endometrial tissue (the tissue that lines the womb and is shed during menstruation) growing outside the womb within the pelvic cavity. This tissue responds to reproductive hormones causing painful periods, chronic lower abdominal pain and difficulty conceiving. Currently, the only reliable way of diagnosing endometriosis is to perform laparoscopic surgery and visualise the endometrial deposits inside the abdomen. Because surgery is risky and expensive, urine tests have been evaluated for their ability to detect endometriosis non‐invasively. An accurate urine test could lead to the diagnosis of endometriosis without the need for surgery; or it could reduce the need for diagnostic surgery, so only women who were most likely to have endometriosis would require it. Other non‐invasive ways of diagnosing endometriosis using blood, imaging, endometrial and combination tests are evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews from this series. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence included in this review is current to July 2015. We included eight studies involving 646 participants. All studies evaluated reproductive‐aged women who were undertaking diagnostic surgery to investigate symptoms of endometriosis or for other indications. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of four urinary biomarkers, including four biomarkers that were expressed differently in women with and without endometriosis and one showing no difference between the two groups. Three other studies just identified three biomarkers that did not distinguish the two groups. 
Key results 
None of the assessed biomarkers, including cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), enolase 1 (NNE), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and urinary peptide profiling have been evaluated by enough studies to provide a meaningful assessment of test accuracy. None of the tests were accurate enough to replace diagnostic surgery. Several studies identified biomarkers that might be of value in diagnosing endometriosis, but there are too few reports to be sure of their diagnostic benefit. There is not enough evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. 
Quality of the evidence 
Generally, the reports were of low methodological quality and urine tests were only assessed in small individual studies. 
Future research 
More high quality research trials are needed to accurately assess the diagnostic potential of urinary biomarkers identified in small numbers of studies as having value in detecting endometriosis. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Urine to Find Endometriosis

## Plain Title
Can Urine Tests Help Doctors Find Endometriosis Without Surgery?

## Rationale

**What is endometriosis?**
Some women have a health problem called endometriosis. The tissue that lines the womb grows outside the womb in the belly area. Each month, this tissue responds to body hormones. This causes painful periods, long-term belly pain, and trouble getting pregnant.

**How do doctors find endometriosis now?**
Right now, doctors must do surgery to know for sure if a woman has endometriosis. This surgery is called laparoscopy. The doctor looks inside the belly to see the tissue growing in the wrong place.

**Why is this a problem?**
Surgery can be risky. It can also cost a lot of money. Women may face problems from surgery. Doctors want to find a safer, easier way to diagnose endometriosis.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know if urine tests could find endometriosis. A good urine test would be simple and safe. Women would not need surgery. Or fewer women would need surgery. Only women most likely to have endometriosis would have surgery.

**Why study urine?**
Urine is easy to collect. It does not hurt to give a urine sample. Researchers thought certain substances in urine might show if a woman has endometriosis.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at other studies done by different doctors. They searched for all studies done up to July 2015.

**Who was in these studies?**
The review included eight studies. These studies had 646 women total. All women were of child-bearing age. All women were having surgery to check for endometriosis or other reasons. Doctors took urine samples from these women. Then doctors did surgery to see if the women really had endometriosis.

**What did researchers look for?**
Researchers looked at different substances in urine. These substances are called biomarkers. They checked if biomarkers were different in women with endometriosis compared to women without it. Five studies tested four different biomarkers. Three studies found three other biomarkers.

## Results

**What were the main results?**
The urine tests did not work well enough. None of the biomarkers tested were accurate enough to replace surgery.

**What biomarkers did researchers test?**
Researchers tested several biomarkers:
- Cytokeratin 19 (CK 19)
- Enolase 1 (NNE)
- Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP)
- Urinary peptide profiling

**Were any tests helpful?**
Some biomarkers showed promise. They might help find endometriosis. But not enough studies tested these biomarkers. Doctors cannot be sure if they really work.

**What does this mean for patients?**
Right now, there is not enough proof that urine tests work. Doctors should not use these urine tests to diagnose endometriosis in regular care.

**How good was the research?**
The quality of the studies was low. Each study only tested a small number of women. This makes it hard to trust the results.

**What do researchers conclude?**
More research is needed. Future studies should be larger. They should be better designed. They should test the most promising biomarkers again. Only then will doctors know if urine tests can help diagnose endometriosis.

**Why does this matter?**
Finding a good urine test would help many women. They could avoid risky surgery. Diagnosis would be faster and cheaper. Women could start treatment sooner. But scientists need to do more work first.

**What happens next?**
Researchers will keep looking for better ways to diagnose endometriosis. They will test more biomarkers. They will do bigger, better studies. The goal is to find a safe, accurate test that does not require surgery.",10.1002-14651858.CD012019,"Urinary biomarkers for the non‐invasive diagnosis of endometriosis

Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and debilitating condition. Several pharmacological interventions have been proposed with the aim to prevent or mitigate it. These interventions should balance efficacy and tolerability, given that not all individuals exposed to a traumatic event will develop PTSD. There are different possible approaches to preventing PTSD; universal prevention is aimed at individuals at risk of developing PTSD on the basis of having been exposed to a traumatic event, irrespective of whether they are showing signs of psychological difficulties. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of pharmacological interventions for universal prevention of PTSD in adults exposed to a traumatic event. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMDCTR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trials registers (November 2020). We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. The search was last updated on 13 November 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials on adults exposed to any kind of traumatic event. We considered comparisons of any medication with placebo or with another medication. We excluded trials that investigated medications as an augmentation to psychotherapy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. In a random‐effects model, we analysed dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/NNTH). We analysed continuous data as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). 
Main results
We included 13 studies which considered eight interventions (hydrocortisone, propranolol, dexamethasone, omega‐3 fatty acids, gabapentin, paroxetine, PulmoCare enteral formula, Oxepa enteral formula and 5‐hydroxytryptophan) and involved 2023 participants, with a single trial contributing 1244 participants. Eight studies enrolled participants from emergency departments or trauma centres or similar settings. Participants were exposed to a range of both intentional and unintentional traumatic events. Five studies considered participants in the context of intensive care units with traumatic events consisting of severe physical illness. Our concerns about risk of bias in the included studies were mostly due to high attrition and possible selective reporting. We could meta‐analyse data for two comparisons: hydrocortisone versus placebo, but limited to secondary outcomes; and propranolol versus placebo. No study compared hydrocortisone to placebo at the primary endpoint of three months after the traumatic event. 
The evidence on whether propranolol was more effective in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms compared to placebo at three months after the traumatic event is inconclusive, because of serious risk of bias amongst the included studies, serious inconsistency amongst the studies' results, and very serious imprecision of the estimate of effect (SMD ‐0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.61 to 0.59; I2 = 83%; 3 studies, 86 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No study provided data on dropout rates due to side effects at three months post‐traumatic event. The evidence on whether propranolol was more effective than placebo in reducing the probability of experiencing PTSD at three months after the traumatic event is inconclusive, because of serious risk of bias amongst the included studies, and very serious imprecision of the estimate of effect (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92; 3 studies, 88 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No study assessed functional disability or quality of life.  
Only one study compared gabapentin to placebo at the primary endpoint of three months after the traumatic event, with inconclusive evidence in terms of both PTSD severity and probability of experiencing PTSD, because of imprecision of the effect estimate, serious risk of bias and serious imprecision (very low‐certainty evidence). We found no data on dropout rates due to side effects, functional disability or quality of life. 
For the remaining comparisons, the available data are inconclusive or missing in terms of PTSD severity reduction and dropout rates due to adverse events. No study assessed functional disability. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides uncertain evidence only regarding the use of hydrocortisone, propranolol, dexamethasone, omega‐3 fatty acids, gabapentin, paroxetine, PulmoCare formula, Oxepa formula, or 5‐hydroxytryptophan as universal PTSD prevention strategies. Future research might benefit from larger samples, better reporting of side effects and inclusion of quality of life and functioning measures. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Medications to Prevent PTSD After Trauma

## Plain Title

Can medications prevent PTSD in people who have experienced trauma?

## Rationale

**What is PTSD?**

PTSD stands for post-traumatic stress disorder. It is a serious mental health condition. Some people develop PTSD after experiencing a scary or dangerous event. These events might include car crashes, natural disasters, violence, or serious illness.

**What problems does PTSD cause?**

People with PTSD may have nightmares and bad memories. They may feel scared or anxious. PTSD can make daily life very hard.

**Why was this study needed?**

Not everyone who experiences trauma develops PTSD. Doctors want to find medications that can prevent PTSD. These medications need to work well. They also need to be safe. This is important because many people who take them will not develop PTSD anyway.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if giving medications right after trauma could prevent PTSD. They looked at whether these medications worked better than fake pills (called placebos). They also wanted to know if the medications were safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of research studies. Researchers looked at 13 different studies. These studies included 2,023 adults who had experienced trauma.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included adults of all genders. Most people joined the studies at emergency rooms or trauma centers. Some people were in intensive care units because of serious illness. People had experienced many types of trauma. Some trauma was from accidents. Some was from violence or serious medical problems.

**What medications were tested?**

Researchers tested eight different medications:
- Hydrocortisone (a steroid hormone)
- Propranolol (a heart medication)
- Dexamethasone (a steroid)
- Omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil)
- Gabapentin (a nerve pain medication)
- Paroxetine (an antidepressant)
- Two special nutrition formulas
- 5-hydroxytryptophan (a supplement)

**How long did the studies last?**

Researchers checked on people three months after their trauma. This is when they measured if PTSD had developed.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The results were unclear for all medications tested. Researchers could not say for certain if any medication prevented PTSD.

**Propranolol findings:**

Three studies tested propranolol. The results were mixed. Some studies showed it might help. Others showed it might not. The studies were too small. The results were not reliable enough to make conclusions.

**Gabapentin findings:**

Only one study tested gabapentin. The study was too small. The results were not clear.

**Other medications:**

For the other medications, there was not enough information. Researchers could not tell if they worked.

**Safety information:**

Most studies did not report enough information about side effects. This made it hard to know if the medications were safe.

**What was missing?**

Most studies did not measure quality of life. They did not measure how well people could do daily activities. This information would have been helpful.

**What do these results mean?**

Right now, doctors do not have clear proof that any medication prevents PTSD. More research is needed. Future studies should include more people. They should better track side effects. They should measure quality of life and daily functioning.

**Conclusion:**

Currently, there is not enough evidence to recommend medications to prevent PTSD after trauma. The medications tested include hydrocortisone, propranolol, and several others. Researchers need to do larger and better studies. These studies will help doctors know which medications work and which are safe.",10.1002-14651858.CD013443,"Medicines for preventing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Why is this review important? 
Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and disabling condition which may develop in people exposed to traumatic events. Such events can have long‐lasting negative repercussions on the lives of those who have experienced them, as well as on the lives of loved ones. 
Research has shown that there are some alterations in how the brain works in people with PTSD. Some researchers have thus proposed using medicines to target these alterations soon after a traumatic event, as a way to prevent the development of PTSD. However, the majority of people who experience a traumatic event will not develop PTSD. Therefore, medicines that can be given soon after exposure to a traumatic event must be carefully evaluated for their effectiveness, including balancing the risk of side effects against the risk of developing PTSD. 
Who will be interested? 
‐ People exposed to traumatic events and their family, friends, and loved ones
‐ Professionals working in mental health 
‐ Professionals working in traumatology and emergency medicine
‐ People caring for victims of traumatic experiences and veterans of the armed forces
What questions did this review try to answer? 
For people exposed to a traumatic event, whether or not they have psychological symptoms, are some medicines more effective than other medicines or placebo (dummy pills) in: 
‐ reducing the severity of symptoms of PTSD?
‐ reducing the number of people stopping the medication because of side effects?
‐ reducing the probability of developing PTSD?
Which studies were included? 
We searched scientific databases for studies in which participants were randomly assigned to a medicine with the aim of preventing PTSD and its symptoms or reducing severity. We included studies published up until November 2020. We selected studies in adults who had experienced any kind of traumatic event, and which provided treatment, regardless of whether or not the participants had psychological symptoms. 
We included 13 studies, with a total of 2023 participants. One study alone contributed 1244 participants. The studies took place in different settings and involved people exposed to a wide range of traumatic events. Some studies took place in emergency departments and considered people whose trauma resulted from intentional harm or unintentional harm. Other studies focused on life‐threatening illness as the source of trauma, including major surgeries or being admitted to intensive care units. The medicines most commonly given to participants in the studies included: hydrocortisone (which reduces the body's immune response), propranolol (used to treat heart problems and anxiety, amongst other conditions), and gabapentin (a medicine primarily used to treat seizures and nerve pain). 
What did the evidence tell us? 
We found four trials comparing hydrocortisone to placebo. These trials did not report how participants were doing at three months after a traumatic event, a time point that is usually useful to assess the evolution of PTSD symptoms. 
We found very low‐certainty evidence about propranolol compared to placebo three months after a traumatic event. This evidence does not tell us whether or not propranolol is more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms and the probability of developing PTSD. We did not find evidence on the probability of people stopping the medication because of side effects, quality of life, or functional disability (a measure of how much one’s life is limited by symptoms). 
We found very low‐certainty evidence about gabapentin compared to placebo three months after a traumatic event. This evidence does not tell us whether or not gabapentin is more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms and the probability of developing PTSD. We did not find evidence on the probability of people stopping the medication because of side effects, quality of life, or functional disability. 
We found studies on additional medicines, for which information about the reduction of PTSD severity and the probability of people stopping the medication was either inconclusive or missing. 
None of the included studies measured the functional disability of participants.
What should happen next? 
The evidence we found does not support the use of any medicines for the prevention of PTSD in people exposed to a traumatic event, regardless of whether or not they have psychological symptoms. More higher quality studies involving more people are needed to draw conclusions about these treatments.

Keratoconus is a condition of the eye that affects approximately 1 in 2000 people. The disease leads to a gradual increase in corneal curvature and decrease in visual acuity with consequent impact on quality of life. Collagen cross‐linking (CXL) with ultraviolet A (UVA) light and riboflavin (vitamin B2) is a relatively new treatment that has been reported to slow or halt the progression of the disease in its early stages. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess whether there is evidence that CXL is an effective and safe treatment for halting the progression of keratoconus compared to no treatment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2014), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to August 2014), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled‐trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 28 August 2014. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where CXL with UVA light and riboflavin was used to treat people with keratoconus and was compared to no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed trial quality, and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were two indicators of progression at 12 months: increase in maximum keratometry of 1.5 dioptres (D) or more and deterioration in uncorrected visual acuity of more than 0.2 logMAR. 
Main results
We included three RCTs conducted in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States that enrolled a total of 225 eyes and analysed 219 eyes. The total number of people enrolled was not clear in two of the studies. Only adults were enrolled into these studies. Out of the eyes analysed, 119 had CXL (all using the epithelium‐off technique) and 100 served as controls. One of these studies only reported comparative data on review outcomes. All three studies were at high risk for performance bias (lack of masking), detection bias (only one trial attempted to mask outcome assessment), and attrition bias (incomplete follow‐up). It was not possible to pool data due to differences in measuring and reporting outcomes. We identified a further three unpublished trials that potentially had enrolled a total of 195 participants. 
There was limited evidence on the risk of progression. Analysis of the first few participants followed up to one year in one study suggested that eyes given CXL were less likely to have an increase in maximum keratometry of 1.5 D or more at 12 months compared to eyes given no treatment, but the confidence intervals (CI) were wide and compatible with no effect or more progression in the CXL group (risk ratio (RR) 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.00, 19 eyes). The same study reported the number of eyes with an increase of 2 D or more at 36 months in the whole cohort with a RR of 0.03 favouring CXL (95% CI 0.00 to 0.43, 94 eyes). Another study reported ""progression"" at 18 months using a different definition; people receiving CXL were less likely to progress, but again the effect was uncertain (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.61, 44 eyes). We judged this to be very low‐quality evidence due to the risk of bias of included studies, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias but noted that the size of the potential effect was large. 
On average, treated eyes had a less steep cornea (approximately 2 D less steep) (mean difference (MD) ‐1.92, 95% CI ‐2.54 to ‐1.30, 94 eyes, 1 RCT, very low‐quality evidence) and better uncorrected visual acuity (approximately 2 lines or 10 letters better) (MD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.31 to ‐0.09, 94 eyes, 1 RCT, very low‐quality evidence) at 12 months. None of the studies reported loss of 0.2 logMAR acuity. The data on corneal thickness were inconsistent. There were no data available on quality of life or costs. Adverse effects were not uncommon but mostly transient and of low clinical significance. In one trial, 3 out of 12 participants treated with CXL had an adverse effect including corneal oedema, anterior chamber inflammation, and recurrent corneal erosions. In one trial at 3 years 3 out of 50 participants experienced adverse events including mild diffuse corneal oedema and paracentral infiltrate, peripheral corneal vascularisation, and subepithelial infiltrates and anterior chamber inflammation. No adverse effects were reported in the control groups. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence for the use of CXL in the management of keratoconus is limited due the lack of properly conducted RCTs. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Collagen Cross-Linking Treatment for Keratoconus

## Plain Title

Does collagen cross-linking with ultraviolet light and vitamin B2 help stop keratoconus from getting worse?

## Rationale

**What is keratoconus?**

Keratoconus is an eye disease. It affects about 1 in 2,000 people. The front clear part of the eye is called the cornea. In keratoconus, the cornea slowly becomes more curved and cone-shaped. This makes it hard to see clearly. Over time, people with this disease lose their ability to see well. This affects their daily life.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know if a treatment called collagen cross-linking (CXL) could help. This treatment uses ultraviolet A (UVA) light and riboflavin (vitamin B2). The goal is to make the cornea stronger. A stronger cornea might stop the disease from getting worse. This treatment is fairly new. Doctors needed to know if it really works and if it is safe.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to see if CXL could stop keratoconus from getting worse. They compared people who got CXL treatment to people who got no treatment.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at three studies. These studies were done in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The studies included 225 eyes from adults with keratoconus. Researchers looked at data from 219 eyes total.

**Who was in the studies?**

Only adults were in these studies. Some people got the CXL treatment (119 eyes). Other people got no treatment (100 eyes). All people who got CXL had the outer layer of their cornea removed first. This is called the ""epithelium-off"" technique.

**How long did the studies last?**

People were followed for different amounts of time. Some were followed for 12 months. Others were followed for up to 36 months (3 years).

## Results

**What did the studies find?**

The evidence was very limited. The studies had some problems with how they were done. This made it hard to be sure about the results.

**Did CXL stop the disease from getting worse?**

One study looked at whether the cornea became more curved. Eyes that got CXL were less likely to get much worse. But the number of people studied was small. More research is needed to be sure.

**Did CXL help people see better?**

At 12 months, people who got CXL had better results:
- Their corneas were less curved (about 2 units less curved)
- They could see better without glasses (about 2 lines better on an eye chart)

**Were there side effects?**

Some people who got CXL had side effects. Most side effects were mild and went away. In one study, 3 out of 12 people had problems. These included:
- Swelling of the cornea
- Inflammation inside the eye
- Repeated scratches on the cornea

In another study, 3 out of 50 people had problems over 3 years. These included mild swelling and inflammation. People who got no treatment had no side effects reported.

**What was missing from the studies?**

The studies did not report:
- How treatment affected quality of life
- How much the treatment costs
- Some important measures of vision loss

**What do the results mean?**

The evidence suggests CXL might help slow or stop keratoconus. But the evidence is weak. The studies were small. They had problems with how they were done. More and better studies are needed.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

There is not enough good evidence yet. More well-designed studies are needed. These studies should follow people for longer. They should include more people. This will help doctors know if CXL really works and is safe for treating keratoconus.",10.1002-14651858.CD010621,"Corneal collagen cross‐linking for thinning of the transparent front part of the eye ('keratoconus') 
Review question  Is corneal collagen cross‐linking (CXL) a good treatment for slowing down the progression of keratoconus? 
Background  Keratoconus is a condition where the transparent front of the eye (cornea) gets thinner and begins to bulge. This leads to vision problems, usually short‐sightedness (distant objects appear blurred). The condition is more common in children and young adults and can deteriorate over time. Initially glasses and contact lenses can help. If the disease progresses, the only option may be a corneal transplant. 
CXL is a new treatment for keratoconus. The eye doctor removes the outer layer of the cornea, puts in vitamin B2 eye drops, and then treats the eye with ultraviolet A light radiation. This can be done in outpatients and takes about an hour. 
Study characteristics  The searches are current to August 2014. We found three randomised controlled trials, which were done in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A total of 219 eyes were randomly allocated to treatment with CXL or no treatment. In all three studies the surgery was done in the same way. None of the studies included children. 
Key results  Eyes treated with CXL were less likely to have problems with progression of bulging compared to eyes that were not treated. However, the studies were small and there were some concerns about the way they were done. It is therefore difficult to say exactly how much the treatment helped. None of the studies reported the risk of eyesight getting worse but, on average, treated eyes had better vision (about 10 letters better) compared to untreated eyes. None of the studies reported on a change in quality of life for the participant. The main adverse effects were inflammation and swelling; this occurred in approximately one in 10 participants. 
Quality of the evidence  We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low because of problems in the way the studies were done and reported and the small number of eyes included.

Misoprostol given orally is a commonly used labour induction method. Our Cochrane Review is restricted to studies with low‐dose misoprostol (initially ≤ 50 µg), as higher doses pose unacceptably high risks of uterine hyperstimulation. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of low‐dose oral misoprostol for labour induction in women with a viable fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov,  the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (14 February 2021) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing low‐dose oral misoprostol (initial dose ≤ 50 µg) versus placebo, vaginal dinoprostone, vaginal misoprostol, oxytocin, or mechanical methods; or comparing oral misoprostol protocols (one‐ to two‐hourly versus four‐ to six‐hourly; 20 µg to 25 µg versus 50 µg; or 20 µg hourly titrated versus 25 µg two‐hourly static). 
Data collection and analysis
Using Covidence, two review authors independently screened reports, extracted trial data, and performed quality assessments. Our primary outcomes were vaginal birth within 24 hours, caesarean section, and hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes. 
Main results
We included 61 trials involving 20,026 women. GRADE assessments ranged from moderate‐ to very low‐certainty evidence, with downgrading decisions based on imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations. 
Oral misoprostol versus placebo/no treatment (four trials; 594 women) 
Oral misoprostol may make little to no difference in the rate of caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.11; 4 trials; 594 women; moderate‐certainty evidence), while its effect on uterine hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes is uncertain (RR 5.15, 95% CI 0.25 to 105.31; 3 trials; 495 women; very low‐certainty evidence). Vaginal births within 24 hours was not reported. In all trials, oxytocin could be commenced after 12 to 24 hours and all women had pre‐labour ruptured membranes. 
Oral misoprostol versus vaginal dinoprostone (13 trials; 9676 women) 
Oral misoprostol probably results in fewer caesarean sections (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.90; 13 trials, 9676 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis indicated that 10 µg to 25 µg (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.87; 9 trials; 8652 women) may differ from 50 µg (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.34; 4 trials; 1024 women) for caesarean section. Oral misoprostol may decrease vaginal births within 24 hours (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; 10 trials; 8983 women; low‐certainty evidence) and hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.59; 11 trials; 9084 women; low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol versus vaginal misoprostol (33 trials; 6110 women) 
Oral use may result in fewer vaginal births within 24 hours (average RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95; 16 trials, 3451 women; low‐certainty evidence), and less hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.92, 25 trials, 4857 women, low‐certainty evidence), with subgroup analysis suggesting that 10 µg to 25 µg orally (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.57; 6 trials, 957 women) may be superior to 50 µg orally (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.11; 19 trials; 3900 women). Oral misoprostol probably does not increase caesarean sections overall (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; 32 trials; 5914 women; low‐certainty evidence) but likely results in fewer caesareans for foetal distress (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; 24 trials, 4775 women). 
Oral misoprostol versus intravenous oxytocin (6 trials; 737 women, 200 with ruptured membranes) 
Misoprostol may make little or no difference to vaginal births within 24 hours (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33; 3 trials; 466 women; low‐certainty evidence), but probably results in fewer caesarean sections (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 6 trials; 737 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). The effect on hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes is uncertain (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.26; 3 trials, 331 women; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol versus mechanical methods (6 trials; 2993 women) 
Six trials compared oral misoprostol to transcervical Foley catheter. Misoprostol may increase vaginal birth within 24 hours (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.79; 4 trials; 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence), and probably reduces the risk of caesarean section (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95; 6 trials; 2993 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.21; 4 trials; 2828 women; low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol one‐ to two‐hourly versus four‐ to six‐hourly (1 trial; 64 women) 
The evidence on hourly titration was very uncertain due to the low numbers reported.
Oral misoprostol 20 µg hourly titrated versus 25 µg two‐hourly static (2 trials; 296 women) 
The difference in regimen may have little or no effect on the rate of vaginal births in 24 hours (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is of very low certainty for all other reported outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Low‐dose oral misoprostol is probably associated with fewer caesarean sections (and therefore more vaginal births) than vaginal dinoprostone, and lower rates of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes. However, time to birth may be increased, as seen by a reduced number of vaginal births within 24 hours. 
Compared to transcervical Foley catheter, low‐dose oral misoprostol is associated with fewer caesarean sections, but equivalent rates of hyperstimulation. 
Low‐dose misoprostol given orally rather than vaginally is probably associated with similar rates of vaginal birth, although rates may be lower within the first 24 hours. However, there is likely less hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes, and fewer caesarean sections performed due to foetal distress. 
The best available evidence suggests that low‐dose oral misoprostol probably has many benefits over other methods for labour induction. This review supports the use of low‐dose oral misoprostol for induction of labour, and demonstrates the lower risks of hyperstimulation than when misoprostol is given vaginally. More trials are needed to establish the optimum oral misoprostol regimen, but these findings suggest that a starting dose of 25 µg may offer a good balance of efficacy and safety.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Using Low-Dose Misoprostol Pills to Start Labor

## Plain Title

Comparing low-dose misoprostol pills taken by mouth to other methods for starting labor in pregnant women

## Rationale

**What is labor induction and why is it needed?**

Sometimes doctors need to start labor before it begins on its own. This is called labor induction. Doctors may do this when waiting longer could harm the mother or baby.

**What is misoprostol?**

Misoprostol is a medicine that helps start labor. Women can take it as a pill by mouth or place it in the vagina. This medicine helps the cervix (the opening to the womb) soften and open. It also causes the womb to contract.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Doctors use many different methods to start labor. These include other medicines and devices. Researchers wanted to know if low-dose misoprostol pills work well and are safe. They also wanted to compare it to other methods.

High doses of misoprostol can cause problems. The womb can contract too much or too often. This is called hyperstimulation. It can harm the baby. That is why this study only looked at low doses (50 micrograms or less).

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know:
- How well does low-dose misoprostol work?
- Is it safe for mothers and babies?
- How does it compare to other methods?

## Trial Design

**How did researchers design this study?**

Researchers reviewed 61 different studies. These studies included 20,026 pregnant women total. The researchers combined the results from all these studies.

**Who was in these studies?**

All women were pregnant and in their third trimester. This means they were at least 28 weeks pregnant. All had healthy babies that were still alive. The studies included women of different ages.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared low-dose misoprostol pills to:
- Fake pills (placebo) or no treatment
- Dinoprostone gel placed in the vagina
- Misoprostol placed in the vagina
- Oxytocin given through an IV
- A balloon catheter placed in the cervix

Some studies also compared different misoprostol doses and schedules.

**How long were women in the studies?**

Women stayed in the studies from the time labor started until after they gave birth. This was usually 1 to 3 days.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found that low-dose misoprostol pills work well and are safe.

**Compared to dinoprostone gel in the vagina:**
- Fewer women needed cesarean sections (surgery to deliver the baby)
- Fewer women had hyperstimulation with baby heart rate problems
- Slightly fewer women gave birth within 24 hours

**Compared to misoprostol placed in the vagina:**
- About the same number of women had cesarean sections
- Fewer women had hyperstimulation with baby heart rate problems
- Fewer women gave birth within 24 hours
- Fewer cesarean sections were done because of baby distress

**Compared to a balloon catheter:**
- Fewer women needed cesarean sections
- About the same number of women had hyperstimulation problems
- More women may have given birth within 24 hours

**Compared to oxytocin through an IV:**
- Fewer women needed cesarean sections
- About the same number of women gave birth within 24 hours

**What dose works best?**

Studies suggest that 25 micrograms works well. Lower doses (10 to 25 micrograms) caused less hyperstimulation than 50 micrograms.

**Why is this study important?**

This study shows that low-dose misoprostol pills are a good choice for starting labor. Taking the pill by mouth is easier than placing medicine in the vagina. It also causes fewer problems than vaginal misoprostol.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

Low-dose misoprostol pills have many benefits. They help more women have vaginal births instead of cesarean sections. They cause fewer problems with the womb contracting too much. A starting dose of 25 micrograms appears to work well and be safe.

More studies are needed to find the best dose and schedule. But current evidence supports using low-dose misoprostol pills to start labor.",10.1002-14651858.CD014484,"Low‐dose misoprostol given by mouth for induction of labour
We looked at the evidence from randomised controlled trials to see if low‐dose misoprostol given by mouth is effective in starting labour in women in their third trimester with a live baby. We compared misoprostol with other commonly used methods of inducing labour. 
What is the issue? 
Artificially starting labour, or induction, is common in pregnancy. Reasons include the mother having high blood pressure in pregnancy or the baby being past the due date. Misoprostol is a type of prostaglandin that can be taken in low doses by mouth to induce labour. Prostaglandins are hormone‐like compounds that are made by the body for various functions (including the natural onset of labour). Unlike other prostaglandins such as vaginal dinoprostone, misoprostol does not need to be stored in the refrigerator. Taking a tablet is convenient to mothers and the low‐dose tablet sizes are now available (25 µg).  
Why is this important? 
A good induction method achieves a safe birth for mother and baby. It is effective, results in a relatively low number of caesarean sections, has few side effects, and is highly acceptable to mothers. Some methods of inducing labour may cause more caesarean sections by being ineffective at bringing on labour, other methods may lead to more caesareans as they cause too many contractions (hyperstimulation) that result in the baby becoming distressed (foetal heart rate changes). 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 14 February 2021 and identified 61 trials involving 20,026 women for inclusion in this review. Not all trials were high quality. 
Starting with oral misoprostol immediately may have a similar effect on rates of caesarean section (4 trials, 594 women; low‐certainty evidence) to giving no treatment for 12 to 24 hours then starting oxytocin, while the effects of misoprostol on uterine hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes are unclear (3 trials, 495 women; very low‐quality evidence). All women in theses trials had ruptured membranes. 
Oral misoprostol was compared to vaginal dinoprostone in 13 trials (9676 women). Misoprostol use probably decreased the risk of caesarean section (moderate‐certainty evidence). When studies were divided by their initial dose of misoprostol, there was evidence that use of 10 µg to 25 µg may be effective in reducing the risk of a caesarean section (9 trials, 8652 women), while the higher 50 µg dose might not reduce the risk (4 trials, 1024 women). There may be very small or no differences between misoprostol and dinoprostone in rates of vaginal births within 24 hours (10 trials, 8983 women; low‐certainty evidence) but may be fewer cases of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes with oral misoprostol (11 trials, 9084 women; low‐certainty evidence).  
Oral misoprostol was compared with vaginal misoprostol in 33 trials (6110 women). Oral use may have resulted in fewer vaginal births within 24 hours (16 trials, 3451 women; low‐certainty evidence). Oral use may have caused less hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (25 trials, 4857 women; low‐certainty evidence), especially with a dose of 10 µg to 25 µg. There was no clear difference in the number of caesarean sections overall (32 trials, 5914 women; low‐certainty evidence) but oral use likely resulted in fewer caesareans being performed because of concerns of the baby being in distress (24 trials, 4775 women). 
When oral misoprostol was compared to oxytocin for induction, misoprostol use probably resulted in fewer caesarean sections (6 trials, 737 women). We found no clear difference in vaginal birth within 24 hours (3 trials, 466 women; moderate‐certainty evidence) or hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (3 trials, 331 women; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol was compared to a balloon catheter inserted in the cervix to mechanically induce labour. The number of vaginal births within 24 hours may have increased with misoprostol (4 trials, 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence). Misoprostol probably reduced the risk of caesarean section (6 trials, 2993 women; moderate‐certainty evidence) with no difference in risk of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (4 trials, 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence). 
Different doses and timings of giving oral misoprostol were explored in three small trials. The certainty of the findings from these trials was either low or very low so we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions from this data. 
What does this mean? 
Using low‐dose (50 µg or less) oral misoprostol to induce labour likely leads to fewer caesarean sections and so more vaginal births than vaginal dinoprostone, oxytocin, and a transcervical Foley catheter. Rates of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes were comparable with these methods. Misoprostol taken by mouth causes less hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes compared to when taken vaginally.  
More trials are needed to establish the most effective misoprostol regimen for labour induction, but for now the findings of this review support oral rather than vaginal use, and suggest that commencing oral misoprostol at a dose of 25 µg or less may be safe and effective.

What is Crohn's disease? 
Crohn’s disease is a long‐term condition that results in inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, occurring anywhere from the mouth to the anus. Common symptoms include fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss. Crohn's disease is characterized by periods of relapse when people are actively experiencing symptoms and periods of remission when the symptoms stop. 
What are Cannabis and Cannabinoids? 
Cannabis is a widely used drug which acts on the endocannabinoid system. Cannabis contains multiple components called cannabinoids. The use of cannabis and cannabis oil containing specific cannabinoids produces mental and physical effects such as altered sensory perception and euphoria when consumed. Some cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, do not have a psychoactive effect. Cannabis and cannabidiol have some anti‐inflammatory properties that might help people with Crohn's disease. 
What did the researchers investigate? 
The researchers studied whether cannabis is better than placebo (e.g. a sugar pill) therapy for treating adults with active Crohn's disease or Crohn's disease that is in remission. 
What did the researchers find? 
The researchers extensively searched the literature up to 17 October 2018 and found three studies (93 participants) that met the inclusion criteria. One ongoing study was also identified. All of the studies were small in size and had some quality issues. One small study (21 participants) compared eight weeks of treatment with cannabis cigarettes containing 115 mg of D9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to placebo cigarettes containing cannabis with the THC removed in participants with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. Although no difference in clinical remission rates was observed, more participants in the cannabis group had improvement in their Crohn's disease symptoms than participants in the placebo group. More side effects were observed in the cannabis cigarette group compared to placebo. These side effects were considered to be mild in nature and included sleepiness, nausea, difficulty with concentration, memory loss, confusion and dizziness. Participants in the cannabis cigarette group reported improvements in pain, appetite and satisfaction with treatment. 
One small study (22 participants) compared cannabis oil (10 mg of cannabidiol twice daily) to placebo oil (i.e. olive oil) in participants with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. No difference in clinical remission rates was observed. There was no difference in serious side effects. Serious side effects included worsening Crohn's disease in one participant in each group. 
One small study (50 participants) compared cannabis oil (composed of 15% cannabidiol and 4% THC) to placebo oil in participants with active Crohn's disease. Positive differences in quality of life and the Crohn's disease activity index were observed.

## Plain Title
Can Cannabis or Cannabis Oil Help Treat Crohn's Disease?

## Rationale

**What is Crohn's disease?**

Crohn's disease is a long-term illness. It causes swelling in the gut. This swelling can happen anywhere from the mouth to the bottom. People with Crohn's disease may have fever. They may have loose stools. Their belly may hurt. They may lose weight. 

The disease comes and goes. Sometimes people feel sick with symptoms. This is called active disease. Other times the symptoms stop. This is called remission.

**Why study cannabis for Crohn's disease?**

Cannabis is a plant that many people use. It has parts called cannabinoids. These parts can change how people feel and think. One part is called THC. It can make people feel high. Another part is called cannabidiol or CBD. CBD does not make people feel high.

Some cannabinoids may help reduce swelling in the body. This might help people with Crohn's disease feel better. Researchers wanted to test if cannabis works better than a fake treatment. They wanted to see if it could help adults with Crohn's disease.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies about cannabis and Crohn's disease. They searched until October 2018. They found three small studies. These studies had 93 people in total.

**Who was in the studies?**

All studies included adults with Crohn's disease. Most people had active disease with symptoms. Other treatments had not worked for them.

**What did the studies test?**

One study gave 21 people either cannabis cigarettes or fake cigarettes. The cannabis cigarettes had 115 mg of THC. The fake cigarettes had cannabis with the THC taken out. People used them for eight weeks.

One study gave 22 people either cannabis oil or olive oil. The cannabis oil had 10 mg of CBD twice each day. People used them for a set time.

One study gave 50 people either cannabis oil or fake oil. The cannabis oil had 15% CBD and 4% THC.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The studies were small. They had some problems with how they were done. This makes it hard to trust the results fully.

**Study 1: Cannabis cigarettes with THC**

People who smoked cannabis cigarettes did not go into remission more than people who smoked fake cigarettes. But more people who used cannabis felt their symptoms get better. They had less pain. They felt more hungry. They were happier with their treatment.

More people who used cannabis had side effects. These were mild. They included feeling sleepy, feeling sick, trouble thinking clearly, forgetting things, feeling confused, and feeling dizzy.

**Study 2: Cannabis oil with CBD only**

People who used cannabis oil did not go into remission more than people who used olive oil. One person in each group had serious side effects. Their Crohn's disease got worse.

**Study 3: Cannabis oil with CBD and THC**

People who used cannabis oil felt better in their daily life. Their disease activity scores improved.

**What do these results mean?**

We cannot say for sure if cannabis or cannabis oil helps Crohn's disease. The studies were too small. We need more research with more people. We do not know if cannabis helps people whose disease is in remission.

**What comes next?**

Future studies should test cannabis in more people. They should test people with active disease and people in remission. They should try different amounts of cannabis. They should test different forms like oils, pills, or cigarettes. This will help us learn if cannabis truly helps people with Crohn's disease.",10.1002-14651858.CD012853,"Cannabis and cannabis oil for the treatment of Crohn's disease

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD; also known as autism) is a developmental disability that begins in childhood and is typically seen in around 1% to 2% of children. It is characterised by social communication difficulties and repetitive and restricted behaviours and routines that can have a negative impact on a child's quality of life, achievement at school, and social interactions with others. It has been hypothesised that memantine, which is traditionally used to treat dementia, may be effective in reducing the core symptoms of autism as well as some co‐occurring symptoms such as hyperactivity and language difficulties. If memantine is being used to treat the core symptoms of autism, it is important to review the evidence of its effectiveness. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of memantine on the core symptoms of autism, including, but not limited to, social communication and stereotypical behaviours. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases and three trials registers up to February 2022. We also checked reference lists of key studies and checked with experts in the field for any additional papers. We searched for retractions of the included studies in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Retraction Watch Database. No retractions or corrections were found. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any dose of memantine compared with placebo in autistic people. We also included RCTs in which only one group received memantine, but both groups received the same additional therapy (e.g. a behaviour intervention). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were core autism symptoms and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were language, intelligence, memory, adaptive behaviour, hyperactivity, and irritability. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included three RCTs (two double‐blind and one single‐blind) with 204 participants that examined the short‐term effect (immediately postintervention) of memantine in autistic people. Two studies took place in the USA and the other in Iran. All three studies focused on children and adolescents, with a mean age of 9.40 (standard deviation (SD) 2.26) years. Most participants were male (range across studies 73% to 87%). The diagnosis of ASD was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition; 4th edition, text revision; or 5th edition). To confirm the diagnosis, one study used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview‐Revised (ADI‐R); one used ADOS, ADI‐R or the Autism Diagnostic Interview Screener; and one used the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale. Dosage of memantine was based on the child's weight and ranged from 3 mg to 15 mg per day.  
Comparisons Two studies examined memantine compared with placebo; in the other study, both groups had a behavioural intervention while only one group was given memantine.  
Risk of biasAll studies were rated at high risk of bias overall, as they were at high or unclear risk of bias across all but four domains in one study, and all but two domains in the other two studies. One study was funded by Forest Laboratories, LLC, (Jersey City, New Jersey), Allergan. The study sponsor was involved in the study design, data collection (via contracted clinical investigator sites), analysis and interpretation of data, and the decision to present these results. The other two studies reported no financial support or sponsorship; though in one of the two, the study medication was an in‐kind contribution from Forest Pharmaceuticals. 
Primary outcomesThere was no clear evidence of a difference between memantine and placebo with respect to severity of core symptoms of autism, although we are very uncertain about the evidence. The standardised mean difference in autism symptoms score in the intervention group versus the control group was –0.74 standard deviations (95% confidence interval (CI) −2.07 to 0.58; 2 studies, 181 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; medium effect size); lower scores indicate less severe autistic symptoms. Two studies (144 participants) recorded adverse effects that the authors deemed related to the study and found there may be no difference between memantine and placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.39; low‐certainty evidence). 
Secondary outcomesThere may be no difference between memantine and placebo on language (2 studies, 144 participants; low‐certainty evidence); memory or adaptive behaviour (1 study, 23 participants; both low‐certainty evidence); or hyperactivity or irritability (1 study, 121 participants; both low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
It is unclear whether memantine is an effective treatment for autistic children. None of the three included trials reported on the effectiveness of memantine in adults. Further studies using rigorous designs, larger samples, longer follow‐up and clinically meaningful outcome measures that are important to autistic people and their families will strengthen our knowledge of the effects of memantine in autism. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Does Memantine Help Children with Autism?

## Plain Title

Does a medicine called memantine help reduce the main symptoms of autism in children?

## Rationale

**What is autism?**

Autism is a condition that starts in childhood. It affects about 1 to 2 out of every 100 children. Children with autism often find it hard to talk with others and make friends. They may also do the same actions over and over. These challenges can make school harder and affect how they feel each day.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Doctors usually give memantine to older adults with memory problems. Some researchers think memantine might also help children with autism. They believe it could reduce the main symptoms of autism. It might also help with other problems like trouble sitting still or speaking.

**Why was this study needed?**

Before doctors give memantine to children with autism, we need to know if it really works. This study looked at all the research done so far to see if memantine helps.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies that tested memantine in people with autism. They found three studies with 204 people total.

**Who was in these studies?**

All three studies included children and teens. The average age was about 9 years old. Most were boys (about 7 to 9 out of every 10 children). All children had been told by a doctor that they had autism.

**What did the studies do?**

Two studies gave some children memantine pills and other children fake pills (called placebo). One study gave all children the same therapy. But only some children also got memantine.

The amount of memantine each child took was based on their weight. Children took between 3 mg and 15 mg each day.

**Where did these studies happen?**

Two studies were done in the United States. One study was done in Iran.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers are very unsure if memantine helps with the main symptoms of autism. The studies did not clearly show that memantine works better than fake pills.

**Were there side effects?**

Two studies looked at side effects. They found memantine may not cause more side effects than fake pills. But we cannot be sure.

**Did memantine help with other problems?**

The studies also looked at other things like:
- Speaking and language skills
- Memory
- Daily living skills
- Sitting still
- Getting upset easily

Memantine did not seem to help with any of these problems.

**What are the problems with these studies?**

All three studies had problems that make the results hard to trust. One drug company paid for one study and helped collect and look at the data. The other two studies got the medicine for free from a drug company.

The studies were also quite small. They only looked at what happened right after treatment ended. They did not check if memantine kept working over time.

**What do the results mean?**

We do not know if memantine helps children with autism. We need better studies to find out. None of these studies tested memantine in adults with autism.

**What is needed next?**

Future studies should:
- Include more people
- Follow people for a longer time
- Be designed more carefully
- Measure things that matter most to people with autism and their families

Until we have better research, we cannot say if memantine is a good treatment for autism.",10.1002-14651858.CD013845,"Can a dementia medicine (memantine) help people with autism spectrum disorder?
BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (autism) is a condition that begins in childhood. Core symptoms include persistent difficulties with social communication (e.g. difficulties with back‐and‐forth conversations, communication without words, and in developing and maintaining relationships), and repetitive and restricted interests and behaviours (e.g. repetitive mannerisms, restricted interests and behaviours, resistance to change and sensory sensitivities). Around 1% to 2% of children have autism. Autistic people often have other conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, language impairments (e.g. difficulties understanding and using grammar) and intellectual disability. Autism can have negative impacts on quality of life, school achievement and social relationships. Memantine is a medication traditionally used to treat dementia, but some studies suggest that it may decrease core autistic symptoms. If memantine is being used to change the core symptoms of autism, it is important to assess whether it works and is safe. This review combines the research evidence on the use of memantine in autism. 
Review questionDoes memantine change the core symptoms of autism and related behaviours? 
Search dateThe evidence is current to 14 February 2022. 
Study characteristicsWe found three studies with 204 people that had evaluated the effectiveness of memantine in autism. All studies were randomised controlled trials, meaning participants were randomly allocated to receive either the treatment or a dummy pill (placebo). This is the best design for assessing the effectiveness of treatments. All three studies included children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, with an average age of 9.40 years. We found no studies in adults. The children received memantine (for 12 weeks in two studies and for 24 weeks in one study), and their behaviour was assessed before treatment and immediately after treatment. 
Study funding sourcesOne study was sponsored and funded by a laboratory that makes memantine (Forest). The study sponsor helped to design the study, collect information, analyse and interpret the information, and take the decision to publish the results. The authors of the other two smaller studies said they did not receive any funding; though in one of these studies, Forest Pharmaceuticals provided the medicine for free. 
Key resultsIt is unclear if memantine makes any difference to the core symptoms of autism. Additionally, there may be no difference between memantine and placebo in the occurrence of side effects, language ability, memory, adaptive behaviour or the autism‐related behaviours of hyperactivity and irritability. 
Limitations of the evidenceWe are not confident about the evidence for core symptoms of autism because it comes from only three small studies; because the studies included different types of people and delivered the medicine in different ways; and because the studies did not always provide information about everything we were interested in. Additionally, we have little confidence in the evidence on side effects and language because it comes from only two small studies; and we have little confidence in the evidence on intelligence, memory, adaptive behaviour, hyperactivity and irritability, because it comes from only one small study.

More research is needed to investigate the long‐term effect of anti‐VEGF medications compared with, or in addition to, conventional treatment. 
What did we study in this review? VEGF is a protein produced by cells in your body, and produces new blood vessels when needed.

New blood vessels can cause scarring and narrowing, which can eventually lead to complete closure of the angle. This results in increased eye pressure since the fluid in the eye cannot drain properly. In NVG, the eye is often red and painful, and the vision is abnormal. High pressure in the eye can lead to blindness. 
Anti‐VEGF medication is a type of medicine that blocks VEGF, therefore, slowing the growth of blood vessels. It is administered by injection into the eye. It can be used early stage, when conventional treatment may not be possible. Most studies report short‐term (generally four to six weeks) benefits of anti‐VEGF medication, but long‐term benefits are not clear.

The last two studies reported different results for lowering eye pressure; one study showed inconclusive results, and the other study showed that anti‐VEGF medications were more effective. The certainty of the evidence in these studies was low, due to limitations in the study designs and inconsistency of results.

","# Plain Language Summary: Anti-VEGF Treatment for Neovascular Glaucoma

## Plain Title
Can Anti-VEGF Medicine Help Treat a Type of Eye Disease Called Neovascular Glaucoma?

## Rationale

### What is neovascular glaucoma?
Your eye makes a protein called VEGF. This protein helps grow new blood vessels when your body needs them. Sometimes, your eye makes too much VEGF. When this happens, new blood vessels grow where they should not.

Neovascular glaucoma is a type of eye disease. In this disease, new blood vessels grow inside your eye. These blood vessels grow in the space between two parts of your eye. One part is the iris (the colored part). The other part is the cornea (the clear front part).

### Why is this condition a problem?
These new blood vessels cause problems. They create scars and make the space narrow. Over time, the space can close completely. When this happens, fluid cannot drain from your eye. The fluid builds up and causes high pressure inside your eye.

High eye pressure is dangerous. It can cause pain and redness. It can make your vision worse. It can even cause blindness.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors use anti-VEGF medicine to treat this disease. This medicine blocks VEGF. When VEGF is blocked, fewer new blood vessels grow.

Doctors give this medicine by injection into the eye. It can help early in the disease. Some studies show it helps for a short time (four to six weeks). But doctors do not know if it helps for a long time.

Researchers wanted to find out if anti-VEGF medicine works better than other treatments. They looked at studies that compared treatment with and without anti-VEGF medicine.

## Trial Design

### How was this review designed?
This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at four different studies. They reviewed what these studies found.

### Who was in these studies?
All four studies included people with neovascular glaucoma. In total, 263 people took part in these studies.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies lasted different amounts of time. One study only lasted one week. The other studies lasted longer. But most studies only looked at short-term results.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The results were unclear. The four studies showed different things.

One study was too short. It only lasted one week. Researchers could not tell if the treatment worked beyond that time.

Another study had problems with how it was set up. This made the results uncertain.

The last two studies looked at eye pressure. Eye pressure is important in this disease. One study showed unclear results. The other study showed that anti-VEGF medicine worked better than treatment without it.

### Why are these results uncertain?
The researchers found problems with these studies. The studies were not designed well enough. Also, the studies showed different results from each other. Because of these problems, the researchers rated the evidence as low quality.

### What does this mean for patients?
Right now, there is not enough proof that anti-VEGF medicine works better than other treatments. Doctors cannot say for sure that all patients with neovascular glaucoma should get this medicine.

More research is needed. Future studies should look at long-term results. They should compare anti-VEGF medicine to standard treatments. They should also see if using anti-VEGF medicine along with other treatments helps.

### How current is this information?
Researchers looked for studies published up to March 22, 2019. This review includes all studies available up to that date.

### What is the main message?
It is unclear if anti-VEGF medicine helps people with neovascular glaucoma more than other treatments. More and better studies are needed to answer this question.

Asthma affects 350 million people worldwide including 45% to 70% with mild disease. Treatment is mainly with inhalers containing beta₂‐agonists, typically taken as required to relieve bronchospasm, and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as regular preventive therapy. Poor adherence to regular therapy is common and increases the risk of exacerbations, morbidity and mortality. Fixed‐dose combination inhalers containing both a steroid and a fast‐acting beta₂‐agonist (FABA) in the same device simplify inhalers regimens and ensure symptomatic relief is accompanied by preventative therapy. Their use is established in moderate asthma, but they may also have potential utility in mild asthma.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of single combined (fast‐onset beta₂‐agonist plus an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)) inhaler only used as needed in people with mild asthma. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal. We contacted trial authors for further information and requested details regarding the possibility of unpublished trials. The most recent search was conducted on 19 March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cross‐over trials with at least one week washout period. We included studies of a single fixed‐dose FABA/ICS inhaler used as required compared with no treatment, placebo, short‐acting beta agonist (SABA) as required, regular ICS with SABA as required, regular fixed‐dose combination ICS/long‐acting beta agonist (LABA), or regular fixed‐dose combination ICS/FABA with as required ICS/FABA. We planned to include cluster‐randomised trials if the data had been or could be adjusted for clustering. We excluded trials shorter than 12 weeks. We included full texts, abstracts and unpublished data. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (OR) or rate ratios (RR) and continuous data as mean difference (MD). We reported 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures of meta‐analysis. We applied the GRADE approach to summarise results and to assess the overall certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring systemic steroids, hospital admissions/emergency department or urgent care visits for asthma, and measures of asthma control. 
Main results
We included six studies of which five contributed results to the meta‐analyses. All five used budesonide 200 μg and formoterol 6 μg in a dry powder formulation as the combination inhaler. Comparator fast‐acting bronchodilators included terbutaline and formoterol. Two studies included children aged 12+ and adults; two studies were open‐label. A total of 9657 participants were included, with a mean age of 36 to 43 years. 2.3% to 11% were current smokers. 
FABA / ICS as required versus FABA as required 
Compared with as‐required FABA alone, as‐required FABA/ICS reduced exacerbations requiring systemic steroids (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.60, 2 RCTs, 2997 participants, high‐certainty evidence), equivalent to 109 people out of 1000 in the FABA alone group experiencing an exacerbation requiring systemic steroids, compared to 52 (95% CI 40 to 68) out of 1000 in the FABA/ICS as‐required group. FABA/ICS as required may also reduce the odds of an asthma‐related hospital admission or emergency department or urgent care visit (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.60, 2 RCTs, 2997 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Compared with as‐required FABA alone, any changes in asthma control or spirometry, though favouring as‐required FABA/ICS, were small and less than the minimal clinically‐important differences. We did not find evidence of differences in asthma‐associated quality of life or mortality. For other secondary outcomes FABA/ICS as required was associated with reductions in fractional exhaled nitric oxide, probably reduces the odds of an adverse event (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95, 2 RCTs, 3002 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and may reduce total systemic steroid dose (MD ‐9.90, 95% CI ‐19.38 to ‐0.42, 1 RCT, 443 participants, low‐certainty evidence), and with an increase in the daily inhaled steroid dose (MD 77 μg beclomethasone equiv./day, 95% CI 69 to 84, 2 RCTs, 2554 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
FABA/ICS as required versus regular ICS plus FABA as required 
There may be little or no difference in the number of people with asthma exacerbations requiring systemic steroid with FABA/ICS as required compared with regular ICS (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.07, 4 RCTs, 8065 participants, low‐certainty evidence), equivalent to 81 people out of 1000 in the regular ICS plus FABA group experiencing an exacerbation requiring systemic steroids, compared to 65 (95% CI 49 to 86) out of 1000 FABA/ICS as required group. The odds of an asthma‐related hospital admission or emergency department or urgent care visit may be reduced in those taking FABA/ICS as required (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91, 4 RCTs, 8065 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Compared with regular ICS, any changes in asthma control, spirometry, peak flow rates (PFR), or asthma‐associated quality of life, though favouring regular ICS, were small and less than the minimal clinically important differences (MCID). Adverse events, serious adverse events, total systemic corticosteroid dose and mortality were similar between groups, although deaths were rare, so confidence intervals for this analysis were wide. We found moderate‐certainty evidence from four trials involving 7180 participants that FABA/ICS as required was likely associated with less average daily exposure to inhaled corticosteroids than those on regular ICS (MD ‐154.51 μg/day, 95% CI ‐207.94 to ‐101.09). 
Authors' conclusions
We found FABA/ICS as required is clinically effective in adults and adolescents with mild asthma. Their use instead of FABA as required alone reduced exacerbations, hospital admissions or unscheduled healthcare visits and exposure to systemic corticosteroids and probably reduces adverse events. FABA/ICS as required is as effective as regular ICS and reduced asthma‐related hospital admissions or unscheduled healthcare visits, and average exposure to ICS, and is unlikely to be associated with an increase in adverse events. 
Further research is needed to explore use of FABA/ICS as required in children under 12 years of age, use of other FABA/ICS preparations, and long‐term outcomes beyond 52 weeks. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using a Combination Inhaler Only When Needed for Mild Asthma

## Plain Title

Can people with mild asthma use a combination inhaler only when they need it instead of taking daily medicine?

## Rationale

**What is asthma and why does it matter?**

Asthma is a lung condition that affects 350 million people around the world. About half of these people have mild asthma. Asthma makes it hard to breathe. It can cause wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness.

**How is asthma usually treated?**

Doctors usually give people two types of inhalers:
- A ""rescue"" inhaler that works fast to help breathing. People use this when they feel symptoms.
- A ""preventer"" inhaler with steroids. People should use this every day to stop asthma attacks.

**What is the problem?**

Many people forget to use their daily preventer inhaler. Or they stop using it when they feel better. This increases their risk of asthma attacks. These attacks can be serious and may require emergency care.

**What did researchers want to test?**

Researchers wanted to see if a combination inhaler could work better. This inhaler has both medicines in one device. It includes a fast-acting medicine to help breathing right away. It also has a steroid to prevent future problems. People would only use it when they have symptoms. This might be easier than taking daily medicine. It would give people steroid protection every time they need symptom relief.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at six studies. These studies included 9,657 people total. The people were between 36 and 43 years old on average. Some studies included teenagers aged 12 and older.

All people in the studies had mild asthma. The combination inhaler used in most studies had two medicines: budesonide (a steroid) and formoterol (a fast-acting medicine).

**What did researchers compare?**

They compared the combination inhaler used only when needed to:
- Using only a fast-acting inhaler when needed
- Using a daily steroid inhaler plus a fast-acting inhaler when needed

**How long did the studies last?**

Each study lasted at least 12 weeks. Some lasted up to one year.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

**Combination inhaler when needed compared to fast-acting inhaler alone:**

The combination inhaler worked much better. Out of 1,000 people:
- 109 people using only the fast-acting inhaler had an asthma attack needing steroid pills
- Only 52 people using the combination inhaler had an asthma attack needing steroid pills

The combination inhaler also reduced emergency room visits. It likely caused fewer side effects. People using it took more steroid medicine each day than those using fast-acting inhalers alone. But they took less steroid pills overall for asthma attacks.

**Combination inhaler when needed compared to daily steroid inhaler:**

The combination inhaler worked about as well as daily steroids. Out of 1,000 people:
- 81 people using daily steroids had an asthma attack needing steroid pills
- 65 people using the combination inhaler when needed had an asthma attack needing steroid pills

The combination inhaler may have reduced emergency room visits. People using it took much less steroid medicine each day. On average, they took 154 micrograms less per day. Both approaches had similar numbers of side effects.

**What do these results mean?**

For people with mild asthma, using a combination inhaler only when needed works well. It is better than using a fast-acting inhaler alone. It works as well as taking daily steroid medicine. It may be easier for people to use correctly. They get protection every time they treat their symptoms.

**What else is needed?**

More research is needed for:
- Children under 12 years old
- Other types of combination inhalers
- Effects after more than one year of use",10.1002-14651858.CD013518,"Combination fixed‐dose beta agonist and steroid inhaler as required for adults or children with mild asthma 
Background 
Asthma is the most common respiratory illness. Many people with asthma have mild asthma, but still remain at risk of severe asthma exacerbations, which often result in the use of oral steroids. Mild asthma is commonly treated with preventative inhalers, which contain a steroid used to reduce inflammation in the airways, and with reliever inhalers, which relax the muscles of the airways causing quick relief of asthma symptoms. Combination inhalers contain both the preventative steroid and the reliever, simplifying treatment and ensuring steroids are always given alongside the immediate relief of symptoms. 
Review question 
We examined the findings of clinical trials to assess the use of combination inhalers in the treatment of mild asthma when taken on an as‐needed, symptom‐driven basis. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to March 2021. Results were collected from six studies which compared use of a combination inhaler used on an as‐needed basis with either as‐needed reliever‐only therapy or daily treatment with a low dose preventative inhaler. 
Key findings 
We found that combination inhalers used as‐needed when compared with reliever‐only treatment reduced severe exacerbations requiring tablet steroids and rates of emergency admission to hospital with asthma symptoms. Differences in other measures relating to symptom control and lung function were too small to be clinically important. Rates of severe exacerbations were similar between patients on daily preventative steroid inhalers and those using combination inhalers as‐needed. People using combination inhalers had lower rates of hospital admission and lower total inhaled steroid dose, whilst the differences in lung function and asthma symptom control were not clinically significant. 
This review found the use of combination inhalers used when the patient experiences asthma symptoms was beneficial in reducing severe exacerbations when compared to stand‐alone reliever therapy in mild asthma. In addition to this the use of combination inhalers used on an as‐needed basis was associated with a reduction in hospital admissions and total inhaled steroid dose when compared with regularly‐taken low dose preventative inhaler therapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies which contributed data were well‐designed and robust, although two were open‐label (participants knew which treatment they were getting), with some potential for bias, so the evidence was generally of moderate‐to‐high quality.

Review question 
Phototherapy is a pain‐free method of treatment that uses light to treat various medical conditions. We reviewed the evidence about phototherapy for foot ulcers in people with diabetes. We wanted to find out whether phototherapy speeds up wound healing and improves patients' quality of life, and whether there are any side effects. 
Background 
Foot ulcers are a disabling complication of diabetes that affect 15% to 25% of people with diabetes at some time in their lives. Diabetic foot ulcers are painful and prone to infection. Not all diabetic foot ulcers can be healed, which can ultimately lead to surgical removal of a limb. Phototherapy involves exposing the affected area to ultraviolet light, sometimes using lasers. This is thought to help ulcers heal through multiple mechanisms such as increased cell growth and blood vessel activity. It has been used as an alternative approach for healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing different phototherapies, or comparing phototherapy with other treatments or a placebo (sham treatment), for foot ulcers in adults with diabetes in October 2016. We included eight trials (316 participants). Most studies were undertaken in clinics or hospitals and had small numbers of participants (14 to 84). The average age in the included studies was from 53 to 68 years, and the ratio of females to males was 0.46 to 1.88. The included studies compared phototherapy with placebo or no phototherapy, on top of usual care (usual care could include treatments such as dressings, antibiotics, or wound cleaning). Treatment times ranged from 15 days to 20 weeks. 
Key results 
The results suggested that phototherapy, when compared to no phototherapy or a placebo, may increase the proportion of wounds completely healed during follow‐up and reduce wound size. However, as the included studies involved small numbers of participants and had drawbacks in study methods, our confidence in these results is limited. We did not find sufficient evidence that the potential harms or incidence of amputations differed between the phototherapy group and the no phototherapy/placebo group. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be low due to a lack of data and risk of the study results being biased. Further high‐quality studies are needed to confirm the benefits and harms of phototherapy.

","# Plain Language Summary: Using Light Therapy to Treat Foot Wounds in People with Diabetes

## Plain Title
Does Light Therapy Help Heal Foot Wounds in People with Diabetes?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

People with diabetes can get wounds on their feet called foot ulcers. These wounds are common. About 1 in 5 people with diabetes will get a foot ulcer at some point in their life.

Foot ulcers cause problems for patients. They are painful. They can get infected easily. Some foot ulcers do not heal. When this happens, doctors may need to remove part of the leg or foot through surgery.

**What is light therapy?**

Light therapy is a treatment that uses special light. Doctors shine the light on the wound. The treatment does not cause pain. Sometimes doctors use a type of light called ultraviolet light. Sometimes they use lasers.

**Why might light therapy help?**

Scientists think light therapy helps wounds heal in several ways. The light may help cells grow faster. It may also help blood vessels work better. These changes could help foot ulcers heal.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know if light therapy really works. They needed to find out if it helps foot ulcers heal faster. They also wanted to know if light therapy is safe.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this question?**

Researchers looked for studies that tested light therapy. They found 8 studies. These studies included 316 people total.

**Who was in the studies?**

All people in the studies had diabetes. They all had foot ulcers. The people were between 53 and 68 years old on average. The studies included both men and women.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared two groups. One group got light therapy plus regular care. The other group got fake treatment or no light therapy plus regular care. Regular care included things like bandages, antibiotics, or wound cleaning.

**How long did the studies last?**

The treatment time was different in each study. Some studies lasted 15 days. Others lasted 20 weeks.

**Where did the studies happen?**

Most studies took place in clinics or hospitals.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The results suggest light therapy may help. More wounds healed completely in the light therapy group. The wounds also got smaller compared to the control group.

However, the studies were small. Each study had between 14 and 84 people. The studies also had some problems with how they were done.

**What about safety?**

Researchers did not find clear differences in harmful effects. They also did not find clear differences in how many people needed surgery to remove part of their leg or foot.

**What do these results mean?**

Light therapy might help foot ulcers heal in people with diabetes. But we cannot be sure yet. The evidence is not strong enough.

**Why is the evidence limited?**

The studies were small. They did not have enough people in them. The way the studies were done had some problems. These problems could affect the results.

**What is needed next?**

More studies are needed. These studies should be larger. They should be done more carefully. This would help us know for sure if light therapy works.

**Conclusion**

Light therapy may help heal foot ulcers in people with diabetes. But we need better studies to be certain. People with diabetes should talk to their doctor about the best treatment for foot ulcers.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treating all school children at regular intervals with deworming drugs in areas where helminth infection is common. Global advocacy organizations claim routine deworming has substantive health and societal effects beyond the removal of worms. In this update of the 2015 edition we included six new trials, additional data from included trials, and addressed comments and criticisms. 
Objectives
To summarize the effects of public health programmes to regularly treat all children with deworming drugs on child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT); reference lists; and registers of ongoing and completed trials up to 19 September 2018. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared deworming drugs for soil‐transmitted helminths (STHs) with placebo or no treatment in children aged 16 years or less, reporting on weight, height, haemoglobin, and formal tests of cognition. We also sought data on other measures of growth, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and mortality. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion, risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed continuous data using the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where data were missing, we contacted trial authors. We stratified the analysis based on the background burden of STH infection. We used outcomes at time of longest follow‐up. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified 51 trials, including 10 cluster‐RCTs, that met the inclusion criteria. One trial evaluating mortality included over one million children, and the remaining 50 trials included a total of 84,336 participants. Twenty‐four trials were in populations categorized as high burden, including nine trials in children selected because they were helminth‐stool positive; 18 with intermediate burden; and nine as low burden. 
First or single dose of deworming drugs 
Fourteen trials reported on weight after a single dose of deworming drugs (4970 participants, 14 RCTs). The effects were variable. There was little or no effect in studies conducted in low and intermediate worm burden groups. In the high‐burden group, there was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago. These trials result in qualitative heterogeneity and uncertainty in the meta‐analysis across all studies (I2 statistic = 90%), with GRADE assessment assessed as very low‐certainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight. 
For height, most studies showed little or no effect after a single dose, with one of the two trials in Kenya from 30 years ago showing a large average difference (2621 participants, 10 trials, low‐certainty evidence). Single dose probably had no effect on average haemoglobin (MD 0.10 g/dL, 95% CI 0.03 lower to 0.22 higher; 1252 participants, five trials, moderate‐certainty evidence), or on average cognition (1596 participants, five trials, low‐certainty evidence). The data are insufficient to know if there is an effect on school attendance and performance (304 participants, one trial, low‐certainty evidence), or on physical fitness (280 participants, three trials, very low‐certainty evidence). No trials reported on mortality. 
Multiple doses of deworming drugs 
The effect of regularly treating children with deworming drugs given every three to six months on weight was reported in 18 trials, with follow‐up times of between six months and three years; there was little or no effect on average weight in all but two trials, irrespective of worm prevalence‐intensity. The two trials with large average weight gain included one in the high burden area in Kenya carried out over 30 years ago, and one study from India in a low prevalence area where subsequent studies in the same area did not show an effect. This heterogeneity causes uncertainty in any meta‐analysis (I2 = 78%). Post‐hoc analysis excluding trials published prior to 2000 gave an estimate of average difference in weight gain of 0.02 kg (95%CI from 0.04 kg loss to 0.08 gain, I2 = 0%). Thus we conclude that we do not know if repeated doses of deworming drugs impact on average weight, with a fewer older studies showing large gains, and studies since 2000 showing little or no average gain. 
Regular treatment probably had little or no effect on the following parameters: average height (MD 0.02 cm higher, 95% CI 0.09 lower to 0.13 cm higher; 13,700 participants, 13 trials, moderate‐certainty evidence); average haemoglobin (MD 0.01 g/dL lower; 95% CI 0.05 g/dL lower to 0.07 g/dL higher; 5498 participants, nine trials, moderate‐certainty evidence); formal tests of cognition (35,394 participants, 8 trials, moderate‐certainty evidence); school performance (34,967 participants, four trials, moderate‐certainty evidence). The evidence assessing an effect on school attendance is inconsistent, and at risk of bias (mean attendance 2% higher, 95% CI 5% lower to 8% higher; 20,650 participants, three trials, very low‐certainty evidence). No trials reported on physical fitness. No effect was shown on mortality (1,005,135 participants, three trials, low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Public health programmes to regularly treat all children with deworming drugs do not appear to improve height, haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, or mortality. We do not know if there is an effect on school attendance, since the evidence is inconsistent and at risk of bias, and there is insufficient data on physical fitness. Studies conducted in two settings over 20 years ago showed large effects on weight gain, but this is not a finding in more recent, larger studies. We would caution against selecting only the evidence from these older studies as a rationale for contemporary mass treatment programmes as this ignores the recent studies that have not shown benefit. 
The conclusions of the 2015 edition have not changed in this update.
","# Plain Language Summary: Do Regular Deworming Programs Help School Children Grow and Learn Better?

## Plain Title

Do programs that give deworming medicine to all school children help them grow, stay healthy, and do better in school?

## Rationale

**What are worms and why are they a problem?**

Some children get worms that live in their gut. These worms are called soil-transmitted helminths. Children can get them from dirty water or soil. These worms can make children feel tired and sick. They may cause children to not grow well or miss school.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

The World Health Organization says all children in areas with many worms should get deworming medicine regularly. Some groups say this helps children grow taller, gain weight, do better in school, and stay healthier. Researchers wanted to know if this is true.

**Why was this study needed?**

Many countries spend money on deworming programs. Researchers needed to check if these programs really help children. They looked at many studies to see what happens when all children get deworming medicine, not just children who have worms.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not one single study. Researchers looked at 51 different studies done around the world. They combined the results to see the overall picture.

The studies included over 1 million children total. Most studies had smaller groups of children. The children were 16 years old or younger. Some children lived in areas where many children had worms. Other children lived in areas where fewer children had worms.

**What did the studies test?**

Some studies gave children one dose of deworming medicine. Other studies gave children medicine every 3 to 6 months for up to 3 years. Researchers compared these children to children who got no medicine or fake medicine.

**What did researchers measure?**

They measured weight and height. They tested blood to check for anemia. They gave tests to check thinking skills. They looked at school attendance and grades. They checked physical fitness. They also looked at whether children died.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

After one dose of medicine, most studies showed little or no change in weight. Two very old studies from Kenya from 30 years ago showed big weight gains. But newer studies did not show this benefit. Because results were so different, researchers cannot say for sure what one dose does.

One dose probably did not change blood health. It probably did not improve thinking skills. There was not enough information about school attendance or physical fitness.

After multiple doses given regularly, most studies showed little or no change in weight. Again, two older studies showed big gains, but newer studies since 2000 showed no gains. When researchers looked only at studies from 2000 or later, they found no weight gain at all.

Regular treatment probably did not change height. Children grew about the same whether they got medicine or not.

Regular treatment probably did not change blood health or thinking skills. It probably did not improve school grades.

The evidence about school attendance was mixed and unclear. Some studies showed small improvements, others showed none.

Three large studies looked at whether children died. The medicine did not prevent deaths.

**What do these results mean?**

Programs that give deworming medicine to all children do not seem to help them grow taller or gain weight. The medicine does not improve their blood health, thinking skills, or school grades. It does not prevent death.

Some very old studies showed benefits. But many newer and larger studies do not show these same benefits. Researchers warn against using only the old studies to support deworming programs today.

**Important note:**

This study looked at programs that treat all children, whether they have worms or not. It does not mean that treating individual children who are sick with worms is not helpful.",10.1002-14651858.CD000371,"Deworming school children in low‐ and middle‐income countries
Cochrane researchers examined the effects of deworming children in areas where intestinal worm infection is common. After searching for relevant trials up to 19 September 2018, we included 50 trials with a total of 84,336 participants, and an additional trial of one million children. 
What is deworming and why might it be important 
Soil‐transmitted worms, including roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms, are common in tropical and subtropical areas, and particularly affect children living in poverty where there is inadequate sanitation. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends that school children in many areas are regularly treated with drugs which kill these worms. Some advocates claim such programmes improve child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and survival. 
What the research says 
In populations of children living in endemic areas, the effect of the first, single dose of deworming drugs on weight is unclear. There was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya, reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago in a school where children were heavily infected with worms. This causes uncertainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight. For height, most studies showed little or no effect, with the exception of the site in Kenya. A single dose of deworming medicine probably has no effect on haemoglobin and cognition. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on school attendance, school performance, or physical fitness or mortality. 
In studies where children were regularly treated with deworming medicine there was little or no effect on weight in all but two trials, irrespective of whether children were heavily infected with worms or not. The two trials with large average weight gains included the Kenya study carried out over 30 years ago, and one study from India carried out over 20 years ago in a low worm burden area where later studies in the same area did not show an effect. In trials from 2000 onwards, which are more relevant given the global reduction in worm burden, there is little or no effect. This causes uncertainty and means we do not know if regularly treating children with deworming medicine improves their weight. Regularly deworming children probably has no effect on height, haemoglobin, cognition, and mortality. We do not know if there is an impact on school attendance, since the evidence is inconsistent and at high risk of bias. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on physical fitness. 
Authors' conclusions 
For public health programmes to regularly treat all children in endemic areas with deworming drugs, there is quite substantial evidence of no benefit in terms of haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, and mortality. For weight, contemporary studies do not show an effect, but unusually large effects were seen in studies over 20 years ago.

## Plain Title
Can Extra Medicine During Cataract Surgery Help Keep a Previous Glaucoma Surgery Working?

## Rationale

**What are glaucoma and cataract?**

Glaucoma is an eye disease that can cause vision loss. The pressure inside the eye gets too high. This high pressure harms the optic nerve. The optic nerve sends signals from the eye to the brain. Once glaucoma damages vision, the damage cannot be fixed.

Cataract is when the lens of the eye gets cloudy. This makes it hard to see clearly.

Both glaucoma and cataract are common around the world. They can make it hard for people to work and live their daily lives.

**How is glaucoma treated?**

The main goal of glaucoma treatment is to lower eye pressure. This helps slow down vision loss.

Doctors first try eye drops or laser treatment. Sometimes these treatments do not work well enough. When this happens, doctors do a surgery called trabeculectomy. In this surgery, the doctor makes a small hole in the white part of the eye. This hole lets extra fluid drain out. This lowers the pressure inside the eye.

**What is the problem?**

Some people who had trabeculectomy surgery later need cataract surgery. During cataract surgery, the eye can heal too much. Scar tissue can form. This scar tissue can block the drainage hole from the trabeculectomy. When the hole gets blocked, the trabeculectomy stops working. The eye pressure goes up again.

**What might help?**

Doctors sometimes use extra medicine during cataract surgery. These medicines help stop too much healing and scar tissue. The medicines include 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C, or anti-VEGF therapy.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if these extra medicines really help. They wanted to see if the medicines keep the drainage hole open. They wanted to compare people who got extra medicine to people who did not get extra medicine.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This is a review study. The researchers looked for other studies that already happened. They wanted to find randomized controlled trials. In these trials, some patients get the extra medicine. Other patients do not get the extra medicine. A computer randomly picks which group each patient joins. This type of study gives the best evidence.

The researchers searched for studies that included:
- Adults with glaucoma who already had trabeculectomy surgery
- Patients who needed cataract surgery
- Patients who got extra medicine during cataract surgery compared to patients who did not

The researchers searched for all studies published up to April 2021.

## Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

The researchers found no studies that met their requirements. They found no randomized controlled trials that tested extra medicine during cataract surgery in people who had trabeculectomy.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, we do not know if extra medicine during cataract surgery helps. There is no good evidence to answer this question.

Doctors cannot be sure if these medicines keep the drainage hole open. They cannot be sure if the medicines help the trabeculectomy keep working.

**What happens next?**

More research is needed. Scientists should do randomized controlled trials in the future. These studies would help doctors know the best way to care for patients. Patients who have both glaucoma and cataract need better answers.

**Conclusions**

This review found no evidence about whether extra medicine during cataract surgery helps people who had trabeculectomy.

## Plain Title
Do SSRI and SNRI Antidepressants Prevent Tension-Type Headaches?

## Rationale

Tension-type headache is a common kind of head pain. Many people get these headaches. When headaches happen often or cause a lot of pain, they can make daily life hard. People may have trouble working, spending time with family, or doing things they enjoy.

Some people with frequent headaches take medicine before the pain starts. This may help stop headaches from happening. Doctors sometimes use medicines called SSRIs and SNRIs to prevent headaches. These medicines are usually given to treat depression. SSRI stands for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. SNRI stands for serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. These medicines work by changing certain chemicals in the brain.

Researchers wanted to test if SSRIs and SNRIs actually work to prevent tension-type headaches. They thought these medicines might help because they affect brain chemicals that may be linked to headaches. This study was needed to find out if these medicines really help people with tension-type headaches.

## Trial Design

This study looked at research that other scientists had already done. The researchers collected information from eight different studies. These studies included 412 adults total. All the people in these studies had tension-type headaches.

The studies were fairly short. They lasted between two and four months. Each study had a small number of people in it. The researchers compared SSRIs and SNRIs to two things. First, they compared them to placebo. A placebo is a sugar pill with no real medicine in it. Second, they compared them to another medicine called amitriptyline. Amitriptyline is an older type of antidepressant.

The researchers looked at how many days people had headaches. They also looked at side effects. Side effects are unwanted problems that medicine can cause. This review was an update of an older review. The researchers found two new studies in November 2014. They added these to six studies from before.

## Results

The main finding was that SSRIs and SNRIs did not work better than placebo. People who took these medicines had about the same number of headache days as people who took sugar pills. This means these medicines did not prevent tension-type headaches.

When compared to amitriptyline, SSRIs and SNRIs also did not work better. Both types of medicine helped about the same amount. However, people taking SSRIs or SNRIs had fewer minor side effects than people taking amitriptyline. Minor side effects might include dry mouth or feeling sleepy. Even though SSRIs and SNRIs caused fewer side effects, about the same number of people stopped taking each medicine. This means the side effects from amitriptyline were not bad enough to make more people quit.

The researchers concluded that SSRIs and SNRIs do not seem to help prevent tension-type headaches. These medicines did not reduce the number of headache days. The studies had some problems. They were small and short. Many were not high quality. This means we cannot be completely sure about the results.

The researchers did not find studies comparing SSRIs and SNRIs to other treatments. These other treatments might include botulinum toxin shots, talk therapy, massage, or acupuncture. More research is needed with better quality studies. Future studies should be larger and last longer. They should also compare these medicines to other headache treatments.

For now, based on this review, SSRIs and SNRIs do not appear to be good choices for preventing tension-type headaches.",10.1002-14651858.CD011681,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for preventing tension‐type headache

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis and is more prevalent among people with CKD than among people who do not have CKD. Although several drugs have been used to effectively treat osteoporosis in the general population, it is unclear whether they are also effective and safe for people with CKD, who have altered systemic mineral and bone metabolism. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for osteoporosis in patients with CKD stages 3‐5, and those undergoing dialysis (5D). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 January 2021 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing any anti‐osteoporotic drugs with a placebo, no treatment or usual care in patients with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3 to 5D were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed their quality using the risk of bias tool, and extracted data. The main outcomes were the incidence of fracture at any sites; mean change in the bone mineral density (BMD; measured using dual‐energy radiographic absorptiometry (DXA)) of the femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine, and distal radius; death from all causes; incidence of adverse events; and quality of life (QoL). Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
Main results
Seven studies involving 9164 randomised participants with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3 to 5D met the inclusion criteria; all participants were postmenopausal women. Five studies included patients with CKD stages 3‐4, and two studies included patients with CKD stages 5 or 5D. Five pharmacological interventions were identified (abaloparatide, alendronate, denosumab, raloxifene, and teriparatide). All studies were judged to be at an overall high risk of bias. 
Among patients with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.69; low certainty evidence). Anti‐osteoporotic drugs probably makes little or no difference to the risk of clinical fracture (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.05; moderate certainty evidence) and adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00; moderate certainty evidence). We were unable to incorporate studies into the meta‐analyses for BMD at the femoral neck, lumbar spine and total hip as they only reported the percentage change in the BMD in the intervention group. 
Among patients with severe CKD stages 5 or 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.87; very low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improves the BMD at the femoral neck because the certainty of this evidence is very low (MD 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.02). Anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve the BMD at the lumbar spine (MD 0.03, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.04, low certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported in the included studies. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of death (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.56; very low certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Among patients with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture in low certainty evidence. Anti‐osteoporotic drugs make little or no difference to the risk of clinical fracture and adverse events in moderate certainty evidence. Among patients with CKD stages 5 and 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture and death because the certainty of this evidence is very low. Anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve the BMD at the lumbar spine in low certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improves the BMD at the femoral neck because the certainty of this evidence is very low. Larger studies including men, paediatric patients or individuals with unstable CKD‐mineral and bone disorder are required to assess the effect of each anti‐osteoporotic drug at each stage of CKD. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Medicines for Weak Bones in People with Kidney Disease

## Plain Title

Do medicines for weak bones work and are they safe for people with kidney disease?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?

Some people have weak bones that break easily. This condition is called osteoporosis. People with kidney disease get weak bones more often than people with healthy kidneys. This happens because kidney disease changes how the body handles minerals like calcium that keep bones strong.

### Why was this study needed?

Doctors have medicines that make bones stronger in people without kidney disease. But no one knew if these same medicines work well and are safe for people with kidney disease. The body works differently when kidneys are not healthy. This means medicines might not work the same way.

### What did researchers want to find out?

Researchers wanted to know if medicines for weak bones help people with kidney disease. They wanted to see if these medicines prevent broken bones and make bones stronger. They also wanted to know if the medicines cause harmful side effects.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

Researchers looked at 7 studies that tested medicines for weak bones. They combined the results from all these studies to get better answers.

The studies included 9,164 women after menopause. All the women had both weak bones and kidney disease. Some women had mild to moderate kidney disease. Other women had severe kidney disease or were on dialysis. Dialysis is a treatment that cleans the blood when kidneys stop working.

The studies tested 5 different medicines: abaloparatide, alendronate, denosumab, raloxifene, and teriparatide. Some women got the medicine. Other women got a fake pill or no treatment. Researchers then compared the two groups.

## Results

### What did the study find?

**For people with mild to moderate kidney disease:**

The medicines may help prevent broken bones in the spine. About half as many women who took medicine had spine fractures compared to women who did not take medicine.

The medicines probably do not change the risk of other broken bones in the body.

The medicines probably do not cause more side effects than fake pills.

**For people with severe kidney disease or on dialysis:**

Researchers are not sure if the medicines prevent broken bones. The studies were too small to know for certain.

The medicines may slightly strengthen bones in the lower back.

Researchers are not sure if the medicines strengthen hip bones.

The medicines do not seem to cause more deaths.

### What does this mean?

Medicines for weak bones may help prevent spine fractures in people with mild to moderate kidney disease. But they may not prevent other types of broken bones.

For people with severe kidney disease, researchers need more information. The current studies are too small to give clear answers.

### What is still needed?

More studies are needed that include:
- Men with kidney disease and weak bones
- Children with these conditions
- People at different stages of kidney disease
- Tests of each medicine separately

These studies would help doctors know which medicine works best for each person with kidney disease and weak bones.

### Important note

All the women in these studies were past menopause. Results might be different for men, younger women, or children.",10.1002-14651858.CD013424,"Pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis in patients with chronic kidney disease
What is the issue?Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of osteoporosis (weakened bone strength), which can often lead to bone fracture. Several drugs are available for the treatment of osteoporosis; however, it is unknown whether these drugs are equally effective and safe in patients with CKD because bone strength impairment in these patients occurs via a different mechanism. 
What did we do?Data were collected from studies including patients with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3‐5, and those undergoing dialysis (stage 5D) with data available on fracture, change in the bone mineral density (BMD; a bone strength index), and adverse events. We included seven studies with available evidence up to 25 January 2021, comparing anti‐osteoporotic drugs (abaloparatide, alendronate, denosumab, raloxifene, and teriparatide) with placebo (a dummy drug), in 9,164 postmenopausal women. We performed a meta‐analysis to assess the effects of these anti‐osteoporotic drugs. 
What did we find?In postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce vertebral fracture in low certainty evidence. Anti‐osteoporotic drugs probably make little or no difference to clinical fracture and adverse events in moderate certainty evidence. In postmenopausal with CKD stages 5 or 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture and death, and anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve BMD at the lumbar spine in low certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improve BMD at the femoral neck. 
ConclusionsAmong postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture. Among patients with CKD stages 5 and 5D, anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve bone strength. However, these conclusions are based on limited data and therefore uncertain.

The use of short‐acting insulin analogues (insulin lispro, insulin aspart, insulin glulisine) for adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes is still controversial, as reflected in many scientific debates. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of short‐acting insulin analogues compared to regular human insulin in adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Search methods
For this update we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the WHO ICTRP Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov to 31 October 2018. We placed no restrictions on the language of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials with an intervention duration of at least 24 weeks that compared short‐acting insulin analogues to regular human insulin in the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes, who were not pregnant. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We assessed dichotomous outcomes by risk ratios (RR), and Peto odds ratios (POR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed continuous outcomes by mean differences (MD) with 95% CI. We assessed trials for certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified 10 trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, randomising 2751 participants; 1388 participants were randomised to receive insulin analogues and 1363 participants to receive regular human insulin. The duration of the intervention ranged from 24 to 104 weeks, with a mean of about 41 weeks. The trial populations showed diversity in disease duration, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. None of the trials were blinded, so the risk of performance bias and detection bias, especially for subjective outcomes, such as hypoglycaemia, was high in nine of 10 trials from which we extracted data. Several trials showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods and results. 
None of the included trials defined all‐cause mortality as a primary outcome. Six trials provided Information on the number of participants who died during the trial, with five deaths out of 1272 participants (0.4%) in the insulin analogue groups and three deaths out of 1247 participants (0.2%) in the regular human insulin groups (Peto OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.41 to 6.64; P = 0.48; moderate‐certainty evidence). Six trials, with 2509 participants, assessed severe hypoglycaemia differently, therefore, we could not summarise the results with a meta‐analysis. Overall, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events was low, and none of the trials showed a clear difference between the two intervention arms (low‐certainty evidence). 
The MD in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) change was ‐0.03% (95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.09; P = 0.60; 9 trials, 2608 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction ranged between ‐0.31% and 0.25%. The MD in the overall number of non‐severe hypoglycaemic episodes per participant per month was 0.08 events (95% CI 0.00 to 0.16; P = 0.05; 7 trials, 2667 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between ‐0.03 and 0.19 events per participant per month. The results provided for nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes were of questionable validity. Overall, there was no clear difference between the two short‐acting insulin analogues and regular human insulin. Two trials assessed health‐related quality of life and treatment satisfaction, but we considered the results for both outcomes to be unreliable (very low‐certainty evidence). 
No trial was designed to investigate possible long term effects (all‐cause mortality, microvascular or macrovascular complications of diabetes), especially in participants with diabetes‐related complications. No trial reported on socioeconomic effects. 
Authors' conclusions
Our analysis found no clear benefits of short‐acting insulin analogues over regular human insulin in people with type 2 diabetes. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was poor and results on patient‐relevant outcomes, like all‐cause mortality, microvascular or macrovascular complications and severe hypoglycaemic episodes were sparse. Long‐term efficacy and safety data are needed to draw conclusions about the effects of short‐acting insulin analogues on patient‐relevant outcomes. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Types of Fast-Acting Insulin for People with Type 2 Diabetes

## Plain Title

Comparing newer fast-acting insulin to regular human insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes

## Rationale

**What is type 2 diabetes?**

Type 2 diabetes is a condition where the body cannot control blood sugar levels properly. High blood sugar over time can damage the heart, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. This causes a heavy burden for patients who must manage their condition every day.

**What are the different types of insulin?**

Many people with type 2 diabetes need insulin shots to control their blood sugar. Regular human insulin has been used for many years. Newer fast-acting insulins (called insulin analogues) were developed to work more quickly in the body. These include insulin lispro, insulin aspart, and insulin glulisine.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors still debate whether the newer fast-acting insulins work better than regular human insulin. This study was needed to find out if the newer insulins provide real benefits for patients. The researchers wanted to know if newer insulins help people live longer, have fewer complications, or have better blood sugar control.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. The researchers searched medical databases up to October 2018. They looked for studies that compared fast-acting insulin analogues to regular human insulin.

**Who was in the studies?**

The review included 10 studies with 2,751 adults with type 2 diabetes. These adults were not pregnant. About half (1,388 people) used the newer fast-acting insulins. The other half (1,363 people) used regular human insulin.

**How long did the studies last?**

Each study lasted at least 24 weeks (about 6 months). The longest study lasted 104 weeks (about 2 years). On average, studies lasted about 41 weeks (about 10 months).

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers found no clear benefits of newer fast-acting insulins compared to regular human insulin.

**Deaths during the studies:**

Very few people died during these studies. Five people died out of 1,272 using newer insulins. Three people died out of 1,247 using regular insulin. This difference was very small and could be due to chance.

**Severe low blood sugar episodes:**

Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can be dangerous. Six studies looked at severe low blood sugar episodes. These episodes were rare in both groups. The studies showed no clear difference between the two types of insulin.

**Blood sugar control:**

Researchers measured blood sugar control using a test called HbA1c. This test shows average blood sugar over several months. Both types of insulin controlled blood sugar about the same. The difference was tiny (0.03%) and not meaningful.

**Mild low blood sugar episodes:**

Seven studies counted mild low blood sugar episodes. People using newer insulins had slightly more episodes (about 0.08 more per month). However, this difference was very small and may not be important.

**Quality of life:**

Two studies looked at quality of life and treatment satisfaction. The results were not reliable enough to draw conclusions.

**What was missing from these studies?**

None of the studies were designed to look at long-term effects. They did not measure complications like heart disease, kidney damage, or eye problems. They did not look at cost differences between the two types of insulin.

**Quality of the evidence:**

The quality of evidence was poor to moderate. Many studies had problems with how they were designed. None of the studies were blinded, meaning both doctors and patients knew which insulin they were using. This could affect the results.

**What do these results mean?**

Based on current evidence, newer fast-acting insulins do not appear to work better than regular human insulin for people with type 2 diabetes. Both types of insulin seem to work about the same for controlling blood sugar and preventing low blood sugar episodes.

**What is still needed?**

Longer studies are needed. These studies should look at whether one type of insulin helps people live longer or prevents diabetes complications. More information is needed before doctors can say one type of insulin is clearly better than the other.",10.1002-14651858.CD013228,"Short‐acting insulin analogues versus regular human insulin for type 2 diabetes mellitus
Review question 
Are short‐acting insulin analogues better than regular human insulin for adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes? 
Background 
Short‐acting insulin analogues act more quickly than regular human insulin. They can be injected immediately before meals and lead to lower blood sugar levels after food intake. Whether people with diabetes really profit from these newer insulins is debated. 
Study characteristics 
We found 10 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the short‐acting insulin analogues insulin lispro, insulin aspart, or insulin glulisine to regular human insulin in 2751 participants. The people in the included trials were monitored (followed) for 24 to 104 weeks. 
This evidence is up to date as of 31 October 2018.
Key results 
We are uncertain whether short‐acting insulin analogues are better than regular human insulin for long‐term blood glucose control or for reducing the number of times blood sugar levels drop below normal (hypoglycaemic episodes). The studies were too short to reliably investigate death from any cause. We found no clear effect of insulin analogues on health‐related quality of life. We found no information on late diabetes complications, such as problems with the eyes, kidneys, or feet. No study reported on socioeconomic effects, such as costs of the intervention and absence from work. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the included studies was low or very low for most outcomes, mainly because all studies were carried out in an open‐labelled fashion (study participants and study personnel knew who was getting which treatment). Several studies also showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods, and results were imprecise.

","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do Blood Thinners Help Patients with Small Blood Clots in the Lungs?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Blood clots can form in the lungs. Doctors call this pulmonary embolism, or PE. These clots block blood flow in the lungs. PE causes between 50,000 and 200,000 deaths each year. It is the third most common cause of death from heart and blood vessel problems.

**What are subsegmental blood clots?**

Some blood clots are very small. They form only in the tiny blood vessels at the edges of the lungs. Doctors call these subsegmental pulmonary embolism, or SSPE. New CT scan machines can now see these small clots better than before. This means doctors find more of these small clots now.

**What symptoms do patients have?**

Most patients with SSPE have few symptoms or no symptoms at all. They may not have the usual signs like coughing, chest pain, or trouble breathing. Sometimes doctors find these clots by accident when doing scans for other reasons, like checking for cancer.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors are not sure if these small clots are dangerous. They do not know if patients need treatment. The usual treatment for blood clots is blood thinners. These drugs are also called anticoagulants. Blood thinners stop clots from getting bigger. But these drugs can also cause bleeding problems.

Doctors need to know: Do blood thinners help patients with small lung clots? Or do the risks outweigh the benefits? This review looked for studies that could answer this question.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers look for answers?**

The researchers searched for clinical trials. They looked for studies that compared two groups of patients:
- Patients who took blood thinners
- Patients who did not take blood thinners

They wanted to find studies about patients with SSPE. These could be patients with symptoms or patients where doctors found the clots by accident.

The researchers searched medical databases up to November 26, 2019. They looked for high-quality studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, patients are put into groups by chance. This makes the results more reliable.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found no studies that met their requirements. There were no randomized controlled trials about blood thinners for SSPE.

**What does this mean?**

Without any studies, the researchers cannot answer the main question. They cannot say if blood thinners help or harm patients with small lung clots. There is simply no evidence from good quality studies.

**What happens next?**

Doctors still do not know the best way to treat SSPE. They cannot make informed choices about treatment. More research is urgently needed.

**Why is this important?**

More patients are being diagnosed with SSPE because of better CT scans. Doctors need to know how to help these patients. Should they prescribe blood thinners? Or should they just watch and wait?

Good quality studies must be done to answer these questions. Until then, doctors must make decisions without clear evidence. They must weigh the possible benefits and risks for each patient.

**Conclusion**

There is no evidence from clinical trials about treating small blood clots in the lungs. Researchers need to conduct well-designed studies. Only then can doctors know the best way to care for these patients.

Stuttering, or stammering as it is referred to in some countries, affects a child's ability to speak fluently. It is a common communication disorder, affecting 11% of children by four years of age. Stuttering can be characterized by sound, part word or whole word repetitions, sound prolongations, or blocking of sounds or airflow. Moments of stuttering can also be accompanied by non‐verbal behaviours, including visible tension in the speaker's face, eye blinks or head nods. Stuttering can also negatively affect behavioural, social and emotional functioning. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
To assess the immediate and long‐term effects of non‐pharmacological interventions for stuttering on speech outcomes, communication attitudes, quality of life and potential adverse effects in children aged six years and younger. 
Secondary objective 
To describe the relationship between intervention effects and participant characteristics (i.e. child age, IQ, severity, sex and time since stuttering onset) at pretest. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, nine other databases and two trial registers on 16 September 2020, and Open Grey on 20 October 2020. There were no limits in regards to language, year of publication or type of publication. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and requested data on unpublished trials from authors of published studies. We handsearched conference proceedings and programmes from relevant conferences. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that assessed non‐pharmacological interventions for stuttering in young children aged six years and younger. Eligible comparators were no intervention, wait list or management as usual. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We identified four eligible RCTs, all of which compared the Lidcombe Program to a wait‐list control group. In total, 151 children aged between two and six years participated in the four included studies. In the Lidcombe Program, the parent and their child visit a speech and language therapist (SLT) in a clinic. One study conducted clinic visits by telephone. In each clinic visit, parents were taught how to conduct treatment at home. Two studies took place in Australia, one in New Zealand and one in Germany. Two studies were conducted for nine months, one for 16 weeks and one for 12 weeks. The frequency of clinic visits and practice sessions at home varied within the programme. One study was partially funded by the Rotary Club, Wiesbaden, Germany; and one was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. One study did not report funding sources and another reported that they did not receive any funding for the trial.  
All four studies reported the outcome of stuttering frequency. One study also reported on speech efficiency, defined as articulation rate. No studies reported the other predetermined outcomes of this review, namely stuttering severity; communication attitudes; emotional, cognitive or psychosocial domains; or adverse effects.  
The Lidcombe Program resulted in a lower stuttering frequency percentage syllables stuttered (% SS) than a wait‐list control group at post‐test, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and nine months postrandomization (mean difference (MD) −2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) −3.48 to −0.84, 4 studies, 151 participants; P = 0.001; very low‐certainty evidence).  
However, as the Lidcombe Program is designed to take one to two years to complete, none of the participants in these studies had finished the complete intervention programme at any of the data collection points. 
We assessed stuttering frequency to have a high risk of overall bias due to high risk of bias in at least one domain within three of four included studies, and to have some concern of overall bias in the fourth, due to some concern in at least one domain. 
We found moderate‐certainty evidence from one study showing that the Lidcombe Program may increase speech efficiency in young children. 
Only one study reported outcomes at long‐term follow‐up. The long‐term effect of intervention could not be summarized, as the results for most of the children in the control group were missing. However, a within‐group comparison was performed between the mean % SS at randomization and the mean % SS at the time of extended follow‐up, and showed a significant reduction in frequency of stuttering.  
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review indicates that the Lidcombe Program may result in lower stuttering frequency and higher speech efficiency than a wait‐list control group in children aged up to six years at post‐test. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the very low and moderate certainty of the evidence and the high risk of bias identified in the included studies. Thus, there is a need for further studies from independent researchers, to evaluate the immediate and long‐term effects of other non‐pharmacological interventions for stuttering compared to no intervention or a wait‐list control group. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Treatments to Help Young Children Who Stutter

## Plain Title
Can speech therapy help young children who stutter speak more smoothly?

## Rationale

**What is stuttering?**
Stuttering is when a child has trouble speaking smoothly. It is quite common. About 1 in 9 children stutter by age four.

**What does stuttering look like?**
Children who stutter may:
- Repeat sounds, parts of words, or whole words
- Stretch out sounds too long
- Get stuck and cannot make sounds come out
- Blink their eyes a lot or nod their heads when trying to talk
- Show tension in their face when speaking

**Why is this a problem?**
Stuttering can make children feel bad about themselves. It can affect how they act around others. It can make it hard to make friends.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to know if speech therapy helps young children stutter less. They looked for studies that tested treatments without using medicine. They wanted to see if these treatments work right away and over time.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This was not a single study. Researchers looked at many studies done by other scientists. They searched for studies until September 2020. They found four studies that met their rules.

**Who was in these studies?**
All four studies tested the same treatment called the Lidcombe Program. In total, 151 children took part. The children were between two and six years old. All of them stuttered.

**Where did the studies happen?**
Two studies were done in Australia. One was done in New Zealand. One was done in Germany.

**How long did the studies last?**
- Two studies lasted nine months
- One study lasted 16 weeks (about four months)
- One study lasted 12 weeks (about three months)

**What is the Lidcombe Program?**
In this program, parents and their child visit a speech therapist at a clinic. One study did visits by phone instead. The therapist teaches parents how to help their child at home. Parents practice with their child between clinic visits. The full program normally takes one to two years to finish. None of the children in these studies finished the whole program.

**What did researchers compare?**
All four studies compared children getting the Lidcombe Program to children on a waiting list. Children on the waiting list got no treatment during the study.

## Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

All four studies measured how often children stuttered. The researchers counted how many times children stuttered out of 100 spoken parts of words (called syllables).

Children who did the Lidcombe Program stuttered less than children on the waiting list. This was true at all the times researchers checked (at 12 weeks, 16 weeks, and nine months).

One study also looked at how fast children could speak clearly. Children in the Lidcombe Program could speak faster and more clearly.

**Important things to know:**
- The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate
- The studies had some problems in how they were done
- Only one study checked on children after treatment ended
- Most children in that study's waiting list group dropped out, so researchers could not compare the groups
- However, children who got treatment still stuttered much less at follow-up than when they started

**What did the studies NOT measure?**
The studies did not look at:
- How severe the stuttering was
- How children felt about talking
- How stuttering affected children's feelings or social life
- Whether treatment caused any harm

**What do the results mean?**
The Lidcombe Program might help young children stutter less. It might help them speak faster and more clearly. But we need to be careful about these results. The studies had problems, and the evidence was not strong.

**What is needed next?**
More and better studies are needed. Different researchers should test the Lidcombe Program. Scientists should also test other treatments for stuttering. Studies should follow children for longer periods of time.",10.1002-14651858.CD013489,"Medicine‐free treatment for stuttering in children aged six years and younger
What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to find out if medicine‐free treatment for stuttering can improve speech fluency, children's communication attitudes and the impact on the child's quality of life, and potential harmful effects in children aged six years and younger, both in the short‐ and long‐term. We collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question and found four studies. 
Key messages 
The Lidcombe Program may result in lower stuttering frequency and higher speech efficiency (i.e. number of words or syllables spoken per minute) for young children after receiving the amount of treatment included in the studies. We do not yet know the impact of the programme delivered in its entirety, as no study reported outcomes for children who had completed the programme, which is designed to last for one to two years. 
Only one study reported how treatment worked in the long run, but the effect of treatment could not be summarized, as the results for most children in the control group were missing. 
We require more high‐quality studies assessing stuttering treatments for young children, including studies that report on a broader range of outcomes and that assess treatments other than the Lidcombe Program. 
What did the review study? 
Stuttering, or stammering as it is sometimes called, is a common communication disorder, that usually begins when children are between two and four years of age. Stuttering can be characterized by repetitions of individual speech sounds, parts of words or whole words; involuntary lengthening of speech sounds; or speech blockages. Moments of stuttering can also be accompanied by visible tension in the speaker's face or voice, eye blinks or head nods. Stuttering can have a negative effect on how people feel about themselves and how they live their lives. Therefore, it is important to identify effective treatments for stuttering in young children to reduce the chance that they will experience these negative effects. 
What were the main results of the review?  
We found four studies, all of which compared young children who received the Lidcombe Program to young children on a wait‐list. In three studies, the children on the wait‐list did not receive any treatment until after the study was finished. In the fourth, the children on the wait‐list could receive treatment from their local speech language therapist (SLT) if they wanted to. At the end of the study, parents of seven children (35%) in the control group reported their child had received some treatment, either the Lidcombe Program or another treatment programme called ""Easy Does It"", while on the wait‐list. 
There were 151 children aged between two and six years in the four studies. In the Lidcombe Program, an SLT conducted clinic visits with the child and parent in person in a clinic or spoke to them by telephone. During these visits, parents were taught to conduct treatment at home during 10‐ to 15‐minute daily practice sessions. Two studies were conducted in Australia, one in New Zealand and one in Germany. Two studies were conducted for nine months, one for 16 weeks and one for 12 weeks. One study was partially funded by the Rotary Club, Wiesbaden, Germany; and one was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. One study did not report any funding sources and another reported that they did not receive any funding for the trial. 
All four studies reported the effects of treatment on stuttering frequency. One study also reported on speech efficiency. We found no studies that looked at the effects of treatments for stuttering on stuttering severity; communication attitudes; emotional (how a child recognizes, expresses, and manages feelings), cognitive (how a child thinks, explores and works problems out) or psychosocial (how a child's individual needs link to the needs or demands of society) development; or side effects. 
The included studies suggest that the Lidcombe Program may reduce stuttering frequency in young children compared to a wait‐list control group (very low‐quality evidence). One study also reported that the Lidcombe Program may increase speech efficiency in young children compared to a wait‐list control group (moderate‐quality evidence). 
Only one study followed the children up to five years after treatment started, and at that time the results for most of the children in the control group were missing. Therefore, we do not know if the benefits of the treatment lasted over time. 
How up‐to‐date was this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to 16 September 2020. One additional database was searched on 20 October 2020.  
How reliable was the evidence generated by this review? 
The quality of the results related to stuttering frequency was very low and the results related to speech efficiency was moderate. This means that we are uncertain that the treatment effect would stay the same if we added more studies to the review. More studies comparing different treatments for stuttering to a wait‐list control group are needed to know the effect of treatment for stuttering with greater certainty.

Eczema is a common and chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder. It seriously impacts quality of life and economic outcomes, especially for those with moderate to severe eczema. Various treatments allow sustained control of the disease; however, their relative benefit remains unclear due to the limited number of trials directly comparing treatments. 
Objectives
To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of different types of systemic immunosuppressive treatments for moderate to severe eczema using NMA and to generate rankings of available systemic immunosuppressive treatments for eczema according to their efficacy and safety. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to August 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic immunosuppressive agents for moderate to severe atopic eczema when compared against placebo or any other eligible eczema treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We synthesised data using pair‐wise analysis and NMA to compare treatments and rank them according to their effectiveness. 
Effectiveness was assessed primarily by determining the proportion of participants who achieved at least 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) and improvement in the Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM). Safety was evaluated primarily by considering the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) and infection. 
We deemed short‐term follow‐up as ≤ 16 weeks and long‐term follow‐up as > 16 weeks.
We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for these primary outcomes using six domains of CiNEMA grading. 
Main results
We included a total of 74 studies, with 8177 randomised participants. Approximately 55% of participants were male, with average age of 32 years (range 2 to 84 years), although age and gender were unreported for 419 and 902 participants, respectively. Most of the included trials were placebo controlled (65%), 34% were head‐to‐head studies (15% assessed the effects of different doses of the same drug), and 1% were multi‐armed studies with both an active comparator and a placebo. 
All trials included participants with moderate to severe eczema, but 62% of studies did not separate data by severity; 38% of studies assessed only severe eczema. The total duration of included trials ranged from 2 weeks to 60 months, whereas treatment duration varied from a single dose (CIM331, KPL‐716) to 60 months (methotrexate (MTX)). 
Seventy studies were available for quantitative synthesis; this review assessed 29 immunosuppressive agents from three classes of interventions. These included (1) conventional treatments, with ciclosporin assessed most commonly; (2) small molecule treatments, including phosphodiesterase (PDE)‐4 inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors; and (3) biological treatments, including anti‐CD31 receptors, anti‐interleukin (IL)‐22, anti‐IL‐31, anti‐IL‐13, anti‐IL‐12/23p40, anti‐OX40, anti‐TSLP, anti‐CRTH2, and anti‐immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibodies, but most commonly dupilumab. 
Most trials (73) assessed outcomes at a short‐term duration ranging from 2 to 16 weeks, whereas 33 trials assessed long‐term outcomes, with duration ranging from 5 to 60 months. All participants were from a hospital setting. Fifty‐two studies declared a source of funding, and of these, pharmaceutical companies funded 88%. We rated 37 studies as high risk; 21, unclear risk, and 16, low risk of bias, with studies most commonly at high risk of attrition bias. 
Network meta‐analysis suggests that dupilumab ranks first for effectiveness when compared with other biological treatments. Dupilumab is more effective than placebo in achieving EASI75 (risk ratio (RR) 3.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.51 to 3.69) and improvement in POEM score (mean difference 7.30, 95% CI 6.61 to 8.00) at short‐term follow‐up (high‐certainty evidence). 
Very low‐certainty evidence means we are uncertain of the effects of dupilumab when compared with placebo, in terms of the proportion of participants who achieve EASI75 (RR 2.59, 95% CI 1.87 to 3.60) at longer‐term follow‐up. 
Low‐certainty evidence indicates that tralokinumab may be more effective than placebo in achieving short‐term EASI75 (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.21 to 5.34), but there was no evidence for tralokinumab to allow us to assess short‐term follow‐up of POEM or long‐term follow‐up of EASI75. 
We are uncertain of the effect of ustekinumab compared with placebo in achieving EASI75 (long‐term follow‐up: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.45; short‐term follow‐up: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.97; both very low certainty). We found no evidence on ustekinumab for the POEM outcome. 
We are uncertain whether other immunosuppressive agents that targeted our key outcomes influence the achievement of short‐term EASI75 compared with placebo due to low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence. 
Dupilumab and ustekinumab were the only immunosuppressive agents evaluated for longer‐term EASI75. Dupilumab was the only agent evaluated for improvement in POEM during short‐term follow‐up. 
Low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence indicates a lower proportion of participants with SAEs after treatment with QAW039 and dupilumab compared to placebo during short‐term follow‐up, but low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence suggests no difference in SAEs during short‐term follow‐up of other immunosuppressive agents compared to placebo. 
Evidence for effects of immunosuppressive agents on risk of any infection during short‐term follow‐up and SAEs during long‐term follow‐up compared with placebo was of low or very low certainty but did not indicate a difference. 
We did not identify differences in other adverse events (AEs), but dupilumab is associated with specific AEs, including eye inflammation and eosinophilia. 
Authors' conclusions
Our findings indicate that dupilumab is the most effective biological treatment for eczema. Compared to placebo, dupilumab reduces eczema signs and symptoms in the short term for people with moderate to severe atopic eczema. Short‐term safety outcomes from clinical trials did not reveal new safety concerns with dupilumab. Overall, evidence for the efficacy of most other immunosuppressive treatments for moderate to severe atopic eczema is of low or very low certainty. 
Given the lack of data comparing conventional with newer biological treatments for the primary outcomes, there remains high uncertainty for ranking the efficacy and safety of conventional treatments such as ciclosporin and biological treatments such as dupilumab. 
Most studies were placebo‐controlled and assessed only short‐term efficacy of immunosuppressive agents. Further adequately powered head‐to‐head RCTs should evaluate comparative long‐term efficacy and safety of available treatments for moderate to severe eczema.

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Body-Wide Treatments for People with Moderate to Severe Eczema

## Rationale

**What is eczema?**
Eczema is a common skin problem that lasts a long time. It comes and goes throughout a person's life. The skin becomes red, itchy, and inflamed. This can make daily life very hard for people who have it.

**Why is this a problem?**
People with moderate to severe eczema often struggle with their daily activities. The constant itching and skin problems affect their quality of life. It also costs a lot of money to manage. Many treatments exist to help control eczema, but doctors are not sure which ones work best.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors have many treatment options for eczema. However, few studies have directly compared these treatments to each other. This makes it hard to know which treatment works best and is safest. Patients and doctors need clear information to make good choices.

**What did researchers want to find out?**
Researchers wanted to compare all the different body-wide treatments for eczema. They wanted to rank these treatments from best to worst. This would help doctors choose the right treatment for their patients.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at 74 different studies that had already been done. They combined the results from all these studies. This method is called a network meta-analysis.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included 8,177 people total. About 55 out of 100 were male. The average age was 32 years old. The youngest person was 2 years old. The oldest was 84 years old. All people in the studies had moderate to severe eczema.

**What treatments were tested?**
Researchers looked at 29 different treatments. These fell into three main groups:
- Older standard treatments like ciclosporin
- Newer pill treatments that block certain body chemicals
- Biological treatments given by injection or IV

The most commonly studied biological treatment was dupilumab.

**How long did the studies last?**
Most studies lasted 2 to 16 weeks. This is called short-term. Some studies lasted longer, from 5 months to 5 years. This is called long-term. All studies took place in hospitals.

## Results

**What did the researchers measure?**
Researchers looked at two main things:
- How much the eczema improved
- What side effects happened

They measured improvement by looking at skin clearing and patient reports of symptoms.

**What were the main findings?**

For short-term treatment (16 weeks or less):
- Dupilumab worked best among biological treatments
- People taking dupilumab were 3 times more likely to see major skin improvement than people taking a fake treatment
- People taking dupilumab also reported much better symptom relief
- Researchers are very confident in these results

For long-term treatment (more than 16 weeks):
- Researchers are less certain about the results
- There was not enough information to be sure about long-term effects

**What about safety?**
- Dupilumab and another drug called QAW039 seemed safer than fake treatment in the short term
- Dupilumab can cause eye inflammation and high levels of certain white blood cells
- For most other treatments, researchers could not be sure about safety

**What about other treatments?**
- Researchers found some evidence that tralokinumab might help
- For most other treatments, the evidence was too weak to draw conclusions
- Very few studies compared the older standard treatments directly with newer biological treatments

**What do these results mean?**
Dupilumab is the most effective biological treatment for moderate to severe eczema in the short term. It helps clear skin and reduces symptoms. Short-term safety looks acceptable based on clinical trials.

However, researchers still do not know enough about:
- How dupilumab compares to older standard treatments
- Long-term effects of most treatments
- Which treatment is best for each individual person

**What is needed next?**
More studies are needed that:
- Directly compare different treatments to each other
- Follow patients for longer periods of time
- Include enough people to give clear answers

This will help doctors and patients make better treatment choices in the future.",10.1002-14651858.CD013206,"Which oral or injected medicines work best to treat moderate to severe eczema?
Why this question is important 
Eczema is a persistent condition that causes dry, cracked, and itchy skin. People with mild eczema have small patches of dry skin, and people with moderate eczema have larger, redder, or swollen areas of skin. People with severe eczema have red crusts and broken skin (which may ooze fluid) that develop all over the body. 
Although there is currently no cure for eczema, treatments that aim to relieve symptoms are available. Usually, the first treatment option is to apply creams, ointments, or liquids to the affected skin. If this does not work, it is possible to take oral or injected (systemic) medicines that work throughout the body. 
Many systemic medicines are available for eczema. To help people decide which one is most appropriate for managing their symptoms, we reviewed the evidence on benefits and risks of different systemic medicines for people with moderate or severe eczema. We particularly wanted to find out: 
• whether some medicines were more likely than others to have an important positive effect on symptoms (defined as either at least a 75% improvement on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), or improvement on the Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)—two scales that are used by clinicians to evaluate changes in eczema symptoms); and 
• whether some medicines are associated with more serious unwanted events, including infection, than others. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (studies where people are randomly divided into different treatment groups) because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared study results and summarised the evidence from all studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, the size of studies, and the consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate, or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found 74 studies that involved a total of 8177 people with moderate to severe eczema. Studies lasted between 2 weeks and 60 months. Treatments received varied from a single, one‐off dose to weekly doses for 60 months. These studies evaluated 29 different medicines by comparing them to a placebo (fake treatment) or to another medicine, or by comparing different doses of the same medicine. The medicine that was studied most frequently was dupilumab (12 studies), a laboratory‐made version of a protein, which blocks parts of the immune system involved in causing eczema. 
Dupilumab versus placebo 
High‐certainty evidence shows that, compared to a placebo or other laboratory‐made proteins, dupilumab improves the symptoms of people with moderate to severe eczema in the short term (within 16 weeks of treatment). It is unclear whether this improvement is sustained after 16 weeks because no studies have looked at changes in POEM scores beyond that time, and because the evidence from studies that measured EASI scores was of very low certainty. Dupilumab may be associated with fewer serious unwanted events than placebo (low‐certainty evidence). 
Other systemic medicines versus placebo 
Evidence on the benefits and risks of other systemic medicines compared to placebo is limited because no studies have measured their effects on symptom improvement or serious unwanted effects, or because the certainty of the evidence is low or very low. 
Comparing different systemic medicines with one another 
Reviewers found too few studies that compared different systemic medicines against one another to determine which worked best for people with moderate to severe eczema. 
What this means 
Evidence shows that, compared to placebo, dupilumab improves the symptoms of people with moderate to severe eczema within 16 weeks of treatment and may be associated with fewer serious unwanted events. 
Reviewers found too few robust studies to conclude whether dupilumab improves symptoms beyond 16 weeks, or whether this medicine works better than older systemic medicines. Future studies need to compare different systemic treatments beyond 16 weeks in people with moderate to severe eczema.

The problem 
There is increasing evidence that people who have undergone brain surgery experience significant pain. This pain can have serious consequences including raised blood pressure, agitation, prolonged recovery time and an increased risk of long‐term headaches. Research studies have looked at different drugs in an attempt to reduce the risk of pain for these people. There is now more evidence about pain reduction options for adults undergoing brain surgery but there remains uncertainty as to which options work best. 
The question 
This review aimed to determine which drugs provide the best chance of reducing pain for adults undergoing brain surgery, by collecting and combining the results of studies that looked at pain‐relieving drugs for this patient group. To provide an accurate answer to this question, only studies conducted in accordance with an approved high standard were included. Studies published in different languages and countries were included in order to obtain as much information as possible. 
In addition to determining which drugs were best at preventing or reducing pain after brain surgery, this review attempted to determine additional information such as how much additional pain‐relieving treatment was required in addition to the treatment under study; whether participants' pain was adequately controlled or not; how drowsy the participants were; what side effects they experienced; and how long they needed to stay in intensive care and in hospital. This review also considered whether some treatments worked better when given before or after surgery or for people undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. 
The results 
A total of 43 eligible studies, (42 complete and one still in progress), were found. Of the 42 completed studies (3548 participants), 10 studied injections of local anaesthetic into the scalp, 12 studied injection of local anaesthetic around specific scalp nerves, 8 studied nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 4 studied dexmedetomidine, 4 studied acetaminophen aka paracetamol), 2 studied opioid drugs, 3 studied gabapentin or pregabalin (anti‐seizure drugs that can also be used for pain relief) together with 1 study each of local anaesthetic injected into the veins, local anaesthetic injected into the jaw and the drug flupirtine. 
Sufficient information was abstracted to calculate the overall pain‐preventing effects of the following: local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound, local anaesthetic injections around specific scalp nerves, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, dexmedetomidine and pregabalin or gabapentin. When only high‐quality studies were examined: NSAIDs reduced pain up to 24 hours after surgery, dexmedetomidine and local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves reduced pain in the first 12 hours after surgery, pregabalin or gabapentin reduced pain in the first 6 hours after surgery and local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound significantly reduced pain 48 hours after surgery, but did not affect pain at earlier time points. 
When the timing of injection of local anaesthetics was examined, local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves provided better early pain relief (first 6 hours) when injected after surgery and better late pain relief (12 and 24 hours) when injected before surgery. 
The following interventions were also found to reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs: local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and dexmedetomidine. Gabapentin or pregabalin was found to reduce the risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery. 
Acetaminophen was not found to prevent pain after brain surgery or reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs. 
Insufficient evidence was found to determine whether any of these drugs made the participants more or less drowsy, affected how long they needed to stay in intensive care or whether different drugs worked better for adults undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. 
The overall quality of the evidence that contributed to the results of this review was assessed and judged to be 'high' for pain‐reducing effects of NSAIDs, 'moderate' to 'low' for pain‐reducing effects of dexmedetomidine, acetaminophen, pregabalin and gabapentin and local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and ' low' to ' very low' for pain‐reducing effects of local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound, additional pain relief requirements and risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery .

Which Pain Medicines Work Best for Adults After Brain Surgery?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Many people feel a lot of pain after brain surgery. This pain is not just uncomfortable. It can cause other serious problems. High blood pressure can develop. People may become upset or confused. They may take longer to get better. They may also get headaches that last a long time.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors have tried many different drugs to reduce pain after brain surgery. Some drugs seem to help. But doctors are not sure which ones work best. This study brought together results from many smaller studies. The goal was to find out which pain drugs work best for adults after brain surgery.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know which drugs best prevent or reduce pain. They also wanted to learn other important things. Did patients need extra pain medicine? Did the drugs make people too sleepy? What side effects happened? How long did people stay in intensive care? How long did they stay in the hospital? They also checked if some drugs worked better when given before surgery or after surgery.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review study. Researchers looked for all high-quality studies about pain relief after brain surgery. They included studies from different countries. They included studies in different languages. This helped them find as much information as possible.

### Who was studied?
The review included 43 studies. Of these, 42 studies were complete. One study was still ongoing. The 42 complete studies included 3,548 adults. All had brain surgery.

### What treatments were studied?
Researchers looked at many different pain treatments:
- Shots of numbing medicine into the scalp (10 studies)
- Shots of numbing medicine around specific scalp nerves (12 studies)
- Anti-inflammatory drugs called NSAIDs (8 studies)
- A drug called dexmedetomidine (4 studies)
- Acetaminophen, also called paracetamol (4 studies)
- Opioid pain drugs (2 studies)
- Seizure drugs that also help pain, called gabapentin or pregabalin (3 studies)
- Other numbing medicine treatments (3 studies)

## Results

### What did the study find?

#### Which drugs reduced pain?
Several drugs helped reduce pain after brain surgery:

**NSAIDs** worked well. They reduced pain for up to 24 hours after surgery.

**Dexmedetomidine** helped in the first 12 hours after surgery.

**Numbing medicine shots around scalp nerves** also helped in the first 12 hours. When given after surgery, they worked better in the first 6 hours. When given before surgery, they worked better at 12 and 24 hours.

**Pregabalin or gabapentin** reduced pain in the first 6 hours after surgery.

**Numbing medicine shots around the surgical wound** reduced pain at 48 hours after surgery. But they did not help at earlier times.

#### Which drugs did NOT work well?
**Acetaminophen** did not prevent pain after brain surgery. It also did not reduce the need for extra pain medicine.

#### What other benefits were found?
Some drugs reduced the need for extra pain medicine. These included numbing shots around scalp nerves and dexmedetomidine.

Gabapentin or pregabalin helped reduce nausea and vomiting after surgery.

#### What could not be determined?
Researchers could not find enough information about some questions. They could not tell if these drugs made people too sleepy. They could not tell if the drugs changed how long people stayed in intensive care or in the hospital.

### How reliable are these results?
The quality of evidence varied. Evidence for NSAIDs was high quality. Evidence for other drugs ranged from moderate to very low quality. More research may be needed to confirm some findings.

### What does this mean for patients?
Several pain medicines can help reduce pain after brain surgery. NSAIDs appear to work best overall. Other drugs like dexmedetomidine and numbing medicine shots also help. Doctors can use this information to choose the best pain treatment for each patient.",10.1002-14651858.CD011931,"Preventing pain after brain surgery

Review question 
The main question addressed by this review is how effective are different treatments and what are the best timings for these treatments following accidental damage during surgery to the nerves that supply sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin. 
Background 
The nerves (alveolar and lingual) supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin, may be injured as a result of surgical treatments to the mouth and face, including surgery to remove lower wisdom teeth. The vast majority (90%) of these injuries are temporary and get better within eight weeks. However if they last for longer than six months they are considered to be permanent. Damage to these nerves can lead to altered sensation in the region of the lower lip and chin, or tongue or both. Furthermore, damage to the nerve supplying the tongue may lead to altered taste perception. These injuries can affect people's quality of life leading to emotional problems, problems with socialising and disabilities. Accidental injury after surgery can also give rise to legal action. 
There are many interventions or treatments available, surgical and non‐surgical, that may enhance recovery, including improving sensation. They can be grouped as. 
1. Surgical – a variety of procedures. 2. Laser treatment – low‐level laser treatment has been used to treat partial loss of sensation. 3. Medical – treatment with drugs including antiepileptics, antidepressants and painkillers. 4. Counselling – including cognitive behavioural and relaxation therapy, changing behaviour and hypnosis. 
Study characteristics 
The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review, and the evidence is current as of 9 October 2013. There are two studies included, both published in 1996, which compared low‐level laser treatment to placebo or fake treatment for partial loss of sensation following surgery to the lower jaw. There were 15 participants in one study and 16 in the other, their ages ranging from 17 to 55 years. All had suffered accidental damage to nerves of the lower jaw and tongue causing some loss of sensation following surgery. 
Key results 
Low‐level laser therapy was the only treatment to be evaluated in the included studies and this was compared to fake or placebo laser therapy. No studies were found that evaluated other surgical, medical or counselling treatments. 
There was some evidence of an improvement when participants reported whether or not sensation was better in the lip and chin areas with low‐level laser therapy. This is based on the results of a single, small study, so the results should be interpreted with caution. 
No studies reported on the effects of the treatment on other outcomes such as pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste. No studies reported on quality of life or harm. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence is very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the two included studies and the low number of participants, and evidence from participants with only partial sensory loss.

## Plain Title
Testing Treatments for Nerve Damage in the Mouth After Surgery

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some nerves in the lower part of the mouth give feeling to the tongue, lower lip, and chin. These nerves can get hurt during mouth surgery. This includes surgery to take out wisdom teeth.

**What happens when these nerves are damaged?**

Most people (9 out of 10) get better within eight weeks. But some people do not get better. If the problem lasts more than six months, it may be permanent. This means it may never go away.

When these nerves are hurt, people may lose feeling in their lower lip, chin, or tongue. They may also have trouble tasting food. This can make life hard. People may feel upset or sad. They may have trouble eating or talking. They may not want to spend time with others.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors have many ways to try to help these nerve problems. These include surgery, laser treatment, medicines, and counseling. But researchers needed to find out which treatments work best. They also wanted to know when to start treatment to help people the most.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies that tested treatments for nerve damage in the mouth after surgery. They searched for studies up to October 2013.

They found two studies from 1996. Both studies tested one type of treatment called low-level laser therapy. This uses a special light to try to help nerves heal.

**Who was in the studies?**

The two studies had 31 people total. One study had 15 people. The other had 16 people. The people were between 17 and 55 years old. All of them had some nerve damage in their lower jaw or tongue after surgery. They had lost some feeling in these areas.

**What did the studies compare?**

Both studies compared real laser treatment to fake laser treatment. The fake treatment looked the same but did not use real laser light. This helped researchers see if the laser really worked.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies did not clearly report how long people stayed in them.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The studies only tested low-level laser therapy. No studies tested other treatments like surgery, medicines, or counseling.

One small study showed some good results. People who got real laser treatment said their feeling got better in their lip and chin areas. They reported this improvement themselves.

But these results come from only one very small study. This means we cannot be sure the treatment really works.

**What was not reported?**

The studies did not report on many important things:
- Whether treatment helped with pain
- Whether people could eat better
- Whether people could speak better
- Whether taste got better
- Whether quality of life improved
- Whether the treatment caused any harm

**What do the results mean?**

There is very little good information about treatments for nerve damage in the mouth after surgery. The evidence quality is very low. This is because:
- Only two very small studies were found
- The studies only included people with partial loss of feeling
- The studies had problems with how they were done
- The studies did not report many important results

**What are the conclusions?**

More and better research is needed. Doctors need more information to know which treatments work best for nerve damage in the mouth after surgery. They also need to know when to start treatment and whether treatments are safe.

People with this problem should talk to their doctor about treatment options. But right now, there is not enough evidence to say which treatment is best.",10.1002-14651858.CD005293,"Treatments for accidental damage during surgery to the nerves supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin

143,10.1002-14651858.CD013193-abstract.txt,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are high‐risk skin cancers which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early curable cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Teledermatology provides a way for generalist clinicians to access the opinion of a specialist dermatologist for skin lesions that they consider to be suspicious without referring the patients through the normal referral pathway. Teledermatology consultations can be 'store‐and‐forward' with electronic digital images of a lesion sent to a dermatologist for review at a later time, or can be live and interactive consultations using videoconferencing to connect the patient, referrer and dermatologist in real time. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of teledermatology for the detection of any skin cancer (melanoma, BCC or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)) in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of in‐person diagnosis. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CPCI, Zetoc, Science Citation Index, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies evaluating skin cancer diagnosis for teledermatology alone, or in comparison with face‐to‐face diagnosis by a specialist clinician, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up and expert opinion. We also included studies evaluating the referral accuracy of teledermatology compared with a reference standard of face‐to‐face diagnosis by a specialist clinician. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where there were information related to the target condition of any skin cancer missing. Data permitting, we estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. Due to the scarcity of data, we undertook no covariate investigations for this review. For illustrative purposes, we plotted estimates of sensitivity and specificity on coupled forest plots for diagnostic threshold and target condition under consideration. 
Main results
The review included 22 studies reporting diagnostic accuracy data for 4057 lesions and 879 malignant cases (16 studies) and referral accuracy data for reported data for 1449 lesions and 270 'positive' cases as determined by the reference standard face‐to‐face decision (six studies). Methodological quality was variable with poor reporting hindering assessment. The overall risk of bias was high or unclear for participant selection, reference standard, and participant flow and timing in at least half of all studies; the majority were at low risk of bias for the index test. The applicability of study findings were of high or unclear concern for most studies in all domains assessed due to the recruitment of participants from secondary care settings or specialist clinics rather than from primary or community‐based settings in which teledermatology is more likely to be used and due to the acquisition of lesion images by dermatologists or in specialist imaging units rather than by primary care clinicians. 
Seven studies provided data for the primary target condition of any skin cancer (1588 lesions and 638 malignancies). For the correct diagnosis of lesions as malignant using photographic images, summary sensitivity was 94.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 90.1% to 97.4%) and summary specificity was 84.3% (95% CI 48.5% to 96.8%) (from four studies). Individual study estimates using dermoscopic images or a combination of photographic and dermoscopic images generally suggested similarly high sensitivities with highly variable specificities. Limited comparative data suggested similar diagnostic accuracy between teledermatology assessment and in‐person diagnosis by a dermatologist; however, data were too scarce to draw firm conclusions. For the detection of invasive melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants both sensitivities and specificities were more variable. Sensitivities ranged from 59% (95% CI 42% to 74%) to 100% (95% CI 48% to 100%) and specificities from 30% (95% CI 22% to 40%) to 100% (95% CI 93% to 100%), with reported diagnostic thresholds including the correct diagnosis of melanoma, classification of lesions as 'atypical' or 'typical, and the decision to refer or to excise a lesion. 
Referral accuracy data comparing teledermatology against a face‐to‐face reference standard suggested good agreement for lesions considered to require some positive action by face‐to‐face assessment (sensitivities of over 90%). For lesions considered of less concern when assessed face‐to‐face (e.g. for lesions not recommended for excision or referral), agreement was more variable with teledermatology specificities ranging from 57% (95% CI 39% to 73%) to 100% (95% CI 86% to 100%), suggesting that remote assessment is more likely recommend excision, referral or follow‐up compared to in‐person decisions. 
Authors' conclusions
Studies were generally small and heterogeneous and methodological quality was difficult to judge due to poor reporting. Bearing in mind concerns regarding the applicability of study participants and of lesion image acquisition in specialist settings, our results suggest that teledermatology can correctly identify the majority of malignant lesions. Using a more widely defined threshold to identify 'possibly' malignant cases or lesions that should be considered for excision is likely to appropriately triage those lesions requiring face‐to‐face assessment by a specialist. Despite the increasing use of teledermatology on an international level, the evidence base to support its ability to accurately diagnose lesions and to triage lesions from primary to secondary care is lacking and further prospective and pragmatic evaluation is needed. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Remote Skin Checks for Detecting Skin Cancer

## Plain Title

Can doctors diagnose skin cancer by looking at photos sent from other clinics?

## Rationale

**What is skin cancer and why does it matter?**

Skin cancer comes in three main types. Two types—melanoma and squamous cell cancer—are high risk. They can spread to other parts of the body and may cause death. The third type—basal cell cancer—usually stays in one place but can damage nearby skin.

Finding skin cancer early is very important. Early treatment works better and can save lives. But doctors also need to avoid removing harmless skin spots that are not cancer.

**What is the problem this study looked at?**

When family doctors see a worrying skin spot, they usually send the patient to a skin specialist. This takes time. The patient must wait for an appointment and travel to see the specialist.

**What is teledermatology?**

Teledermatology means getting expert advice without the patient traveling. The family doctor takes photos of the skin spot and sends them to a skin specialist. The specialist looks at the photos and gives advice. This can happen in two ways:
- Store-and-forward: Photos are sent and the specialist reviews them later
- Live video: The doctor, patient, and specialist talk together using video

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to know if skin specialists can correctly identify skin cancer by looking at photos. They also wanted to compare photo diagnosis with in-person visits.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked at 22 earlier studies. These studies tested how well teledermatology works.

The studies included:
- 4,057 skin spots in total
- 879 spots that were actually cancer
- Adults with skin spots that might be cancer

**How did the studies work?**

Doctors took photos of skin spots. Skin specialists looked at the photos and decided if each spot was cancer. Then researchers checked if the specialists were right. They checked by:
- Testing removed skin spots in a lab
- Having patients visit a specialist in person
- Watching spots over time

Some studies used regular photos. Others used special close-up photos called dermoscopic images.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

When specialists looked at regular photos of skin spots:
- They correctly identified 95 out of 100 cancers
- They correctly identified 84 out of 100 harmless spots as not cancer

This means teledermatology found most cancers. However, it sometimes labeled harmless spots as possibly cancer.

**How did photo diagnosis compare to in-person visits?**

A few studies compared the two methods. Results suggested they work about the same. But there were not enough studies to be certain.

**What about deciding who needs to see a specialist?**

Some studies looked at whether teledermatology could decide which patients need specialist care. Results showed:
- When a spot truly needed specialist care, teledermatology agreed more than 90 times out of 100
- When a spot did not need specialist care, teledermatology sometimes still recommended seeing a specialist

This means teledermatology is cautious. It may send more patients to specialists than needed.

**What problems did researchers find with the studies?**

Many studies had issues:
- Studies were small
- Studies were done in specialist clinics, not regular doctor offices
- Specialists took the photos, not family doctors
- Studies did not always explain their methods clearly

**What do the results mean?**

Teledermatology can find most skin cancers. It works well for deciding which patients should see a specialist in person. It is better at catching cancer than at ruling out harmless spots.

**What is still needed?**

More studies are needed that:
- Test teledermatology in regular doctor offices
- Have family doctors take the photos
- Include more patients
- Follow clear methods

Despite wide use of teledermatology around the world, we need better proof that it works well in everyday medical care.",10.1002-14651858.CD013193,"What is the diagnostic accuracy of teledermatology for the diagnosis of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are different types of skin cancer. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms and it is important to identify it early so that it can be removed. If it is not recognised when first brought to the attention of doctors (also known as a false‐negative test result) treatment can be delayed resulting in the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body and possibly causing early death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are usually localised skin cancers, although cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Calling something a skin cancer when it is not really a skin cancer (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations that can cause stress and worry to the patient. Making the correct diagnosis is important. Mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether teledermatology is accurate enough to identify which people with skin lesions need to be referred to see a specialist dermatologist (a doctor concerned with disease of the skin) and who can be safely reassured that their lesion (damage or change of the skin) is not malignant. We included 22 studies to answer this question. 
What was studied in the review? 
Teledermatology means sending pictures of skin lesions or rashes to a specialist for advice on diagnosis or management. It is a way for primary care doctors (general practitioners (GPs)) to get an opinion from a specialist dermatologist without having to refer patients through the normal referral pathway. Teledermatology can involve sending photographs or magnified images of a skin lesion taken with a special camera (dermatoscope) to a skin specialist to look at or it might involve immediate discussion about a skin lesion between a GP and a skin specialist using videoconferencing. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included 22 studies, 16 studies comparing teledermatology diagnoses to the final lesion diagnoses (diagnostic accuracy) for 4057 lesions and 879 malignant cases and five studies comparing teledermatology decisions to the decisions that would be made with the patient present (referral accuracy) for 1449 lesions and 270 'positive' cases. 
The studies were very different from each other in terms of the types of people with suspicious skin cancer lesions included and the type of teledermatology used. A single reliable estimate of the accuracy of teledermatology could not be made. For the correct diagnosis of a lesion to be a skin cancer, data suggested that less than 7% of malignant skin lesions were missed by teledermatology. Study results were too variable to tell us how many people would be referred unnecessarily for a specialist dermatology appointment following a teledermatology consultation. Without access to teledermatology services however, most of the lesions included in these studies would likely be referred to a dermatologist. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
In the included studies, the final diagnosis of skin cancer was made by lesion biopsy (taking a small sample of the lesion so it could be examined under a microscope) and the absence of skin cancer was confirmed by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer. In a few studies, a diagnosis of no skin cancer was made by a skin specialist rather than biopsy. This is less likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer*. Poor reporting of what was done in the study made it difficult for us to say how reliable the study results are. Selecting some patients from specialist clinics instead of primary care along with different ways of doing teledermatology were common problems. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in: Europe (64%), North America (18%), South America (9%) or Oceania (9%). The average age of people who were studied was 52 years; however, several studies included at least some people under the age of 16 years. The percentage of people with skin cancer ranged between 2% and 88% with an average of 30%, which is much higher than would be observed in a primary care setting in the UK. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Teledermatology is likely to be a good way of helping GPs to decide which skin lesions need to be seen by a skin specialist. Our review suggests that using magnified images, in addition to photographs of the lesion, improves accuracy. More research is needed to establish the best way of providing teledermatology services. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow‐up or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference comparisons.

The global burden of poor maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) accounts for more than a quarter of healthy years of life lost worldwide. Targeted client communication (TCC) via mobile devices (MD) (TCCMD) may be a useful strategy to improve MNCH. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of TCC via MD on health behaviour, service use, health, and well‐being for MNCH. 
Search methods
In July/August 2017, we searched five databases including The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched two trial registries. A search update was carried out in July 2019 and potentially relevant studies are awaiting classification. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that assessed TCC via MD to improve MNCH behaviour, service use, health, and well‐being. Eligible comparators were usual care/no intervention, non‐digital TCC, and digital non‐targeted client communication. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane, although data extraction and risk of bias assessments were carried out by one person only and cross‐checked by a second. 
Main results
We included 27 trials (17,463 participants). Trial populations were: pregnant and postpartum women (11 trials conducted in low‐, middle‐ or high‐income countries (LMHIC); pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV (three trials carried out in one lower middle‐income country); and parents of children under the age of five years (13 trials conducted in LMHIC). Most interventions (18) were delivered via text messages alone, one was delivered through voice calls only, and the rest were delivered through combinations of different communication channels, such as multimedia messages and voice calls. 
Pregnant and postpartum women 
TCCMD versus standard care 
For behaviours, TCCMD may increase exclusive breastfeeding in settings where rates of exclusive breastfeeding are less common (risk ratio (RR) 1.30, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.06 to 1.59; low‐certainty evidence), but have little or no effect in settings where almost all women breastfeed (low‐certainty evidence). For use of health services, TCCMD may increase antenatal appointment attendance (odds ratio (OR) 1.54, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.96; low‐certainty evidence); however, the CI encompasses both benefit and harm. The intervention may increase skilled attendants at birth in settings where a lack of skilled attendants at birth is common (though this differed by urban/rural residence), but may make no difference in settings where almost all women already have a skilled attendant at birth (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.94; low‐certainty evidence). There were uncertain effects on maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity because the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low. 
TCCMD versus non‐digital TCC (e.g. pamphlets) 
TCCMD may have little or no effect on exclusive breastfeeding (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.07; low‐certainty evidence). TCCMD may reduce 'any maternal health problem' (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.79) and 'any newborn health problem' (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.06) reported up to 10 days postpartum (low‐certainty evidence), though the CI for the latter includes benefit and harm. The effect on health service use is unknown due to a lack of studies. 
TCCMD versus digital non‐targeted communication 
No studies reported behavioural, health, or well‐being outcomes for this comparison. For use of health services, there are uncertain effects for the presence of a skilled attendant at birth due to very low‐certainty evidence, and the intervention may make little or no difference to attendance for antenatal influenza vaccination (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.58), though the CI encompasses both benefit and harm (low‐certainty evidence). 
Pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV 
TCCMD versus standard care 
For behaviours, TCCMD may make little or no difference to maternal and infant adherence to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (low‐certainty evidence). For health service use, TCC mobile telephone reminders may increase use of antenatal care slightly (mean difference (MD) 1.5, 95% CI –0.36 to 3.36; low‐certainty evidence). The effect on the proportion of births occurring in a health facility is uncertain due to very low‐certainty evidence. For health and well‐being outcomes, there was an uncertain intervention effect on neonatal death or stillbirth, and infant HIV due to very low‐certainty evidence. No studies reported on maternal mortality or morbidity. 
TCCMD versus non‐digital TCC 
The effect is unknown due to lack of studies reporting this comparison.
TCCMD versus digital non‐targeted communication 
TCCMD may increase infant ARV/prevention of mother‐to‐child transmission treatment adherence (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.48; low‐certainty evidence). The effect on other outcomes is unknown due to lack of studies. 
Parents of children aged less than five years 
No studies reported on correct treatment, nutritional, or health outcomes.
TCCMD versus standard care 
Based on 10 trials, TCCMD may modestly increase health service use (vaccinations and HIV care) (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.34; low‐certainty evidence); however, the effect estimates varied widely between studies. 
TCCMD versus non‐digital TCC 
TCCMD may increase attendance for vaccinations (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.28; low‐certainty evidence), and may make little or no difference to oral hygiene practices (low‐certainty evidence). 
TCCMD versus digital non‐targeted communication 
TCCMD may reduce attendance for vaccinations, but the CI encompasses both benefit and harm (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.20; low‐certainty evidence). 
No trials in any population reported data on unintended consequences.
Authors' conclusions
The effect of TCCMD for most outcomes is uncertain. There may be improvements for some outcomes using targeted communication but these findings were of low certainty. High‐quality, adequately powered trials and cost‐effectiveness analyses are required to reliably ascertain the effects and relative benefits of TCCMD. Future studies should measure potential unintended consequences, such as partner violence or breaches of confidentiality. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using Mobile Phones to Send Health Messages to Mothers and Parents

## Plain Title

Can targeted health messages sent by mobile phone help mothers and young children stay healthy?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Every year, many mothers and young children around the world get sick or die from health problems that could be prevented. In fact, more than 1 out of 4 healthy years of life lost worldwide are due to poor health in mothers, newborns, and children. This is a major burden for families and communities.

**Why was this study needed?**

Many women do not get the health care they need during pregnancy and after birth. Many children miss important vaccines or treatments. One reason is that parents may not know when to seek care or what healthy behaviors to follow.

Mobile phones are now common in many parts of the world. Researchers wanted to know if sending targeted health messages through mobile phones could help. These messages could remind mothers about appointments, teach them about breastfeeding, or tell them when their child needs vaccines.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to see if sending personalized health messages by mobile phone would help mothers and parents:
- Follow healthy behaviors (like breastfeeding)
- Use health services more (like going to doctor visits)
- Improve health outcomes for mothers and children

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of many different studies. Researchers looked at 27 studies that included 17,463 people total. They searched medical databases in 2017 and updated their search in 2019.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included three groups of people:
- Pregnant women and new mothers (11 studies)
- Pregnant women and new mothers living with HIV (3 studies)
- Parents of children under 5 years old (13 studies)

These studies took place in low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries around the world.

**What did the studies test?**

Most studies (18 out of 27) sent text messages to participants. One study used voice calls only. The rest used a mix of methods like text messages, voice calls, and multimedia messages.

Researchers compared these mobile phone messages to:
- Standard care (no special messages)
- Non-digital messages (like pamphlets or brochures)
- General digital messages (not personalized)

**How long did studies last?**

The length of time varied across different studies. Some followed women through pregnancy and after birth. Others followed children for months or years.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The results were mixed and often uncertain. Here are the key findings:

**For pregnant women and new mothers:**
- Mobile messages may help more women breastfeed only breast milk in places where this is less common.
- Mobile messages may help more women attend pregnancy check-ups, but results were unclear.
- Mobile messages may help more women have a trained health worker at birth in some settings.
- Effects on mother and baby deaths were unclear.
- When compared to pamphlets, mobile messages may reduce some health problems for mothers and newborns.

**For pregnant women living with HIV:**
- Mobile messages may make little difference in whether mothers and babies take their HIV medicines.
- Mobile messages may slightly increase pregnancy care visits.
- Effects on baby deaths and HIV infection in babies were unclear.

**For parents of young children:**
- Mobile messages may modestly increase vaccine visits and HIV care visits.
- Results varied widely between different studies.

**Important limitations:**
- Most results had low certainty, meaning we cannot be sure of the true effects.
- No studies looked at harmful side effects, like partner violence or privacy breaches.
- More high-quality research is needed.

**What do the results mean?**

Mobile phone messages might help improve some health behaviors and increase use of health services. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. Better studies are needed to know if this approach truly works and is worth the cost.",10.1002-14651858.CD013679,"Communicating to pregnant woman and parents through their mobile devices to improve maternal, neonatal, and child health 
Aim of this review 
We assessed the effect of sending targeted messages by mobile devices to pregnant women and parents of young children about health and healthcare services. 
Key messages 
There are gaps in the evidence regarding the effects of targeted messages by mobile devices to pregnant women and parents of young children about health and healthcare services. Some of these messages may improve some people's health and their use of health services, but others may make little or no difference. The existing evidence is mostly of low or very low certainty. 
What was studied in the review? 
Targeted client communication (TCC) is an intervention in which the health system sends information to particular people, based on their health status or other factors specific to that population group. Common types of TCC are text messages reminding people to attend appointments or that offer healthcare information and support. Our review assessed whether TCC can change pregnant women's and parents' behaviour, health service use, health, and well‐being. 
What happens when pregnant women receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to women who get no messages 
Women may breastfeed more in settings where exclusive breastfeeding is not common. They may also go to more antenatal care appointments. They may use skilled birth attendants more where this is less common. We do not know if the messages affect women's or babies' health because the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
Compared to women who get messages sent in other ways 
Women and newborns may have fewer health problems during the first 10 days after birth. The messages may make little or no difference to the number of women who breastfeed. We do not know if they make women use more health services. 
Compared to women who get untargeted messages 
The messages may make little or no difference to whether women get influenza vaccines during pregnancy. We do not know if the messages affect women's or babies' health or lead women to use skilled birth attendants more because the evidence is lacking or of very low certainty. 
What happens when pregnant women living with HIV receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to women who get no messages 
Women may go to slightly more antenatal care appointments. We do not know whether the messages lead more women to give birth in a health facility or improve babies' health because the evidence is of very low certainty. The messages may make little or no difference to whether pregnant women and babies follow antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (used to treat HIV) according to plan. We do not know if the messages affect women's health because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to women who get messages sent in other ways 
We do not know what the effect of these messages is because we lack evidence.
Compared to women who get untargeted messages 
More parents may follow their babies' ARV treatment according to plan. We do not know if the messages improve women's or babies' health or their use of services because the evidence is missing. 
What happens when parents of young children receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to parents who get no messages 
More parents may take their children to healthcare services such as vaccination appointments. But we do not know if the messages improve children's health or their health behaviour because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to parents who get messages sent in other ways 
Slightly more parents may take their children to vaccination appointments. The messages may make little or no difference to children's toothbrushing habits. We do not know if the messages affect children's health because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to parents who get untargeted messages 
Fewer parents may take their children to vaccination appointments, but this evidence is mixed. We do not know if the messages affect children's health due to lack of evidence.

145,10.1002-14651858.CD013432.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of hospital admissions, disease‐related morbidity and mortality. COPD is a heterogeneous disease with distinct inflammatory phenotypes, including eosinophilia, which may drive acute exacerbations in a subgroup of patients. Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin 5 (IL‐5) or its receptor (IL‐5R) have a role in the care of people with severe eosinophilic asthma, and may similarly provide therapeutic benefit for people with COPD of eosinophilic phenotype. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibody therapies targeting IL‐5 signalling (anti‐IL‐5 or anti‐IL‐5Rα) compared with placebo in the treatment of adults with COPD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, clinical trials registries, manufacturers' websites, and reference lists of included studies. Our most recent search was 23 September 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing anti‐IL‐5 therapy with placebo in adults with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and analysed outcomes using a random‐effects model.The primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring antibiotics or oral steroids, hospitalisations due to exacerbation of COPD, serious adverse events, and quality of life. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
Six studies involving a total of 5542 participants met our inclusion criteria. Three studies used mepolizumab (1530 participants), and three used benralizumab (4012 participants). The studies were on people with COPD, which was similarly defined with a documented history of COPD for at least one year. We deemed the risk of bias to be generally low, with all studies contributing data of robust methodology. 
Mepolizumab 100 mg reduces the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations by 19% in those with an eosinophil count of at least 150/μL (rate ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.93; participants = 911; studies = 2, high‐certainty evidence). When participants with lower eosinophils are included, mepolizumab 100 mg probably reduces the exacerbation rate by 8% (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03; participants = 1285; studies = 2, moderate‐certainty evidence). Mepolizumab 300 mg probably reduces the rate of exacerbations by 14% in participants all of whom had raised eosinophils (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.06; participants = 451; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence); the evidence was uncertain for a single small study of mepolizumab 750 mg. In participants with high eosinophils, mepolizumab probably reduces the rate of hospitalisation by 10% (100 mg, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.24; participants = 911; studies = 2, moderate‐certainty evidence) and 17% (300 mg, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.35; participants = 451; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence). Mepolizumab 100 mg increases the time to first moderate or severe exacerbation compared to the placebo group, in people with the eosinophilic phenotype (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.92; participants = 981; studies 2, high‐certainty evidence). When participants with lower eosinophils were included this difference was smaller and less certain (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.0; participants = 1285; studies 2, moderate‐certainty evidence). Mepolizumab 300 mg probably increases the time to first moderate or severe exacerbation in participants who all had eosinophilic phenotype (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99; participants = 451; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Benralizumab 100 mg reduces the rate of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalisation in those with an eosinophil count of at least 220/μL (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.81; participants = 1512; studies = 2, high‐certainty evidence). Benralizumab 10 mg probably reduces the rate of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalisation in those with an eosinophil count of at least 220/μL (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94; participants = 765; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
There was probably little or no difference between the intervention and placebo for quality of life measures. Where there were differences the mean difference fell below the pre‐specified minimum clinically significant difference. 
Treatment with mepolizumab and benralizumab appeared to be safe. All pooled analyses showed that there was probably little or no difference in serious adverse events, adverse events, or side effects between the use of a monoclonal antibody therapy compared to placebo. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that mepolizumab and benralizumab probably reduce the rate of moderate and severe exacerbations in the highly selected group of people who have both COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils. This highlights the importance of disease phenotyping in COPD, and may play a role in the personalised treatment strategy in disease management. 
Further research is needed to elucidate the role of monoclonal antibodies in the management of COPD in clinical practice. In particular, it is not clear whether there is a threshold blood eosinophil level above which these drugs may be effective. Studies including cost effectiveness analysis may be beneficial given the high cost of these therapies, to support use if appropriate. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing New Drugs for People with COPD Who Have High Levels of Certain White Blood Cells

## Plain Title

Can drugs that target a specific immune signal help people with COPD who have high levels of certain white blood cells?

## Rationale

**What is COPD?**

COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is a long-term lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. People with COPD often have flare-ups, called exacerbations. During these flare-ups, breathing gets much worse. These flare-ups can send people to the hospital. They are a major cause of illness and death in people with COPD.

**What makes COPD different in some people?**

COPD is not the same in everyone. Some people have high levels of a type of white blood cell called eosinophils. These cells are part of the body's immune system. When there are too many eosinophils, they can cause inflammation in the lungs. This inflammation may trigger flare-ups in some people with COPD.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors already use special drugs called monoclonal antibodies for people with severe asthma who have high eosinophils. These drugs block a signal in the body called interleukin 5, or IL-5. IL-5 helps control eosinophils. The researchers wanted to see if these same drugs could help people with COPD who also have high eosinophils. If these drugs work, they could reduce flare-ups and hospital visits for this group of people.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

The researchers looked at six different studies. These studies included 5,542 adults with COPD. Three studies tested a drug called mepolizumab. Three studies tested a drug called benralizumab. Both drugs block IL-5 signals in the body.

**Who was in the studies?**

All participants were adults with COPD. They had been diagnosed with COPD for at least one year. Some studies focused on people with high eosinophil levels. Other studies included people with lower eosinophil levels too.

**What did participants receive?**

Some participants received the study drug. Others received a placebo. A placebo looks like the real drug but contains no medicine. The researchers compared the two groups.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time varied by study. Participants were followed to see how many flare-ups they had. Researchers also tracked hospital visits and side effects.

## Results

**What did the researchers find about mepolizumab?**

In people with high eosinophils (at least 150 cells per microliter of blood), mepolizumab 100 mg reduced flare-ups by about one-fifth. It also helped people go longer before having their first flare-up. The 300 mg dose also helped reduce flare-ups. Hospital visits went down by about one-tenth with the 100 mg dose. The results were less clear when people with lower eosinophil levels were included.

**What did the researchers find about benralizumab?**

In people with high eosinophils (at least 220 cells per microliter), benralizumab 100 mg reduced severe flare-ups needing hospital care. It cut these flare-ups by more than one-third. The 10 mg dose also helped reduce hospital visits.

**Did quality of life improve?**

The drugs probably made little or no difference in quality of life scores. Any improvements were too small to matter to patients.

**Were the drugs safe?**

Both drugs appeared to be safe. There was probably little or no difference in serious side effects between the drug and placebo groups. The number of people having any side effects was similar in both groups.

**What do these results mean?**

These drugs can help reduce flare-ups in a specific group of people. They work best for people who have both COPD and high eosinophil levels. This shows that testing blood eosinophil levels matters. It can help doctors choose the right treatment for each person.

**What is still unknown?**

More research is needed. Doctors need to know the exact eosinophil level where these drugs start working. These drugs are very expensive. Studies looking at cost compared to benefit would help doctors decide when to use them.",10.1002-14651858.CD013432,"Mepolizumab or benralizumab for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
Background to the question 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung condition in which people can experience severe difficulties with breathing and an associated reduction in their quality of life. 
For people with COPD, episodes in which the condition of patients seriously worsens are a major concern. We examined the findings of clinical trials to see whether mepolizumab or benralizumab, two new drugs, are better than placebo (dummy treatment) for people with COPD, and whether they reduce the number of episodes when the condition of patients seriously worsens. 
Study characteristics 
Six clinical studies compared either mepolizumab or benralizumab to placebo in a total of 5542 people with COPD. We examined the findings of the studies in terms of episodes when patients' conditions flared up requiring additional treatment, patient quality of life, patient performance in breathing tests, and side effects of the medication. 
Main results 
Three studies used mepolizumab, and the other three studies used benralizumab.
Mepolizumab 100 mg reduced the rate of flare‐ups in a group of people with both COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils (a type of white blood cells involved in inflammatory and allergic reactions). When mepolizumab is given in a higher dose (300 mg or 750 mg) the rate of flare‐ups is probably reduced. 
Benralizumab at a dose of 100mg resulted in a clear reduction in the number of episodes requiring admission to hospital, and when given at a lower dose (10mg) probably reduces flare‐ups requiring hospitalisation. This is in people with COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils. 
Further studies comparing mepolizumab or benralizumab to a placebo may provide more clarity on the role of these drugs for COPD. 
Quality of the evidence 
The included studies were for the most part very well‐designed and robust, and the evidence was generally of high quality.

","# Plain Language Summary: Bisphosphonate Therapy for Osteogenesis Imperfecta

## Plain Title
Do Bone-Strengthening Drugs Help People with Brittle Bone Disease?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**

Osteogenesis imperfecta is also called brittle bone disease. People with this condition have bones that break very easily. The disease is passed down in families through genes. Sometimes it happens in a child with no family history.

**What problems does it cause?**

People with brittle bone disease face many challenges. Their long bones break often. The bones in their spine can collapse. These problems make daily life very hard.

**Why was this study needed?**

There is no cure for brittle bone disease. Doctors mostly provide supportive care. Researchers wanted to find better ways to help. They looked at drugs called bisphosphonates. These drugs are usually given to older people with weak bones. Doctors hoped these drugs might help people with brittle bone disease too.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if bisphosphonates could help in three ways. First, could they make bones stronger? Second, could they reduce how often bones break? Third, could they help people move and function better?

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 14 different trials. They collected all the evidence about bisphosphonates. Then they compared the results.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included people with brittle bone disease. The review included people of different ages. It included both males and females.

**How was the drug given?**

Some studies gave the drug by mouth. Other studies gave it through a vein. Different studies used different amounts of the drug. They also treated people for different lengths of time.

**How long did the studies last?**

Each trial lasted a different amount of time. The review looked at evidence up to April 2016.

## Results

**What did the studies find?**

The studies showed mixed results. The drugs did help in one important way. They made bones denser and stronger. Every study showed this improvement. The drugs worked whether given by mouth or through a vein.

However, the drugs did not clearly reduce broken bones. Most studies did not show a major drop in fractures. This was the main goal of treatment.

**What else did researchers learn?**

The studies did not report enough information about other important things. Researchers could not tell if the drugs helped with bone pain. They could not tell if children grew better. They could not tell if quality of life improved. These effects need more study.

**What were the main conclusions?**

Bisphosphonates do make bones denser in people with brittle bone disease. But they may not prevent fractures as hoped. More research is needed to understand the full effects.

**What questions remain?**

Several important questions still need answers. Do these drugs work well over many years? Are they safe for long-term use? What is the best dose to give? How long should treatment last? Researchers need to study these questions more.

**What were the study limitations?**

Most of the trials were small. They did not include enough people. This made it hard to see clear differences. The studies could not prove if the drugs truly helped with many outcomes. Larger studies are needed in the future.

**Why does this matter?**

This review helps doctors understand what bisphosphonates can and cannot do. The drugs may help make bones denser. But they may not prevent all fractures. Doctors and families need this information to make good choices about treatment.",10.1002-14651858.CD005088,"Bisphosphonate therapy for osteogenesis imperfecta

147,10.1002-14651858.CD013186-abstract.txt,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) are high‐risk skin cancers which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early curable cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Computer‐assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems use artificial intelligence to analyse lesion data and arrive at a diagnosis of skin cancer. When used in unreferred settings ('primary care'), CAD may assist general practitioners (GPs) or other clinicians to more appropriately triage high‐risk lesions to secondary care. Used alongside clinical and dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, CAD may reduce unnecessary excisions without missing melanoma cases. 
Objectives
To determine the accuracy of CAD systems for diagnosing cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, BCC or cSCC in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of dermoscopy. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design that evaluated CAD alone, or in comparison with dermoscopy, in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma or BCC or cSCC, and compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities separately by type of CAD system, using the bivariate hierarchical model. We compared CAD with dermoscopy using (a) all available CAD data (indirect comparisons), and (b) studies providing paired data for both tests (direct comparisons). We tested the contribution of human decision‐making to the accuracy of CAD diagnoses in a sensitivity analysis by removing studies that gave CAD results to clinicians to guide diagnostic decision‐making. 
Main results
We included 42 studies, 24 evaluating digital dermoscopy‐based CAD systems (Derm–CAD) in 23 study cohorts with 9602 lesions (1220 melanomas, at least 83 BCCs, 9 cSCCs), providing 32 datasets for Derm–CAD and seven for dermoscopy. Eighteen studies evaluated spectroscopy‐based CAD (Spectro–CAD) in 16 study cohorts with 6336 lesions (934 melanomas, 163 BCC, 49 cSCCs), providing 32 datasets for Spectro–CAD and six for dermoscopy. These consisted of 15 studies using multispectral imaging (MSI), two studies using electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and one study using diffuse‐reflectance spectroscopy. Studies were incompletely reported and at unclear to high risk of bias across all domains. Included studies inadequately address the review question, due to an abundance of low‐quality studies, poor reporting, and recruitment of highly selected groups of participants. 
Across all CAD systems, we found considerable variation in the hardware and software technologies used, the types of classification algorithm employed, methods used to train the algorithms, and which lesion morphological features were extracted and analysed across all CAD systems, and even between studies evaluating CAD systems. Meta–analysis found CAD systems had high sensitivity for correct identification of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in highly selected populations, but with low and very variable specificity, particularly for Spectro–CAD systems. Pooled data from 22 studies estimated the sensitivity of Derm–CAD for the detection of melanoma as 90.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 84.0% to 94.0%) and specificity as 74.3% (95% CI 63.6% to 82.7%). Pooled data from eight studies estimated the sensitivity of multispectral imaging CAD (MSI–CAD) as 92.9% (95% CI 83.7% to 97.1%) and specificity as 43.6% (95% CI 24.8% to 64.5%). When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the mean observed melanoma prevalence of 20%, Derm–CAD would miss 20 melanomas and would lead to 206 false‐positive results for melanoma. MSI–CAD would miss 14 melanomas and would lead to 451 false diagnoses for melanoma. Preliminary findings suggest CAD systems are at least as sensitive as assessment of dermoscopic images for the diagnosis of invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants. We are unable to make summary statements about the use of CAD in unreferred populations, or its accuracy in detecting keratinocyte cancers, or its use in any setting as a diagnostic aid, because of the paucity of studies. 
Authors' conclusions
In highly selected patient populations all CAD types demonstrate high sensitivity, and could prove useful as a back‐up for specialist diagnosis to assist in minimising the risk of missing melanomas. However, the evidence base is currently too poor to understand whether CAD system outputs translate to different clinical decision–making in practice. Insufficient data are available on the use of CAD in community settings, or for the detection of keratinocyte cancers. The evidence base for individual systems is too limited to draw conclusions on which might be preferred for practice. Prospective comparative studies are required that evaluate the use of already evaluated CAD systems as diagnostic aids, by comparison to face–to–face dermoscopy, and in participant populations that are representative of those in which the test would be used in practice. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Computer Programs to Help Doctors Detect Skin Cancer

## Plain Title

Can computer programs help doctors find skin cancer?

## Rationale

**What is skin cancer and why does it matter?**

Skin cancer comes in different types. Some types are very serious. Melanoma and a type called squamous cell cancer can spread to other parts of the body and may cause death. Another type called basal cell cancer usually stays in one place but can damage nearby skin.

Finding skin cancer early is very important. When doctors find it early, they can treat it better. But doctors also worry about two things. They don't want to miss any cancers. But they also don't want to remove spots that are not cancer.

**What are computer programs for skin cancer?**

Computer programs can look at pictures or data from skin spots. These programs use artificial intelligence to decide if a spot might be cancer. Doctors call these programs CAD systems.

**Why study these computer programs?**

Researchers wanted to know if these computer programs work well. Can they help doctors find skin cancer? Can they help doctors decide which patients need to see a specialist? The programs might help doctors make better choices about which spots to remove.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked at 42 different studies. These studies tested computer programs on adults with skin spots that might be cancer.

The studies tested two main types of computer programs:
- Programs that look at special photos of skin spots (24 studies with 9,602 skin spots)
- Programs that use light or electrical signals to study skin spots (18 studies with 6,336 skin spots)

The researchers checked if the computer programs were right. They compared the computer results to what doctors found when they removed the spots and looked at them under a microscope. This is the best way to know if a spot is cancer.

The researchers also compared the computer programs to dermoscopy. Dermoscopy is when doctors use a special tool to look closely at skin spots.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included adults with skin spots that looked like they might be cancer. Most studies looked at very specific groups of patients. These were often people already seeing skin specialists.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The computer programs were good at finding melanoma. The photo-based programs found 9 out of 10 melanomas. The light-based programs found slightly more.

But the programs also made many mistakes. They said many normal spots were cancer when they were not.

**What does this mean in real numbers?**

Imagine 1,000 people with skin spots. About 200 of these spots are melanoma.

With photo-based programs:
- The program would miss 20 melanomas
- The program would wrongly say 206 normal spots were cancer

With light-based programs:
- The program would miss 14 melanomas
- The program would wrongly say 451 normal spots were cancer

**What about other types of skin cancer?**

The researchers could not find enough information about how well these programs find basal cell cancer or squamous cell cancer.

**What about regular doctor visits?**

The researchers could not find enough studies about using these programs in regular doctor offices. Most studies were done with skin specialists.

**Main conclusions**

The computer programs are good at finding melanoma in special clinics. They might help skin specialists make sure they don't miss cancers.

But there are problems:
- The studies were not very good quality
- The programs said too many normal spots were cancer
- We don't know if they work in regular doctor offices
- We don't know if they help doctors make better choices

**What is needed next?**

Researchers need better studies. These studies should test the programs in regular doctor offices with everyday patients. They should compare the programs to doctors looking at skin spots in person.

Right now, doctors should not rely only on these computer programs to find skin cancer.",10.1002-14651858.CD013186,"What is the diagnostic accuracy of computer‐assisted diagnosis techniques for the detection of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms. If it is not recognised early treatment can be delayed and this risks the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body and may eventually lead to death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and BCC are considered less dangerous, as they are localised (less likely to spread to other parts of the body compared to melanoma). However, cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) might result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations and can cause stress and anxiety to the patient. Missing a diagnosis of skin cancer may result in the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate computer–assisted diagnosis (CAD) is for diagnosing melanoma, BCC or cSCC. The review also compared the accuracy of two different types of CAD, and compared the accuracy of CAD with diagnosis by a doctor using a handheld illuminated microscope (a dermatoscope or ‘dermoscopy’). We included 42 studies to answer these questions. 
What was studied in the review? 
A number of tools are available to skin cancer specialists which allow a more detailed examination of the skin compared to examination by the naked eye alone. Currently a dermatoscope which magnifies the skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) using a bright light source is used by most skin cancer specialists. CAD tests are computer systems that analyse information about skin lesions obtained from a dermatoscope or other techniques that use light to describe the features of a skin lesion (spectroscopy) to produce a result indicating whether skin cancer is likely to be present. We included CAD systems that get their information from dermoscopic images of lesions (Derm–CAD), or that use data from spectroscopy. Most of the spectroscopy studies used data from multispectral imaging (MSI–CAD) and are the main focus here. When a skin cancer specialist finds a lesion is suspicious using visual examination with or without additional dermoscopy, results from CAD systems can be used alone to make a diagnosis of skin cancer (CAD–based diagnosis), or can be used by doctors in addition to their visual inspection examination of a skin lesion to help them reach a diagnosis (CAD–aided diagnosis). Researchers examined how useful CAD systems are to help diagnose skin cancers in addition to visual inspection and dermoscopy. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included 42 studies looking at CAD systems for the diagnosis of melanoma. There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of CAD systems for the diagnosis of BCC (3 studies) or cSCC (1 study). 
Derm‐CAD results for diagnosis of melanoma  
The main results for Derm‐CAD are based on 22 studies including 8992 lesions.
Applied to a group of 1000 skin lesions, of which 200 (20%) are given a final diagnosis* of melanoma, the results suggest that: 
‐ An estimated 386 people will have a Derm–CAD result suggesting that a melanoma is present, and of these 206 (53%) will not actually have a melanoma (false‐positive result) 
‐ Of the 614 people with a Derm–CAD result indicating that no melanoma is present, 20 (3%) will in fact actually have a melanoma (false‐negative result) 
There was no evidence to suggest that dermoscopy or Derm–CAD was different in its ability to detect or rule out melanoma. 
MSI‐CAD results for diagnosis of melanoma  
The main results for MSI–CAD are based on eight studies including 2401 lesions. In a group of 1000 people, of whom 200 (20%) actually do have melanoma*, then: 
‐ An estimated 637 people will have an MSI–CAD result suggesting that a melanoma is present, and of these 451 (71%) will not actually have a melanoma (false‐positive result) 
‐ Of the 363 people with an MSI–CAD result indicating that no melanoma is present, 14 (4%) will in fact have a melanoma (false‐negative result) 
MSI–CAD detects more melanomas, but possibly produces more false‐positive results (an increase in unnecessary surgery). 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
Incomplete reporting of studies made it difficult for us to judge how reliable they were. Many studies had important limitations. Some studies only included particular types of skin lesions or excluded lesions that were considered difficult to diagnose. Importantly, most of the studies only included skin lesions with a biopsy result, which means that only a sample of lesions that would be seen by a doctor in practice were included. These characteristics may result in CAD systems appearing more or less accurate than they actually are. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were largely conducted in Europe (29, 69%) and North America (8, 19%). Mean age (reported in 6/42 studies) ranged from 32 to 49 years for melanoma. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma ranged from 1% to 52%. It was not always possible to tell whether suspicion of skin cancer in study participants was based on clinical examination alone, or both clinical and dermoscopic examinations. Almost all studies were done in people with skin lesions who were seen at specialist clinics rather than by doctors in primary care. 
What are the implications of this review? 
CAD systems appear to be accurate for identification of melanomas in skin lesions that have already been selected for excision on the basis of clinical examination (visual inspection and dermoscopy). It is possible that some CAD systems identify more melanomas than doctors using dermoscopy images. However, CAD systems also produced far more false‐positive diagnoses than dermoscopy, and could lead to considerable increases in unnecessary surgery. The performance of CAD systems for detecting BCC and cSCC skin cancers is unclear. More studies are needed to evaluate the use of CAD by doctors for the diagnosis of skin cancer in comparison to face‐to‐face diagnosis using dermoscopy, both in primary care and in specialist skin cancer clinics. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow up, or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference standards (means of establishing the final diagnosis).

Review question 
Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the most effective way of using gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) as part of controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing assisted reproduction technology (ART). 
Background 
GnRHa are given along with hormone injections that stimulate the ovaries, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous release of eggs prior to their planned surgical retrieval. GnRHa have been proven to improve pregnancy rates; however, various regimens are described in the literature. We conducted this review to identify the most effective regimens. 
Study characteristics 
We found 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 3872 women comparing the use of GnRHa in various protocols. Twenty of these RCTs (1643 women) compared a long protocol with a short protocol. The evidence is current to April 2015. 
Key results 
In comparisons of long GnRHa protocols (where GnRHa is given for at least 14 days prior to the start of ovarian stimulation) versus short GnRHa protocols (when the GnRHa is given at the start of stimulation) there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates. However there was moderate quality evidence of higher clinical pregnancy rates in the long protocol groups. Our findings suggest that in a population in which 14% of women achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a short protocol, between 13% and 23% will achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a long protocol. 
None of the other analyses showed any evidence of a difference in birth or pregnancy outcomes between the protocols compared. There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding adverse effects. Further research is needed to determine which long protocol is most cost effective and acceptable to women. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or ongoing pregnancy, poor reporting of methods in the primary studies, and imprecise findings due to lack of data. Only 10 of the 37 included studies were conducted within the last 10 years.

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Ways to Use Hormone Drugs to Help Women Get Pregnant Through Fertility Treatment

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Some women need help to get pregnant. Doctors use a treatment called assisted reproduction technology (ART) to help these women. During this treatment, doctors give women hormone drugs to help their ovaries make eggs. Then doctors remove these eggs through a small surgery.

**What is the problem?**
Sometimes a woman's body releases eggs too early, before doctors can collect them. When this happens, the treatment does not work.

**What is the study drug?**
Doctors use a drug called GnRHa to stop eggs from being released too early. This drug has been shown to help more women get pregnant. However, doctors use this drug in different ways. Some doctors give it for a long time before starting other hormone drugs. Other doctors give it for a short time.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to find out which way of using GnRHa works best. This would help doctors choose the best treatment plan for women trying to get pregnant.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 37 studies that had already been done. These studies included 3,872 women in total. The researchers compared different ways of using GnRHa.

The main comparison looked at two methods:
- Long protocol: Women took GnRHa for at least 14 days before starting other hormone drugs
- Short protocol: Women took GnRHa at the same time as starting other hormone drugs

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included women who were trying to get pregnant through fertility treatment.

**When was this research done?**
The researchers looked at studies published up to April 2015. Only 10 of the 37 studies were done in the last 10 years before 2015.

## Results

**What did the study find?**
The researchers compared the long protocol to the short protocol. Here is what they found:

For live births and ongoing pregnancies, the results were not clear. The long protocol might work better, but the evidence was not strong enough to be sure. Out of 100 women using the short protocol, about 14 had a live birth or ongoing pregnancy. With the long protocol, between 13 and 23 out of 100 women might have a live birth or ongoing pregnancy.

For clinical pregnancies (pregnancies confirmed by a doctor), the long protocol worked better than the short protocol.

The researchers also looked at other ways of using GnRHa. They found no clear differences between these other methods.

**What about side effects?**
The studies did not provide enough information about side effects or problems from the treatments.

**What do these results mean?**
The long protocol may help more women get pregnant compared to the short protocol. However, more research is needed.

**What research is still needed?**
Doctors need more information about:
- Which long protocol costs less money
- Which treatment women prefer
- What side effects happen with each treatment
- How these treatments work with newer fertility methods

The studies in this review were not perfect. Many did not report live births. Some were done many years ago. Newer research with better methods is needed to help doctors and women make the best choices.",10.1002-14651858.CD006919,"Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) used as an adjuvant to gonadotrophins in assisted reproduction treatments

Review question 
Which treatments help to relieve symptoms for people with burning mouth syndrome (BMS)?
Background 
BMS is a common painful condition. Symptoms include burning, dryness or uncomfortable sensations in the mouth and changes to taste, with no obvious underlying medical or dental cause. BMS is usually persistent and suffered long term, and can lead to a reduced quality of life (QoL). Currently, scientific research suggests that BMS is caused by underlying damage to the nerves. There are many treatments available including drugs for anxiety, other psychological conditions and increasing saliva production, protective barriers and treatments applied to the mouth surface amongst others. 
Study characteristics 
This review of studies was carried out through Cochrane Oral Health, and the evidence is current up to 31 December 2015. 
We found 23 studies (assessing 1121 people; 83% were women), published between 1995 and 2015 to include in this review. Twenty‐one studies assessed short‐term (up to three months) symptom relief, and four studies assessed long‐term (from three to six months) symptom relief. Seventeen studies provided information about side effect occurrence, seven studies assessed a measure of QoL, and two studies assessed changes in taste and feeling of dryness. 
All of the 23 treatments included in this review were compared to a placebo (fake treatment): antidepressants and antipsychotics (two studies), antiseizure drugs (one study), types of tranquillisers (four studies), saliva stimulants (one study), dietary supplements (12 studies), directed energy waves (one study), physical barriers (one study), psychological therapies (one study), and treatments applied to the mouth surface (five studies). 
Key results 
Short‐term symptom relief  
We found evidence of short‐term symptom relief for directed energy waves (one study, 58 participants), a type of tranquilliser used topically (that is held in the mouth before being removed, and which also acts as an antiseizure drug) called clonazepam (two studies, 111 participants), thin plastic tongue covers (one study, 50 participants), and an antiseizure drug called gabapentin (one study, 100 participants). 
There was no difference in short‐term symptom relief found for antidepressants, saliva stimulants, and another type of tranquilliser used systemically (one that is swallowed) also called clonazepam. We were unable to show whether dietary supplements or treatments applied to the mouth surface provide symptom relief in the short term or not. 
Short‐term relief was not reported for the single study that assessed a psychological therapy. 
Long‐term symptom relief  
We found evidence of long‐term symptom relief for psychological therapy (one study, 30 participants), chili pepper mouthrinse (one study, 18 participants) and the topical tranquilliser called clonazepam (one study, 66 participants). 
We found there was no difference in long‐term symptom relief for dietary supplements or treatments applied to the mouth surface. 
Studies which assessed antidepressants, directed energy waves, saliva stimulants, antiseizure drugs, or physical barriers did not evaluate long‐term symptom relief. 
Change in QoL  
There was evidence of short‐term improvement in QoL for directed energy waves (one study, 58 patients), although no difference was found for antidepressants, tranquillisers, dietary supplements and physical barriers. No study assessed long‐term QoL changes. 
Change in taste or feeling of dryness  
A few studies assessed short‐term change in taste or feeling of dryness (none evaluated these outcomes long‐term), but there was not enough evidence to judge the effects of treatment on these outcomes. 
Side effects  
Side effects were more likely to be experienced with antidepressants (dizziness and drowsiness more likely: one study, 37 people), and with a dietary supplement called alpha lipoic acid (also known as ALA) with or without other ingredients (headaches more likely: two studies, 118 people; and upset stomachs more likely: three studies, 138 people). 
Quality of the evidence  Overall, we found very low‐quality evidence for each short‐ and long‐term outcome we investigated (symptom relief; changes in QoL, taste and feeling of dryness; and side effects) in all types of assessed treatment: antidepressants and antipsychotics, antiseizure drugs, types of tranquillisers, saliva stimulants, dietary supplements, directed energy waves, physical barriers (except side effects, which was assessed as low quality), psychological therapies, and treatments applied to the mouth surface. As we found so few studies at low risk of bias, we are currently unable to prove or disprove the effectiveness of any treatments for managing BMS. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Burning Mouth Syndrome

## Plain Title
Testing Different Treatments to Help People with Burning Mouth Syndrome

## Rationale

**What is burning mouth syndrome?**
Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a painful condition. People with BMS feel burning, dryness, or discomfort in their mouth. Their sense of taste may change. Doctors cannot find a clear medical or dental cause for these symptoms.

**Why is this a problem?**
BMS usually lasts a long time. It does not go away easily. This ongoing pain can make daily life harder for patients. It can lower their quality of life.

**What causes BMS?**
Scientists believe BMS happens when nerves become damaged. The exact reason is not fully known.

**Why was this study needed?**
Many different treatments exist for BMS. These include medicines for anxiety, medicines to help make more saliva, mouth rinses, and other options. However, doctors need to know which treatments actually work. This study looked at the research to find out which treatments help relieve BMS symptoms.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at 23 different studies. These studies tested various treatments for BMS. The review included research published between 1995 and 2015.

**Who was in these studies?**
A total of 1,121 people took part across all studies. Most participants were women (83 out of every 100 people). All participants had BMS.

**What did the studies test?**
Each study compared a real treatment to a fake treatment (called a placebo). The treatments tested included:
- Medicines for depression and anxiety
- Medicines to prevent seizures
- Calming medicines (tranquilizers)
- Products to increase saliva
- Vitamins and dietary supplements
- Energy wave therapy
- Plastic tongue covers
- Talk therapy
- Mouth rinses and gels

**How long did the studies last?**
Most studies (21 studies) looked at short-term relief. Short-term means up to 3 months. Four studies looked at long-term relief. Long-term means 3 to 6 months.

**What did researchers measure?**
Researchers looked at several things:
- Did symptoms get better?
- Did quality of life improve?
- Did taste or dryness change?
- Did treatments cause side effects?

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**Short-term symptom relief (up to 3 months):**
Some treatments helped reduce symptoms in the short term:
- Energy wave therapy (1 study, 58 people)
- A calming medicine called clonazepam used in the mouth (2 studies, 111 people)
- Thin plastic covers for the tongue (1 study, 50 people)
- A seizure medicine called gabapentin (1 study, 100 people)

Some treatments did not help:
- Depression medicines
- Saliva-boosting products
- Clonazepam pills (swallowed, not held in mouth)

For other treatments, researchers could not tell if they worked or not.

**Long-term symptom relief (3 to 6 months):**
Some treatments helped reduce symptoms long-term:
- Talk therapy (1 study, 30 people)
- Chili pepper mouth rinse (1 study, 18 people)
- Clonazepam used in the mouth (1 study, 66 people)

Vitamins and mouth treatments did not show long-term benefits.

**Quality of life:**
Energy wave therapy improved quality of life in the short term (1 study, 58 people). Other treatments did not show clear improvements.

**Changes in taste or dryness:**
Not enough information was available to judge these effects.

**Side effects:**
Some treatments caused side effects:
- Depression medicines caused dizziness and drowsiness (1 study, 37 people)
- Alpha lipoic acid (a dietary supplement) caused headaches (2 studies, 118 people) and upset stomachs (3 studies, 138 people)

**What do these results mean?**
The quality of evidence was very low for all treatments. This means the studies had problems that make the results less reliable. Researchers found very few high-quality studies. Because of this, they cannot prove which treatments definitely work for BMS.

**Conclusions:**
More high-quality research is needed. Right now, doctors and patients cannot be certain which treatments work best for burning mouth syndrome. Some treatments showed promise, but better studies are needed to confirm the results.",10.1002-14651858.CD002779,"Interventions for treating burning mouth syndrome

## Plain Title
Can Brain Training Help People with Mild to Moderate Dementia?

## Rationale

**What is dementia and why is it important?**

Dementia is a brain condition that makes it hard for people to think, remember, and do daily tasks. It gets worse over time. More than 40 million people around the world have dementia today. By the year 2050, more than 115 million people may have it. Dementia is caused by diseases like Alzheimer's disease. It is a big health problem that affects many people and their families.

**What is cognitive training?**

Cognitive training is a type of treatment that does not use drugs. Instead, people practice tasks that help their brain work better. These tasks focus on things like memory, paying attention, and solving problems. A trained person guides them through these tasks.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need to find better ways to help people with dementia. We do not know if cognitive training can help people with mild to moderate dementia keep their thinking skills or feel better. This study looked at past research to find out if cognitive training works.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at 33 different studies that had already been done. They combined the results from all these studies to see what they could learn.

**Who was in these studies?**

About 2,000 people took part in these 33 studies. All of them had mild to moderate dementia. The studies were done in 12 different countries around the world.

**What did the studies compare?**

Some people in the studies did cognitive training. Other people got their usual care or did activities that were not specific brain training. Some studies also compared cognitive training to other active treatments.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found some good news about cognitive training:

People who did cognitive training may have shown some improvement in their overall thinking skills. They may have also gotten better at specific things like verbal fluency. Verbal fluency means being able to think of and say words quickly.

The benefits may last for at least a few months after the training ends.

People who did cognitive training did not seem to have more stress or burden from taking part.

**What did the researchers not find?**

The researchers did not find proof that cognitive training worked better than other active treatments.

**What are the limits of these findings?**

The quality of the 33 studies was not very high overall. Some studies were better than others. This means we cannot be completely sure about all the findings. The researchers say their certainty in some results is low.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Cognitive training may help people with mild to moderate dementia improve some thinking skills. It does not seem to cause harm or extra stress. However, we need better studies to be more sure about these benefits.

**What is needed next?**

Future studies should be higher quality. They should compare cognitive training to other treatments. They should also follow people for a longer time. This will help us know if the benefits last for many months or years.

**Main conclusion**

Cognitive training may offer some benefits for thinking skills in people with mild to moderate dementia. These benefits may last for a few months. More research is needed to be more certain about these findings and to see if benefits last longer.",10.1002-14651858.CD013069,"Cognitive training for people with mild to moderate dementia

151,10.1002-14651858.CD011723.pub2-abstract.txt,"Mindfulness‐based interventions for substance use disorders
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to determine whether mindfulness‐based interventions (MBIs) i.e. interventions involving training in mindfulness meditation improve symptoms of substance use disorders (SUDs) (i.e. alcohol and/or drug use, but excluding tobacco use disorders). Cochrane researchers searched, selected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question. We found 40 randomized controlled trials,that assessed MBI as a treatment for SUDs. 
Key messages 
SUD outcomes were monitored at different time points: directly following completion of the MBIs, and at follow‐up time points, which ranged from 3 months to 10 months after the MBI ended. Relative to other interventions (standard of care, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoeducation, support group, physical exercise, medication), MBIs may slightly reduce days with substance use, but it is very uncertain whether they reduce other SUD‐related outcomes. The effects of MBIs relative to no treatment was very uncertain across all SUD‐assessed outcomes, as was the risk for adverse events. 
What was studied in this review? 
SUDs are very common and associated with negative physical and psychological health outcomes. Although evidence‐based interventions exist for treating SUDs, the standard treatments may not be sufficient and many individuals relapse to substance use. In the past several decades, MBIs have been examined for the treatment of SUDs. MBIs involve training in mindfulness meditation practice, which emphasizes the cultivation of present‐moment, non‐judgmental awareness. MBIs may improve many of the psychological variables involved in substance use and relapse (i.e. depression, anxiety, stress, attention). We studied whether MBIs benefit individuals with SUDs. 
We searched for studies that compared an MBI to no treatment or to another treatment (e.g. cognitive behavior therapy, psychoeducation). We studied the results at the end of the intervention and at follow‐up assessments, which occurred 3 to 10 months following the end of the intervention. 
What are the main results of this review? 
The review authors found 40 relevant studies, of which 45% were focused on individuals with various SUDs with the remaining studies including participants using a specific substance (e.g. alcohol, opioids).

","# Plain Language Summary: Mindfulness Training for People with Drug and Alcohol Problems

## Plain Title
Can mindfulness training help people who struggle with drug or alcohol use?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**
Many people have problems with drugs or alcohol. These problems are called substance use disorders, or SUDs. SUDs are very common. They can harm a person's body and mind. They can make people feel sad, worried, or stressed.

**What treatments exist?**
Doctors have treatments that can help people with SUDs. But these treatments do not always work well enough. Many people start using drugs or alcohol again after treatment. This is called relapse.

**What is mindfulness training?**
Mindfulness training teaches people to pay attention to the present moment. It teaches them not to judge their thoughts and feelings. People learn this through meditation practice. Mindfulness may help with feelings like sadness, worry, and stress. It may also help people pay better attention. All of these things are linked to drug and alcohol use.

**Why do this study?**
Researchers wanted to know if mindfulness training could help people with SUDs. They looked at many studies to find the answer. They wanted to see if mindfulness works better than no treatment. They also wanted to see if it works better than other treatments like talk therapy or education classes.

## Trial Design

**How was this study done?**
Researchers looked for all studies that tested mindfulness training for SUDs. They found 40 studies. These studies included people who had problems with different substances. Some used alcohol. Some used opioids. Some used various drugs.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included 2,825 people total. These people all had problems with drugs or alcohol. The studies did not focus on tobacco use.

**Where were the studies done?**
Most studies were done in the United States (23 studies). Eleven studies were done in Iran. Other studies were done in Thailand, Brazil, China, Taiwan, and Spain.

**What did researchers compare?**
Some studies compared mindfulness training to no treatment. Other studies compared mindfulness training to other treatments. These other treatments included talk therapy, education classes, support groups, exercise, and medication.

**When did researchers check the results?**
Researchers checked results right after the mindfulness training ended. They also checked results 3 to 10 months later. This helped them see if the benefits lasted over time.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

When mindfulness training was compared to other treatments:
- Mindfulness may slightly reduce the number of days people use drugs or alcohol. This was true both right after treatment and months later.
- About the same number of people stayed in mindfulness programs as stayed in other treatment programs.
- For other measures, the results were unclear. These measures included staying completely sober, how much people used, and how strong their cravings were.

When mindfulness training was compared to no treatment:
- The results were unclear for all measures of drug and alcohol use.
- About the same number of people stayed in mindfulness programs as in no-treatment groups.

**Were there any harmful effects?**
Only four studies looked at harmful effects. The information available did not show that mindfulness training caused harm or serious problems.

**What does this mean?**
Mindfulness training may help reduce drug and alcohol use a little bit. It seems to work about as well as other treatments. More research is needed to know for sure how well it works. More research is also needed to know if it is safe.

**How current is this information?**
Researchers looked at studies published through April 2021.

**Who paid for these studies?**
Sixteen studies had no funding. Other studies were paid for by government agencies, universities, non-profit groups, and clinics.",10.1002-14651858.CD011723,"Mindfulness‐based interventions for substance use disorders
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to determine whether mindfulness‐based interventions (MBIs) i.e. interventions involving training in mindfulness meditation improve symptoms of substance use disorders (SUDs) (i.e. alcohol and/or drug use, but excluding tobacco use disorders). Cochrane researchers searched, selected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question. We found 40 randomized controlled trials,that assessed MBI as a treatment for SUDs. 
Key messages 
SUD outcomes were monitored at different time points: directly following completion of the MBIs, and at follow‐up time points, which ranged from 3 months to 10 months after the MBI ended. Relative to other interventions (standard of care, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoeducation, support group, physical exercise, medication), MBIs may slightly reduce days with substance use, but it is very uncertain whether they reduce other SUD‐related outcomes. The effects of MBIs relative to no treatment was very uncertain across all SUD‐assessed outcomes, as was the risk for adverse events. 
What was studied in this review? 
SUDs are very common and associated with negative physical and psychological health outcomes. Although evidence‐based interventions exist for treating SUDs, the standard treatments may not be sufficient and many individuals relapse to substance use. In the past several decades, MBIs have been examined for the treatment of SUDs. MBIs involve training in mindfulness meditation practice, which emphasizes the cultivation of present‐moment, non‐judgmental awareness. MBIs may improve many of the psychological variables involved in substance use and relapse (i.e. depression, anxiety, stress, attention). We studied whether MBIs benefit individuals with SUDs. 
We searched for studies that compared an MBI to no treatment or to another treatment (e.g. cognitive behavior therapy, psychoeducation). We studied the results at the end of the intervention and at follow‐up assessments, which occurred 3 to 10 months following the end of the intervention. 
What are the main results of this review? 
The review authors found 40 relevant studies, of which 45% were focused on individuals with various SUDs with the remaining studies including participants using a specific substance (e.g. alcohol, opioids). Of these 40 studies, 23 were conducted in the USA, 11 were conducted in Iran, two were conducted in Thailand, one was conducted in Brazil, one was conducted in China, one was conducted in Taiwan, and one was conducted in both Spain and the USA. We were able to analyze results of 35 studies composed of 2825 participants; the other five did not report usable results, and requests to the authors for more information were unsuccessful. 
When MBIs were compared with other treatments, our review and analysis showed that MBIs may slightly reduce days with substance use at post‐treatment and follow‐up, and show similar study retention.

When MBIs were compared with no treatment, the evidence was uncertain for all SUD‐related outcomes, although MBIs showed similar treatment retention.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological cause of disability in young adults. Off‐label rituximab for MS is used in most countries surveyed by the International Federation of MS, including high‐income countries where on‐label disease‐modifying treatments (DMTs) are available.  
Objectives
To assess beneficial and adverse effects of rituximab as 'first choice' and as 'switching' for adults with MS. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and trial registers for completed and ongoing studies on 31 January 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) comparing rituximab with placebo or another DMT for adults with MS. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We used the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias. We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE for: disability worsening, relapse, serious adverse events (SAEs), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), common infections, cancer, and mortality. We conducted separate analyses for rituximab as 'first choice' or as 'switching', relapsing or progressive MS, comparison versus placebo or another DMT, and RCTs or NRSIs. 
Main results
We included 15 studies (5 RCTs, 10 NRSIs) with 16,429 participants of whom 13,143 were relapsing MS and 3286 progressive MS. The studies were one to two years long and compared rituximab as 'first choice' with placebo (1 RCT) or other DMTs (1 NRSI), rituximab as 'switching' against placebo (2 RCTs) or other DMTs (2 RCTs, 9 NRSIs). The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high‐income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two studies. We identified 14 ongoing studies. 
Rituximab as 'first choice' for relapsing MS 
Rituximab versus placebo: no studies met eligibility criteria for this comparison.
Rituximab versus other DMTs: one NRSI compared rituximab with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, or fingolimod in active relapsing MS at 24 months' follow‐up. Rituximab likely results in a large reduction in relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (hazard ratio (HR) 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.39; 335 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may reduce relapses compared with dimethyl fumarate (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.00; 206 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and natalizumab (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.00; 170 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It may make little or no difference on relapse compared with fingolimod (HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.69; 137 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported no deaths over 24 months. The study did not measure disability worsening, SAEs, HRQoL, and common infections. 
Rituximab as 'first choice' for progressive MS 
One RCT compared rituximab with placebo in primary progressive MS at 24 months' follow‐up. Rituximab likely results in little to no difference in the number of participants who have disability worsening compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.11; 439 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may result in little to no difference in recurrence of relapses (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.99; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), SAEs (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.20; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), common infections (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.73; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), cancer (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.59; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and mortality (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.77; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure HRQoL. 
Rituximab versus other DMTs: no studies met eligibility criteria for this comparison.
Rituximab as 'switching' for relapsing MS  
One RCT compared rituximab with placebo in relapsing MS at 12 months' follow‐up. Rituximab may decrease recurrence of relapses compared with placebo (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.93; 104 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to placebo on SAEs (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.92; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), common infections (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.24; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), cancer (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 39.15; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and mortality (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 39.15; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure disability worsening and HRQoL.  
Five NRSIs compared rituximab with other DMTs in relapsing MS at 24 months' follow‐up. The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to interferon beta or glatiramer acetate on disability worsening (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.42; 1 NRSI, 853 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Rituximab likely results in a large reduction in relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; 1 NRSI, 1383 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and fingolimod (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32; 1 NRSI, 256 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to natalizumab on relapses (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.2 to 5.0; 1 NRSI, 153 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Rituximab likely increases slightly common infections compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.62; 1 NRSI, 5477 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and compared with natalizumab (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.32; 2 NRSIs, 5001 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may increase slightly common infections compared with fingolimod (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.77; 3 NRSIs, 5187 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It may make little or no difference compared with ocrelizumab (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.40; 1 NRSI, 472 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab on mortality compared with fingolimod (OR 5.59, 95% CI 0.22 to 139.89; 1 NRSI, 136 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and natalizumab (OR 6.66, 95% CI 0.27 to 166.58; 1 NRSI, 153 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The included studies did not measure SAEs, HRQoL, and cancer. 
Authors' conclusions
For preventing relapses in relapsing MS, rituximab as 'first choice' and as 'switching' may compare favourably with a wide range of approved DMTs. A protective effect of rituximab against disability worsening is uncertain. There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for progressive MS.  
The evidence is uncertain about the effect of rituximab on SAEs. They are relatively rare in people with MS, thus difficult to study, and they were not well reported in studies. There is an increased risk of common infections with rituximab, but absolute risk is small.  
Rituximab is widely used as off‐label treatment in people with MS; however, randomised evidence is weak. In the absence of randomised evidence, remaining uncertainties on beneficial and adverse effects of rituximab for MS might be clarified by making real‐world data available. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Rituximab for Multiple Sclerosis

## Plain Title

Does rituximab help adults with multiple sclerosis?

## Rationale

**What is multiple sclerosis?**

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the brain and nerves. It is the most common nerve disease that causes disability in young adults. MS can make it hard for people to move, see, or think clearly. It can greatly affect daily life.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors around the world use a drug called rituximab to treat MS. However, rituximab is not officially approved for MS. It was made for other diseases. Doctors use it ""off-label,"" which means they prescribe it even though it is not approved for MS.

Many countries use rituximab for MS, even rich countries that have other approved MS drugs. Researchers wanted to know if rituximab really works for MS and if it is safe.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know:
- Does rituximab help people with MS?
- Does it prevent MS from getting worse?
- Does it reduce MS attacks (called relapses)?
- Is it safe? What are the side effects?

They looked at rituximab used two ways: as a first treatment for newly diagnosed people, and when switching from another MS drug.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 15 different studies. These studies included 16,429 adults with MS. Some studies were very carefully controlled. Others looked at real-world use of the drug.

The studies compared rituximab to:
- Fake treatment (placebo)
- Other approved MS drugs

**Who was in the studies?**

- Adults with MS
- Some had relapsing MS (13,143 people). This type causes attacks that come and go.
- Some had progressive MS (3,286 people). This type slowly gets worse over time.

**How long did the studies last?**

Most studies lasted one to two years.

**Where were the studies done?**

Studies were done around the world. Most were in wealthy countries. Six studies used data from Sweden's MS registry.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

**For relapsing MS (the type with attacks):**

When rituximab was used as a first treatment:
- Rituximab likely reduces MS attacks much more than older drugs like interferon beta or glatiramer acetate.
- It may reduce attacks compared to other drugs like dimethyl fumarate and natalizumab.
- No deaths occurred during the studies.

When people switched to rituximab from another drug:
- Rituximab may reduce MS attacks compared to fake treatment.
- Rituximab likely reduces attacks much more than several other MS drugs.
- Rituximab slightly increases common infections compared to some other drugs. However, the actual risk is small.

**For progressive MS (the type that slowly worsens):**

- Rituximab likely makes little to no difference in preventing disability from getting worse.
- It may make little difference in reducing attacks.
- Side effects were similar to fake treatment.

**What about safety?**

- Serious side effects were hard to study because they are rare in people with MS.
- Common infections increased slightly with rituximab, but the actual number was small.
- The studies did not find clear differences in cancer or death rates.
- More research is needed to fully understand safety.

**What do these results mean?**

Rituximab may help reduce MS attacks in people with relapsing MS. It may work as well as or better than other approved MS drugs. However, researchers are not sure if it prevents disability from getting worse.

For progressive MS, rituximab does not seem to help much.

**What is still unknown?**

Most evidence comes from real-world use, not carefully controlled studies. More controlled studies are needed. Researchers need better information about long-term safety and whether rituximab truly prevents disability.

Even though many doctors use rituximab for MS, the scientific evidence is limited. More research would help doctors and patients make better decisions.",10.1002-14651858.CD013874,"Rituximab for people with multiple sclerosis
Key messages 
– Rituximab may offer moderate‐to‐large benefit against a range of other medicines in preventing relapses in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Compared with no medicines, the desirable effects would be greater. 
– There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for preventing disability worsening in all forms of MS.  
– Serious harmful effects are relatively rare in people with MS making them difficult to study, and they were also not well reported in studies. 
What is the issue? 
Rituximab is a medicine administered by intravenous (by a vein) infusion that can suppress certain immune cells. The immune system fights infections and consists of many immune cells; it is affected in MS. 
Rituximab is currently used in many low‐ to middle‐income countries that have major barriers for accessing approved medicines for MS. However, rituximab is not always reimbursed by health systems because it is not licensed for MS by marketing authorities.  
Rituximab is considered a feasible treatment option as it is considered a highly effective treatment (similar to other approved medicines used to treat MS) but has considerably lower cost and less frequent dosing. Treatment with rituximab requires specialist care and infusion facilities, but other approved medicines do too. 
What did we want to find out? 
We aimed to investigate the beneficial and unwanted effects of rituximab for people with MS, when is used as a 'first choice' or as 'switching' (in other words, used when other medicines do not work well or become contraindicated). 
We wanted to find out if rituximab was better than other medicines to prevent disability worsening and recurrence of relapse, and to improve well‐being. 
We also wanted to find out if rituximab was associated with any unwanted or harmful effects, for example, serious harmful effects, common infections, cancer, and mortality (death). 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that investigated rituximab compared with all other approved medicines for MS. We searched the literature up to January 2021. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and quality. 
What did we find?  
We found 15 studies that involved about 16,000 people with MS and lasted one or two years. The biggest study was of 6421 people and the smallest study was of 27 people. The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high‐income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two included studies. 
Main results 
Rituximab as a first choice treatment in relapsing MS: 
– likely results in a large reduction in the number of people who have relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study in 335 people); 
– may reduce the number of people who have relapses compared with dimethyl fumarate and natalizumab, but the evidence is uncertain (evidence from one study). 
There was no usable information on disability worsening, well‐being, and serious harmful effects. 
Rituximab as a first choice treatment in progressive MS: 
– likely results in little to no difference in the number of participants who have disability worsening over 24 months compared with pretend treatment (evidence from one study of 439 people); 
– the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of rituximab on well‐being and serious harmful effects. 
Rituximab as 'switching' for relapsing MS: 
– likely results in a large reduction in the number of people who have relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study of 1383 people), and fingolimod (evidence from one study of 256 people). The evidence is very uncertain on the comparison of rituximab with natalizumab; 
– the evidence is very uncertain on disability worsening;
– likely increases slightly the number of people who have common infections compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study of 5477 people), and natalizumab (evidence from two studies of 5001 people). The evidence is uncertain for the comparisons of rituximab with fingolimod and ocrelizumab. 
There was no usable information on well‐being and serious harmful effects.
Rituximab as 'switching' for progressive MS 
Only three small studies investigated rituximab in secondary progressive MS. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of rituximab on disability worsening, well‐being, and serious harmful effects. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
– Limited confidence about the effect of rituximab on disability worsening in all forms of MS. 
– Limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for progressive forms of MS. 
– Studies were short with a median duration of 24 months.
How up to date is the evidence?

153,10.1002-14651858.CD015077-abstract.txt,"Background
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents the most severe course of COVID‐19 (caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus), usually resulting in a prolonged stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) and high mortality rates. Despite the fact that most affected individuals need invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), evidence on specific ventilation strategies for ARDS caused by COVID‐19 is scarce. Spontaneous breathing during IMV is part of a therapeutic concept comprising light levels of sedation and the avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA). This approach is potentially associated with both advantages (e.g. a preserved diaphragmatic motility and an optimised ventilation‐perfusion ratio of the ventilated lung), as well as risks (e.g. a higher rate of ventilator‐induced lung injury or a worsening of pulmonary oedema due to increases in transpulmonary pressure). As a consequence, spontaneous breathing in people with COVID‐19‐ARDS who are receiving IMV is subject to an ongoing debate amongst intensivists. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of early spontaneous breathing activity in invasively ventilated people with COVID‐19 with ARDS compared to ventilation strategies that avoid spontaneous breathing. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (which includes CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials.gov WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv) and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies from their inception to 2 March 2022.  
Selection criteria
Eligible study designs comprised randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated spontaneous breathing in participants with COVID‐19‐related ARDS compared to ventilation strategies that avoided spontaneous breathing (e.g. using NMBA or deep sedation levels). Additionally, we considered controlled before‐after studies, interrupted time series with comparison group, prospective cohort studies and retrospective cohort studies. For these non‐RCT studies, we considered a minimum total number of 50 participants to be compared as necessary for inclusion. Prioritised outcomes were all‐cause mortality, clinical improvement or worsening, quality of life, rate of (serious) adverse events and rate of pneumothorax. Additional outcomes were need for tracheostomy, duration of ICU length of stay and duration of hospitalisation.  
Data collection and analysis
We followed the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 
Two review authors independently screened all studies at the title/abstract and full‐text screening stage. We also planned to conduct data extraction and risk of bias assessment in duplicate. We planned to conduct meta‐analysis for each prioritised outcome, as well as subgroup analyses of mortality regarding severity of oxygenation impairment and duration of ARDS. In addition, we planned to perform sensitivity analyses for studies at high risk of bias, studies using NMBA in addition to deep sedation level to avoid spontaneous breathing and a comparison of preprints versus peer‐reviewed articles. We planned to assess the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.  
Main results
We identified no eligible studies for this review.
Authors' conclusions
We found no direct evidence on whether early spontaneous breathing in SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS is beneficial or detrimental to this particular group of patients.  RCTs comparing early spontaneous breathing with ventilatory strategies not allowing for spontaneous breathing in SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS are necessary to determine its value within the treatment of severely ill people with COVID‐19. Additionally, studies should aim to clarify whether treatment effects differ between people with SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS and people with non‐SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title

Can early breathing on their own help people with severe COVID-19 lung damage who are on breathing machines?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people with COVID-19 develop a very serious lung problem called ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). This is the worst form of COVID-19 lung damage. People with ARDS cannot breathe well enough on their own. They need to stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Many of these people die from this condition.

**What treatment did researchers want to study?**

Most people with ARDS need a breathing machine. Doctors put a tube down their throat. The machine pushes air into their lungs. There are two main ways to use these breathing machines:

- Let patients try to breathe on their own while the machine helps them
- Give patients strong drugs so they cannot breathe on their own, and let the machine do all the work

**Why did researchers want to do this study?**

Doctors do not know which way is better for people with COVID-19 ARDS. Each way has good points and bad points.

Letting patients breathe on their own might help because:
- Their breathing muscles stay strong
- Air moves better through their lungs

But it might also cause harm because:
- It could damage their lungs more
- It could make fluid build up in their lungs

Doctors need to know which way works best. This study tried to find all the research done on this question.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers look for studies?**

The researchers searched medical databases up to March 2022. They looked for studies that compared these two breathing methods in adults with COVID-19 ARDS.

They wanted to find studies that measured:
- How many people died
- How many people got better or worse
- Quality of life after treatment
- Side effects and safety problems
- Lung collapse (pneumothorax)
- How long people stayed in the ICU
- How long people stayed in the hospital

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found no studies that met their requirements. Not a single study compared these two breathing methods in people with COVID-19 ARDS.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, there is no clear evidence to tell doctors which breathing method is better. Doctors do not know if letting COVID-19 patients breathe on their own helps them or hurts them.

**What needs to happen next?**

Researchers need to do new studies to answer this important question. These studies should:
- Compare the two breathing methods
- Include people with COVID-19 ARDS
- Measure which method helps more people survive
- Look at side effects and safety

These studies would help doctors make better choices about how to treat people with severe COVID-19 lung damage.

**Why is this important?**

Many people with COVID-19 develop severe lung damage. Doctors need to know the best way to use breathing machines for these patients. Without good research, doctors must make their best guess. This could mean some patients do not get the best treatment. New studies could save lives by showing doctors which breathing method works better.

Is early spontaneous breathing beneficial in the treatment of lung failure in individuals with COVID‐19? 
People with severe COVID‐19 can present with lung failure, which is called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This requires invasive mechanical ventilation through a breathing tube. It is possible to allow breathing, triggered by the patient (called spontaneous breathing), whilst being on a ventilator. However, it is unclear whether this is beneficial for such individuals, especially in the early phase of ventilation. 
Key messages 
We found no evidence if spontaneous breathing is beneficial in the treatment of lung failure due to COVID‐19. 
What are the advantages of early spontaneous breathing in ARDS?  
The advantage of spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation is the preserved movement of the diaphragm (the major muscle for breathing located under the lungs). It leads to better distribution of the inhaled air, especially in the pulmonary alveoli (small air sacs within the lungs) close to the diaphragm. In general, ventilation procedures with possible spontaneous breathing require lower doses of sedatives (which slow down brain activity). Since these can cause low blood pressure, it can additionally reduce the administration of cardiovascular medicines. 
Can early spontaneous breathing be harmful in the treatment of ARDS? 
During spontaneous breathing under mechanical ventilation, increased pressure fluctuations in the lungs may occur. Increased pressure difference within the lung is the main cause of ventilator‐associated lung injury. 
What is the alternative to using early spontaneous breathing? 
Spontaneous breathing may be suppressed by increased sedation or blockade of the nerves innervating muscles by medicines that allow for breathing (called neuromuscular blockade). The advantage of complete ventilator‐based breathing is a lower oxygen consumption of the muscles and the reduced risk of self‐inflicted lung injury. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of early spontaneous breathing activity in ventilated people with COVID‐19 with ARDS compared to ventilation strategies that avoid spontaneous breathing. 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that compared early spontaneous breathing during invasive mechanical ventilation with mandatory invasive ventilation and neuromuscular blockade in people with ARDS related to COVID‐19. People could have been any age, sex or ethnicity.  
What did we find?  
After systematic search, we found no records that met the inclusion criteria.
Main results 
We identified no eligible studies for this review.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
To date, there are no studies that have compared early spontaneous breathing during invasive mechanical ventilation to mandatory invasive ventilation without spontaneous breathing in people with ARDS related to COVID‐19.  
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
Our evidence is up‐to‐date to 2 March 2022.

Fetal malposition (occipito‐posterior and persistent occipito‐transverse) in labour is associated with adverse maternal and infant outcomes. Whether use of maternal postures can improve these outcomes is unclear. This Cochrane Review of maternal posture in labour is one of two new reviews replacing a 2007 review of maternal postures in pregnancy and labour. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of specified maternal postures for women with fetal malposition in labour on maternal and infant morbidity compared to other postures.  
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (13 July 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster‐RCTs conducted among labouring women with a fetal malposition confirmed by ultrasound or clinical examination, comparing a specified maternal posture with another posture. Quasi‐RCTs and cross‐over trials were not eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, risk of bias, and performed data extraction. We used mean difference (MD) for continuous variables, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included eight eligible studies with 1766 women. 
All studies reported some form of random sequence generation but were at high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding. There was a high risk of selection bias in one study, detection bias in two studies, attrition bias in two studies, and reporting bias in two studies. 
Hands and knees 
The use of hands and knees posture may have little to no effect on operative birth (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.50; 3 trials, 721 women; low‐certainty evidence) and caesarean section (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.87; 3 trials, 721 women; low‐certainty evidence) but the evidence is uncertain; and very uncertain for epidural use (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.31; 2 trials, 282 women; very low‐certainty evidence), instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.90; 3 trials, 721 women; very low‐certainty evidence), severe perineal tears (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.03 to 22.30; 2 trials, 586 women; very low‐certainty evidence), maternal satisfaction (average RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.54; 3 trials, 350 women; very low‐certainty evidence), and Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.34; 2 trials, 586 babies; very low‐certainty evidence).  
No data were reported for the hands and knees comparisons for postpartum haemorrhage, serious neonatal morbidity, death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant), admission to neonatal intensive care, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy.  
Lateral postures 
The use of lateral postures may have little to no effect on reducing operative birth (average RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.19; 4 trials, 871 women; low‐certainty evidence), caesarean section (average RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.39; 4 trials, 871 women; low‐certainty evidence), instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.36; 4 trials, 871 women; low‐certainty evidence), and maternal satisfaction (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; 2 trials, 451 women; low‐certainty evidence), but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of lateral postures on severe perineal tears (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.48; 3 trials, 609 women; very low‐certainty evidence), postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.70; 1 trial, 322 women; very low‐certainty evidence), serious neonatal morbidity (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.12; 3 trials, 752 babies; very low‐certainty evidence), Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.24; 1 trial, 322 babies; very low‐certainty evidence), admissions to neonatal intensive care (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.12; 2 trials, 542 babies; very low‐certainty evidence) and neonatal death (stillbirth or death of liveborn) (1 trial, 210 women and their babies; no events).  
For the lateral posture comparisons, no data were reported for epidural use, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy. We were not able to estimate the outcome death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant) due to no events (1 trial, 210 participants).  
Authors' conclusions
We found low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence which indicated that the use of hands and knees posture or lateral postures in women in labour with a fetal malposition may have little or no effect on health outcomes of the mother or her infant. If a woman finds the use of hands and knees or lateral postures in labour comfortable there is no reason why they should not choose to use them. Further research is needed on the use of hands and knees and lateral postures for women with a malposition in labour. Trials should include further assessment of semi‐prone postures, same‐side‐as‐fetus lateral postures with or without hip hyperflexion, or both, and consider interventions of longer duration or that involve the early second stage of labour. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Different Body Positions During Labor When the Baby Is Facing the Wrong Way

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
During labor, babies usually face toward the mother's back. This is the best position for birth. Sometimes, babies face toward the mother's front or side instead. Doctors call this ""fetal malposition."" When babies are in these positions, labor can be harder and longer. Mothers may need more help during birth, such as forceps or a cesarean section (surgery to deliver the baby). Both mothers and babies can have more health problems.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors wanted to know if changing how a mother positions her body during labor could help the baby turn to a better position. If the baby turns, birth might be easier and safer. Some doctors suggest mothers get on their hands and knees or lie on their side. But no one knew for sure if these positions really help.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to find out if specific body positions during labor could make birth safer and easier when babies are facing the wrong way. They wanted to know if these positions could reduce the need for surgery or tools to help deliver the baby.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at eight different studies that other scientists had already done. Together, these studies included 1,766 women.

All the women in these studies were in labor. Their babies were facing the wrong way. Doctors confirmed this by checking or using ultrasound (a test that uses sound waves to see the baby).

Some women were asked to use specific body positions during labor. These positions included:
- Hands and knees (getting down on all fours)
- Lying on their side

Other women used different positions or their usual positions.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included pregnant women who were in labor. Their babies were not in the best position for birth.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies looked at what happened during labor and birth. This usually lasted several hours. Researchers also checked on mothers and babies right after birth.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

The researchers found that changing body positions during labor probably does not make much difference for mothers or babies when the baby is facing the wrong way.

**For hands and knees position:**
- This position probably did not reduce the need for surgery (cesarean section) or tools (forceps or vacuum) to help deliver the baby.
- Researchers were very unsure if this position changed how many mothers wanted pain medicine.
- Researchers were very unsure if this position changed how happy mothers felt about their birth.
- Researchers were very unsure if this position affected baby health scores after birth.

**For lying on the side:**
- This position probably did not reduce the need for surgery or tools to help deliver the baby.
- This position probably did not change how happy mothers felt about their birth.
- Researchers were very unsure if this position changed the risk of heavy bleeding after birth.
- Researchers were very unsure if this position affected how many babies needed special care after birth.

### What does this mean?
The evidence was weak. The studies were small. The researchers could not be sure about most of their findings. They need better and bigger studies to know if body positions really help.

### What should women do?
If a woman finds hands and knees or lying on her side comfortable during labor, she can use these positions. There is no harm in trying them. But these positions may not change how the birth goes.

### What happens next?
More research is needed. Future studies should test positions for longer times. They should also test other positions, like lying partly on the stomach or pulling the knee up high while lying on the side.",10.1002-14651858.CD014615,"Mothers' positions in labour when baby is lying 'back‐to‐back'
What is the issue? 
Malposition is when the back of the baby's head lies towards the mother's back. As a result, labour and birth can be long and difficult, sometimes resulting in an operative birth (where the baby is delivered by caesarean section or with special tools to help the baby through the birth canal) and more perineal trauma (damage to the pelvic floor). The baby may be more likely to go to a neonatal care unit. Also, women may experience stress or disappointment with the birth experience.  
Why is this important? 
The way a pregnant woman is positioned during labour may help rotate a baby so that the back of the baby's head lies towards the front of the mother's abdomen. This improved position may help the mother and baby have a more normal labour and birth. However, it is not yet known which posture, if any, is effective and when is the best time to use it. 
A systematic review of studies of positions (postures) used by women in labour with a baby in a malposition can provide answers on whether the postures improve birth and other health outcomes for mothers and babies. The summary of this review can be used to update clinical practice guidelines. 
A Cochrane Review in 2007 reported that the use of the 'hands and knees' posture in labour was ineffective for malposition, but it did reduce labouring women's backache. Since then, more trials have been conducted, some using other postures; these need evaluating to see if those postures work. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence (published to 13 July 2021) and identified eight studies  in nine different countries involving 1766 women and their babies. Women in the included studies were either first‐time mothers or mothers who had birthed before. All the women's  pregnancies were at least at 36 weeks.  
The trials compared use of 'hands and knees' posture or 'side‐lying' (lateral) postures (lying on the same side as the baby, lying on the opposite side to the baby, and lying semi‐prone) to other postures (free posture, lying on back, leaning back, lying on the same side as the baby).  
For both the hands and knees posture and side‐lying positions during labour, there may be little or no difference in the numbers of operative births, haemorrhage (profuse bleeding of the mother), severe perineal trauma, and women's satisfaction with their labour and delivery, but there was insufficient evidence to be sure. Many of our outcomes of interest were not reported in the included studies. 
Overall, we have little to no confidence in the evidence, mainly because there were too few women and babies in the studies, and some studies used unclear methods. 
What does this mean? 
Overall, it is uncertain whether hands and knees or side‐lying positions in labour improve the health of mother and baby when a baby is in a malposition. However, if women find the use of hands and knees, side‐lying, or other postures in labour comfortable, there is no reason why they should not choose to use them. 
Further research is needed to enable optimal fetal positioning. In particular, further research is needed on variations in the postures, the impact of longer use of these postures during labour, and on long‐term outcomes for women and their babies.

Carotid artery stenosis is an important cause of stroke and transient ischemic attack. Correctly and rapidly identifying patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis is essential for adequate treatment with early cerebral revascularization. Doubts about the diagnostic value regarding the accuracy of duplex ultrasound (DUS) and the possibility of using DUS as the single diagnostic test before carotid revascularization are still debated. 
Objectives
To estimate the accuracy of DUS in individuals with symptomatic carotid stenosis verified by either digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). 
Search methods
We searched CRDTAS, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), ISI Web of Science, HTA, DARE, and LILACS up to 15 February 2021. We handsearched the reference lists of all included studies and other relevant publications and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies or unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We included studies assessing DUS accuracy against an acceptable reference standard (DSA, MRA, or CTA) in symptomatic patients. We considered the classification of carotid stenosis with DUS defined with validated duplex velocity criteria, and the NASCET criteria for carotid stenosis measures on DSA, MRA, and CTA. We excluded studies that included < 70% of symptomatic patients; the time between the index test and the reference standard was longer than four weeks or not described, or that presented no objective criteria to estimate carotid stenosis. 
Data collection and analysis
The review authors independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS‐2 domain list. We extracted data with an effort to complete a 2 × 2 table (true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives) for each of the different categories of carotid stenosis and reference standards. We produced forest plots and summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots to summarize the data. Where meta‐analysis was possible, we used a bivariate meta‐analysis model. 
Main results
We identified 25,087 unique studies, of which 22 were deemed eligible for inclusion (4957 carotid arteries). The risk of bias varied considerably across the studies, and studies were generally of moderate to low quality. We narratively described the results without meta‐analysis in seven studies in which the criteria used to determine stenosis were too different from the duplex velocity criteria proposed in our protocol or studies that provided insufficient data to complete a 2 × 2 table for at least in one category of stenosis. Nine studies (2770 carotid arteries) presented DUS versus DSA results for 70% to 99% carotid artery stenosis, and two (685 carotid arteries) presented results from DUS versus CTA in this category. Seven studies presented results for occlusion with DSA as the reference standard and three with CTA as the reference standard. Five studies compared DUS versus DSA for 50% to 99% carotid artery stenosis. Only one study presented results from 50% to 69% carotid artery stenosis. 
For DUS versus DSA, for < 50% carotid artery stenosis, the summary sensitivity was 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48 to 0.76) and the summary specificity was 0.99 (95% CI 0.96 to 0.99); for the 50% to 69% range, only one study was included and meta‐analysis not performed; for the 50% to 99% range, the summary sensitivity was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.98) and the summary specificity was 0.70 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.73); for the 70% to 99% range, the summary sensitivity was 0.85 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.91) and the summary specificity was 0.98 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.90); for occlusion, the summary sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.97) and the summary specificity was 0.95 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.99). 
For sensitivity analyses, excluding studies in which participants were selected based on the presence of occlusion on DUS had an impact on specificity: 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 0.99). For DUS versus CTA, we found two studies in the range of 70% to 99%; the sensitivity varied from 0.57 to 0.94 and the specificity varied from 0.87 to 0.98. For occlusion, the summary sensitivity was 0.95 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.99) and the summary specificity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.99). For DUS versus MRA, there was one study with results for 50% to 99% carotid artery stenosis, with a sensitivity of 0.88 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.98) and specificity of 0.60 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.95); in the 70% to 99% range, two studies were included, with sensitivity that varied from 0.54 to 0.99 and specificity that varied from 0.78 to 0.89. We could perform only a few of the proposed sensitivity analyses because of the small number of studies included. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides evidence that the diagnostic accuracy of DUS is high, especially at discriminating between the presence or absence of significant carotid artery stenosis (< 50% or 50% to 99%). This evidence, plus its less invasive nature, supports the early use of DUS for the detection of carotid artery stenosis. The accuracy for 70% to 99% carotid artery stenosis and occlusion is high. Clinicians should exercise caution when using DUS as the single preoperative diagnostic method, and the limitations should be considered. There was little evidence of the accuracy of DUS when compared with CTA or MRA. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution because they are based on studies of low methodological quality, mainly due to the patient selection method. Methodological problems in participant inclusion criteria from the studies discussed above apparently influenced an overestimated estimate of prevalence values. Most of the studies included failed to precisely describe inclusion criteria and previous testing. Future diagnostic accuracy studies should include direct comparisons of the various modalities of diagnostic tests (mainly DUS, CTA, and MRA) for carotid artery stenosis since DSA is no longer considered to be the best method for diagnosing carotid stenosis and less invasive tests are now used as reference standards in clinical practice. Also, for future studies, the participant inclusion criteria require careful attention. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing How Well Ultrasound Detects Blocked Neck Arteries That Can Cause Strokes

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?

The carotid arteries are large blood vessels in the neck. They carry blood to the brain. Sometimes, these arteries become narrow or blocked. This is called carotid artery stenosis. When this happens, blood flow to the brain decreases. This can cause a stroke or a mini-stroke.

A stroke happens when part of the brain does not get enough blood. This can cause serious problems. People may lose the ability to move, speak, or think clearly. Finding blocked neck arteries quickly is very important. Doctors can then treat patients before a stroke happens.

### Why was this study needed?

Doctors use different tests to check for blocked neck arteries. One test is called duplex ultrasound, or DUS. This test uses sound waves to create pictures of blood vessels. It does not hurt. It does not use needles or dyes.

Other tests include DSA, CTA, and MRA. These tests give detailed pictures but are more complex. Some use X-rays or strong magnets. Some require dye injections.

Doctors wanted to know if DUS alone is good enough to find blocked arteries. They needed to know if DUS could replace the more complex tests. This would help patients avoid more invasive procedures.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

This was not a single study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at many studies that other doctors had already done. They searched medical databases up to February 2021. They found 25,087 studies. Of these, 22 studies met their standards.

The 22 studies included 4,957 carotid arteries from patients who had stroke symptoms. These patients had already received both DUS and at least one other test (DSA, CTA, or MRA).

The researchers compared the DUS results to the other test results. They wanted to see how often DUS correctly identified blocked arteries. They looked at different levels of blockage:
- Less than 50% blocked
- 50% to 69% blocked
- 70% to 99% blocked
- Completely blocked

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

The researchers found that DUS works well for finding blocked neck arteries.

**For arteries less than 50% blocked:**
When comparing DUS to DSA, DUS correctly identified 63 out of 100 blocked arteries. It correctly identified 99 out of 100 arteries that were not blocked.

**For arteries 50% to 99% blocked:**
DUS correctly identified 97 out of 100 blocked arteries. It correctly identified 70 out of 100 arteries that were not blocked.

**For arteries 70% to 99% blocked:**
DUS correctly identified 85 out of 100 blocked arteries. It correctly identified 98 out of 100 arteries that were not blocked.

**For completely blocked arteries:**
DUS correctly identified 91 out of 100 blocked arteries. It correctly identified 95 out of 100 arteries that were not blocked.

The researchers found fewer studies comparing DUS to CTA or MRA. The results varied more in these comparisons.

### What does this mean?

DUS is very good at finding blocked neck arteries. It works especially well at telling the difference between arteries that are less than 50% blocked and those that are 50% or more blocked. This information helps doctors decide on treatment.

DUS is safe and does not hurt. It can be used early to check for blocked arteries. However, doctors should be careful. They should consider using additional tests before surgery in some cases.

The researchers noted that many studies had quality problems. Future studies should compare DUS, CTA, and MRA directly. They should also include patients more carefully. This will give doctors better information about which test works best.",10.1002-14651858.CD013172,"How accurate is duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging for diagnosing carotid artery stenosis in symptomatic patients? 
Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) is a narrowing of the lumen (the inside space) of the carotid artery (usually due to cholesterol deposits called plaque). CAS is responsible for 8% of all strokes due to a blocked blood vessel (ischemic strokes) and is associated with a high chance of recurrence. In such circumstances, the treatment is to re‐establish adequate blood flow (by surgery or other approaches to open the artery) to prevent further neurologic episodes. Duplex ultrasound (DUS) can help identify the appropriate patients who will benefit from a more invasive treatment and those who should be with drugs alone. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine how accurate DUS is for diagnosing different grades of CAS in individuals with neurologic symptoms. 
What was studied in the review? 
DUS is used in clinical practice as the first test to detect carotid artery stenosis, usually with the result confirmed by other more expensive and invasive tests, such as computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The advantage of DUS is that it is less expensive and helps to reduce the time required to select patients for treatment. We included studies assessing the accuracy of DUS compared with DSA, MRA, or CTA in patients with recent stroke symptoms. We grouped the results from studies that used approximately the same method and threshold to assess accuracy in the following categories of carotid artery stenosis: < 50%, 50% to 99%, 50% to 69%, 70% to 99%, and occlusion (blockage of the vessel). 
What are the main results of this review? 
This review included 22 studies (4957 carotid arteries tested). The searches were performed up to 15 February 2021. The results indicate the following: If DUS were to be used in a standardized cohort of 1000 patients: 
For DUS versus DSA  
< 50% CAS (4 studies, 1495 carotid arteries): Estimated 299 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of non‐significant CAS, of whom eight (2.7%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 701 people with a result indicating that < 50% carotid stenosis is not present, 169 (24.1%) would be incorrectly classified. 
50% to 99% CAS (5 studies, 1536 carotid arteries): Estimated 642 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of 50% to 99% CAS; of these, 147 (22.8%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 358 people with a result indicating that 50% to 99% carotid stenosis is not present, 15 (4.2%) would be incorrectly classified. 
70% to 99% CAS (9 studies, 2770 carotid arteries): Estimated 390 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of 70% to 99% CAS; of these, eight (2%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 610 people with a result indicating that 70% to 99% carotid stenosis is not present, 68 (11.1%) would be incorrectly classified. 
Occlusion (7 studies, 1212 carotid arteries): Estimated 205 patients would have a DUS result indicating carotid artery occlusion; of these, 41 (20%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 795 people with a result indicating that carotid occlusion is not present, 16 (2%) would be incorrectly classified. 
For DUS versus CTA  
Occlusion (3 studies, 833 carotid arteries): An estimated 606 patients would have a DUS result indicating carotid artery occlusion; of these, 36 (6%) would be incorrectly classified. 394 people with a result indicating that carotid occlusion is not present, 30 (8%) would be incorrectly classified. 
For DUS versus MRA  
Meta‐analysis was not performed.
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
There were some problems with how the studies were conducted that could impair the correct estimates of the diagnostic accuracy. Many of the studies were of poor or unclear quality. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
The results are relevant for patients with neurologic symptoms who are suspected of having carotid artery stenosis. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The diagnostic accuracy of DUS is high, especially at discriminating between the presence or absence of significant carotid artery stenosis. This evidence, plus its less invasive nature, supports the early use of DUS for the detection of carotid artery stenosis.

## Plain Title
Do Antibiotics Help Kidney Transplant Patients Who Have Bacteria in Their Urine but No Symptoms?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

After someone gets a kidney transplant, bacteria can grow in their urine. Up to 1 in 2 people with a kidney transplant will have this happen. When bacteria are in the urine and cause problems like fever, pain when urinating, or belly pain, this is called a urinary tract infection or UTI. But sometimes bacteria are in the urine without causing any symptoms. This is called asymptomatic bacteriuria. ""Asymptomatic"" means no symptoms, and ""bacteriuria"" means bacteria in the urine.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors often give antibiotics to kidney transplant patients who have bacteria in their urine but no symptoms. The idea is that antibiotics might stop a full UTI from happening later. Preventing UTIs might help patients live longer and keep their transplanted kidney working better. However, we do not know if this treatment really helps. We also do not know how many people with bacteria but no symptoms will actually get sick later.

**What are the concerns about using antibiotics?**

Antibiotics can cause problems. They can lead to diarrhea and other side effects. Taking antibiotics often can make bacteria stronger and harder to kill. This is called antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics also cost money. Researchers wanted to find out if giving antibiotics to people without symptoms does more good than harm.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies that tested antibiotics in kidney transplant patients with bacteria in their urine but no symptoms. They searched medical records through September 2017. They found 2 studies with 212 people total. These studies compared people who took antibiotics to people who did not take antibiotics.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included adults who had received a kidney transplant. These people had bacteria in their urine but felt fine and had no symptoms of infection.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies followed patients for different lengths of time to see what happened.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The bacteria in the urine often stayed there whether people took antibiotics or not. The antibiotics did not always clear the bacteria.

**Did antibiotics prevent UTIs?**

The researchers could not tell for sure if antibiotics prevented UTIs with symptoms. There was not enough information from the studies. The studies also had some problems with how they were done.

**Did antibiotics cause antibiotic resistance?**

It was unclear if using antibiotics made bacteria more resistant. Again, there was not enough data to know.

**What about other important outcomes?**

The studies did not provide clear answers about whether antibiotics helped with:
- Keeping the transplanted kidney from being rejected
- Keeping people out of the hospital
- Helping people live longer
- Keeping the transplanted kidney working better

**Were antibiotics safe?**

One study with 112 people found no serious harmful reactions from antibiotics. Minor side effects seemed rare.

**What are the main conclusions?**

We cannot say for sure if antibiotics help kidney transplant patients who have bacteria in their urine but no symptoms. The studies had problems. In one study, people were not assigned to groups randomly. This can make results less trustworthy. In both studies, people knew if they were taking antibiotics or not. This knowledge might have changed how they reported symptoms. Also, the studies were too small to give clear answers.

**What is needed next?**

More and better research is needed. Future studies should be larger and better designed to give clear answers about whether antibiotics help or harm these patients.",10.1002-14651858.CD011357,"Antibiotics for bacterial infection in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms

Review question 
What is the effectiveness of compression stockings as the only and initial treatment of varicose veins in people without healed or active venous ulceration (leg ulcers)? 
Background 
Varicose veins are widened veins that twist and turn and are visible under the skin of the legs. They generally do not cause medical problems, although many people seek medical advice. Symptoms may include pain, ankle swelling, tired legs, restless legs, night cramps, heaviness, itching and distress from their cosmetic appearance. Complications such as oedema (build‐up of fluid), pigmentation, inflammation (swelling, redness and pain) and ulceration (sores) can also develop. Compression stockings are often the first line of treatment and come in a variety of lengths from knee‐length to full tights, and apply different pressures to support the flow of blood in the veins. 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 studies involving 1021 participants with varicose veins who had not experienced venous ulceration in this review (search run May 2020). Five studies assessed compression stocking versus no compression stocking (for example no treatment or placebo stocking with no graduated elastic). Three of these studies used knee‐length stockings, one used full‐length stockings and one used full tights. Eight studies compared different types or pressures of knee‐length stockings. The stockings used in the studies exerted different levels of pressure. One study included only pregnant women, while other studies included people who had sought medical intervention for their varicose veins by being on surgical waiting lists, or attending vascular surgery or dermatology (skin care) clinics or outpatient departments. 
Key results 
Participants considered their symptoms had improved when stockings were worn in the nine studies that assessed this outcome, but these assessments were not always made by comparing one treatment group of the trial with a control group in the same study and was therefore subject to bias. 
Two studies comparing stockings with placebo stockings measured physical signs; there was no clear difference between baseline and follow‐up for ankle circumference, while oedema was reduced in the stocking group compared with the placebo stocking group. Generally there were no clear differences between studies comparing two types of stockings for volume reduction and change in diameter (ways to measure oedema). 
Complications or side effects ranged from sweating, itching, irritation, skin dryness and a feeling of tightness. There were no severe or long‐lasting side effects. 
Two studies comparing stockings with different stockings, and four studies comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed compliance (whether the person used the stockings as directed). In the stocking versus different stocking studies, there was no clear difference between the stockings, with generally low levels of compliance reported. In the stocking versus placebo/no treatment group, three studies reported results. Of these, one study reported a high initial dropout rate with generally low levels of compliance. The other two studies reported generally good compliance in the stocking group. Some reasons provided for non‐compliance included discomfort, difficulty in putting the stockings on, appearance, not being effective and causing irritation. 
Four studies that compared stockings with different stockings and two studies that compared stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed comfort, tolerance and acceptability of stockings. Comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment, comfort, tolerance and acceptability was affected by the study population. Compression tights were increasingly rejected by pregnant women as their pregnancy progressed, while in a study of non‐pregnant women, the stockings group showed no more hindrance of normal activities and daytime discomfort when compared with placebo stockings. In the stocking versus different stockings studies, two studies reported similar levels of tolerance and discomfort between the types of stocking. Discomfort was the main reason for indicating a preference for one type of stocking over another. 
One study assessed quality of life, showing no clear differences between the stocking and no stocking groups. 
No conclusions regarding the optimum length or pressure of compression stockings could be made as there were no conclusive results from the included studies.  
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence was low or very low because of risk of bias due to poor reporting, not all studies assessed the same outcomes, they assessed them in different ways, or reported them in a way that they could be combined and analysed with other studies. Evidence from available trials is not sufficient to determine if compression stockings as the only and initial treatment are effective in managing and treating varicose veins in the early stages. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Compression Stockings for Varicose Veins

## Plain Title
Do compression stockings help treat varicose veins in people without leg ulcers?

## Rationale

**What are varicose veins?**
Varicose veins are swollen, twisted veins. You can see them under the skin on your legs. They usually do not cause serious health problems. But they can make people feel uncomfortable.

**What problems do varicose veins cause?**
People with varicose veins may have pain, swelling around the ankles, and tired legs. They may also have restless legs, night cramps, and itching. Some people feel upset about how their legs look. In some cases, varicose veins can lead to more serious problems. These include fluid build-up, skin color changes, swelling and redness, and sores on the legs.

**What are compression stockings?**
Compression stockings are special tight socks or tights. They squeeze the legs gently. This helps blood flow better through the veins. Doctors often suggest these stockings as the first treatment. The stockings come in different lengths. Some go up to the knee. Others cover the full leg. They also squeeze with different amounts of pressure.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to know if compression stockings really help people with varicose veins. They looked at people who did not have leg sores. They wanted to find out if stockings work as the first and only treatment.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 13 different studies. These studies included 1,021 people total. All the people had varicose veins. None of them had leg ulcers or sores.

**What did the studies compare?**
Five studies compared wearing compression stockings to not wearing them. Some people wore no stockings at all. Others wore fake stockings that did not squeeze the legs. Eight studies compared different types of compression stockings. They looked at stockings with different pressures and lengths.

**Who was in the studies?**
Most studies included people who went to doctors for help with varicose veins. Some were on waiting lists for surgery. Others went to vein clinics or skin care clinics. One study included only pregnant women.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies tested stockings over different time periods. The exact length varied by study.

## Results

**Did compression stockings help with symptoms?**
Nine studies asked people about their symptoms. People said they felt better when they wore the stockings. However, these studies had some problems. They did not always compare the stocking group fairly with the no-stocking group. This means the results may not be fully reliable.

**Did stockings reduce swelling?**
Two studies measured swelling around the ankles. Stockings helped reduce fluid build-up compared to fake stockings. But there was no clear change in ankle size. Studies comparing different types of stockings found no clear differences in reducing swelling.

**Were there side effects?**
Some people had minor problems. These included sweating, itching, irritation, and dry skin. Some felt the stockings were too tight. No one had serious or long-lasting side effects.

**Did people wear the stockings as directed?**
Six studies checked if people wore their stockings regularly. Many people did not wear them as directed. Some studies found very low use. People stopped wearing stockings for several reasons. The stockings were uncomfortable. They were hard to put on. People did not like how they looked. Some felt the stockings did not help. Others said the stockings caused irritation.

**Were the stockings comfortable?**
Six studies asked about comfort. Results varied. Pregnant women liked the stockings less as their pregnancy went on. Non-pregnant women found the stockings acceptable. When comparing different types of stockings, comfort levels were similar. Discomfort was the main reason people preferred one type over another.

**Did stockings improve quality of life?**
One study looked at overall quality of life. It found no clear difference between wearing stockings and not wearing them.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers could not determine the best length or pressure for compression stockings. The studies did not provide clear answers. The quality of the evidence was low or very low. This was because studies had problems with how they were done. They measured different things in different ways. There is not enough good evidence to know if compression stockings work well as the first and only treatment for varicose veins in early stages.",10.1002-14651858.CD008819,"Wearing stockings to provide compression for the treatment of varicose veins

","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Carbetocin Help Prevent Heavy Bleeding After Giving Birth?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Heavy bleeding after giving birth is called postpartum hemorrhage. This is a major problem for mothers around the world. In poorer countries, many mothers die or become very sick from this bleeding. Even in richer countries, some women still face this risk.

### What happens normally?
Doctors try to prevent heavy bleeding after birth. They use a method called ""active management."" This means they give the mother a drug to help the womb squeeze tight. They also clamp the cord early. Then they help deliver the placenta. These steps help reduce blood loss.

### What drugs are used now?
Doctors usually give one of two drugs. These are oxytocin or syntometrine. Both drugs are given as shots in the muscle. They help the womb contract and stop bleeding.

### What is carbetocin?
Carbetocin is a newer drug. It works like oxytocin. Oxytocin is a natural hormone in the body. This hormone helps the womb contract. Carbetocin copies what oxytocin does.

### Why study carbetocin?
Researchers wanted to know if carbetocin works better than other drugs. They wanted to see if it prevents heavy bleeding. They also wanted to check if it causes fewer side effects.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This review looked at 11 different studies. These studies included 2,635 women in total. All studies were randomized controlled trials. This means women were put into groups by chance. This makes the results more reliable.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included women who had just given birth. Some women had vaginal births. Other women had cesarean sections. The studies compared carbetocin to other drugs. Some compared it to oxytocin. Others compared it to syntometrine.

### How were the drugs given?
All drugs were given as shots after delivery. Doctors gave them right after the baby was born. This is the normal time to prevent bleeding.

## Results

### What did the studies find?

#### Carbetocin compared to oxytocin:
The studies found no difference in heavy bleeding between the two drugs. Both worked about the same for preventing major blood loss. However, women who got carbetocin had one benefit. They needed fewer extra drugs after cesarean sections. These extra drugs help the womb contract more.

#### Carbetocin compared to syntometrine:
Women who got carbetocin had less blood loss after vaginal birth. This was better than syntometrine. Carbetocin also caused fewer side effects. Women felt sick to their stomach much less often. They also vomited less. Women who got carbetocin had lower blood pressure too. This was measured at 30 minutes after birth. It was also measured at 60 minutes after birth.

### What does this mean for patients?
Carbetocin may be a good choice for preventing bleeding after birth. It works as well as oxytocin. It may work better than syntometrine for some women. It causes fewer unpleasant side effects like nausea and vomiting. It also causes less high blood pressure.

### What should we know about these studies?
Five of the 11 studies got money from a drug company. This is important to know. It might affect how the studies were done.

### What do researchers conclude?
Carbetocin is a promising drug for preventing heavy bleeding after birth. It works well and causes fewer side effects than some other drugs. More research may help us understand when carbetocin is the best choice.",10.1002-14651858.CD005457,"Carbetocin for preventing postpartum haemorrhage

Review question 
Is cryotherapy (cooling) beneficial or harmful for local destruction of cancer (tumours) spread to the liver? 
Background 
When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancer affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die from complications. Cryotherapy is one of methods, used to destroy metastases in the liver. This method requires placing a special probe near the cancer site. The probe is used to deliver extreme cold to the site, which is produced by liquid nitrogen or argon gas. Placement of the probe can be guided using ultrasound or computed tomography (a special x‐ray). The rapid freezing process kills the cancer cells, and the size of the cancer is reduced. However, it is not clear if this treatment prolongs life or increases quality of life of affected people. 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of cryotherapy in destroying cancer metastases in the liver. We searched for studies assessing the effect of cryotherapy in comparison with no treatment or any other treatment in people with liver metastases from cancer of any location. We aimed to assess the effect of cryotherapy on the risk of death, quality of life, and adverse events (side effects caused by the treatment). 
Study characteristics 
We last searched for evidence in June 2018. We included only one trial conducted in Ukraine, and participants' primary cancer was colorectal (bowel) cancer in 66% of instances, but there were also people with stomach, breast, skin, and other tumours. All of them had cancer spread to the liver. In this trial, 123 participants were allocated at random to receive either cryotherapy (63 people) or conventional surgery (affected parts of the liver were removed; 60 people). 
Funding 
The trial did not provide information on funding.
Key results 
The trial was at high risk of bias. The participants were followed for up to 10 years (minimum five months). The trial reported that the mortality at 10 years was 81% (51/63) in the cryotherapy group and 92% (55/60) in the conventional surgery group. We judged the evidence as low‐certainty evidence. We found no evidence of a difference in proportion of participants with recurrence of the malignancy in the liver: 86% (54/63) of the participants in the cryotherapy group and 95% (57/60) of the participants in the conventional surgery group developed a new malignancy (low‐certainty evidence). The frequency of reported complications was similar between the cryotherapy group and the conventional surgery group, except for postoperative pain. Both insignificant and pronounced pain were reported to be more common in the cryotherapy group while intense pain was reported to be more common in the conventional surgery group. However, it was not reported whether there was any evidence of a difference. The frequency of unwanted effects (adverse events or complications) was mostly similar in both groups, but pain intensity and frequency seemed to differ between the groups. There were no intervention‐related mortality or bile leakages. The trial did not provide data on quality of life; cancer mortality, and time to progression of liver metastases. 
Reliability of the evidence 
The evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy versus conventional surgery in people with liver metastases is of low certainty. We are uncertain about our estimate and cannot determine whether cryotherapy compared with conventional surgery is beneficial or harmful. We found no evidence for the benefits or harms of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, or versus systemic treatments. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Freezing Treatment for Cancer That Has Spread to the Liver

## Plain Title
Does freezing cancer cells help people whose cancer has spread to the liver?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
When cancer spreads from where it started to other parts of the body, it often goes to the liver. The liver is a large organ that helps clean your blood. More than half of people with cancer in their liver die from problems caused by the cancer.

**What is the treatment being studied?**
Doctors can use a freezing treatment called cryotherapy. A special needle-like tool is placed near the cancer. This tool makes the area very cold using liquid nitrogen or argon gas. The extreme cold kills the cancer cells and makes the tumor smaller. Doctors use special pictures (ultrasound or CT scans) to guide the tool to the right spot.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors do not know if this freezing treatment helps people live longer. They also do not know if it makes people feel better. This study looked at whether cryotherapy works better than other treatments or causes fewer problems.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a study done in Ukraine. Researchers put 123 people into two groups by chance. One group got cryotherapy (63 people). The other group got regular surgery where doctors cut out the cancer parts of the liver (60 people).

**Who was in the study?**
All people in the study had cancer that had spread to their liver. Most people (66 out of 100) had bowel cancer first. Others had cancer that started in the stomach, breast, skin, or other places.

**How long did the study last?**
Researchers followed people for up to 10 years. The shortest time anyone was followed was five months.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

After 10 years, 81 out of 100 people in the freezing group had died. In the surgery group, 92 out of 100 people had died. This means slightly fewer people died in the freezing group.

The cancer came back in the liver for many people in both groups. In the freezing group, 86 out of 100 people got new cancer. In the surgery group, 95 out of 100 people got new cancer.

**What about side effects?**

Both treatments caused similar problems. Pain was different between the groups. People who got freezing treatment had more mild and medium pain. People who got surgery had more severe pain. But the study did not clearly show if these differences were important.

No one died from the treatment itself. No one had bile leaks (a fluid that helps digest food).

**What was not measured?**

The study did not ask people about their quality of life. It did not report how many people died only from cancer. It did not measure how fast the cancer grew.

**What do these results mean?**

We cannot be sure if freezing treatment is better or worse than surgery. The study had problems with how it was done. This makes the results less reliable. We need better studies to know if freezing treatment really helps.

**What is still unknown?**

We found no studies comparing freezing treatment to no treatment. We found no studies comparing it to cancer drugs. More research is needed to answer these questions.

**Conclusion**

The evidence is weak. We cannot tell if freezing cancer in the liver helps people live longer or feel better compared to surgery. Doctors and patients need more and better studies before knowing if this treatment should be used.",10.1002-14651858.CD009058,"Cryotherapy for liver metastases
Review question 
Is cryotherapy (cooling) beneficial or harmful for local destruction of cancer (tumours) spread to the liver? 
Background 
When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancer affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die from complications. Cryotherapy is one of methods, used to destroy metastases in the liver. This method requires placing a special probe near the cancer site. The probe is used to deliver extreme cold to the site, which is produced by liquid nitrogen or argon gas. Placement of the probe can be guided using ultrasound or computed tomography (a special x‐ray). The rapid freezing process kills the cancer cells, and the size of the cancer is reduced. However, it is not clear if this treatment prolongs life or increases quality of life of affected people. 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of cryotherapy in destroying cancer metastases in the liver. We searched for studies assessing the effect of cryotherapy in comparison with no treatment or any other treatment in people with liver metastases from cancer of any location. We aimed to assess the effect of cryotherapy on the risk of death, quality of life, and adverse events (side effects caused by the treatment). 
Study characteristics 
We last searched for evidence in June 2018. We included only one trial conducted in Ukraine, and participants' primary cancer was colorectal (bowel) cancer in 66% of instances, but there were also people with stomach, breast, skin, and other tumours. All of them had cancer spread to the liver. In this trial, 123 participants were allocated at random to receive either cryotherapy (63 people) or conventional surgery (affected parts of the liver were removed; 60 people). 
Funding 
The trial did not provide information on funding.
Key results 
The trial was at high risk of bias. The participants were followed for up to 10 years (minimum five months). The trial reported that the mortality at 10 years was 81% (51/63) in the cryotherapy group and 92% (55/60) in the conventional surgery group. We judged the evidence as low‐certainty evidence. We found no evidence of a difference in proportion of participants with recurrence of the malignancy in the liver: 86% (54/63) of the participants in the cryotherapy group and 95% (57/60) of the participants in the conventional surgery group developed a new malignancy (low‐certainty evidence). The frequency of reported complications was similar between the cryotherapy group and the conventional surgery group, except for postoperative pain. Both insignificant and pronounced pain were reported to be more common in the cryotherapy group while intense pain was reported to be more common in the conventional surgery group. However, it was not reported whether there was any evidence of a difference. The frequency of unwanted effects (adverse events or complications) was mostly similar in both groups, but pain intensity and frequency seemed to differ between the groups. There were no intervention‐related mortality or bile leakages. The trial did not provide data on quality of life; cancer mortality, and time to progression of liver metastases. 
Reliability of the evidence 
The evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy versus conventional surgery in people with liver metastases is of low certainty. We are uncertain about our estimate and cannot determine whether cryotherapy compared with conventional surgery is beneficial or harmful. We found no evidence for the benefits or harms of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, or versus systemic treatments.

Patients with diabetes frequently use complimentary and alternative medications including Ayurvedic medications and hence it is important to determine their efficacy and safety. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus.
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Library (issue 10, 2011), MEDLINE (until 31 August 2011), EMBASE (until 31 August 2011), AMED (until 14 October 2011), the database of randomised trials from South Asia (until 14 October 2011), the database of the grey literature (OpenSigle, until 14 October 2011) and databases of ongoing trials (until 14 October 2011). In addition we performed hand searches of several journals and reference lists of potentially relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials of at least two months duration of Ayurvedic interventions for diabetes mellitus. Participants of both genders, all ages and any type of diabetes were included irrespective of duration of diabetes, antidiabetic treatment, comorbidity or diabetes related complications. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data. Risk of bias of trials was evaluated as indicated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention. 
Main results
Results of only a limited number of studies could be combined, in view of different types of interventions and variable quality of data. We found six trials of proprietary herbal mixtures and one of whole system Ayurvedic treatment. These studies enrolled 354 participants ( 172 on treatment, 158 on controls, 24 allocation unknown). The treatment duration ranged from 3 to 6 months. All these studies included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
With regard to our primary outcomes, significant reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood sugar (FBS) or both were observed with Diabecon, Inolter and Cogent DB compared to placebo or no additional treatment, while no significant hypoglycaemic response was found with Pancreas tonic and Hyponidd treatment. The study of whole system Ayurvedic treatment did not provide data on HbA1c and FBS values. One study of Pancreas tonic treatment did not detect a significant change in health‐related quality of life. The main adverse effects reported were drug hypersensitivity (one study, one patient in the treatment arm); hypoglycaemic episodes (one study, one participant in the treatment arm; none had severe hypoglycaemia) and gastrointestinal side effects in one study (1 of 20 in the intervention group and 0 of 20 participants in the control group). None of the included studies reported any deaths, renal, hematological or liver toxicity. 
With regard to our secondary outcomes, post prandial blood sugar (PPBS) was lower among participants treated with Diabecon, was unchanged with Hyponidd and was higher in patients treated with Cogent DB. Treatment with Pancreas tonic and Hyponidd did not affect lipid profile significantly, while patients treated with Inolter had significantly higher HDL‐ and lower LDL‐cholesterol as well as lower triglycerides. Cogent DB treated participants also had lower total cholesterol and triglycerides. 
Studies of treatment with Diabecon reported increased fasting insulin levels; one study of treatment with Diabecon reported higher stimulated insulin levels and fasting C‐peptide levels in the treatment group. There was no significant difference in fasting and stimulated C‐peptide and insulin levels with Hyponidd, Cogent DB and Pancreas tonic treatment. The study of Inolter did not assess these outcomes. 
No study reported on or was designed to investigate diabetic complications, death from any cause and economic data. 
Authors' conclusions
Although there were significant glucose‐lowering effects with the use of some herbal mixtures, due to methodological deficiencies and small sample sizes we are unable to draw any definite conclusions regarding their efficacy. Though no significant adverse events were reported, there is insufficient evidence at present to recommend the use of these interventions in routine clinical practice and further studies are needed. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Ayurvedic Treatments for Diabetes

## Plain Title
Do Ayurvedic Medicines Help People with Diabetes Control Their Blood Sugar?

## Rationale

**What is diabetes and why is it a problem?**

Diabetes is a disease where the body cannot control blood sugar levels. High blood sugar can damage many parts of the body over time. People with diabetes need treatment to keep their blood sugar at safe levels.

**Why was this study needed?**

Many people with diabetes use Ayurvedic medicines. Ayurveda is a traditional healing system from India. These medicines use herbs and plants. Many patients take these treatments along with their regular diabetes medicines. Doctors need to know if these Ayurvedic treatments really work. They also need to know if these treatments are safe.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to see if Ayurvedic treatments can lower blood sugar in people with diabetes. They also wanted to check if these treatments cause any harmful side effects.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at many smaller studies done by other scientists. They searched medical databases up to 2011. They looked for studies that tested Ayurvedic treatments in people with diabetes.

**Who was in these studies?**

The researchers found 7 studies with 354 people total. All participants were adults with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. It usually starts in adulthood.

**What treatments were tested?**

Six studies tested herbal mixtures. These had names like Diabecon, Inolter, Cogent DB, Pancreas tonic, and Hyponidd. One study tested a complete Ayurvedic treatment system.

**How long did the studies last?**

People stayed in these studies for 3 to 6 months.

## Results

**What did the studies find about blood sugar?**

Some herbal mixtures helped lower blood sugar. Three treatments (Diabecon, Inolter, and Cogent DB) lowered blood sugar more than fake pills or no extra treatment. Two treatments (Pancreas tonic and Hyponidd) did not lower blood sugar significantly.

Researchers measured blood sugar in two main ways. One test shows average blood sugar over several months. Another test measures blood sugar after not eating overnight. Some treatments helped with these measurements. Others did not.

**What about other health measures?**

Some treatments affected cholesterol levels. Cholesterol is a fat in the blood. Inolter raised good cholesterol and lowered bad cholesterol. It also lowered triglycerides, another type of fat. Cogent DB lowered total cholesterol and triglycerides.

Some treatments affected insulin levels. Insulin is a hormone that controls blood sugar. Diabecon increased insulin levels in the blood.

**Were there any side effects?**

Most treatments seemed safe. Very few people had problems. One person had an allergic reaction. One person had low blood sugar. One person had stomach problems. No one died. The treatments did not harm the kidneys, blood, or liver.

**What problems did the studies have?**

The studies had several weaknesses. Most studies were small with few people. Some studies were not well designed. Different studies tested different treatments. This made it hard to compare results. No studies looked at long-term problems from diabetes. No studies reported costs.

**What do the results mean?**

Some Ayurvedic herbal mixtures may help lower blood sugar. However, the studies were too small and had too many problems. Doctors cannot say for sure if these treatments really work. The treatments seemed fairly safe in these short studies. But researchers need more information.

**What should happen next?**

Larger and better studies are needed. These studies should follow people for longer times. They should use better methods. Until then, doctors cannot recommend these Ayurvedic treatments as regular diabetes care. People with diabetes should talk to their doctor before using any Ayurvedic medicines.",10.1002-14651858.CD008288,"Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus:
People with diabetes and other chronic diseases often use complementary and alternative medicines. This review examines the efficacy and safety of the use of various Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus. We found seven trials which included 354 participants (172 on treatment, 158 on control, 24 could not be classified). All these studies included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Six studies tested five different types of herbal mixtures (proprietary drugs) and only one tested 'whole system' Ayurvedic treatment. The duration of treatment ranged from three to six months. One study each of Diabecon, Inolter and Cogent DB (proprietary herbal mixtures) found significantly lower glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) levels at the end of the treatment period compared to controls. Two studies of Diabecon, and one study of Cogent DB (proprietary herbal mixtures) found significantly lower fasting blood sugar levels at the end of the study period in the treatment group. No deaths were observed in these trials and side effects did not differ significantly between intervention and control groups. One study of Pancreas tonic reported no significant change in health‐related quality of life. No study reported on or was designed to investigate diabetic complications, death from any cause and costs. Despite positive results in some studies, and absence of serious side effects, firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to weak methods and small number of participants in the evaluated studies. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of these treatments. Ayurvedic physicians generally use a mixture of various herbs or proprietary preparations along with diet, exercise and mode of living. The treatments are usually individualised taking into account the balance of three 'doshas'. It is possible that the interventions in the trials analysed have not replicated actual Ayurvedic practice but only assessed some components individually.

Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is the third leading cause of neonatal mortality globally constituting 13% of overall neonatal mortality. Despite the high burden of neonatal sepsis, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. Possibly due to the diagnostic challenges of sepsis and the relative immunosuppression of the newborn, many neonates receive antibiotics for suspected sepsis. Antibiotics have become the most used therapeutics in neonatal intensive care units. The last Cochrane Review was updated in 2004. Given the clinical importance, an updated systematic review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis is needed. 
Objectives
To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase Ovid; CINAHL; LILACS; Science Citation Index EXPANDED and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science on 12 March 2021. We searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis. We included participants from birth to 72 hours of life at randomisation. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcome was all‐cause mortality, and our secondary outcomes were: serious adverse events, respiratory support, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, necrotising enterocolitis, and ototoxicity. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow‐up. 
Main results
We included five RCTs (865 participants). All trials were at high risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence according to GRADE was very low. The included trials assessed five different comparisons of antibiotics. 
We did not conduct any meta‐analyses due to lack of relevant data.
Of the five included trials one trial compared ampicillin plus gentamicin with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin plus tazobactam with amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with piperacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin with ampicillin plus amikacin; and one trial compared ceftazidime with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin. 
None of the five comparisons found any evidence of a difference when assessing all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, or necrotising enterocolitis; however, none of the trials were near an information size that could contribute significantly to the evidence of the comparative benefits and risks of any particular antibiotic regimen. 
None of the trials assessed respiratory support or ototoxicity.
The benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the lack of well‐powered trials and the high risk of systematic errors. 
Authors' conclusions
Current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. Large RCTs assessing different antibiotic regimens in early‐onset neonatal sepsis with low risk of bias are warranted. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Antibiotics for Newborn Infections

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Antibiotic Treatments for Infections in Newborn Babies

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Newborn babies can get serious infections called sepsis. Sepsis happens when germs get into a baby's blood. This makes babies very sick. Sepsis is one of the top three reasons newborn babies die around the world. It causes 13 out of every 100 newborn deaths.

**Why is this a problem?**

Newborn babies have weak immune systems. Their bodies cannot fight germs as well as older children or adults. This makes it hard for doctors to know if a baby has sepsis. Because of this, many babies get antibiotics even when doctors are not sure they have an infection. Antibiotics are now the most common medicine given to sick newborns in hospitals.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need to know which antibiotics work best for newborn sepsis. The last major review of this topic was done in 2004. That was almost 20 years ago. Doctors need updated information to help them choose the best treatment for sick babies.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to find out which antibiotic treatments work best. They wanted to know which antibiotics help babies survive. They also wanted to know which antibiotics cause the fewest side effects.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a systematic review. Researchers looked at studies that other scientists had already done. They searched medical databases up to March 2021. They looked for studies that compared different antibiotic treatments.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included newborn babies who were 72 hours old or younger. These babies had infections that started very early in life. The researchers found five studies with 865 babies total.

**What treatments were compared?**

The five studies looked at different combinations of antibiotics:
- One study compared ampicillin plus gentamicin with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin
- One study compared piperacillin plus tazobactam with amikacin
- One study compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with piperacillin plus gentamicin
- One study compared piperacillin with ampicillin plus amikacin
- One study compared ceftazidime with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin

**How long did the studies last?**

The review looked at results for as long as each study followed the babies.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not find clear proof that any antibiotic treatment works better than another. None of the five studies showed that one antibiotic combination was better at:
- Keeping babies alive
- Preventing serious side effects
- Preventing heart problems
- Preventing kidney damage
- Preventing brain development problems
- Preventing gut problems

**What were the problems with the studies?**

All five studies had serious problems with how they were done. The studies were too small. They did not include enough babies to give clear answers. The studies also had a high risk of errors in how they were set up and run.

The studies did not look at some important questions. None checked if antibiotics affected breathing support needs. None checked if antibiotics caused hearing problems.

**What do the results mean?**

Doctors still do not know which antibiotic treatment is best for newborn sepsis. The evidence is not strong enough to recommend one treatment over another.

**What happens next?**

Researchers need to do larger, better studies. These new studies need to include more babies. They need to be designed more carefully to avoid errors. Only then will doctors know which antibiotics work best and are safest for newborn babies with sepsis.

**Conclusion**

Right now, there is not enough good evidence to say which antibiotic treatment is best for newborn infections. More research is urgently needed to help doctors make better treatment choices for sick babies.",10.1002-14651858.CD013837,"Antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis
Review question 
We reviewed available evidence on different antibiotic regimens for newborns (from birth to 72 hours of life), with early‐onset sepsis (as defined by trialists). 
Background 
Sepsis in newborns is a severe and potential lethal condition, caused by the body's response to an infection. Neonatal sepsis is the third leading cause of neonatal death globally. Despite the high burden of sepsis in newborns, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. This Cochrane Review was originally published in 2004. To identify the most appropriate antibiotic policies for neonatal sepsis, there is a need to base these policies on an updated well‐conducted review. Given the clinical importance, such a review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis is needed. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to August 2020. We included five trials randomising 865 participants. The included trials compared five different antibiotic regimens. 
Key results 
We included five trials: one trial compared ampicillin plus gentamicin with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin plus tazobactam with amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with piperacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin with ampicillin plus amikacin; and one trial compared ceftazidime with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin. 
None of the five comparisons showed any difference when assessing death from all causes, serious adverse events (i.e. major complications), respiratory support, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity (toxicity in the kidneys), neurological developmental impairment (disabilities in the functioning of the brain that affect a child's behaviour, memory, or ability to learn), necrotising enterocolitis (tissues in the gut become inflamed and start to die), or ototoxicity (toxic to the ear). Current evidence cannot confirm or reject one antibiotic regimen being superior to another. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence behind our conclusions is very‐low quality. The five trials had high risk of bias (i.e. the trials were conducted in a way that may have skewed results to the positive side). In addition, the five trials included few participants, making the results of this review imprecise.

Typical and atypical antipsychotics are widely used to treat agitation and psychosis in dementia. However, whether or not they are beneficial is uncertain. Some trials have yielded negative results and effectiveness may be outweighed by harms. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics for the treatment of agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid Sp), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 7 January 2021. Two review authors independently screened the title and abstract of the hits, and two review authors assessed the full text of studies that got through this screening. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐arm trials comparing the effects of antipsychotics and placebo for the treatment of agitation or psychosis in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, or both, irrespective of age, severity of cognitive impairment, and setting. (The majority of) participants had to have clinically significant agitation (including aggression) or psychosis or both at baseline. We excluded studies about antipsychotics that are no longer available in the USA or EU, or that are used for emergency short‐term sedation. We also excluded head‐to‐head trials and antipsychotic withdrawal trials. 
Data collection and analysis
The primary outcomes were (1) reduction in agitation or psychosis in participants with agitation or psychosis, respectively at baseline, and (2) the number of participants with adverse events: somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, any adverse event, any serious adverse event (SAE), and death. 
Two review authors independently extracted the necessary data and assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated the pooled effect on agitation and psychosis for typical and atypical antipsychotics separately, and the pooled risk of adverse effects independent of the target symptom (agitation or psychosis). We used RevMan Web for the analyses. 
Main results
The search yielded 8233 separate hits. After assessing the full‐text of 35 studies, we included 24 trials that met the eligibility criteria. Six trials tested a typical antipsychotic, four for agitation and two for psychosis. Twenty trials tested an atypical antipsychotic, eight for agitation and 12 for psychosis. Two trials tested both drug types. Seventeen of 26 comparisons were performed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease specifically. The other nine comparisons also included patients with vascular dementia or mixed dementia. Together, the studies included 6090 participants (12 to 652 per study). The trials were performed in institutionalised, hospitalised and community‐dwelling patients, or a combination of those. 
For typical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, thiothixene), we are uncertain whether these drugs improve agitation compared with placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.57 to ‐0.15, 4 studies, n = 361); very low‐certainty evidence, but typical antipsychotics may improve psychosis slightly (SMD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.55 to ‐0.03, 2studies, n= 240; low‐certainty evidence) compared with placebo. These drugs probably increase the risk of somnolence (risk ratio (RR) 2.62, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.56, 3 studies, n = 466; moderate‐certainty evidence) and increase extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.23, 3 studies, n = 467; high‐certainty) evidence. There was no evidence regarding the risk of any adverse event. The risks of SAEs (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.66, 1 study, n = 193) and death (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.00, 6 studies, n = 578) may be increased slightly, but these estimates were very imprecise, and the certainty was low. The effect estimates for haloperidol from five trials were in line with those of the drug class. 
Atypical antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) probably reduce agitation slightly (SMD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.30 to ‐0.12, 7 studies, n = 1971; moderate‐certainty evidence), but probably have a negligible effect on psychosis (SMD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.18 to ‐0.03, 12 studies, n = 3364; moderate‐certainty evidence). These drugs increase the risk of somnolence (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.39, 13 studies, n ‐ 3878; high‐certainty evidence) and are probably also associated with slightly increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.68, 15 studies, n = 4180; moderate‐certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.61, 15 studies, n= 4316; moderate‐certainty evidence) and death (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.05, 17 studies, n= 5032; moderate‐certainty evidence), although the latter estimate was imprecise. The drugs probably have a negligible effect on the risk of any adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09, 11 studies, n = 2785; moderate‐certainty evidence). The findings from seven trials for risperidone were in line with those for the drug class. 
Authors' conclusions
There is some evidence that typical antipsychotics might decrease agitation and psychosis slightly in patients with dementia. Atypical antipsychotics reduce agitation in dementia slightly, but their effect on psychosis in dementia is negligible. The apparent effectiveness of the drugs seen in daily practice may be explained by a favourable natural course of the symptoms, as observed in the placebo groups. Both drug classes increase the risk of somnolence and other adverse events. If antipsychotics are considered for sedation in patients with severe and dangerous symptoms, this should be discussed openly with the patient and legal representative. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Antipsychotic Medicines for Agitation and Psychosis in People with Dementia

## Plain Title

Do antipsychotic drugs help people with dementia who have agitation or psychosis?

## Rationale

**What is dementia and why is this important?**

Dementia is a brain disease that gets worse over time. It affects memory and thinking. Many people with dementia also have other problems. Some become very agitated. This means they may feel restless, upset, or angry. They may pace, shout, or act aggressively. Others have psychosis. This means they see or hear things that are not real. Or they believe things that are not true.

These problems are very hard for patients and their families. They can make daily life difficult and unsafe.

**What are antipsychotic drugs?**

Doctors often give antipsychotic drugs to treat these problems. There are two types: typical and atypical antipsychotics. Typical drugs are older. Atypical drugs are newer.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors are not sure if these drugs really help. Some studies show they do not work well. The drugs may also cause harm. This study looked at all the research to find out if the benefits are greater than the risks.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was not a single study. The researchers looked at many studies done by other scientists. They searched medical databases for all studies that tested antipsychotic drugs in people with dementia.

They only included certain types of studies. The studies had to compare an antipsychotic drug to a placebo. A placebo is a fake pill with no medicine in it. The studies had to be randomized. This means patients were put into groups by chance. This makes the test fair.

**Who was in these studies?**

The researchers found 24 studies that met their rules. These studies included 6,090 people total. Each study had between 12 and 652 people.

Most people in the studies had Alzheimer's disease. This is the most common type of dementia. Some people had vascular dementia. This type is caused by problems with blood flow to the brain.

All the people had agitation or psychosis at the start of the studies. Some lived in nursing homes. Some lived at home. Some were in hospitals.

**What drugs were tested?**

Six studies tested typical antipsychotics like haloperidol. Twenty studies tested atypical antipsychotics like risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, and quetiapine.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**For typical antipsychotics:**

The researchers are not sure if these drugs help with agitation. The evidence was very weak. These drugs may help psychosis a little bit. But they probably cause drowsiness. They increase movement problems like stiffness and shaking. They may slightly increase the risk of serious side effects and death. But the researchers could not be certain about this.

**For atypical antipsychotics:**

These drugs probably reduce agitation a little bit. But they have almost no effect on psychosis. They increase drowsiness. They probably also increase movement problems, serious side effects, and death. However, they have little effect on the overall risk of any side effect.

**What does this mean?**

In daily practice, doctors may think these drugs work better than they actually do. This is because agitation and psychosis often get better on their own over time. This happened even in patients who took the placebo.

Both types of drugs cause side effects. The side effects include drowsiness and movement problems. There may be more serious risks too.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

Antipsychotic drugs may help agitation and psychosis slightly in some people with dementia. But the benefits are small. The drugs also cause harm.

If a doctor thinks about using these drugs for severe and dangerous symptoms, they should talk openly with the patient and family. They should discuss both the possible benefits and the risks. This helps everyone make the best choice together.",10.1002-14651858.CD013304,"Do antipsychotic medicines reduce  agitated behaviour and psychotic symptoms in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia? 
 
Key messages 
It is uncertain whether older, first‐generation or ‘typical’ antipsychotic medicines such as haloperidol have an effect on agitated behaviour (for example, restlessness and aggression); the effect is moderate at best. Typical antipsychotic medicines may decrease delusions and hallucinations slightly in people with dementia.  
Newer, second‐generation ‘atypical’ antipsychotic medicines, such as risperidone, probably reduce agitated behaviour slightly. Atypical antipsychotic medicines probably have no effect on psychotic symptoms.  
Both first‐ and second‐generation antipsychotic medicines increase the risk of drowsiness and other unwanted events. When patients’ symptoms improve after antipsychotics have been prescribed, this is probably largely due to natural improvement in symptoms over time. 
What are antipsychotic medicines? 
Antipsychotics are medicines prescribed to treat psychotic symptoms and severely disturbed behaviour in some mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and severe depression. Psychotic symptoms are delusions (very strongly held beliefs in something which is not true) and hallucinations (sensing – usually seeing or hearing ‐ things which are not really there). 
Antipsychotic medicines are often divided into two groups:
1. first‐generation (older) or ‘typical’ antipsychotics, for example haloperidol;
2. second‐generation (newer) or ‘atypical’ antipsychotics, for example risperidone.
Both types can cause unwanted effects, such as drowsiness, movement disorders (for example, involuntary or uncontrollable movements, tremors, muscle contractions) and weight gain. 
Why do people with dementia need antipsychotics? 
People with dementia quite often experience hallucinations and delusions during their illness for some time. Particularly in the later stages of the illness, they may also show agitated behaviours such as restlessness, shouting out or aggression towards others. It is important to try to understand what is driving these behaviours and there are many ways to manage them which do not involve drugs. However, antipsychotic medicines have often been prescribed to people with dementia for these problems. In many countries, they are prescribed less often than in the past but are still used when the symptoms are severe. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know how well antipsychotic medicines reduce the severity of agitation and psychotic symptoms in people with the two commonest types of dementia, namely dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. We also wanted to know how many people experienced unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated antipsychotic medicines currently available in the USA or European Union by comparing them with placebo (a ’dummy’ pill), for treatment of persistent agitation or psychotic symptoms. People in the studies had to have Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. They could be any age and reside in a care home, a hospital, or the community. Most of the people in the studies had to be experiencing agitation (including aggression) or psychotic symptoms, or both, at the start of the study. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 24 studies with a total of 6090 people:
‐ six studies tested typical antipsychotics, mostly haloperidol; 
‐ 20 studies tested atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole; and  
‐ two studies tested both typical and atypical antipsychotics.
All the studies compared antipsychotics with placebo. The people were living in institutions, hospitals, the community, or a combination of these settings. 
Main results 
Typical antipsychotics (haloperidol, thiothixene) compared with placebo:
‐ may improve symptoms of psychosis slightly (2 studies, 240 people), but we are uncertain about their effect on agitation (4 studies, 361 people);  
‐ probably increase the risk of drowsiness (3 studies, 466 people), and movement disorders (3 studies, 467 people);  
‐ may slightly increase the risk of serious unwanted effects (1 study, 193 people) and of death (6 studies, 578 people).  
There was no evidence about the risk of non‐serious and serious unwanted effects combined.
Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) compared with placebo: 
‐ probably slightly reduce agitation (7 studies, 1971 people) and may slightly reduce aggression (1 study, 301 people), but probably make no important difference to symptoms of psychosis (12 studies, 3364 people); 
‐ increase the risk of drowsiness (13 studies, 2878 people) and probably slightly increase movement disorders (15 studies, 4180 people); 
‐ probably slightly increase the risk of experiencing any non‐serious or serious unwanted effect combined, the risk of serious unwanted effects, and the risk of death (17 studies, 5032 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Overall, our confidence in the evidence about typical antipsychotics is limited and our confidence in the evidence about atypical antipsychotics moderate. Typical antipsychotics have been investigated in just a few studies. In addition, the studies about typical and atypical antipsychotics did not always use the best methods to carry out their investigations, or did not report the results. Consequently, the effects on agitation or psychosis may have been overestimated, and the effects on adverse events underestimated. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 7 January 2021.

It is common for people not to take antidepressant medication as prescribed, with around 50% of people likely to prematurely discontinue taking their medication after six months. Community pharmacists may be well placed to have a role in antidepressant management because of their unique pharmacotherapeutic knowledge and ease of access for people. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to offer proactive interventions to people with depression or depressive symptoms. However, the effectiveness and acceptability of existing pharmacist‐based interventions is not yet well understood. The degree to which a pharmacy‐based management approach might be beneficial, acceptable to people, and effective as part of the overall management for those with depression is, to date, unclear. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) will help answer these questions and add important knowledge to the currently sparse evidence base. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of pharmacy‐based management interventions compared with active control (e.g. patient information materials or any other active intervention delivered by someone other than the pharmacist or the pharmacy team), waiting list, or treatment as usual (e.g. standard pharmacist advice or antidepressant education, signposting to support available in primary care services, brief medication counselling, and/or (self‐)monitoring of medication adherence offered by a healthcare professional outside the pharmacy team) at improving depression outcomes in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD‐CTR) to June 2016; the Cochrane Library (Issue 11, 2018); and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to December 2018. We searched theses and dissertation databases and international trial registers for unpublished/ongoing trials. We applied no restrictions on date, language, or publication status to the searches.  
Selection criteria
We included all RCTs and cluster‐RCTs where a pharmacy‐based intervention was compared with treatment as usual, waiting list, or an alternative intervention in the management of depression in adults over 16 years of age. Eligible studies had to report at least one of the following outcomes at any time point: depression symptom change, acceptability of the intervention, diagnosis of depression, non‐adherence to medication, frequency of primary care appointments, quality of life, social functioning, or adverse events.  
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently, and in duplicate, conducted all stages of study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment (including GRADE). We discussed disagreements within the team until we reached consensus. Where data did not allow meta‐analyses, we synthesised results narratively.  
Main results
Twelve studies (2215 participants) met the inclusion criteria and compared pharmacy‐based management with treatment as usual. Two studies (291 participants) also included an active control (both used patient information leaflets providing information about the prescribed antidepressant). Neither of these studies reported depression symptom change. A narrative synthesis of results on acceptability of the intervention was inconclusive, with one study reporting better acceptability of pharmacy‐based management and the other better acceptability of the active control. One study reported that participants in the pharmacy‐based management group had better medication adherence than the control participants. One study reported adverse events with no difference between groups. The studies reported no other outcomes. 
Meta‐analyses comparing pharmacy‐based management with treatment as usual showed no evidence of a difference in the effect of the intervention on depression symptom change (dichotomous data; improvement in symptoms yes/no: risk ratio (RR), 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 4 RCTs, 475 participants; moderate‐quality evidence; continuous data: standard mean difference (SMD) ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.10; 5 RCTs, 718 participants; high‐certainty evidence), or acceptability of the intervention (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.45; 12 RCTs, 2072 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The risk of non‐adherence was reduced in participants receiving pharmacy‐based management (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87; 6 RCTs, 911 participants; high‐certainty evidence). We were unable to meta‐analyse data on diagnosis of depression, frequency of primary care appointments, quality of life, or social functioning. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence of a difference between pharmacy‐based management for depression in adults compared with treatment as usual in facilitating depression symptom change. Based on numbers of participants leaving the trials early, there may be no difference in acceptability between pharmacy‐based management and controls. However, there was uncertainty due to the low‐certainty evidence. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Can Pharmacists Help People Taking Medicine for Depression?

## Plain Title
Can pharmacists help adults who take medicine for depression feel better and keep taking their medicine?

## Rationale

**What is depression and why is it a problem?**

Depression is a common mental health problem. It can make people feel very sad and tired. It can make daily life very hard.

Doctors often give medicine called antidepressants to help treat depression. These medicines can help people feel better. But there is a problem. About half of all people stop taking their antidepressant medicine too early. They stop within six months. When people stop too soon, the medicine cannot work well.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Pharmacists are the people who give out medicine at the pharmacy. They know a lot about medicines. People can visit them easily without an appointment.

Researchers wanted to know if pharmacists could help people with depression. Could pharmacists help people keep taking their medicine? Could they help people feel better?

**What did researchers want to find out?**

The researchers looked at studies to answer these questions:
- Do people feel less depressed when pharmacists help them?
- Do people like getting help from pharmacists?
- Do people keep taking their medicine when pharmacists help them?

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this question?**

The researchers looked for all studies that tested pharmacy help for depression. They searched many databases. They looked at studies published up to December 2018.

They found 12 studies. These studies included 2,215 adults. All the people in the studies were over 16 years old. All had depression or felt depressed.

**What did the studies compare?**

Most studies compared two groups:
- One group got special help from pharmacists
- One group got usual care (normal help from doctors and pharmacists)

Two studies also had a third group. This group got information leaflets about their medicine.

**What did pharmacists do to help?**

Pharmacists talked with people about their medicine. They checked if people were taking their medicine correctly. They answered questions. They gave advice and support.

**How long were people in the studies?**

Different studies lasted different amounts of time. The text does not give exact times for all studies.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers combined results from all the studies. Here is what they found:

**Did people feel less depressed?**

No difference was found. People who got help from pharmacists did not feel better than people who got usual care. Both groups had similar depression symptoms.

**Did people like the pharmacy help?**

The results were mixed. About the same number of people left both groups early. This suggests people found both types of care acceptable. But the researchers were not completely sure about this finding.

**Did people keep taking their medicine?**

Yes, this showed good results. People who got help from pharmacists were more likely to keep taking their medicine. They did not stop their medicine as often as people in the usual care group.

**Other findings**

The researchers could not combine results for some other questions. Not enough studies measured things like:
- Quality of life
- How well people functioned in daily life
- How often people visited their doctor

**What do these results mean?**

Pharmacy help did not make people feel less depressed compared to usual care. But it did help people keep taking their medicine as prescribed.

The researchers say we need more studies. We need to better understand if and how pharmacists can help people with depression.

**Strength of the evidence**

The evidence about depression symptoms was strong. The evidence about people liking the pharmacy help was moderate. The evidence about people taking their medicine was strong.",10.1002-14651858.CD013299,"Pharmacies might be able to support people with their depression medicines
Background 
Some people with depression find it difficult to take their depression medicines (often called 'antidepressants') as prescribed by their doctor. This can mean that the medicines do not work properly and people might not get better or might even get worse. It could be that pharmacists and their teams can help people with their depression treatment in ways that their family doctor (general practitioner (GP)) cannot. Pharmacies are based within the community, easier to get to, and people may feel more comfortable telling a pharmacist about their mood. However, there are not many studies to tell us if this works. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases for well‐designed studies that compared a group of adults with depression who received additional help with their depression medicines from their pharmacy with a group of adults with depression who received their treatment as usual. 
The evidence is current to 14 December 2018.
Key results and certainty of the evidence 
We found 12 studies with over 2000 adults taking part. They compared pharmacy‐based support with treatment as usual, for example, basic information about their medicines or signposting to other services only. We found that additional support given by the pharmacist was no better at reducing people's depression than their treatment as usual. The studies also showed that people may have liked both approaches the same, although we are uncertain about the results as the evidence was of low certainty. 
The studies did show that people who received support from their pharmacy were more likely to take their antidepressants as prescribed. We were not able to combine information from the included studies on other outcomes we were interested in (diagnosis of depression, frequency of healthcare appointments, quality of life, social functioning, or side effects). 
We found no difference in effectiveness when people with depression received additional support from a pharmacist compared with treatment as usual.

Remdesivir is an antiviral medicine with properties to inhibit viral replication of SARS‐CoV‐2. Positive results from early studies attracted media attention and led to emergency use authorisation of remdesivir in COVID‐19.  A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effects of remdesivir as a treatment for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is required. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of remdesivir compared to placebo or standard care alone on clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (which comprises the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv) as well as Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index) and WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions. We conducted the searches on 16 April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
We included RCTs evaluating remdesivir for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in hospitalised adults compared to placebo or standard care alone irrespective of disease severity, gender, ethnicity, or setting.  
We excluded studies that evaluated remdesivir for the treatment of other coronavirus diseases. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
To assess risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for outcomes that were reported according to our prioritised categories: all‐cause mortality at up to day 28, duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation, duration to liberation from supplemental oxygen, new need for mechanical ventilation (high‐flow oxygen, non‐invasive, or invasive mechanical ventilation), new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, new need for non‐invasive mechanical ventilation or high‐flow oxygen, new need for oxygen by mask or nasal prongs, quality of life, serious adverse events, and adverse events (any grade). 
Main results
We included five RCTs with 7452 participants diagnosed with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and a mean age of 59 years, of whom 3886 participants were randomised to receive remdesivir. Most participants required low‐flow oxygen (n=4409) or mechanical ventilation (n=1025) at baseline. Studies were mainly conducted in high‐ and upper‐middle‐income countries. We identified two ongoing studies, one was suspended due to a lack of COVID‐19 patients to recruit. 
Risk of bias assessments were considered to be some concerns or high risk for clinical status and safety outcomes because participants who had died did not contribute information to these outcomes. Without adjustment, this leads to an uncertain amount of missing values and the potential for bias due to missing data. 
Effects of remdesivir in hospitalised individuals  
Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to all‐cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.06; risk difference (RD) 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 21 fewer to 7 more; 4 studies, 7142 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  There was limited evidence for a beneficial effect of remdesivir on mortality in a subset of 435 participants who received low flow oxygen at baseline in one study (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.66). We could not confirm this finding due to restricted availability of relevant subgroup data from other studies. 
Remdesivir may have little or no effect on the duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1298 participants, data not pooled, low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether remdesivir increases or decreases the chance of clinical improvement in terms of duration to liberation from supplemental oxygen at up to day 28 (3 studies, 1691 participants, data not pooled, very low‐certainty evidence).   
We are very uncertain whether remdesivir decreases or increases the risk of clinical worsening in terms of new need for mechanical ventilation at up to day 28 (high‐flow oxygen or non‐invasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation) (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.24; RD 29 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 68 fewer to 32 more; 3 studies, 6696 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); new need for non‐invasive mechanical ventilation or high‐flow oxygen (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.98; RD 72 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 118 fewer to 5 fewer; 1 study, 573 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and new need for oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.22; RD 84 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 204 fewer to 98 more; 1 study, 138 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Remdesivir may decrease the risk of clinical worsening in terms of new need for invasive mechanical ventilation (67 fewer participants amongst 1000 participants; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.77; 2 studies, 1159 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
None of the included studies reported quality of life.
Remdesivir probably decreases the serious adverse events rate at up to 28 days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.90; RD 63 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 94 fewer to 25 fewer; 3 studies, 1674 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether remdesivir increases or decreases adverse events rate (any grade) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; RD 29 more per 1000, 95% CI 82 fewer to 158 more; 3 studies, 1674 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the currently available evidence remdesivir probably has little or no effect on all‐cause mortality at up to 28 days in hospitalised adults with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We are uncertain about the effects of remdesivir on clinical improvement and worsening. There were insufficient data available to examine the effect of remdesivir on mortality across subgroups defined by respiratory support at baseline.  
Future studies should provide additional data on efficacy and safety of remdesivir for defined core outcomes in COVID‐19 research, especially for different population subgroups. This could allow us to draw more reliable conclusions on the potential benefits and harms of remdesivir in future updates of this review. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Does Remdesivir Help Treat Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients?

## Plain Title

Does the antiviral drug remdesivir help people in the hospital with COVID-19?

## Rationale

**What is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?**

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Many people with COVID-19 get very sick and need to stay in the hospital. Some need help breathing with oxygen or machines. COVID-19 can cause death. Doctors need good treatments to help these patients.

**What is remdesivir?**

Remdesivir is a medicine that fights viruses. It works by stopping viruses from making copies of themselves. Early studies of remdesivir got a lot of attention in the news. Because of these early results, some countries allowed doctors to use remdesivir for COVID-19 patients before all the research was complete.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors needed to know if remdesivir really helps COVID-19 patients. The researchers wanted to look at all the best quality studies done so far. They wanted to find out if remdesivir helps patients get better, stay alive, and avoid serious problems.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single new study. Instead, researchers collected and reviewed results from multiple high-quality studies. They only included studies that:
- Tested remdesivir in adults in the hospital with COVID-19
- Compared remdesivir to fake medicine or standard care
- Assigned patients to treatment groups by chance

**Who was in these studies?**

The researchers found 5 studies with 7,452 patients total. About 3,886 patients received remdesivir. The average age was 59 years. Most patients needed some oxygen help when they started treatment. Some needed breathing machines. The studies took place mostly in wealthy countries.

**How long did the studies last?**

The researchers looked at results up to 28 days after treatment started.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**Death rates:** Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference in how many patients die within 28 days. For every 1,000 patients treated, remdesivir might prevent 8 deaths, but it might also make no difference at all. One study found remdesivir might help patients who only needed low amounts of oxygen. But there was not enough information from other studies to confirm this finding.

**Breathing support:** The researchers could not tell for sure if remdesivir helps patients get off breathing machines faster. They also could not tell if it helps patients stop needing oxygen sooner. Remdesivir may reduce the need for breathing machines in some patients. For every 1,000 patients, remdesivir might prevent 67 patients from needing a breathing machine.

**Side effects:** Remdesivir probably reduces serious side effects. For every 1,000 patients treated, 63 fewer patients had serious side effects. The researchers could not tell if remdesivir causes more or fewer minor side effects overall.

**Quality of life:** None of the studies measured how patients felt about their quality of life.

**How certain are these results?**

The researchers rated their confidence in these results. They were moderately confident about the death rates and serious side effects. They were less confident about other results because the studies had some problems with how they were done.

**What do these results mean?**

Based on current evidence, remdesivir probably does not greatly reduce deaths in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It may help some patients avoid needing breathing machines. It probably reduces serious side effects. However, more research is needed to understand which patients might benefit most from remdesivir.

**What happens next?**

The researchers will keep updating this review as new studies are completed. Future studies should look at how remdesivir works for different groups of patients.",10.1002-14651858.CD014962,"Remdesivir to treat people with COVID‐19
Is remdesivir (an antiviral medicine) an effective treatment for COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
• For adults hospitalised with COVID‐19, remdesivir probably has little or no effect on deaths from any cause up to 28 days after treatment compared with placebo (sham treatment) or usual care.  
• We are uncertain whether remdesivir improves or worsens patients’ condition, based on whether they needed more or less help with breathing. 
• Researchers should agree on key outcomes to be used in COVID‐19 research, and future studies should investigate these areas. This would allow future updates of this review to draw more certain conclusions about the use of remdesivir to treat COVID‐19. 
What is remdesivir? 
Remdesivir is a medicine that fights viruses. It has been shown to prevent the virus that causes COVID‐19 (SARS‐CoV‐2) from reproducing. Medical regulators have approved remdesivir for emergency use to treat people with COVID‐19.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if remdesivir is an effective treatment for people in hospital with COVID‐19 and if it causes unwanted effects compared to placebo or usual care. 
People with COVID‐19 are given different kinds of breathing support, depending on how severe their breathing difficulties are. We used the types of breathing support people received as a measure of the success of remdesivir in treating COVID‐19. Types of breathing support included: 
• for severe breathing difficulties: invasive mechanical ventilation, when a breathing tube is put into patients’ lungs, and a machine (ventilator) breathes for them. Patients are given medicine to make them sedated whilst they are on a ventilator. 
• for moderate to severe breathing difficulties: non‐invasive mechanical ventilation through a mask over the nose and/or mouth, or a helmet. Air or oxygen is pushed through the mask. Patients are generally awake for this treatment. 
• for moderate breathing difficulties: oxygen via a mask or prongs that sit in the nostrils. Patients can still breathe room air. 
We were interested in the following outcomes:
• deaths from any cause in the 28 days after treatment;
• whether patients got better after treatment, measured by how long they spent on mechanical ventilation or oxygen; 
• whether patients’ condition worsened so that they needed oxygen or mechanical ventilation;
• quality of life;
• any unwanted effects; and 
• serious unwanted effects.
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that investigated remdesivir to treat adults with COVID‐19 compared to placebo or standard care. Patients were hospitalised with COVID‐19 and could be of any gender or ethnicity.   
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 5 studies with 7452 people hospitalised with COVID‐19. Of these, 3886 people were given remdesivir. The average age of patients was 59 years. Studies took place around the world, mainly in high‐ and upper‐middle‐income countries.  
Main results  
The included studies compared remdesivir to placebo or usual care in people hospitalised with COVID‐19 for up to 28 days. 
Deaths from any cause 
• Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to deaths from any cause (4 studies, 7142 people). In 1000 people, 8 fewer die with remdesivir compared to placebo or standard care. 
Did patients get better with remdesivir? 
• Remdesivir may have little or no effect on the length of time patients spent on invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1298 people).  
• We do not know whether remdesivir increases or decreases time on supplemental oxygen (3 studies, 1691 people). 
Did patients get worse with remdesivir? 
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need any mechanical ventilation (invasive or non‐invasive) with remdesivir (3 studies, 6696 people). 
• Patients may be less likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1159 people). 
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need non‐invasive mechanical ventilation (1 study, 573 people).  
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (1 study, 138 people). 
Quality of life 
• None of the included studies reported quality of life.
Unwanted effects 
• We do not know whether remdesivir leads to more or fewer unwanted effects of any level (3 studies, 1674 people).  
• Patients are probably less likely to experience serious unwanted effects with remdesivir than with placebo or standard care (3 studies, 1674 people). In 1000 people, 63 fewer would experience a serious unwanted effect compared to placebo or standard care. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are moderately confident in the evidence for deaths from any cause and serious unwanted effects; however, our confidence in the other evidence is limited because studies used different methods to measure and record their results, and we did not find many studies for some of our outcomes of interest.  
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is current to 16 April 2021.

165,10.1002-14651858.CD013488.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, life‐limiting, multisystem disease affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF suffer with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which if left untreated, leads to a poor nutritional status. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has been shown to be effective in improving nutritional status and subsequently associated with improved lung function. However, the timings of PERT administration in relation to a meal are subjective and not standardised, meaning that variations in the timing of PERT dosing persist. 
Objectives
The primary objective of the review is to compare the efficacy (fat absorption) and effectiveness (nutritional status, lung function and quality of life) of different PERT dosing strategies in terms of timing of administration for treating dietary malabsorption in all individuals with CF. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
Date of last search: 24 June 2021.
We also searched ongoing trials registers on 09 July 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over RCTs with a minimum washout period of two weeks, and quasi‐RCTs of PERT dosing regimens in people (of any age) with CF. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed and screened the studies identified from the searches. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for our pre‐specified critical outcomes, but we did not identify any eligible studies. 
Main results
No studies met the eligibility criteria and therefore we did not include any in this review. The excluded studies were either cross‐over in design (but lacking a sufficient washout period between treatments) or did not assess the timing of PERT. One study which was terminated early is awaiting assessment pending further information. 
Authors' conclusions
We were unable to determine whether one dosing schedule for PERT is better than another since we identified no eligible RCTs. While the introduction of PERT to people with CF can improve their nutritional status, there are a limited number of studies which address this review question, and none met our eligibility criteria. Since malnutrition and adverse gastrointestinal symptoms remain a common feature in CF, the assessment of the relative performance of dosing schedules may provide evidence to improve outcomes in people with CF who are pancreatic insufficient. 
Further research is needed to fully evaluate the role of dosing schedules for PERT in fat absorption. Research should also establish reliable outcome measures and minimal clinically important differences. While RCTs with a cross‐over design may have advantages over a parallel group design, an adequate washout period between intervention periods is essential. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
A review looking at the best time to take pancreatic enzymes with meals for people with cystic fibrosis

## Rationale

### What is cystic fibrosis and why is this important?
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that people are born with. It affects many parts of the body. More than 70,000 people around the world have CF.

Most people with CF (8 to 9 out of every 10 people) have a problem with their pancreas. The pancreas is an organ that makes enzymes. Enzymes are special proteins that help break down food. When the pancreas does not work well, people cannot digest their food properly. This means their body cannot absorb fat and other nutrients from food.

### What happens if this problem is not treated?
When people with CF cannot digest food well, they do not get enough nutrition. This can lead to poor growth and weight loss. It can also make their lung problems worse.

### What is the treatment?
Doctors give people with CF pancreatic enzyme pills. These pills replace the enzymes their body does not make. The pills are called PERT (pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy). PERT helps people digest food better. When people take PERT, they gain weight and their lungs work better.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors know that PERT works. But they do not know the best time to take it. Should people take PERT before eating? During the meal? After eating? Different doctors tell patients different things. There is no standard rule about timing.

The researchers wanted to find out if one timing schedule works better than others. They hoped to help people with CF get the most benefit from their enzyme pills.

## Trial Design

### How did the researchers look for answers?
The researchers planned to review studies that tested different timing schedules for PERT. They looked for studies that compared taking enzymes at different times with meals.

They searched medical databases up to June 2021. They looked for studies that included people of any age with CF. They wanted studies that measured how well people absorbed fat from food. They also wanted to know if timing affected weight, lung function, and quality of life.

The researchers only wanted to include high-quality studies. These are called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people are put into groups by chance. This makes the results more reliable.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers found no studies that met their requirements. They looked at many studies, but none of them were suitable.

Some studies did not test timing at all. Other studies had design problems. Some studies used a crossover design. This means each person tried both timing schedules. But these studies did not have a long enough break between the two schedules. Without a proper break (at least two weeks), the results would not be reliable.

One study was stopped early. The researchers are waiting for more information about this study.

### What does this mean?
The researchers could not answer their question. They do not know if one timing schedule for PERT is better than another. There is not enough research on this topic.

### Why does this matter?
Many people with CF still have nutrition problems and stomach symptoms. Even with PERT, some people do not absorb fat well. Finding the best time to take enzymes might help these people.

### What needs to happen next?
More research is needed. Scientists need to do well-designed studies that test different timing schedules. These studies need to measure fat absorption carefully. They also need to measure other important outcomes like weight gain and lung function.

Future studies should use a crossover design with a proper break between treatments. This break needs to be at least two weeks long.

Better research could help doctors give clearer advice to patients. This could improve nutrition and health for people with CF.",10.1002-14651858.CD013488,"Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy timings in cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the different timings of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in people (of any age) with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Background 
CF is an inherited condition affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF are not able to produce enough pancreatic enzymes to breakdown and absorb fat, protein and fat‐soluble vitamins from food. This can lead to fatty stools (poo) and weight loss. It is thought that if fat is not digested properly, it could contribute to a higher risk of developing constipation or other serious gut complications such as distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. 
PERT provides the enzymes required to breakdown fat and the dosage is based upon the fat content of a meal or the person's body weight. PERT has been shown to improve weight and is associated with improved lung function. Despite current dose guidance, there are differences in PERT doses and there is no set guidance for when the therapy should be taken in relation to a meal (i.e. before, during or after eating). 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 24 June 2021.
Study characteristics 
We did not find any studies where PERT was given to people with CF who were pancreatic insufficient at different timings relative to their meals. We excluded nine studies. Four of these assessed the timing of PERT administration, but they had a cross‐over design where participants had one intervention and then swapped to the second intervention. We excluded these studies because they did not leave enough time between the different interventions to be sure that the effects of the first intervention were not affecting the results from the second intervention. Four studies did not look at the timing of PERT and one study evaluated a new educational program for PERT. One study was terminated early and we will assess this again at the first update of this review if we are able to obtain more information from the investigators. 
Key results 
No studies met the eligibility criteria. Further research is needed to work out the best time to take PERT in relation to a meal.

High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of mainly cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 2500 metres (˜ 8200 feet). Acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE), and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as potential medical problems associated with high altitude ascent. In this, the third of a series of three reviews about preventive strategies for HAI, we assessed the effectiveness of miscellaneous and non‐pharmacological interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of miscellaneous and non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI in people who are at risk of developing high altitude illness in any setting. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) in January 2019. We adapted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other databases. We used a combination of thesaurus‐based and free‐text search terms. We scanned the reference lists and citations of included trials and any relevant systematic reviews that we identified for further references to additional trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials conducted in any setting where non‐pharmacological and miscellaneous interventions were employed to prevent acute HAI, including preacclimatization measures and the administration of non‐pharmacological supplements. We included trials involving participants who are at risk of developing high altitude illness (AMS or HACE, or HAPE, or both). We included participants with, and without, a history of high altitude illness. We applied no age or gender restrictions. We included trials where the relevant intervention was administered before the beginning of ascent. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures employed by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 20 studies (1406 participants, 21 references) in this review. Thirty studies (14 ongoing, and 16 pending classification (awaiting)) will be considered in future versions of this suite of three reviews as appropriate. We report the results for the primary outcome of this review (risk of AMS) by each group of assessed interventions. 
Group 1. Preacclimatization and other measures based on pressure 
Use of simulated altitude or remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) might not improve the risk of AMS on subsequent exposure to altitude, but this effect is uncertain (simulated altitude: risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.71; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 140 participants; low‐quality evidence. RIPC: RR 3.0, 95% CI 0.69 to 13.12; 1 trial, 40 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement of this risk using positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP), but this information was derived from a cross‐over trial with a limited number of participants (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.38 to 9.76; 1 trial, 8 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. 
Group 2. Supplements and vitamins 
Supplementation of antioxidants, medroxyprogesterone, iron or Rhodiola crenulata might not improve the risk of AMS on exposure to high altitude, but this effect is uncertain (antioxidants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.03; 1 trial, 18 participants; low‐quality evidence. Medroxyprogesterone: RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.05; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 32 participants; low‐quality evidence. Iron: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.11; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 65 participants; low‐quality evidence. R crenulata: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.29; 1 trial, 125 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement of this risk with the administration of erythropoietin, but this information was extracted from a trial with issues related to risk of bias and imprecision (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.84; 1 trial, 39 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Regarding administration of ginkgo biloba, we did not perform a pooled estimation of RR for AMS due to considerable heterogeneity between the included studies (I² = 65%). RR estimates from the individual studies were conflicting (from 0.05 to 1.03; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. 
Group 3. Other comparisons 
We found heterogeneous evidence regarding the risk of AMS when ginkgo biloba was compared with acetazolamide (I² = 63%). RR estimates from the individual studies were conflicting (estimations from 0.11 (95% CI 0.01 to 1.86) to 2.97 (95% CI 1.70 to 5.21); low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement when ginkgo biloba was administered along with acetazolamide, but this information was derived from a single trial with issues associated to risk of bias (compared to ginkgo biloba alone: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.71; 1 trial, 311 participants; low‐quality evidence). Administration of medroxyprogesterone plus acetazolamide did not improve the risk of AMS when compared to administration of medroxyprogesterone or acetazolamide alone (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.55; 1 trial, 12 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. 
Authors' conclusions
This Cochrane Review is the final in a series of three providing relevant information to clinicians, and other interested parties, on how to prevent high altitude illness. The assessment of non‐pharmacological and miscellaneous interventions suggests that there is heterogeneous and even contradictory evidence related to the effectiveness of these prophylactic strategies. Safety of these interventions remains as an unclear issue due to lack of assessment. Overall, the evidence is limited due to its quality (low to very low), the relative paucity of that evidence and the number of studies pending classification for the three reviews belonging to this series (30 studies either awaiting classification or ongoing). Additional studies, especially those comparing with pharmacological alternatives (such as acetazolamide) are required, in order to establish or refute the strategies evaluated in this review. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Non-Drug Methods to Prevent High Altitude Sickness

## Plain Title

Can non-drug methods prevent sickness when traveling to high places?

## Rationale

**What is high altitude sickness?**

When people travel to high places like mountains (above 8,200 feet), they can get sick. This happens because there is less air to breathe. The body needs time to get used to this change. High altitude sickness can cause headaches, feeling sick to your stomach, feeling tired, and trouble breathing. In serious cases, it can cause fluid to build up in the brain or lungs. This can be very dangerous.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors want to find safe ways to stop people from getting sick at high places. Some people take drugs to prevent this sickness. But other people want to try methods that do not use drugs. These methods might include special training before the trip, breathing exercises, or taking vitamins. This study looked at whether these non-drug methods work.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if non-drug methods could keep people safe when they go to high places. They looked at many different methods to see which ones work best.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 20 past studies. These studies tested different non-drug methods. The studies included 1,406 people total. All of these people were at risk of getting sick at high places.

The researchers grouped the methods into three types:
- Methods using air pressure changes before the trip
- Vitamins and supplements
- Other methods and combinations

The studies included men and women of different ages. Some people had gotten sick at high places before. Others had not. The length of time people spent in each study varied.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers found mixed results for different methods:

**Air pressure methods:**
- Training at fake high altitude before a trip may not help much
- A method called RIPC (blocking blood flow briefly) may not help
- One small study found that a breathing method called PEEP might help
- More research is needed to know if these methods are safe

**Vitamins and supplements:**
- Antioxidants may not help prevent sickness
- Iron supplements may not help
- A drug called medroxyprogesterone may not help
- A plant called Rhodiola crenulata may not help
- One study found that erythropoietin might help, but the study had problems
- Studies about ginkgo biloba showed very different results. Some studies said it helps. Other studies said it does not help.
- Researchers could not tell if these supplements are safe

**Other combinations:**
- Studies comparing ginkgo biloba to acetazolamide (a common drug) showed different results
- One study found that taking ginkgo biloba and acetazolamide together might work better than ginkgo biloba alone
- Taking two drugs together did not work better than taking one drug alone

**What do these results mean?**

The evidence about non-drug methods is unclear. Different studies showed different results. Many studies were small. The quality of the studies was low. Researchers do not know if these methods are safe because most studies did not check for side effects.

**What happens next?**

More studies are needed. These studies should compare non-drug methods to proven drugs like acetazolamide. They should include more people. They should check if the methods are safe. Right now, there are 30 more studies being done or waiting to be reviewed. These may provide better answers in the future.",10.1002-14651858.CD013315,"Diverse strategies for preventing high altitude illness
Background 
The term high altitude illness (HAI) is used to describe a group of brain and lung conditions that can occur when people travel to altitudes above approximately 2500 metres (approximately 8200 feet). Individuals can respond to high altitudes in different ways and experience a variety of symptoms. These include HAI‐related headache, nausea, vomiting and tiredness, often called acute mountain sickness. Drowsiness, confusion or unconsciousness can occur when the brain is particularly affected (high altitude cerebral oedema or HACE), and cough or breathlessness when it is the lungs (high altitude pulmonary oedema or HAPE). A number of different strategies are used to prevent HAI. In this review we assessed the evidence from randomized controlled trials on whether various approaches could prevent the onset of high altitude illness, with a focus on non‐drug approaches, herbs and natural supplements. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to January 2019. We included 20 randomized controlled studies involving 1406 participants. The studies looked at diverse approaches to HAI prevention. These approaches included strategies to acclimatize to high altitudes by mimicking quick ascents by reducing levels of oxygen in the air that participants are breathing, and herbal products or vitamin supplements available without a prescription. 
The participants ranged in age between 17 and 65 years. Only one study included people at high risk of developing HAI as they had a history of HAI. Four trials provided the intervention between one to three days before making the ascent (20% of the studies), and eight between four to 30 days before departure for the ascent (40% of the studies). The participants in all these studies reached a final altitude of between 3500 and 5500 metres above sea level. Most of the studies did not provide clear information on how they were funded (55% of studies). Thirty additional studies were classified as either ongoing (14 studies), or awaiting classification (16 studies), and they will be considered in future versions of this suite of three reviews as appropriate. 
Key results 
The evidence for any benefit of the various strategies is inconclusive, and even contradictory among the included studies. 
In three studies comparing normal levels of oxygen with low oxygen levels as a way of acclimatization before leaving for high altitudes, we found no differences in the risk of developing acute mountain sickness (3 trials, 140 participants; low‐quality evidence). Adverse events were not reported, nor were high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) or pulmonary oedema (HAPE). 
Ginkgo biloba was compared with taking an inactive placebo in seven studies (523 participants) looking at acute mountain sickness. There was no difference between ginkgo biloba and placebo in terms of the risk of developing HACE (3 studies, 371 participants), or in the risk of developing tingling or pricking, often described as 'pins and needles', as a side effect of treatment (2 studies, 352 participants). No HAPE events were reported (3 studies, 371 participants). 
Ginkgo biloba was compared with acetazolamide, which is a drug used to prevent acute mountain sickness, in four studies (397 participants). The findings differed between the studies, and no conclusions could be drawn. Acetazolamide increased the risk of developing pins and needles in two studies (354 participants). No HAPE or HACE events were reported. Overall, the limited information on the safety of the various interventions means that their safety remains unclear. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was low to very low. We could not obtain the full text reports of some of the studies we had identified, which limited the number of studies included in the review. Many of the studies had small numbers of participants; and for some outcomes few events occurred so that any findings were uncertain. Additional research is needed to clarify the effectiveness and safety of the various strategies to reduce HAI.

Review question 
We examined the effect of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen, for people with acute low back pain. Acute low back pain is defined as the presence of pain in the back, below the ribs and above the buttocks, for under 12 weeks. We compared NSAIDs to placebo, paracetamol, other NSAIDs, other drugs, and non‐drug treatments. 
Background 
Acute low back pain is common, and causes pain and disability. Physicians often prescribe NSAIDs to treat acute low back pain. Different types of NSAIDs are available, both over‐the‐counter and as prescription drugs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials that were published or registered before 7 January 2020. We included 32 trials with 5356 participants. Trial participants were 16 to 78 years old and had acute low back pain. Study length varied from one day to six months. The studies took place in many different countries. More than half of the studies was done in Europe and North‐America. 
Key results 
NSAIDs were slightly more effective than placebo for pain reduction in the first three weeks. On average, the pain intensity decreased by 7.3 points on a 100‐point scale. This means there was a small difference between the two treatments, but it was not clinically relevant. People receiving NSAIDs also scored 2.0 points better on a 24‐point disability scale than those receiving placebo. This is unlikely to be of real‐world benefit. There was a similar number of side effects between people receiving NSAIDs and people receiving placebo. However, the type of studies that we investigated are not designed to find side effects. Therefore, we should be careful about drawing conclusions based upon these findings. 
We also compared two different types of NSAIDs; non‐selective NSAIDs versus COX‐2 inhibitors. We found no clear differences in effect. There was also a similar number of reported side effects of the digestive system, such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, or stomach symptoms. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing short‐term pain, and high quality evidence that they are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing disability in acute low back pain. The magnitude of the effect is very small. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Anti-Inflammatory Drugs for Sudden Back Pain

## Plain Title
Do Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Help People with Sudden Low Back Pain?

## Rationale

**What is acute low back pain?**
Low back pain is pain that occurs below the ribs and above the buttocks. When this pain lasts less than 12 weeks, doctors call it ""acute."" This type of back pain is very common. It causes pain and makes it hard for people to do daily tasks.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
Doctors often give patients anti-inflammatory drugs to treat sudden back pain. These drugs are called NSAIDs. Common examples include ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac. You can buy some NSAIDs at the store. Others need a prescription from a doctor.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know if NSAIDs really help people with sudden low back pain. They wanted to see if these drugs work better than fake pills (called placebo). They also compared NSAIDs to other pain medicines and treatments.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers set up this study?**
Researchers looked at 32 different studies. These studies included 5,356 people in total. The researchers searched for studies published before January 2020.

**Who was in these studies?**
The people in these studies were between 16 and 78 years old. All of them had sudden low back pain. The studies took place in many countries around the world. More than half were done in Europe and North America.

**How long did the studies last?**
The length of studies varied. Some lasted just one day. Others lasted up to six months.

**What did researchers compare?**
Researchers compared NSAIDs to several things:
- Fake pills (placebo)
- Paracetamol (another pain medicine)
- Different types of NSAIDs
- Other drugs
- Treatments that don't use drugs

## Results

**What did the researchers find about pain?**
NSAIDs worked slightly better than fake pills for reducing pain. This was true during the first three weeks. On a scale from 0 to 100, pain went down by about 7 points more with NSAIDs. This is a small difference. It may not make a big difference in daily life.

**What did researchers find about disability?**
Disability means how hard it is to do daily tasks. Researchers used a scale from 0 to 24 points. People taking NSAIDs scored 2 points better than people taking fake pills. This small difference likely does not help much in real life.

**Were there side effects?**
About the same number of people had side effects with NSAIDs and fake pills. However, these types of studies are not the best way to find side effects. We need to be careful about making conclusions from this finding.

**Did different types of NSAIDs work differently?**
Researchers compared two types of NSAIDs. These were regular NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. Both types worked about the same. Both types caused similar stomach problems. These problems included belly pain, upset stomach, and diarrhea.

**What do these results mean?**
NSAIDs help reduce pain and disability from sudden low back pain. But the benefit is very small. The improvement may not be enough to notice in everyday life.

**How good was the evidence?**
The evidence about pain reduction was moderate quality. The evidence about disability reduction was high quality. Both showed that NSAIDs work slightly better than fake pills. But again, the difference is very small.

**What should patients know?**
If you have sudden low back pain, NSAIDs may help a little. But the benefit is small. Talk to your doctor about the best treatment for you. Consider both the small benefits and possible side effects.",10.1002-14651858.CD013581,"Anti‐inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain
Review question 
We examined the effect of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen, for people with acute low back pain. Acute low back pain is defined as the presence of pain in the back, below the ribs and above the buttocks, for under 12 weeks. We compared NSAIDs to placebo, paracetamol, other NSAIDs, other drugs, and non‐drug treatments. 
Background 
Acute low back pain is common, and causes pain and disability. Physicians often prescribe NSAIDs to treat acute low back pain. Different types of NSAIDs are available, both over‐the‐counter and as prescription drugs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials that were published or registered before 7 January 2020. We included 32 trials with 5356 participants. Trial participants were 16 to 78 years old and had acute low back pain. Study length varied from one day to six months. The studies took place in many different countries. More than half of the studies was done in Europe and North‐America. 
Key results 
NSAIDs were slightly more effective than placebo for pain reduction in the first three weeks. On average, the pain intensity decreased by 7.3 points on a 100‐point scale. This means there was a small difference between the two treatments, but it was not clinically relevant. People receiving NSAIDs also scored 2.0 points better on a 24‐point disability scale than those receiving placebo. This is unlikely to be of real‐world benefit. There was a similar number of side effects between people receiving NSAIDs and people receiving placebo. However, the type of studies that we investigated are not designed to find side effects. Therefore, we should be careful about drawing conclusions based upon these findings. 
We also compared two different types of NSAIDs; non‐selective NSAIDs versus COX‐2 inhibitors. We found no clear differences in effect. There was also a similar number of reported side effects of the digestive system, such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, or stomach symptoms. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing short‐term pain, and high quality evidence that they are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing disability in acute low back pain. The magnitude of the effect is very small.

Stem cell therapy (SCT) has been proposed as an alternative treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), nonetheless its effectiveness remains debatable. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of SCT in adults with non‐ischaemic DCM.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase for relevant trials in November 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers in May 2020. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing stem/progenitor cells with no cells in adults with non‐ischaemic DCM. We included co‐interventions such as the administration of stem cell mobilizing agents. Studies were classified and analysed into three categories according to the comparison intervention, which consisted of no intervention/placebo, cell mobilization with cytokines, or a different mode of SCT. 
The first two comparisons (no cells in the control group) served to assess the efficacy of SCT while the third (different mode of SCT) served to complement the review with information about safety and other information of potential utility for a better understanding of the effects of SCT. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened all references for eligibility, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. We undertook a quantitative evaluation of data using random‐effects meta‐analyses. We evaluated heterogeneity using the I² statistic. We could not explore potential effect modifiers through subgroup analyses as they were deemed uninformative due to the scarce number of trials available. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We created summary of findings tables using GRADEpro GDT. We focused our summary of findings on all‐cause mortality, safety, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), performance status, and major adverse cardiovascular events. 
Main results
We included 13 RCTs involving 762 participants (452 cell therapy and 310 controls). Only one study was at low risk of bias in all domains. There were many shortcomings in the publications that did not allow a precise assessment of the risk of bias in many domains. Due to the nature of the intervention, the main source of potential bias was lack of blinding of participants (performance bias). Frequently, the format of the continuous data available was not ideal for use in the meta‐analysis and forced us to seek strategies for transforming data in a usable format. 
We are uncertain whether SCT reduces all‐cause mortality in people with DCM compared to no intervention/placebo (mean follow‐up 12 months) (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.31; I² = 0%; studies = 7, participants = 361; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether SCT increases the risk of procedural complications associated with cells injection in people with DCM (data could not be pooled; studies = 7; participants = 361; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether SCT improves HRQoL (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.62, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.23; I² = 72%; studies = 5, participants = 272; very low‐certainty evidence) and functional capacity (6‐minute walk test) (mean difference (MD) 70.12 m, 95% CI –5.28 to 145.51; I² = 87%; studies = 5, participants = 230; very low‐certainty evidence). SCT may result in a slight functional class (New York Heart Association) improvement (data could not be pooled; studies = 6, participants = 398; low‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported major adverse cardiovascular events as defined in our protocol. SCT may not increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (data could not be pooled; studies = 8, participants = 504; low‐certainty evidence). 
When comparing SCT to cell mobilization with granulocyte‐colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF), we are uncertain whether SCT reduces all‐cause mortality (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.31; I² = 39%; studies = 3, participants = 195; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether SCT increases the risk of procedural complications associated with cells injection (studies = 1, participants = 60; very low‐certainty evidence). SCT may not improve HRQoL (MD 4.61 points, 95% CI –5.62 to 14.83; studies = 1, participants = 22; low‐certainty evidence). SCT may improve functional capacity (6‐minute walk test) (MD 140.14 m, 95% CI 119.51 to 160.77; I² = 0%; studies = 2, participants = 155; low‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported MACE as defined in our protocol or ventricular arrhythmia. 
The most commonly reported outcomes across studies were based on physiological measures of cardiac function where there were some beneficial effects suggesting potential benefits of SCT in people with non‐ischaemic DCM. However, it is unclear if this intermediate effects translates into clinical benefits for these patients. 
With regard to specific aspects related to the modality of cell therapy and its delivery, uncertainties remain as subgroup analyses could not be performed as planned, making it necessary to wait for the publication of several studies that are currently in progress before any firm conclusion can be reached. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether SCT in people with DCM reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality and procedural complications, improves HRQoL, and performance status (exercise capacity). SCT may improve functional class (NYHA), compared to usual care (no cells). 
Similarly, when compared to G‐CSF, we are also uncertain whether SCT in people with DCM reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality although some studies within this comparison observed a favourable effect that should be interpreted with caution. SCT may not improve HRQoL but may improve to some extent performance status (exercise capacity). Very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding procedural complications. These suggested beneficial effects of SCT, although uncertain due to the very low certainty of the evidence, are accompanied by favourable effects on some physiological measures of cardiac function. 
Presently, the most effective mode of administration of SCT and the population that could benefit the most is unclear. Therefore, it seems reasonable that use of SCT in people with DCM is limited to clinical research settings. Results of ongoing studies are likely to modify these conclusions. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Stem Cell Treatment for People with Dilated Cardiomyopathy

## Plain Title
Can stem cell treatment help people with dilated cardiomyopathy (a heart muscle disease)?

## Rationale

**What is dilated cardiomyopathy?**
Dilated cardiomyopathy, or DCM, is a heart disease. The heart muscle becomes weak and stretched. When this happens, the heart cannot pump blood well. People with DCM may feel tired and short of breath. They may have trouble doing daily tasks. This disease can be very hard to live with.

**Why was this study needed?**
Current treatments for DCM do not work well for everyone. Some people still get worse even with treatment. Doctors wanted to find new ways to help. Stem cell treatment might help repair damaged heart muscle. Stem cells are special cells that can grow into different types of cells. Scientists think stem cells might help the heart work better.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know if stem cell treatment is safe. They also wanted to know if it helps people with DCM live longer. They looked at whether it helps people feel better and do more activities.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 13 different studies. These studies included 762 adults with DCM. Some people got stem cell treatment (452 people). Other people did not get stem cells (310 people). This helped researchers compare the two groups.

**What did the studies compare?**
Some studies compared stem cells to no treatment at all. Other studies compared stem cells to a different treatment. This treatment used special proteins to help the body make more stem cells.

**How long did the studies last?**
Most people were followed for about 12 months. This means researchers tracked their health for one year.

## Results

**What did researchers find about death rates?**
Researchers are not sure if stem cell treatment helps people live longer. The studies did not show a clear answer. More research is needed to know for certain.

**Was stem cell treatment safe?**
Researchers are not sure about safety. Some studies looked at problems from the treatment procedure. But there was not enough information to give a clear answer. The treatment may not cause heart rhythm problems. But again, more research is needed.

**Did stem cell treatment help people feel better?**
Researchers are not sure if people felt better overall. Some studies measured quality of life. The results were mixed and unclear. Some studies looked at how far people could walk in 6 minutes. Again, the results were not clear. However, stem cell treatment might help a little with daily activities. Some people moved up in their heart failure class rating.

**Did stem cell treatment help the heart work better?**
Some tests showed the heart might work a bit better. But researchers do not know if this means real benefits for patients. Better test results do not always mean people feel better or live longer.

**What about comparing stem cells to other treatments?**
When compared to protein treatment, results were also unclear. Stem cell treatment might help people walk farther. But it might not help with quality of life. Researchers need more information about death rates and safety.

**What do these results mean?**
The evidence is very uncertain. This means researchers cannot say for sure if stem cell treatment works. They also cannot say which type of stem cell treatment works best. They do not know which patients would benefit most.

**What should happen next?**
Right now, stem cell treatment should only be used in research studies. It should not be regular treatment yet. Many new studies are happening now. These studies will help answer the questions. The answers may change as new information comes in.

**Bottom line:**
Stem cell treatment for DCM might help in some ways. But researchers need more proof before they can recommend it. More studies are needed to know if it is safe and helpful.",10.1002-14651858.CD013433,"Bone marrow cells in non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy
Review question 
Are bone marrow cells safe and effective as a treatment for non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)? 
Background 
DCM is a disorder of the heart muscle with heart dilation (heart muscle becomes stretched) and impaired contraction, in the absence of high blood pressure, damaged or diseased heart valves, or heart disease present at birth or related to myocardial infarction (heart attack). The current standard of treatment is based on medicines and cardiac devices. However, DCM is still one of the leading causes of heart transplantation in adults. 
Stem cells are special cells produced in the bone marrow that are able to develop into many different cell types. Giving stem cells directly into the heart muscle has been proposed as an alternative treatment to reduce or stop further deterioration in heart function in people with DCM. 
Study characteristics 
We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the infusion of bone marrow‐derived stem cells into the heart muscle with the usual‐care (control) treatment in people diagnosed with DCM. We searched multiple databases for trials up to 10 November 2020. 
We included 13 RCTs involving 762 participants (452 receiving stem cell therapy and 310 controls). The trials included people with severe symptoms of ischaemic (following a heart attack) and non‐ischaemic DCM. We selected only the data from non‐ischaemic DCM. 
The studies included an average of 60 people aged about 45 to 58.5 years and 50% to 89% men in each trial. Following therapy, the participants were assessed for six months to five years, with most at one year. One study declared a private funding whereas seven others had public or governmental funding, two had non‐profit funding, and four did not report this information. 
Key results 
SCT versus control: very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding mortality, procedural complications, health‐related quality of life and exercise capacity. Low‐quality evidence suggests that SCT may slightly improve deterioration of heart function and may not increase the risk of abnormal heartbeats in people with DCM. No studies reported other relevant outcomes such as major cardiac adverse events. 
STC plus cytokine versus control: very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding mortality. Low‐quality evidence suggests that SCT plus cytokine may not improve health‐related quality of life but may improve exercise capacity as well as some physiological measures related to cardiac function (although it is unclear to what extent these latter outcomes are associated with relevant clinical benefits for patients). Hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. Very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding procedural complications. No studies reported major cardiac adverse events or abnormal heartbeats. 
Due to the limited number of studies we could not perform analyses to identify which specific features of SCT and clinical characteristics of patients are associated with better results. Thus, more research is needed to establish the role of SCT in the treatment of DCM and the most effective therapies. 
Quality of evidence 
The evidence in this review is of low to very low quality due to the small number of events, results not similar across studies, risk of bias, and issues with study design. Furthermore, the limitations in the reporting of most studies made it difficult to obtain and use the information to reach clearer conclusions.

","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Surgery to Remove as Much Tumor as Possible for Advanced Ovarian Cancer

## Rationale

**What is ovarian cancer?**
Ovarian cancer is a disease where cancer cells grow in the ovaries. The ovaries are part of a woman's reproductive system. This cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women. Most ovarian cancers start in the tissue that covers the ovary. Doctors call this type ""epithelial ovarian cancer.""

**Why is this condition a problem?**
Ovarian cancer is a serious disease. It can spread to other parts of the body. This makes it harder to treat. The cancer can cause many health problems for women.

**What is the main treatment?**
The main treatment is surgery. During surgery, doctors try to remove as much of the tumor as they can. Doctors call this ""cytoreductive surgery."" The goal is to remove the bulk of the cancer.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
How much cancer is left after surgery matters a lot. Women who have less cancer left after surgery often live longer. But doctors are not sure if the surgery itself helps women live longer. Or if other factors make the difference. Researchers wanted to find out if removing more cancer during surgery helps women with advanced ovarian cancer live longer.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know how long women lived based on how much cancer was left after surgery. They looked at three groups:
- No visible cancer left (called ""complete"" removal)
- Small bits of cancer left, each less than 1 cm (called ""optimal"" removal)
- Larger bits of cancer left, more than 1 cm (called ""suboptimal"" removal)

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked back at 11 older studies. They combined the results from these studies. All studies looked at women who had surgery for advanced ovarian cancer.

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. This means the cancer was at stage III or stage IV. The cancer had spread beyond the ovaries. More than 100 women were in each study that researchers reviewed.

**How long did the studies last?**
The researchers did not report how long each woman was followed. Different studies followed women for different amounts of time.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The study found that removing more cancer during surgery is linked to longer survival.

**Complete removal (no visible cancer left):**
Women who had all visible cancer removed lived the longest. These women lived longer than women who had any cancer left. They also went longer before their cancer came back.

**Optimal removal (cancer bits less than 1 cm):**
Women who had small bits of cancer left (less than 1 cm) also did better. They lived longer than women who had larger bits of cancer left (more than 1 cm).

**Suboptimal removal (cancer bits more than 2 cm):**
When researchers compared women with cancer bits larger than 2 cm to those with bits smaller than 2 cm, the difference was smaller. The survival benefit was less clear.

**What does this mean for patients?**
During surgery for advanced ovarian cancer, doctors should try to remove all visible cancer. If they cannot remove all cancer, they should try to leave only very small bits (less than 1 cm).

**What are the limits of this study?**
These studies looked back at past records. They were not planned experiments. This means the results might not be fully accurate. The studies did not report side effects from surgery. They did not report quality of life. They did not report costs.

**What should happen next?**
Better studies are needed. These studies should be planned experiments where some women get different types of surgery. This would help doctors know for sure if the surgery itself helps women live longer. Or if other factors make the difference.

**Main conclusion:**
Removing as much cancer as possible during surgery is linked to longer survival for women with advanced ovarian cancer. Complete removal of all visible cancer gives the best results.",10.1002-14651858.CD007565,"Clear survival benefit is achieved if all or most (< 1 cm remaining) of the tumour after primary surgical treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer is removed

170,10.1002-14651858.CD006672.pub3-abstract.txt,"Perineal techniques during the second stage of labour for reducing perineal trauma
What is the issue? 
Vaginal births are often associated with some form of trauma to the genital tract, and tears that affect the anal sphincter or mucosa (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears) can cause serious problems. Perineal trauma can occur spontaneously or result from a surgical incision (episiotomy). Different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head, and allow the perineum to stretch slowly to prevent injury. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. The objective of this updated review was to assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence of perineal trauma. This is an update of a review that was published in 2011. 
Why is this important? 
Trauma to the perineum can cause pain and other problems for women after the birth. The damage is described as first‐, second‐, third‐ and fourth‐degree tears – first‐degree tears being the least damage and fourth‐degree tears being the most. Third‐ and fourth‐degree tears, affect the anal sphincter or mucosa, thus causing the most problems. Reducing the use of episiotomies will reduce trauma to the perineum. Also, different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. It is important to know if these do indeed reduce trauma and pain for women. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies in September 2016. Twenty two trials were eligible for inclusion in this updated review but only twenty studies (involving 15,181 women), contributed results to the review. The participants in the studies were women without medical complications who were expecting a vaginal birth. The studies varied in their risk of bias, and the quality of the studies was very low to moderate. 
Hands off (or poised) compared to hands on  
Using 'hands off' the perineum resulted in fewer women having an episiotomy (low‐quality evidence), but made no difference to numbers of women with no tears (moderate‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), or third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There were considerable unexplained differences in results between the four studies. None of the studies provided data on the number of tears requiring suturing. 
Warm compresses versus control (hands off or no warm compress)  
Fewer women in the warm‐compress group experienced third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). A warm compress did not affect numbers of women with intact perineum (moderate‐quality evidence), tears requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compresses increase or reduce the incidence of first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). 
Massage versus control (hands off or routine care)  
There were more women with an intact perineum in the perineal massage group (low‐quality evidence), and fewer women with third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). Massage did not appear to make a difference to women with perineal trauma requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (very low‐quality evidence). 
Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care  
One small study found that women who had Ritgen's manoeuvre had fewer first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), but more second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in terms of the number of third‐ or fourth‐degree tears, or episiotomies (both low‐quality evidence). 
What does this mean? 
We found that massage and warm compresses may reduce serious perineal trauma (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears). Hands‐off techniques may reduce the number of episiotomies but it was not clear that these techniques had a beneficial effect on other perineal trauma. There remains uncertainty about the value of other techniques to reduce damage to the perineum during childbirth. 
More research is necessary, to evaluate different perineal techniques and to answer questions about how to minimise perineal trauma. There is insufficient evidence on women's experiences and views (only one included study collected information on this). It is important for future research to ascertain whether these interventions are acceptable to women.

## Plain Title

Testing Different Methods to Prevent Tearing During Vaginal Birth

## Rationale

**What is the perineum and why does it matter?**

The perineum is the area of skin and muscle between the vagina and the anus. During vaginal birth, this area can tear or be cut. Tears are ranked by how bad they are. First-degree tears are small and cause the least harm. Fourth-degree tears are the worst. Third- and fourth-degree tears go deep into the muscle. They can reach the anus. These serious tears can cause long-term pain and other problems for women.

**Why was this study needed?**

Many women experience tearing during childbirth. Doctors and midwives want to find ways to prevent this. They use different methods to help the baby's head come out slowly. This gives the perineum time to stretch. Some methods include massage, warm cloths, and different hand positions. However, researchers needed to know which methods actually work.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to find out if these different methods really reduce tearing. They wanted to help women have less pain and fewer problems after giving birth.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at 22 different studies from around the world. Twenty of these studies had results they could use. Together, these studies included 15,181 women.

**Who was in the studies?**

All the women in these studies were healthy. They were pregnant and expecting a vaginal birth. They did not have medical problems that would make birth more risky.

**What methods did researchers compare?**

Researchers looked at several different methods:
- **Hands off versus hands on**: Midwives either touched the perineum or kept their hands away during birth.
- **Warm compresses**: Midwives placed warm, wet cloths on the perineum during birth.
- **Massage**: Midwives rubbed and stretched the perineum during birth.
- **Ritgen's maneuver**: A special hand position to support the perineum.

Each method was compared to standard care or no special treatment.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

**Warm compresses helped prevent serious tears:**
Women who had warm cloths placed on their perineum had fewer serious tears. Fewer women had third- or fourth-degree tears. This was one of the most important findings.

**Massage also helped:**
Women who received perineal massage during birth had better outcomes. More women had no tears at all. Fewer women had serious third- or fourth-degree tears.

**Hands-off method reduced surgical cuts:**
When midwives used a hands-off approach, fewer women needed episiotomies. An episiotomy is when the doctor cuts the perineum on purpose. However, the hands-off method did not clearly reduce other types of tears.

**Ritgen's maneuver had mixed results:**
One small study looked at this special hand position. Results were unclear. Some tears went down, but other tears went up.

**What does this mean for women?**

Two methods show real promise: massage and warm compresses. These methods may help prevent the most serious tears. This could mean less pain and fewer problems after birth.

The hands-off method may help women avoid episiotomies. However, more research is needed to know if it helps with other tears.

**What questions remain?**

Researchers still need to learn more. They need bigger and better studies. They also need to ask women what they prefer. Only one study asked women about their experience. Future studies should find out if women find these methods comfortable and helpful.

**Conclusion:**

Warm compresses and massage during birth may protect women from serious tearing. These simple methods could help many women have better birth experiences. More research will help doctors and midwives know the best ways to protect women during childbirth.

What is the issue? 
Vaginal births are often associated with some form of trauma to the genital tract, and tears that affect the anal sphincter or mucosa (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears) can cause serious problems. Perineal trauma can occur spontaneously or result from a surgical incision (episiotomy). Different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head, and allow the perineum to stretch slowly to prevent injury. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. The objective of this updated review was to assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence of perineal trauma. This is an update of a review that was published in 2011. 
Why is this important? 
Trauma to the perineum can cause pain and other problems for women after the birth. The damage is described as first‐, second‐, third‐ and fourth‐degree tears – first‐degree tears being the least damage and fourth‐degree tears being the most. Third‐ and fourth‐degree tears, affect the anal sphincter or mucosa, thus causing the most problems. Reducing the use of episiotomies will reduce trauma to the perineum. Also, different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. It is important to know if these do indeed reduce trauma and pain for women. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies in September 2016. Twenty two trials were eligible for inclusion in this updated review but only twenty studies (involving 15,181 women), contributed results to the review. The participants in the studies were women without medical complications who were expecting a vaginal birth. The studies varied in their risk of bias, and the quality of the studies was very low to moderate. 
Hands off (or poised) compared to hands on  
Using 'hands off' the perineum resulted in fewer women having an episiotomy (low‐quality evidence), but made no difference to numbers of women with no tears (moderate‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), or third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There were considerable unexplained differences in results between the four studies. None of the studies provided data on the number of tears requiring suturing. 
Warm compresses versus control (hands off or no warm compress)  
Fewer women in the warm‐compress group experienced third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). A warm compress did not affect numbers of women with intact perineum (moderate‐quality evidence), tears requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compresses increase or reduce the incidence of first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). 
Massage versus control (hands off or routine care)  
There were more women with an intact perineum in the perineal massage group (low‐quality evidence), and fewer women with third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). Massage did not appear to make a difference to women with perineal trauma requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (very low‐quality evidence). 
Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care  
One small study found that women who had Ritgen's manoeuvre had fewer first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), but more second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in terms of the number of third‐ or fourth‐degree tears, or episiotomies (both low‐quality evidence). 
What does this mean? 
We found that massage and warm compresses may reduce serious perineal trauma (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears). Hands‐off techniques may reduce the number of episiotomies but it was not clear that these techniques had a beneficial effect on other perineal trauma. There remains uncertainty about the value of other techniques to reduce damage to the perineum during childbirth. 
More research is necessary, to evaluate different perineal techniques and to answer questions about how to minimise perineal trauma. There is insufficient evidence on women's experiences and views (only one included study collected information on this). It is important for future research to ascertain whether these interventions are acceptable to women.

Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) are severe and potentially sight‐threatening allergic eye diseases characterised by chronic inflammation of the ocular surface. Both topical and systemic treatments are used. This Cochrane Review focuses on systemic treatments. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of systemic treatments (including corticosteroids, NSAIDS, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies), alone or in combination, compared to placebo or other systemic or topical treatment, for severe AKC and VKC in children and young people up to the age of 16 years. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. We last searched the electronic databases on 17 February 2020. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that involved systemic treatments in children aged up to 16 years with a clinical diagnosis of AKC or VKC. We planned to include studies that evaluated a single systemic medication versus placebo, and studies that compared two or multiple active treatments. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods expected by Cochrane.
Main results
No trial met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane Review. No RCTs have been carried out on this topic. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently no evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the safety and efficacy of systemic treatments for VKC and AKC. Trials are required to test efficacy and safety of current and future treatments. Outcome measures need to be developed which can capture both objective clinical and patient‐reported aspects of the condition and treatments. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Systemic Treatments for Severe Allergic Eye Diseases in Children

## Plain Title
A Review of Medicines Taken by Mouth or Injection for Severe Allergic Eye Diseases in Children

## Rationale

### What are these eye conditions?

Some children get severe allergic eye diseases. Two types are called atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). These are long names for serious eye allergies.

These conditions cause long-lasting swelling and redness in the eyes. The eyes may itch, hurt, or water a lot. Bright light may bother the child. The eyelids may swell.

### Why are these conditions a problem?

These eye diseases can last a long time. They can make it hard for children to see clearly. In some cases, they can damage the eyes. This can lead to vision loss if not treated.

Children with these conditions may have trouble at school. They may not be able to play outside. Their quality of life goes down.

### What treatments are used?

Doctors use two main types of treatments. Some are eye drops that go directly in the eye. Others are systemic treatments. Systemic means the medicine goes through the whole body. These include pills taken by mouth or shots given by injection.

Systemic treatments may include steroids, anti-inflammatory drugs, or medicines that change how the immune system works.

### Why was this study needed?

Researchers wanted to know if systemic treatments work well for children with these severe eye allergies. They also wanted to know if these treatments are safe. They looked for studies that tested these medicines in a careful way.

## Trial Design

### How did the researchers look for studies?

The researchers searched for a special type of study. These are called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, some children get the treatment being tested. Other children get a fake treatment or a different treatment. Researchers then compare the groups.

The team searched medical databases. They looked for studies done anywhere in the world. They looked for studies in any language. They searched up to February 2020.

### What studies were they looking for?

They wanted studies that included children up to 16 years old. The children had to have AKC or VKC diagnosed by a doctor.

They looked for studies that tested systemic treatments. This could be one medicine compared to a fake treatment. Or it could be two or more real treatments compared to each other.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

The researchers found no studies that met their requirements. Not a single randomized controlled trial has been done on this topic.

This means there is no high-quality evidence about these treatments. Doctors do not have good research to guide their treatment choices.

### What does this mean?

Without proper studies, we do not know if systemic treatments work for these eye conditions in children. We also do not know if they are safe.

### What do the researchers conclude?

Good quality trials are needed. These trials should test whether systemic treatments work. They should also check if the treatments are safe for children.

Researchers need to develop better ways to measure results. These measures should include what doctors can see when they examine the eye. They should also include what children and families report about symptoms and quality of life.

### Why is this important?

Children with severe allergic eye diseases need effective and safe treatments. Right now, doctors must make treatment decisions without good evidence. Proper research studies would help doctors choose the best treatments for their young patients.",10.1002-14651858.CD013298,"What medicines, taken by mouth or given as an injection, work best to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people under 16 years old? 
What is allergic eye disease? An immune response is how the body recognises and defends itself against substances that appear harmful, usually by producing specific blood proteins (antibodies) against them. An allergy is a reaction by the body's immune system to a particular substance (an allergen) that is usually harmless, such as grass or tree pollens in the air. Different allergens affect different tissues, and their effects can be mild or serious. 
In the eye, allergic reactions can cause conjunctivitis: the conjunctiva (the tissue covering the white of the eye and lining the inside of the eyelids) becomes swollen and sore. Severe allergic eye disease may also affect the cornea (the clear, front part of the eye), causing keratoconjunctivitis. 
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) are rare types of severe allergic eye disease. VKC usually develops in children and is more common in boys; AKC can affect children and adults. These conditions usually affect both eyes and make them red, itchy, sore, watery and sensitive to light. Both conditions can damage the cornea, which can affect eyesight and lead to blindness. Treatment is essential to save eyesight. 
Treatments for severe allergic eye disease Both conditions are treated with medicines that try to block the allergic reaction and reduce swelling. Symptoms may get better with medicines given as eye drops, but if these don't work, other medicines may be taken by mouth or given as an injection (systemic medicines). Systemic medicines that are often used to treat severe allergic eye disease include ones that target or suppress the immune response, such as anti‑inflammatory medicines and antibodies. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to find out which systemic treatments work best for severe allergic eye disease in children and young people. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that looked at systemic medicines to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people under 16 years of age. We wanted to find studies that compared a single medicine with a placebo (dummy) medicine, or studies that compared two or more medicines against each other. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
Search date: We searched for evidence published up to 17 February 2020. 
What we foundWe found no randomised controlled studies in children and young people with severe allergic eye disease treated by systemic medicines. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence from randomised controlled studies about how well systemic medicines work for severe allergic eye disease in children and young people aged under 16 years. 
Research is needed to investigate how well systemic medicines work to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people, and to learn about any unwanted effects these medicines might cause.

The balance of benefits and harms associated with enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia is not clear. An increasing number of guidelines highlight the lack of evidenced benefit and potential risks of enteral tube feeding. In some areas of the world, the use of enteral tube feeding is decreasing, and in other areas it is increasing. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia who develop problems with eating and swallowing or who have reduced food and fluid intake. 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases and two trials registers on 14 April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or controlled non‐randomised studies. Our population of interest was adults of any age with a diagnosis of primary degenerative dementia of any cause, with severe cognitive and functional impairment, and poor nutritional intake. Eligible studies evaluated the effectiveness and complications of enteral tube feeding via a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, or via jejunal post‐pyloric feeding, in comparison with standard care or enhanced standard care, such as an intervention to promote oral intake. Our primary outcomes were survival time, quality of life, and pressure ulcers. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors screened citations and two review authors assessed full texts of potentially eligible studies against inclusion criteria. One review author extracted data, which were then checked independently by a second review author. We used the 'Risk Of Bias In Non‐randomised Studies of Interventions' (ROBINS‐I) tool to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. Risk of confounding was assessed against a pre‐agreed list of key potential confounding variables. Our primary outcomes were survival time, quality of life, and pressure ulcers. Results were not suitable for meta‐analysis, so we presented them narratively. We presented results separately for studies of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding, nasogastric tube feeding and studies using mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding methods. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall certainty of the evidence related to each outcome for each study. 
Main results
We found no eligible RCTs. We included fourteen controlled, non‐randomised studies. All the included studies compared outcomes between groups of people who had been assigned to enteral tube feeding or oral feeding by prior decision of a healthcare professional. Some studies controlled for a range of confounding factors, but there were high or very high risks of bias due to confounding in all studies, and high or critical risks of selection bias in some studies. 
Four studies with 36,816 participants assessed the effect of PEG feeding on survival time. None found any evidence of effects on survival time (low‐certainty evidence). 
Three of four studies using mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding methods in 310 participants (227 enteral tube feeding, 83 no enteral tube feeding) found them to be associated with longer survival time. The fourth study (1386 participants: 135 enteral tube feeding, 1251 no enteral tube feeding) found no evidence of an effect. The certainty of this body of evidence is very low. 
One study of PEG feeding (4421 participants: 1585 PEG, 2836 no enteral tube feeding) found PEG feeding increased the risk of pressure ulcers (moderate‐certainty evidence). Two of three studies reported an increase in the number of pressure ulcers in those receiving mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding (234 participants: 88 enteral tube feeding, 146 no enteral tube feeding). The third study found no effect (very‐low certainty evidence).  
Two studies of nasogastric tube feeding did not report data on survival time or pressure ulcers. 
None of the included studies assessed quality of life.
Only one study, using mixed methods of enteral tube feeding, reported on pain and comfort, finding no difference between groups. In the same study, a higher proportion of carers reported very heavy burden in the enteral tube feeding group compared to no enteral tube feeding. 
Two studies assessed the effect of nasogastric tube feeding on mortality (236 participants: 144 nasogastric group, 92 no enteral tube feeding). One study of 67 participants (14 nasogastric, 53 no enteral tube feeding) found nasogastric feeding was associated with increased mortality risk. The second study found no difference in mortality between groups. The certainty of this evidence is very low. Results on mortality for those using PEG or mixed methods of enteral tube feeding were mixed and the certainty of evidence was very low. There was some evidence from two studies for enteral tube feeding improving nutritional parameters, but this was very low‐certainty evidence. Five studies reported a variety of harm‐related outcomes with inconsistent results. The balance of evidence suggested increased risk of pneumonia with enteral tube feeding. 
None of the included studies assessed behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence that tube feeding improves survival; improves quality of life; reduces pain; reduces mortality; decreases behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia; leads to better nourishment; improves family or carer outcomes such as depression, anxiety, carer burden, or satisfaction with care; and no indication of harm. We found some evidence that there is a clinically significant risk of pressure ulcers from enteral tube feeding. Future research should focus on better reporting and matching of control and intervention groups, and clearly defined interventions, measuring all the outcomes referred to here.   
","# Plain Language Summary: Tube Feeding for People with Severe Dementia

## Plain Title

Does tube feeding help people with severe dementia who have trouble eating and drinking?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**

People with severe dementia often have trouble eating and swallowing. They may also eat and drink less than they need. This can lead to weight loss and poor health. Families and doctors worry about whether these patients are getting enough food and water.

**What is tube feeding?**

Tube feeding means giving food and water through a tube. The tube can go through the nose into the stomach. Or doctors can place it directly into the stomach through the skin. Some doctors think tube feeding might help people with severe dementia live longer and stay healthier.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors are not sure if tube feeding helps or harms people with severe dementia. Some guidelines say tube feeding may not help and could cause problems. In some parts of the world, doctors use tube feeding more often. In other places, they use it less. This study looked at the research to find out if tube feeding works for people with severe dementia.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at studies that other scientists had already done. They searched for all studies that compared tube feeding to normal eating in people with severe dementia.

**Who was in the studies?**

The researchers found 14 studies with adults who had severe dementia. These people had trouble eating or were not eating enough. Some got tube feeding. Others continued eating by mouth. The studies included over 37,000 people in total.

**How long did the studies last?**

Different studies followed patients for different amounts of time. Some tracked patients for weeks. Others followed them for months or years.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found no good evidence that tube feeding helps people with severe dementia. Here are the main findings:

**Living longer:** Four large studies looked at whether tube feeding helped people live longer. None of these studies found that tube feeding helped. Three smaller studies had mixed results. The quality of this evidence was low.

**Quality of life:** None of the studies measured quality of life. This means we do not know if tube feeding makes people feel better or worse.

**Pressure sores:** Pressure sores are wounds on the skin from lying or sitting too long in one place. One large study found that tube feeding increased the risk of pressure sores. Two other studies found similar results. This was the clearest finding from all the research.

**Pain and comfort:** Only one study looked at pain and comfort. It found no difference between groups.

**Family and carer burden:** One study asked family members and carers about their stress. More carers felt very stressed when their loved one had tube feeding.

**Risk of death:** Two small studies looked at feeding tubes through the nose. Results were mixed and unclear.

**Better nutrition:** Two studies suggested tube feeding might improve nutrition measures. But the evidence was very weak.

**Harm:** Some studies found tube feeding might increase the risk of lung infections called pneumonia.

**What the researchers concluded:**

The researchers found no proof that tube feeding helps people with severe dementia. They found no evidence it helps people live longer, improves quality of life, reduces pain, or provides better nutrition. They did find some evidence that tube feeding may cause pressure sores. The quality of most evidence was low or very low. This means we cannot be very sure about the results. Better studies are needed to answer these important questions.",10.1002-14651858.CD013503,"Enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia
What are the advantages and problems of tube feeding people with severe dementia?  
Key messages 
Tube feeding may not increase the length of time people with severe dementia live compared to no tube feeding. The risk of developing a pressure sore is probably higher with a feeding tube than with no tube. No studies looked at quality of life.We need more and better studies to investigate tube feeding people with severe dementia. Future studies should focus on a broader range of outcomes including, pain, quality of life and the impact on carers 
What is tube feeding? 
Somebody who can’t eat or drink through their mouth may be given liquid food through a tube into their stomach. This is called enteral tube feeding. The tube passes through their nose into their stomach (a nasogastric tube), or is inserted into the stomach through a small cut in their belly (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or PEG).  
Why is this important for people with dementia? 
People with dementia often have difficulties eating and drinking. During the early stages of dementia, they may forget to eat, chew food without swallowing, or be confused at mealtimes. Some people experience changes in the taste and smell of food. In the later stages of dementia, people often have difficulties swallowing.  It can be difficult to ensure they receive appropriate food and fluids.  
People with severe dementia need full‐time care, and it is often their families who care for them. It is difficult to decide whether or not to tube‐feed someone with dementia because the feeding tube can be uncomfortable or even painful, and may cause other unwanted effects such as pneumonia, worsen bowel or bladder control, as well as bleeding, swelling and infection. People with severe dementia may be confused or distressed by the tube and may try to remove it.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether tube feeding helps people with severe dementia who have problems with eating and swallowing.  
We were interested in the effect of tube feeding on:
how long people lived; 
their quality of life (well‐being); and 
the development or healing of pressure sores (also known as bed sores).
What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated whether: 
PEG compared to no tube; a nasogastric tube compared to no tube; orPEG, nasogastric and other types of tube feeding compared to no tube 
was effective and whether tube feeding caused any unwanted effects in adults of any age with severe dementia and poor intake of food and drink.  
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We included 14 studies that included 49,714 participants. Of these, 6203 were tube‐fed and 43,511 were not. Participants with no feeding tube were given standard care or standard care with extra treatments to encourage eating and drinking. 
Main results 
In people with severe dementia, compared to no tube feeding:
PEG may make no difference to how long people live (4 studies, 36,816 people), and leads to a small increase in the chance of developing pressure sores (1 study, 4421 people). we don’t know if nasogastric tube feeding increases the length of time people live or increases their chance of developing pressure sores, because none of our included studies gave information about these points. Studies of people with either PEG or nasogastric tubes showed tube feeding may increase the length of time people live (4 studies, 1696 people), and may slightly increase the chance of developing pressure sores (3 studies, 351 people).  
None of our included studies reported quality of life.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We have moderate confidence in our finding that pressure ulcers were more common in people who were fed with a PEG tube. However, we have little to very little confidence for our other findings.  
Three main factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Firstly, people in the studies were not randomly placed into different treatment groups. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between people rather than between the treatments. However, due to ethical considerations it would be very difficult to do this in future studies. Secondly, results were very inconsistent across the different studies. Finally, some studies were very small.  
The results of further research could differ from the results of this review.
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 14 April 2021.

Globally, children under 15 years represent approximately 12% of new tuberculosis cases, but 16% of the estimated 1.4 million deaths. This higher share of mortality highlights the urgent need to develop strategies to improve case detection in this age group and identify children without tuberculosis disease who should be considered for tuberculosis preventive treatment. One such strategy is systematic screening for tuberculosis in high‐risk groups. 
Objectives
To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the presence of one or more tuberculosis symptoms, or symptom combinations; chest radiography (CXR); Xpert MTB/RIF; Xpert Ultra; and combinations of these as screening tests for detecting active pulmonary childhood tuberculosis in the following groups. 
– Tuberculosis contacts, including household contacts, school contacts, and other close contacts of a person with infectious tuberculosis. 
– Children living with HIV.
– Children with pneumonia.
– Other risk groups (e.g. children with a history of previous tuberculosis, malnourished children). 
– Children in the general population in high tuberculosis burden settings.
Search methods
We searched six databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase, on 14 February 2020 without language restrictions and contacted researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Cross‐sectional and cohort studies where at least 75% of children were aged under 15 years. Studies were eligible if conducted for screening rather than diagnosing tuberculosis. Reference standards were microbiological (MRS) and composite reference standard (CRS), which may incorporate symptoms and CXR. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using QUADAS‐2. We consolidated symptom screens across included studies into groups that used similar combinations of symptoms as follows: one or more of cough, fever, or poor weight gain and one or more of cough, fever, or decreased playfulness. For combination of symptoms, a positive screen was the presence of one or more than one symptom. 
We used a bivariate model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and performed analyses separately by reference standard. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Nineteen studies assessed the following screens: one symptom (15 studies, 10,097 participants); combinations of symptoms (12 studies, 29,889 participants); CXR (10 studies, 7146 participants); and Xpert MTB/RIF (2 studies, 787 participants). Several studies assessed more than one screening test. No studies assessed Xpert Ultra. For 16 studies (84%), risk of bias for the reference standard domain was unclear owing to concern about incorporation bias. Across other quality domains, risk of bias was generally low. 
Symptom screen (verified by CRS) 
One or more of cough, fever, or poor weight gain in tuberculosis contacts (4 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 2% to 13%): pooled sensitivity was 89% (95% CI 52% to 98%; 113 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 69% (95% CI 51% to 83%; 2582 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 339 would be screen‐positive, of whom 294 (87%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (false positives); 661 would be screen‐negative, of whom five (1%) would have pulmonary tuberculosis (false negatives). 
One or more of cough, fever, or decreased playfulness in children aged under five years, inpatient or outpatient (3 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 3% to 13%): sensitivity ranged from 64% to 76% (106 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and specificity from 37% to 77% (2339 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 251 to 636 would be screen‐positive, of whom 219 to 598 (87% to 94%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 364 to 749 would be screen‐negative, of whom 12 to 18 (2% to 3%) would have pulmonary tuberculosis. 
One or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis close contact (World Health Organization four‐symptom screen) in children living with HIV, outpatient (2 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 3% and 8%): pooled sensitivity was 61% (95% CI 58% to 64%; 1219 screens; moderate‐certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 94% (95% CI 86% to 98%; 201,916 screens; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 symptom screens where 50 of the screens are on children with pulmonary tuberculosis, 88 would be screen‐positive, of which 57 (65%) would be on children who do not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 912 would be screen‐negative, of which 19 (2%) would be on children who have pulmonary tuberculosis. 
CXR (verified by CRS) 
CXR with any abnormality in tuberculosis contacts (8 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 2% to 25%): pooled sensitivity was 87% (95% CI 75% to 93%; 232 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 99% (95% CI 68% to 100%; 3281 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children, where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 63 would be screen‐positive, of whom 19 (30%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 937 would be screen‐negative, of whom 6 (1%) would have pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Xpert MTB/RIF (verified by MRS) 
Xpert MTB/RIF, inpatient or outpatient (2 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 1% and 4%): sensitivity was 43% and 100% (16 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and specificity was 99% and 100% (771 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children, where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 31 to 69 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 to 19 (28% to 29%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 931 to 969 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative, of whom 0 to 28 (0% to 3%) would have tuberculosis. 
Studies often assessed more symptoms than those included in the index test and symptom definitions varied. These differences complicated data aggregation and may have influenced accuracy estimates. Both symptoms and CXR formed part of the CRS (incorporation bias), which may have led to overestimation of sensitivity and specificity. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that in children who are tuberculosis contacts or living with HIV, screening tests using symptoms or CXR may be useful, but our review is limited by design issues with the index test and incorporation bias in the reference standard. 
For Xpert MTB/RIF, we found insufficient evidence regarding screening accuracy.
Prospective evaluations of screening tests for tuberculosis in children will help clarify their use. In the meantime, screening strategies need to be pragmatic to address the persistent gaps in prevention and case detection that exist in resource‐limited settings.

## Plain Title

How Well Do Different Tests Find Tuberculosis in Children Who May Be at Risk?

## Rationale

**What is tuberculosis and why is it a problem for children?**

Tuberculosis is a serious lung infection. It spreads through the air when someone with the disease coughs. Children under 15 years old make up about 1 out of 8 new cases worldwide. But they make up about 1 out of 6 deaths from tuberculosis. This means children are more likely to die from tuberculosis than adults. Many children with tuberculosis are never found and treated.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need better ways to find tuberculosis in children early. Finding it early means children can get treatment sooner. Some children need medicine to prevent tuberculosis before they get sick. To find these children, doctors can screen groups who are more likely to have tuberculosis. These groups include children who live with someone who has tuberculosis, children living with HIV, and children who are very sick.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know how well different screening tests work. They looked at tests that check for symptoms like cough or fever. They looked at chest X-rays. They also looked at a lab test called Xpert MTB/RIF. They wanted to see which tests best find children who have tuberculosis.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at 19 studies that other scientists had already done. These studies included over 10,000 children under 15 years old.

The researchers looked at different screening tests:
- Checking for symptoms like cough, fever, or weight loss
- Taking chest X-rays
- Using the Xpert MTB/RIF lab test

They studied children in different risk groups:
- Children who live with someone who has tuberculosis
- Children living with HIV
- Children in hospitals or clinics
- Children under 5 years old

The researchers checked how often each test correctly found tuberculosis. They also checked how often tests said a child had tuberculosis when they really did not.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**Symptom screening in children who live with someone who has tuberculosis:**

The test looked for cough, fever, or poor weight gain. Out of 1,000 children where 50 have tuberculosis, about 339 would test positive. Of these, 294 would not actually have tuberculosis. About 661 would test negative. Of these, only 5 would actually have tuberculosis. This test finds most children with tuberculosis but also flags many healthy children.

**Symptom screening in children under 5 years old:**

The test looked for cough, fever, or less playfulness. This test found between 64 and 76 out of 100 children who had tuberculosis. However, it also said many healthy children might have tuberculosis.

**Symptom screening in children living with HIV:**

This test looked for cough, fever, poor weight gain, or contact with someone who has tuberculosis. Out of 1,000 screens where 50 are on children with tuberculosis, 88 would be positive. Of these, 57 would be on children without tuberculosis. About 912 would be negative. Of these, 19 would be on children who have tuberculosis.

**Chest X-ray screening:**

X-rays worked better than symptom checks. Out of 1,000 children where 50 have tuberculosis, 63 would have abnormal X-rays. Of these, only 19 would not have tuberculosis. About 937 would have normal X-rays. Of these, only 6 would have tuberculosis.

**Xpert MTB/RIF test:**

Only two small studies looked at this test. Results varied too much to draw clear conclusions.

**What do these results mean?**

Screening tests using symptoms or chest X-rays may help find tuberculosis in at-risk children. Chest X-rays appear more accurate than symptom checks. However, the studies had some problems that may affect how reliable the results are. More research is needed to know the best way to screen children for tuberculosis. Until then, doctors should use practical screening methods to find and treat more children with tuberculosis.",10.1002-14651858.CD013693,"Screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children
Why is improving screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in children important? 
Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Most children who die from tuberculosis are never diagnosed or treated. Screening may be useful to identify children with possible tuberculosis and refer them for further testing. As well, screening could be used to identify children without tuberculosis, who should be considered for preventive treatment. A false‐positive result means that children may undergo unnecessary testing and treatment and may not receive preventive treatment promptly. A false‐negative result means that children have tuberculosis, but may miss further testing to confirm the diagnosis. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children in high‐risk groups, such as children with HIV and close contacts of people with tuberculosis. 
What was studied in this review? 
Screening tests were: one tuberculosis symptom; one or more of a combination of tuberculosis symptoms; the World Health Organization (WHO) four‐symptom screen (one or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis contact) in children with HIV, recommended at each healthcare visit; chest radiography (CXR); and Xpert MTB/RIF. 
What are the main results in this review? 
Nineteen studies assessed the following screening tests: one symptom (15 studies, 10,097 participants); more than one symptom (12 studies, 29,889 participants); CXR (10 studies, 7146 participants); and Xpert MTB/RIF (two studies, 787 participants). 
Symptom screening 
For every 1000 children screened, if 50 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard: 
One or more of cough, fever, or poor weight gain in tuberculosis contacts (composite reference standard (CRS) (4 studies) 
– 339 would screen positive, of whom 294 (87%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 661 would screen negative, of whom 5 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
One or more of cough, fever, or decreased playfulness in children under five, inpatient or outpatient (CRS) (3 studies) 
– 251 to 636 would screen positive, of whom 219 to 598 (87% to 94%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 364 to 749 would screen negative, of whom 12 to 18 (2% to 3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). 
One or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis close contact (WHO four‐symptom screen) in children with HIV, outpatient (CRS) (2 studies) 
– 88 would screen positive, of which 57 (65%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive).
– 912 would screen negative, of which 19 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
Abnormal CXR in tuberculosis contacts (CRS) (8 studies) 
– 63 would screen positive, of whom 19 (30%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive).
– 937 would screen negative, of whom 6 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
Xpert MTB/RIF in children, inpatient or outpatient microbiologic reference standard (MRS) (2 studies) 
– 31 to 69 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 to 19 (28% to 29%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 931 to 969 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative, of whom 0 to 28 (0% to 3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
Diagnosing tuberculosis in children is difficult. This may lead to screening tests appearing more or less accurate than they actually are. For Xpert MTB/RIF, there were few studies and children tested to be confident about results. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Children at risk for pulmonary tuberculosis. Results likely do not apply to children in the general population. Studies mainly took place in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis. 
What are the implications of this review? 
In children who are tuberculosis contacts or living with HIV, screening tests using symptoms or CXR may be useful. However, symptoms and CXR formed part of the reference standard, which may falsely elevate the accuracy of the results. We urgently need better screening tests for tuberculosis in children to better identify children who should be considered for tuberculosis preventive treatment and to increase the timeliness of treatment in those with tuberculosis disease. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
To 14 February 2020.

174,10.1002-14651858.CD008685.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Warfarin is used as an oral anticoagulant. However, there is wide variation in patient response to warfarin dose. This variation, as well as the necessity of keeping within a narrow therapeutic range, means that selection of the correct warfarin dose at the outset of treatment is not straightforward. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of different initiation doses of warfarin in terms of time in‐range, time to INR in‐range and effect on serious adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, DARE and the NHS Health economics database on The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to April 2012) and EMBASE (1974 to April 2012). 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials which compared different initiation regimens of warfarin.
Data collection and analysis
Review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Authors also assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. 
Main results
We identified 12 studies of patients commencing warfarin for inclusion in the review. The overall risk of bias was found to be variable, with most studies reporting adequate methods for randomisation but only two studies reporting adequate data on allocation concealment. Four studies (355 patients) compared 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses. All four studies reported INR in‐range by day five. Although there was notable heterogeneity, pooling of these four studies showed no overall difference between 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77, P = 0.46, I2 = 83%). Two of these studies used two consecutive INRs in‐range as the outcome and showed no difference between a 5 mg and 10 mg dose by day five (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19, P = 0.37, I2 = 22%); two other studies used a single INR in‐range as the outcome and showed a benefit for the 10 mg initiation dose by day 5 (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21, P = 0.05, I2 = 72%). Two studies compared a 5 mg dose to other doses: a 2.5 mg initiation dose took longer to achieve the therapeutic range (2.7 versus 2.0 days; P < 0.0001), but those receiving a calculated initiation dose achieved a target range quicker (4.2 days versus 5 days, P = 0.007). Two studies compared age adjusted doses to 10 mg initiation doses. More elderly patients receiving an age adjusted dose achieved a stable INR compared to those receiving a 10 mg initial dose (and Fennerty regimen). Four studies used genotype guided dosing in one arm of each trial. Three studies reported no overall differences; the fourth study, which reported that the genotype group spent significantly more time in‐range (P < 0.001), had a control group whose INRs were significantly lower than expected. No clear impacts from adverse events were found in either arm to make an overall conclusion. 
Authors' conclusions
The studies in this review compared loading doses in several different situations. There is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate, leading to fewer high INRs. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype guided initiation. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Starting Doses of Warfarin Blood Thinner Medicine

## Plain Title

Comparing Different Starting Doses of Warfarin to Find the Best Way to Begin Treatment

## Rationale

**What is warfarin and why do people need it?**

Warfarin is a medicine that thins the blood. Doctors give it to people to stop blood clots from forming. Blood clots can be very dangerous.

**What is the problem?**

Different people respond to warfarin in different ways. The same dose may work well for one person but not for another. Doctors need to keep the blood at just the right thickness. If the blood is too thick, clots can form. If the blood is too thin, a person can bleed too much. This makes it hard for doctors to pick the right starting dose.

Doctors measure blood thickness using a test called INR. The INR needs to stay in a safe range. Finding the right dose quickly is important for patient safety.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know the best dose to start with. They needed to find out which starting dose gets patients into the safe range fastest. They also wanted to know which dose causes fewer problems.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 12 different studies. These studies tested warfarin in real patients. The studies compared different starting doses to see which worked best.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included 355 patients who were starting warfarin treatment. Some studies focused on older patients. All patients needed warfarin to prevent blood clots.

**What did the studies compare?**

Most studies compared a 5 mg starting dose to a 10 mg starting dose. Some studies tested even lower doses, like 2.5 mg. Other studies tested doses based on patient age. A few studies used genetic tests to pick the dose. The studies checked how long it took to reach the safe INR range. They also counted how many patients reached the safe range by day five.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The main findings showed mixed results:

When comparing 5 mg to 10 mg starting doses, there was no clear winner. Four studies looked at this question. The results were very different from each other. Overall, both doses worked about the same.

For older patients, lower starting doses worked better. Age-adjusted doses led to fewer problems with blood being too thin. Older patients had safer INR levels with lower starting doses.

Very low doses (2.5 mg) took longer to work. Patients needed more time to reach the safe range compared to 5 mg doses.

Using genetic tests to pick doses did not help much. Three studies found no benefit from genetic testing. One study showed better results, but that study had problems with how it was done.

**Were there side effects?**

The studies did not find major differences in serious problems between different doses. Neither dose clearly caused more bleeding or clotting problems.

**What do these results mean?**

Doctors still do not have a clear answer about the best starting dose. For most adults, either 5 mg or 10 mg may work. For older patients, starting with a lower dose or adjusting for age seems safer. Genetic testing does not appear helpful for picking starting doses right now.

**What is still unknown?**

More research is needed to find the best starting dose for different types of patients. Better studies could help doctors make warfarin treatment safer and more effective from the start.",10.1002-14651858.CD008685,"The optimal warfarin dose for patients beginning therapy
Warfarin is commonly prescribed to prevent blot clots in patients with medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation, heart valve replacement or previous blood clots. Warfarin is an effective treatment which has been used for many years but needs to be closely monitored, especially at the beginning of treatment, as there is a wide variation in response to dose. Monitoring of the response to dose is done using an International Normalized Ratio (INR) and it is important that patients remain within a narrow range (typically 2 to 3 INR) due to the need to balance the goal of preventing blood clots with the risk of causing excessive bleeding. 
This review included 12 randomised controlled trials comparing different warfarin doses given to patients beginning warfarin treatment. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias so the results were interpreted with caution. 
Those trials that were included compared loading doses in several different situations. The review authors divided the trials into four categories, 5 mg versus 10 mg initial doses (four studies), 5 mg versus other doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus age adjusted doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus genotype adjusted doses (four studies). 
The review authors concluded that there is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype adjusted dosing. We also found no data to suggest that any one method was safer than another.

175,10.1002-14651858.CD014698-abstract.txt,"Background
Ultrasound examination of pregnancy before 24 weeks gestation may lead to more accurate dating and earlier diagnosis of pathology, but may also give false reassurance. It can be used to monitor development or diagnose conditions of an unborn baby. This review compares the effect of routine or universal, ultrasound examination, performed before 24 completed weeks' gestation, with selective or no ultrasound examination.  
Objectives
To assess the effect of routine pregnancy ultrasound before 24 weeks as part of a screening programme, compared to selective ultrasound or no ultrasound, on the early diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy location, termination for fetal congenital abnormality, multiple pregnancy, maternal outcomes and later fetal compromise. 
To assess the effect of first trimester (before 14 weeks) and second trimester (14 to 24 weeks) ultrasound, separately. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 11 August 2020. We also examined the reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs and RCTs published in abstract form. We included all trials with pregnant women who had routine or revealed ultrasound versus selective ultrasound, no ultrasound, or concealed ultrasound, before 24 weeks' gestation. All eligible studies were screened for scientific integrity and trustworthiness. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, extracted data and checked extracted data for accuracy. Two review authors independently used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome 
Main results
Our review included data from 13 RCTs including 85,265 women. The review included four comparisons. Four trials were assessed to be at low risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation concealment and two as high risk. The nature of the intervention made it impossible to blind women and staff providing care to treatment allocation.  Sample attrition was low in the majority of trials and outcome data were available for most women. Many trials were conducted before it was customary for trials to be registered and protocols published. 
First trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: four studies, 1791 women, from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). 
First trimester scans probably reduce short‐term maternal anxiety about pregnancy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; moderate‐certainty evidence). We do not have information on whether the reduction was sustained.  
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of first trimester scans on perinatal loss (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73; 648 participants; one study; low‐certainty evidence) or induction of labour for post‐maturity (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.37; 1474 participants; three studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
The effect of routine first trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or termination of pregnancy for fetal abnormality was not reported. 
Second trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: seven studies, 36,053 women, from Finland, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and the US. 
Second trimester scans probably make little difference to perinatal loss (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.20; 17,918 participants, three studies; moderate‐certainty evidence) or intrauterine fetal death (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.42; 29,584 participants, three studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
Second trimester scans may reduce induction of labour for post‐maturity (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73; 24,174 participants, six studies; low‐certainty evidence), presumably by more accurate dating. 
Routine second trimester ultrasound may improve detection of multiple pregnancy (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16; 274 participants, five studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
Routine second trimester ultrasound may increase detection of major fetal abnormality before 24 weeks (RR 3.45, 95% CI 1.67 to 7.12; 387 participants, two studies; low‐certainty evidence) and probably increases the number of women terminating pregnancy for major anomaly (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.93; 26,893 participants, four studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Long‐term follow‐up of children exposed to scans before birth did not indicate harm to children's physical or intellectual development (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.34; 603 participants, one study; low‐certainty evidence). 
The effect of routine second trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or maternal anxiety was not reported. 
Standard care plus two ultrasounds and referral for complications versus standard care: one cluster‐RCT, 47,431 women, from Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan and Zambia. 
This trial included a co‐intervention, training of healthcare workers and referral for complications and was, therefore, assessed separately. 
Standard pregnancy care plus two scans, and training and referral for complications, versus standard care probably makes little difference to whether women with complications give birth in a risk appropriate setting with facilities for caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.19; 11,680 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  The intervention also probably makes little to no difference to low birthweight (< 2500 g) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13; 47,312 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about whether the community intervention (including ultrasound) makes any difference to maternal mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.55; 46,768 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Revealed ultrasound results (communicated to both patient and doctor) versus concealed ultrasound results (blinded to both patient and doctor at any time before 24 weeks): one study, 1095 women, from the UK. 
The evidence was very uncertain for all results relating to revealed versus concealed ultrasound scan (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Early scans probably reduce short term maternal anxiety. 
Later scans may reduce labour induction for post‐maturity. They may improve detection of major fetal abnormalities and increase the number of women who choose termination of pregnancy for this reason. They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies. All these findings accord with observational data.  
Neither type of scan appears to alter other important maternal or fetal outcomes, but our review may underestimate the effect in modern practice because trials were mostly  from relatively early in the development of the technology, and many control participants also had scans. The trials were also underpowered to show an effect on other important maternal or fetal outcomes.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Routine Ultrasound Scans in Early Pregnancy

## Plain Title
Do routine ultrasound scans before 24 weeks of pregnancy help mothers and babies?

## Rationale

### What is an ultrasound scan?
An ultrasound scan uses sound waves to create pictures of a baby inside the womb. Doctors use these scans to check how the baby is growing.

### Why did researchers do this study?
Ultrasound scans done before 24 weeks of pregnancy can help in several ways. They can show when the baby is due more clearly. They can find problems with the baby early. They can show if a woman is having twins.

However, scans might also make parents feel falsely safe. They might miss some problems. Researchers wanted to know if giving all pregnant women ultrasound scans helps more than only giving scans when doctors think they are needed.

### What did researchers want to find out?
Researchers wanted to see if routine scans help:
- Find problems early
- Reduce worry for mothers
- Improve health for mothers and babies
- Give better information about the pregnancy

They looked at two types of scans:
- Early scans (before 14 weeks of pregnancy)
- Later scans (14 to 24 weeks of pregnancy)

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at 13 studies. These studies included 85,265 pregnant women. The studies came from many countries around the world.

### What did the studies compare?
The studies compared different groups of women:
- Some women got routine ultrasound scans
- Some women only got scans when doctors thought they needed them
- Some women got no scans at all

### Who was in the studies?
All the women in the studies were pregnant. They were at different stages of pregnancy before 24 weeks.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies followed women through their pregnancy. Some studies also checked on children after birth to see if they were healthy.

## Results

### What did researchers find about early scans (before 14 weeks)?

**Reducing worry:** Early scans probably help reduce worry for mothers in the short term. About 8 out of 10 women felt less anxious after an early scan.

**Other outcomes:** Researchers could not tell if early scans changed the number of babies lost during pregnancy. They also could not tell if scans changed how often labor was started early.

### What did researchers find about later scans (14 to 24 weeks)?

**Finding twins:** Later scans help doctors find twin pregnancies. Only 5 out of 100 twin pregnancies were missed with routine scans.

**Finding birth defects:** Later scans help find serious problems with babies. Scans found about 3 times more major problems before 24 weeks. More women chose to end their pregnancy when serious problems were found.

**Better due dates:** Later scans help doctors know when babies are due. This meant fewer women had labor started because doctors thought the baby was late.

**Baby loss:** Scans did not change how many babies died before or after birth.

**Child development:** Children who had scans before birth grew up healthy. The scans did not harm their physical or mental growth.

### What about scans in low-resource countries?

One large study looked at giving two scans plus extra training for health workers. This was done in five countries with fewer medical resources. The study included 47,431 women.

This approach did not change:
- Where women gave birth
- How many babies were born small
- How many mothers died

### What are the main conclusions?

**Early scans** help reduce worry for mothers in the short term.

**Later scans** help in several ways:
- They give better due dates
- They find more serious problems with babies
- They find more twin pregnancies

**Important note:** Scans did not change other important outcomes for mothers or babies. However, most studies were done many years ago. Ultrasound technology is much better now. Also, many women in the ""no routine scan"" groups still got scans anyway. This made it harder to see clear differences.

More research with modern ultrasound machines might show different results.",10.1002-14651858.CD014698,"Routine ultrasound scans for babies before 24 weeks of pregnancy.
We set out to determine the effect of routine ultrasound scans early in pregnancy (before 24 weeks). This was in comparison to no scan at all, or scans only when a clinical problem was suspected, such as if the woman has vaginal bleeding, or the baby is at high risk of having an abnormality. 
What is the issue? 
Ultrasound scans send out high‐frequency sound waves directed to the area being examined, and use the reflected sound to make an image. This review considers two types of scan in the first half of pregnancy.  Early scans (before 14 weeks) mainly aim to count the number of babies, to check they are growing in the correct place and check the pregnancy dates.  Later scans, typically done around 18 to 24 weeks, recheck all the above, and also examine the baby's anatomy and whether the placenta (afterbirth) is in the correct place. Both types of scan may cause parental anxiety and a false positive diagnoses could lead to harm. The aim of this review is to compare routine with selective or no scans. 
Why is this important? 
It has been assumed that routine scans before 24 weeks' gestation will result in the earlier detection of problems and improve management and the pregnancy outcome. The alternative is selective scans for specific reasons. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials. We found 13 studies including 85,265 women. We included two main comparisons. 
Routine early scanning  
Ultrasound scans in the first 14 weeks reduced short‐term maternal worries about the pregnancy. There was no evidence of a clear effect on induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue, loss of the baby, early birth (before 34 weeks) or mothers choosing termination for baby abnormalities. 
Routine later scanning  
Second trimester scans, at 14 to 24 weeks, increased detection of baby abnormalities, and more women chose termination of pregnancy for this reason. There was no evidence of an effect on perinatal loss. Induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue was reduced. No studies reported how it affected maternal anxiety. Multiple pregnancies were more likely to be detected by 24 weeks. Long‐term follow‐up of children exposed to these scans did not indicate that they were harmful to children's physical or intellectual development. 
We also found one trial from a group of low and middle income countries, comparing a combination of two scans and specialist training of health professionals and referral of women with complications, with selective scans and routine care. The intervention did not alter the number of women delivering in a hospital with caesarean section facility. Nor did it appear to reduce maternal deaths or the numbers of low‐birthweight babies, although the evidence was very uncertain. 
We also found one trial where all women underwent scans but the results were revealed to the health care professionals in half the cases. This trial showed no important effect of revealing the scan results but the evidence was very uncertain. 
Most studies were carried out relatively early in the development of scan technology and when training in its use was less advanced. In most trials a large proportion of women in the control groups received a scan too. 
What does this mean? 
Early scans probably reduce maternal worries about the baby in the short term. Later scans may reduce labour induction to prevent the pregnancy going overdue. They may also improve detection of major abnormalities in the baby and increase the number of women who choose pregnancy termination for this reason. They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies. All these findings accord with common sense.  
Although neither type of scan appears to alter other important outcomes, our review may underestimate the effect in modern practice because the trials were mostly from relatively early in the development of scan technology, and many participants in the control arms also had scans.

Health services have traditionally been developed to focus on specific diseases or medical specialties. Involving consumers as partners in planning, delivering and evaluating health services may lead to services that are person‐centred and so better able to meet the needs of and provide care for individuals. Globally, governments recommend consumer involvement in healthcare decision‐making at the systems level, as a strategy for promoting person‐centred health services. However, the effects of this 'working in partnership' approach to healthcare decision‐making are unclear. Working in partnership is defined here as collaborative relationships between at least one consumer and health provider, meeting jointly and regularly in formal group formats, to equally contribute to and collaborate on health service‐related decision‐making in real time. In this review, the terms 'consumer' and 'health provider' refer to partnership participants, and 'health service user' and 'health service provider' refer to trial participants. 
This review of effects of partnership interventions was undertaken concurrently with a Cochrane Qualitative Evidence Synthesis (QES) entitled Consumers and health providers working in partnership for the promotion of person‐centred health services: a co‐produced qualitative evidence synthesis. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership, as an intervention to promote person‐centred health services. 
Search methods
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases from 2000 to April 2019; PROQUEST Dissertations and Theses Global from 2016 to April 2019; and grey literature and online trial registries from 2000 until September 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster‐RCTs of ‘working in partnership’ interventions meeting these three criteria: both consumer and provider participants meet; they meet jointly and regularly in formal group formats; and they make actual decisions that relate to the person‐centredness of health service(s). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened most titles and abstracts. One review author screened a subset of titles and abstracts (i.e. those identified through clinical trials registries searches, those classified by the Cochrane RCT Classifier as unlikely to be an RCT, and those identified through other sources). Two review authors independently screened all full texts of potentially eligible articles for inclusion. In case of disagreement, they consulted a third review author to reach consensus. One review author extracted data and assessed risk of bias for all included studies and a second review author independently cross‐checked all data and assessments. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion, or by consulting a third review author to reach consensus. Meta‐analysis was not possible due to the small number of included trials and their heterogeneity; we synthesised results descriptively by comparison and outcome. We reported the following outcomes in GRADE ‘Summary of findings’ tables: health service alterations; the degree to which changed service reflects health service user priorities; health service users' ratings of health service performance; health service users' health service utilisation patterns; resources associated with the decision‐making process; resources associated with implementing decisions; and adverse events. 
Main results
We included five trials (one RCT and four cluster‐RCTs), with 16,257 health service users and more than 469 health service providers as trial participants. For two trials, the aims of the partnerships were to directly improve the person‐centredness of health services (via health service planning, and discharge co‐ordination). In the remaining trials, the aims were indirect (training first‐year medical doctors on patient safety) or broader in focus (which could include person‐centredness of health services that targeted the public/community, households or health service delivery to improve maternal and neonatal mortality). Three trials were conducted in high income‐countries, one was in a middle‐income country and one was in a low‐income country. Two studies evaluated working in partnership interventions, compared to usual practice without partnership (Comparison 1); and three studies evaluated working in partnership as part of a multi‐component intervention, compared to the same intervention without partnership (Comparison 2). No studies evaluated one form of working in partnership compared to another (Comparison 3). 
The effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership compared to usual practice without partnership are uncertain: only one of the two studies that assessed this comparison measured health service alteration outcomes, and data were not usable, as only intervention group data were reported. Additionally, none of the included studies evaluating this comparison measured the other primary or secondary outcomes we sought for the 'Summary of findings' table. 
We are also unsure about the effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership as part of a multi‐component intervention compared to the same intervention without partnership. Very low‐certainty evidence indicated there may be little or no difference on health service alterations or health service user health service performance ratings (two studies); or on health service user health service utilisation patterns and adverse events (one study each). No studies evaluating this comparison reported the degree to which health service alterations reflect health service user priorities, or resource use. 
Overall, our confidence in the findings about the effects of working in partnership interventions was very low due to indirectness, imprecision and publication bias, and serious concerns about risk of selection bias; performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias in most studies. 
Authors' conclusions
The effects of consumers and providers working in partnership as an intervention, or as part of a multi‐component intervention, are uncertain, due to a lack of high‐quality evidence and/or due to a lack of studies. Further well‐designed RCTs with a clear focus on assessing outcomes directly related to partnerships for patient‐centred health services are needed in this area, which may also benefit from mixed‐methods and qualitative research to build the evidence base. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Working Together to Make Health Care Better for Patients

## Plain Title

Do health care services improve when patients and health care workers team up to make decisions together?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Health care services often focus on specific diseases or body parts. They may not always focus on what matters most to the person getting care. This can make it hard for people to get the care they really need.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if health care gets better when patients and health care workers team up. They looked at what happens when patients and health care workers meet as a group on a regular basis. In these meetings, both groups work as equal partners to make decisions about health services.

**Why is this important?**

Many governments around the world say patients should help make decisions about health care. They think this could make health care focus more on what patients need. But no one knows for sure if this team approach really works. This study tried to find out.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked for studies where patients and health care workers worked together in a special way. They had to meet as a group, meet regularly, and make real decisions about health services together.

The researchers searched medical databases from the year 2000 to 2019. They looked for high-quality studies that compared this team approach to regular care.

**Who was in these studies?**

The researchers found five studies. These studies included more than 16,000 people who use health services. They also included more than 469 health care workers.

Three studies took place in wealthy countries. One was in a middle-income country. One was in a low-income country.

**What did the studies look at?**

Some studies looked at whether this team approach directly improved care for patients. Other studies looked at whether it helped in other ways, like training new doctors or reducing deaths of mothers and babies.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not tell if working together as partners really helps. The evidence was very weak for several reasons:

- Only five studies met the requirements
- The studies were very different from each other
- The studies had problems with how they were done
- Many studies did not measure the things that matter most

**What outcomes did they look at?**

The researchers wanted to know if working together led to:
- Changes in health services
- Changes that matched what patients wanted
- Better ratings from patients
- Different patterns of health care use
- Changes in costs
- Any harmful effects

Most studies did not measure these things. The few that did had results that were not clear or reliable.

**What does this mean?**

We do not know if patients and health care workers working together as partners makes health care better. More and better studies are needed.

**What happens next?**

Researchers need to do more careful studies. These studies should:
- Focus clearly on whether working together helps patients
- Measure things that matter to patients
- Be designed better to give clear answers

Other types of research could also help. Talking to patients and health care workers about their experiences could teach us more about how working together might help.

**Bottom line**

The idea of patients and health care workers teaming up to make decisions sounds good. But right now, we do not have enough good evidence to know if it really works. We need more research to find out.",10.1002-14651858.CD013373,"When healthcare consumers (patients, carers and family members) and healthcare providers work together as partners to plan, deliver and evaluate health services, what effects does this have? 
What are person‐centred health services? 
Traditionally, health services have been developed by healthcare providers and focus on specific diseases or medical specialties. Involving consumers as partners in planning, delivering and evaluating health services may lead to services that are better able to meet the needs of and provide care for individuals.  
Why we did this Cochrane review 
Governments worldwide recommend that healthcare providers work with consumers to promote person‐centred health services. However, the effects of healthcare providers and consumers working together are unclear. 
We reviewed the evidence from research studies to find out about the effects of healthcare providers and consumers working together to plan, deliver and evaluate health services. 
Specifically, we wanted to know if consumers and healthcare providers working together in partnership – in the form of regular meetings in which consumers and providers were invited to contribute as equals to decisions about health services – had an impact on: 
‐ changes to health services;
‐ the extent to which changes to health services reflected service users’ priorities;
‐ users’ ratings of health services;
‐ health service use; and
‐ time and money needed to make or act on decisions about health services.
We also wanted to find out if there were any unwanted (adverse) effects.    
What did we do? 
First, we searched the medical literature for studies that compared:
‐ consumers and healthcare providers working in partnership against usual practice or other strategies with no partnership; or 
‐ different ways of working in partnership (for example, with fewer or more consumers, or with online or face‐to‐face meetings). 
We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find? 
We found five studies that involved a total of 16,257 health service users and more than 469 health service providers. Three studies took place in high income‐countries and one each in middle‐ and low‐income countries. 
The studies compared:
‐ working in partnership against usual practice without partnership working (2 studies); and 
‐ working in partnership as part of a wider strategy to promote person‐centred health services, against the same wider strategy without partnership working (3 studies).   
No studies evaluated one form of working in partnership compared to another.
What are the main results of our review? 
The studies provided insufficient evidence to determine if working in partnership had any effects compared to usual practice or wider strategies with no working in partnership. 
No studies investigated:
‐ impacts on the extent to which changes to health services reflected service users’ priorities, or 
‐ the resources needed to make or act on decisions about health services.
Few studies investigated:
‐ impacts on changes to health services;
‐ users’ ratings of health services;
‐ health service use; and
‐ adverse events.
The few studies that did investigate these outcomes either did not report usable information or produced findings in which we have very little confidence. These studies were small, used methods likely to introduce errors in their results and focused on specific settings or populations. Their results are unlikely to reflect the results of all the studies that have been conducted in this area, some of which have not made their results public yet. 
What does this mean? 
There is not enough robust evidence to determine the effects of consumers and providers working in partnership to plan, deliver or evaluate health services. 
This review highlights the need for well‐designed studies with a clear focus on evaluating the effects of partnerships for promoting person‐centred care in health services. This area of research may also benefit from studies that investigate why certain partnerships between consumers and healthcare providers may be more successful than others, and an accompanying qualitative evidence synthesis addressing this aspect is forthcoming. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to April 2019.

The prevalence of substance use, both prescribed and non‐prescribed, is increasing in many areas of the world. Substance use by women of childbearing age contributes to increasing rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is a newer term describing the subset of NAS related to opioid exposure. Non‐pharmacological care is the first‐line treatment for substance withdrawal in newborns. Despite the widespread use of non‐pharmacological care to mitigate symptoms of NAS, there is not an established definition of, and standard for, non‐pharmacological care practices in this population. Evaluation of safety and efficacy of non‐pharmacological practices could provide clear guidance for clinical practice. 
Objectives
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of non‐pharmacological treatment of infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal on the length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment for symptom management. 
Comparison 1: in infants at risk for, or having early symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal, does non‐pharmacological treatment reduce the length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment? 
Comparison 2: in infants receiving pharmacological treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, does concurrent non‐pharmacological treatment reduce duration of pharmacological treatment, maximum and cumulative doses of opioid medication, and length of hospitalization? 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search CENTRAL (2019, Issue 10); Ovid MEDLINE; and CINAHL on 11 October 2019. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster trials. 
Selection criteria
We included trials comparing single or bundled non‐pharmacological interventions to no non‐pharmacological treatment or different single or bundled non‐pharmacological interventions. We assessed non‐pharmacological interventions independently and in combination based on sufficient similarity in population, intervention, and comparison groups studied. We categorized non‐pharmacological interventions as: modifying environmental stimulation, feeding practices, and support of the mother‐infant dyad. We presented non‐randomized studies identified in the search process narratively. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes in infants at risk for, or having early symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal included length of hospitalization and pharmacological treatment with one or more doses of opioid or sedative medication. Primary outcomes in infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal included length of hospitalization, length of pharmacological treatment with opioid or sedative medication, and maximum and cumulative doses of opioid medication. 
Main results
We identified six RCTs (353 infants) in which infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal participated between 1975 and 2018. We identified no RCTs in which infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal participated. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low to low. We also identified and excluded 34 non‐randomized studies published between 2005 and 2018, including 29 in which infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal participated and five in which infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal participated. We identified seven preregistered interventional clinical trials that may qualify for inclusion at review update when complete. 
Of the six RCTs, four studies assessed modifying environmental stimulation in the form of a mechanical rocking bed, prone positioning, non‐oscillating waterbed, or a low‐stimulation nursery; one study assessed feeding practices (comparing 24 kcal/oz to 20 kcal/oz formula); and one study assessed support of the maternal‐infant dyad (tailored breastfeeding support). 
There was no evidence of a difference in length of hospitalization in the one study that assessed modifying environmental stimulation (mean difference [MD) –1 day, 95% confidence interval [CI) –2.82 to 0.82; 30 infants; very low‐certainty evidence) and the one study of support of the maternal‐infant dyad (MD –8.9 days, 95% CI –19.84 to 2.04; 14 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). No studies of feeding practices evaluated the length of hospitalization. 
There was no evidence of a difference in use of pharmacological treatment in three studies of modifying environmental stimulation (typical risk ratio [RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; 92 infants; low‐certainty evidence), one study of feeding practices (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.33; 49 infants; very low‐certainty evidence), and one study of support of the maternal‐infant dyad (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.90; 14 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Reported secondary outcomes included neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, days to regain birth weight, and weight nadir. One study of support of the maternal‐infant dyad reported NICU admission (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.90; 14 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). One study of feeding practices reported days to regain birth weight (MD 1.10 days, 95% CI 2.76 to 0.56; 46 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). One study that assessed modifying environmental stimulation reported weight nadir (MD –0.28, 95% CI –1.15 to 0.59; 194 infants; very low‐certainty evidence) and one study of feeding practices reported weight nadir (MD –0.8, 95% CI –2.24 to 0.64; 46 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns affects important clinical outcomes including length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment based on the six included studies. The outcomes identified for this review were of very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence. Combined analysis was limited by heterogeneity in study design and intervention definitions as well as the number of studies. Many prespecified outcomes were not reported. Although caregivers are encouraged by experts to optimize non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns prior to initiating pharmacological care, we do not have sufficient evidence to inform specific clinical practices. Larger well‐designed studies are needed to determine the effect of non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Non-Drug Treatments for Newborns Withdrawing from Opioids

## Plain Title

Do non-drug treatments help newborn babies who are withdrawing from opioids?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some pregnant women use drugs like opioids. These drugs can be prescribed by doctors or obtained without a prescription. When a baby is born to a mother who used these drugs during pregnancy, the baby may experience withdrawal symptoms. This is called neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS. When the withdrawal is specifically from opioids, doctors call it neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, or NOWS.

**Why is this a problem for babies?**

Babies with withdrawal symptoms may be fussy, have trouble eating, or have other health problems. These babies often need to stay in the hospital longer. Some babies need medicines to help with their symptoms.

**What treatments are available?**

Doctors usually try non-drug treatments first. These are things like keeping the room quiet, holding the baby, special feeding methods, or helping mothers breastfeed. If these do not work well enough, doctors may give the baby medicine.

**Why was this study needed?**

More women are using opioids, so more babies are born with withdrawal symptoms. Doctors use many different non-drug treatments, but no one knows which ones work best. This study looked at research to find out if non-drug treatments help these babies.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of other studies. Researchers looked for studies that tested non-drug treatments in newborn babies. They searched medical databases and found six studies. These studies included 353 babies total. The studies were done between 1975 and 2018.

**What babies were included?**

The studies looked at newborn babies who were at risk for withdrawal symptoms. These babies were born to mothers who used opioids during pregnancy.

**What treatments were tested?**

The studies tested different non-drug treatments:
- Special beds that rock or use water
- Positioning babies on their stomachs
- Quiet rooms with less stimulation
- Special formula with more calories
- Extra help for mothers who wanted to breastfeed

**How long did the studies last?**

Each baby stayed in their study until they went home from the hospital.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not tell if non-drug treatments really help these babies. The evidence was not strong enough to be sure.

**Length of hospital stay:**

Two studies looked at how long babies stayed in the hospital. One study tested quiet rooms. One study tested breastfeeding support. Neither study showed clear proof that these treatments shortened hospital stays.

**Need for medicine:**

Five studies looked at whether babies needed medicine for withdrawal. Three studies tested things like special beds and positioning. One study tested special formula. One study tested breastfeeding support. None of these studies showed clear proof that non-drug treatments reduced the need for medicine.

**Other findings:**

Some studies looked at other things like weight gain and admission to intensive care. These studies also did not show clear benefits.

**Why was the evidence weak?**

The studies were small. The studies tested different treatments in different ways. Many studies did not measure important outcomes. This made it hard to combine results and draw clear conclusions.

**What do the results mean?**

Doctors often recommend non-drug treatments before giving medicine to babies with withdrawal symptoms. However, this review shows we do not have good evidence about which specific treatments work best. We need larger, better-designed studies to answer this question.

**What happens next?**

Researchers found seven new studies that are currently being done. These studies may provide better answers when they are finished. Until then, doctors will continue using non-drug treatments, but we cannot say for certain which ones help the most.",10.1002-14651858.CD013217,"Non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns
Review question 
Do one or more specific non‐pharmacological (treatments other than medicines) care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth? 
Background 
Newborns of mothers who take opioids during pregnancy often experience symptoms of withdrawal after delivery, such as high‐pitched cry, tremors, and high tone. Non‐pharmacological care is the first treatment for symptoms of withdrawal. If symptoms worsen despite non‐pharmacological care, a medication such as morphine, methadone, or buprenorphine is the second treatment to reduce symptoms. Though non‐pharmacological care is the first approach to symptom management, it is not the same at every hospital. We wanted to discover whether one or more non‐pharmacological care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth. 
Study characteristics 
We looked at randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of opioid‐exposed newborns treated with one or more non‐pharmacological care practice. Non‐pharmacological care practices include changes to the environment to reduce stimulation or provide soothing, changes to feeding frequency or type, changes that increase maternal care of the newborn or maternal wellness, and multiple changes such as occur in a new site or system of care. Search is up to date as of October 2019. 
Key results 
This review included six RCTs that enrolled 353 opioid‐exposed newborns. The studies were published between 1975 and 2018. We also identified seven ongoing studies that may qualify for inclusion at review update when complete. 
Of the six RCTs, four assessed changes to the environment to reduce stimulation or provide soothing. These studies examined the effect of a mechanical rocking bed, prone positioning (lying on tummy), non‐oscillating waterbed, and a low‐stimulation nursery. We are uncertain whether modifying environmental stimulation is associated with length of hospitalization based on one study with 30 infants. Modifying environmental stimulation may be associated with little or no difference in use of pharmacological treatment based on three studies with 92 infants. We are uncertain whether modifying environmental stimulation is associated with weight nadir (lowest weight recorded during birth hospitalization) based on one study with 194 infants. 
One study assessed a change to the feeding type comparing higher‐calorie formula to standard‐calorie formula. We are uncertain whether feeding practices are associated with use of medicines, days to regain birth weight, or weight nadir based on one study with 46 infants. 
One study assessed changes to support the mother with tailored breastfeeding support. We are uncertain whether support of the mother‐infant dyad is associated with length of hospitalization, use of medicines, or neonatal intensive care unit admission based on one study with 14 infants. 
Many potential important effects were not reported, and others were not reported in all studies. 
Quality of evidence 
We are uncertain whether one or more specific non‐pharmacological care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth. The quality of evidence for all outcomes is very low to low and provides limited information to inform individual non‐pharmacological care practices or combinations of non‐pharmacological care practices.

178,10.1002-14651858.CD003315.pub3-abstract.txt,"Feeding interventions for growth and development in infants with cleft lip, cleft palate or cleft lip and palate 
Cleft lip and cleft palate (the roof of the mouth) are common defects. The severity of the cleft (opening) varies and it can occur on one (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral). It can be difficult to feed babies enough nutritious food when they have this condition, and there is evidence of delayed development in children born with cleft. 
This review aimed to compare the effects of different feeding interventions such as maternal advice and support, modified bottles and/or teats, obturating or maxillary plates (plates placed in the roof of the mouth to artificially close the cleft palate) and supplemental breastfeeding in babies with cleft lip and/or palate prior to, or following, closure. Interventions in the first 6 months from term and used with breast milk or formula feeding only were considered, but outcomes (measures of growth, development and parental satisfaction) may have been measured at any time including adulthood. 
Maternal advice and support on feeding techniques and breastfeeding positions are often provided, but no studies evaluated the effectiveness of this intervention. Squeezable rather than rigid bottles may be easier to use for feeding babies with cleft lip and/or palate, and breastfeeding may have growth advantages over spoon‐feeding following cleft lip surgery. Only five studies (including 292 babies) compared the effects of feeding interventions in babies with cleft lip and/or palate on growth, development or parental satisfaction. Evidence for breastfeeding rather than spoon‐feeding following surgery was weak and there was a suggestion that squeezable bottles may be more manageable than rigid ones. No evidence was found to support the use of maxillary plates in babies with unilateral clefts and no studies assessed the effects of maternal advice or support. Further research is required to assess the most effective feeding interventions to prevent developmental delays in infants with cleft lip and/or palate.

## Plain Title
A Study of Different Feeding Methods for Babies Born with Cleft Lip or Cleft Palate

## Rationale

Some babies are born with a cleft lip or cleft palate. This means they have an opening in their lip or the roof of their mouth. The opening can be small or large. It can be on one side or both sides of the face.

These openings make it hard for babies to eat and drink. Babies with clefts may not get enough food. When babies do not get enough food, they may not grow well. Research shows that children born with clefts may have delays in how they grow and develop.

Doctors and nurses want to find the best ways to feed these babies. Good feeding methods can help babies get the food they need. This can help them grow and develop better. The researchers wanted to compare different feeding methods to see which ones work best.

## Trial Design

The researchers looked at studies that tested different feeding methods. They wanted to find studies that looked at babies with cleft lip or cleft palate. The babies could be any age up to 6 months old.

The researchers looked for studies that tested these feeding methods:
- Advice and support given to mothers about how to feed their babies
- Special bottles that can be squeezed
- Regular bottles that cannot be squeezed
- Special teats (nipples) for bottles
- Plates placed in the roof of the mouth to close the opening
- Breastfeeding with extra support
- Spoon feeding after surgery

The researchers wanted to know if these methods helped babies grow better. They also wanted to know if parents were happy with the feeding methods.

The researchers looked at what happened to the babies at any time. This could be when they were still babies or even when they grew up to be adults.

## Results

The researchers found only 5 studies to review. These studies included 292 babies total. This is a small number of studies.

The main findings were:
- No studies tested whether advice and support for mothers helped babies grow better
- Squeezable bottles may be easier to use than regular hard bottles
- Breastfeeding may help babies grow better than spoon feeding after cleft lip surgery
- The evidence for breastfeeding was weak and not very strong
- No evidence showed that plates in the mouth helped babies with clefts on one side

The researchers found that more studies are needed. There is not enough information to know which feeding methods work best. Doctors and nurses often give mothers advice about feeding positions and techniques. But no studies have tested if this advice really helps.

The researchers concluded that we need more research. We need to learn which feeding methods help babies with clefts grow and develop best. This will help prevent delays in growth and development. Better feeding methods can help these babies get the nutrition they need.

The study shows that this is an important area that needs more attention. Families and doctors need better information about the best ways to feed babies with cleft lip or cleft palate.",10.1002-14651858.CD003315,"Feeding interventions for growth and development in infants with cleft lip, cleft palate or cleft lip and palate 
Cleft lip and cleft palate (the roof of the mouth) are common defects. The severity of the cleft (opening) varies and it can occur on one (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral). It can be difficult to feed babies enough nutritious food when they have this condition, and there is evidence of delayed development in children born with cleft. 
This review aimed to compare the effects of different feeding interventions such as maternal advice and support, modified bottles and/or teats, obturating or maxillary plates (plates placed in the roof of the mouth to artificially close the cleft palate) and supplemental breastfeeding in babies with cleft lip and/or palate prior to, or following, closure. Interventions in the first 6 months from term and used with breast milk or formula feeding only were considered, but outcomes (measures of growth, development and parental satisfaction) may have been measured at any time including adulthood. 
Maternal advice and support on feeding techniques and breastfeeding positions are often provided, but no studies evaluated the effectiveness of this intervention. Squeezable rather than rigid bottles may be easier to use for feeding babies with cleft lip and/or palate, and breastfeeding may have growth advantages over spoon‐feeding following cleft lip surgery. Only five studies (including 292 babies) compared the effects of feeding interventions in babies with cleft lip and/or palate on growth, development or parental satisfaction. Evidence for breastfeeding rather than spoon‐feeding following surgery was weak and there was a suggestion that squeezable bottles may be more manageable than rigid ones. No evidence was found to support the use of maxillary plates in babies with unilateral clefts and no studies assessed the effects of maternal advice or support. Further research is required to assess the most effective feeding interventions to prevent developmental delays in infants with cleft lip and/or palate.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet ASCVD risk factor control and secondary prevention rates remain low. A fixed‐dose combination of blood pressure‐ and cholesterol‐lowering and antiplatelet treatments into a single pill, or polypill, has been proposed as one strategy to reduce the global burden of ASCVD. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of fixed‐dose combination therapy on all‐cause mortality, fatal and non‐fatal ASCVD events, and adverse events. We also sought to determine the effect of fixed‐dose combination therapy on blood pressure, lipids, adherence, discontinuation rates, health‐related quality of life, and costs. 
Search methods
We updated our previous searches in September 2016 of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and DARE, HTA, and HEED. We also searched two clinical trials registers in September 2016. We used no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of a fixed‐dose combination therapy including at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one lipid‐lowering component versus usual care, placebo, or an active drug comparator for any treatment duration in adults 18 years old or older, with no restrictions on presence or absence of pre‐existing ASCVD. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted the data for this update. We evaluated risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed‐effect models when heterogeneity was low (I2 < 50%) and random‐effects models when heterogeneity was high (I2 ≥ 50%). We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality of evidence. 
Main results
In the initial review, we identified nine randomised controlled trials with a total of 7047 participants and four additional trials (n = 2012 participants; mean age range 62 to 63 years; 30% to 37% women) were included in this update. Eight of the 13 trials evaluated the effects of fixed‐dose combination (FDC) therapy in populations without prevalent ASCVD, and the median follow‐up ranged from six weeks to 23 months. More recent trials were generally larger with longer follow‐up and lower risk of bias. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Compared with the comparator groups (placebo, usual care, or active drug comparator), the effects of the fixed‐dose combination treatment on mortality (FDC = 1.0% versus control = 1.0%, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.89,  I2 = 0%, 5 studies, N = 5300) and fatal and non‐fatal ASCVD events (FDC = 4.7% versus control = 3.7%, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66, I2 = 0%, 6 studies, N = 4517) were uncertain (low‐quality evidence). The low event rates for these outcomes and indirectness of evidence for comparing fixed‐dose combination to usual care versus individual drugs suggest that these results should be viewed with caution. Adverse events were common in both the intervention (32%) and comparator (27%) groups, with participants randomised to fixed‐dose combination therapy being 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25, 11 studies, 6906 participants, moderate‐quality evidence) more likely to report an adverse event . The mean differences in systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control arms was ‐6.34 mmHg (95% CI ‐9.03 to ‐3.64, 13 trials, 7638 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). The mean differences (95% CI) in total and LDL cholesterol between the intervention and control arms were ‐0.61 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.88 to ‐0.35, 11 trials, 6565 participants, low‐quality evidence) and ‐0.70 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.41, 12 trials, 7153 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), respectively. There was a high degree of statistical heterogeneity in comparisons of blood pressure and lipids (I2 ≥ 80% for all) that could not be explained, so these results should be viewed with caution. Fixed‐dose combination therapy improved adherence to a multidrug strategy by 44% (26% to 65%) compared with usual care (4 trials, 3835 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
The effects of fixed‐dose combination therapy on all‐cause mortality or ASCVD events are uncertain. A limited number of trials reported these outcomes, and the included trials were primarily designed to observe changes in ASCVD risk factor levels rather than clinical events, which may partially explain the observed differences in risk factors that were not translated into differences in clinical outcomes among the included trials. Fixed‐dose combination therapy is associated with modest increases in adverse events compared with placebo, active comparator, or usual care but may be associated with improved adherence to a multidrug regimen. Ongoing, longer‐term trials of fixed‐dose combination therapy will help demonstrate whether short‐term changes in risk factors might be maintained and lead to expected differences in clinical events based on these changes. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing a Single Pill That Combines Multiple Heart Medicines

## Plain Title

Can a single pill containing blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood-thinning medicines help prevent heart disease and death?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Heart and blood vessel disease is the top cause of death around the world. This disease happens when arteries get blocked or damaged. It can lead to heart attacks and strokes.

**Why is this a problem for patients?**

Many people who need treatment do not take all their medicines correctly. This puts them at higher risk of serious health problems and death.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to test a new approach. They combined several medicines into one pill. This pill is called a polypill. It contains medicine to lower blood pressure, medicine to lower cholesterol, and medicine to prevent blood clots.

**Why might this approach work?**

Taking one pill instead of many separate pills might be easier for patients. When treatment is easier, people may be more likely to take their medicine every day. This could help prevent heart attacks and strokes.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 13 different studies. These studies tested the polypill approach in different ways. Some studies compared the polypill to fake pills (placebo). Others compared it to usual care or other active medicines.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 9,059 adults total. Most participants were around 62 to 63 years old. About 3 out of 10 participants were women. Most people in the studies did not have heart disease when they started.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies lasted different amounts of time. The shortest was 6 weeks. The longest was 23 months (almost 2 years).

## Results

**What did the researchers find about deaths?**

The polypill did not clearly reduce deaths. About 1 out of 100 people died in both the polypill group and the comparison group. Researchers are not certain about this finding because not many people died during these studies.

**What about heart attacks and strokes?**

The polypill did not clearly prevent heart attacks and strokes. About 5 out of 100 people in the polypill group had these events. About 4 out of 100 people in the comparison group had these events. Again, researchers are uncertain about this finding.

**Did the polypill cause side effects?**

Yes, side effects were common. About 32 out of 100 people taking the polypill had side effects. About 27 out of 100 people in the comparison groups had side effects. People taking the polypill were slightly more likely to report side effects.

**Did the polypill improve risk factors?**

Yes, the polypill did improve some measurements:
- Blood pressure dropped by about 6 points
- Total cholesterol levels went down
- Bad cholesterol (LDL) levels went down

**Did people take their medicines more often?**

Yes. People taking the polypill were 44% more likely to take their medicine as directed. This was compared to people taking separate pills.

**What do these results mean?**

The polypill improved risk factors like blood pressure and cholesterol. It also helped people take their medicine more regularly. However, the studies did not clearly show that the polypill prevented deaths or heart problems.

**Why might this be?**

Most studies were short. They were designed to measure blood pressure and cholesterol, not deaths or heart attacks. Longer studies are needed to see if the improvements in risk factors lead to fewer heart attacks and deaths over time.

**What happens next?**

Longer studies are currently underway. These studies will help show whether the polypill can prevent heart attacks, strokes, and deaths when taken for many years.",10.1002-14651858.CD009868,"Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke
Review question: We reviewed the evidence about the effect of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. We found 13 studies including 9059 participants. 
Background: We wanted to discover whether using fixed‐dose combination therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care, placebo, or giving drugs separately, for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. This report represents an update from a previous review published in 2014. 
Study characteristics: The evidence is current to September 2016. Four studies included individuals with a prior heart attack or stroke or with a high predicted risk for having an initial heart attack and five studies had long‐term (12 months or more) follow‐up. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Most study participants were middle‐aged men with moderate elevations in blood pressure or cholesterol. Two studies specifically included ethnic Aboriginal or Maori minorities in half of the study participants. The fixed‐dose combinations ranged from two to five drugs; all studies included at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one cholesterol‐lowering drug. 
Key results: The effects of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on all‐cause mortality and fatal and non‐fatal heart attacks and strokes are uncertain, primarily due to the low number of participants experiencing these events in these studies (fewer than 5% for both) and comparisons with usual care (low‐quality evidence). Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy leads to more adverse events than control (32% versus 27%), including placebo (moderate‐quality evidence). This information is not surprising since aspirin, blood pressure‐lowering drugs and cholesterol drugs are known to increase the risk for side effects compared with placebo. Fixed‐dose combination therapy may modestly lower blood pressure (˜6 mmHg) and cholesterol (‐0.6 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol), but these effects were not consistent (moderate‐quality evidence for blood pressure and LDL cholesterol but low‐quality evidence of total cholesterol). Fixed‐dose combination therapy appears to improve adherence to medications to prevent ASCVD (moderate‐quality evidence). 
Quality of the evidence: The quality of evidence from these studies generally ranged from moderate to low. Ongoing trials of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy will likely inform clinical endpoints to guide decision‐making.

Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is the third leading cause of neonatal mortality globally constituting 13% of overall neonatal mortality. Despite the high burden of neonatal sepsis, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. Due to the diagnostic challenges of sepsis and the relative immunosuppression of the newborn, many neonates receive antibiotics for suspected sepsis. Antibiotics have become the most used therapeutics in neonatal intensive care units, and observational studies in high‐income countries suggest that 83% to 94% of newborns treated with antibiotics for suspected sepsis have negative blood cultures. The last Cochrane Review was updated in 2005. There is a need for an updated systematic review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Objectives
To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL (2021, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase Ovid; CINAHL; LILACS; Science Citation Index EXPANDED and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science on 12 March 2021. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. We included participants older than 72 hours of life at randomisation, suspected or diagnosed with neonatal sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, or necrotising enterocolitis. We excluded trials that assessed treatment of fungal infections. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcome was all‐cause mortality, and our secondary outcomes were: serious adverse events, respiratory support, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, necrotising enterocolitis, and ototoxicity. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow‐up. 
Main results
We included five RCTs (580 participants). All trials were at high risk of bias, and had very low‐certainty evidence. 
The five included trials assessed five different comparisons of antibiotics.
We did not conduct a meta‐analysis due to lack of relevant data.
Of the five included trials one trial compared cefazolin plus amikacin with vancomycin plus amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with flucloxacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared cloxacillin plus amikacin with cefotaxime plus gentamicin; one trial compared meropenem with standard care (ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime plus gentamicin); and one trial compared vancomycin plus gentamicin with vancomycin plus aztreonam. 
None of the five comparisons found any evidence of a difference when assessing all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, or necrotising enterocolitis; however, none of the trials were near an information size that could contribute significantly to the evidence of the comparative benefits and risks of any particular antibiotic regimen. 
None of the trials assessed respiratory support or ototoxicity.
The benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the lack of well‐powered trials and the high risk of systematic errors. 
Authors' conclusions
Current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. RCTs assessing different antibiotic regimens in late‐onset neonatal sepsis with low risks of bias are warranted. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Antibiotics for Infections in Newborn Babies

## Plain Title

Comparing different antibiotics to treat infections that start after the first 3 days of life in newborn babies.

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Newborn babies can get serious infections called sepsis. Sepsis is when germs get into the blood and spread through the body. This is a major problem for newborns around the world. Sepsis is the third most common cause of death in newborn babies. It causes 13 out of every 100 newborn deaths.

**Why is this a problem?**

It is hard to know for sure if a newborn has sepsis. Newborn babies also have weak immune systems. This means their bodies cannot fight germs as well as older children or adults. Because of this, doctors give antibiotics to many babies who might have sepsis. Antibiotics are medicines that kill germs.

Antibiotics are now the most used medicine in units that care for sick newborns. Studies show that 83 to 94 out of every 100 babies who get antibiotics do not actually have germs in their blood. This means many babies get antibiotics they may not need.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need to know which antibiotics work best for newborn sepsis. The last major review of studies on this topic was done in 2005. An updated review was needed to help doctors choose the best antibiotics for babies with late-onset sepsis. Late-onset sepsis means the infection starts after the baby is 3 days old.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

The researchers looked for all studies that compared different antibiotics for late-onset sepsis in newborns. They searched medical databases up to March 2021.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included newborn babies who were older than 72 hours (3 days) when they joined the study. These babies had suspected or confirmed infections. The infections could be sepsis, brain infections, bone infections, heart infections, or gut infections.

**What did the studies compare?**

The researchers found 5 studies with 580 babies total. Each study compared two different antibiotic treatments:
- Study 1: cefazolin plus amikacin versus vancomycin plus amikacin
- Study 2: ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid versus flucloxacillin plus gentamicin
- Study 3: cloxacillin plus amikacin versus cefotaxime plus gentamicin
- Study 4: meropenem versus standard care (ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime plus gentamicin)
- Study 5: vancomycin plus gentamicin versus vancomycin plus aztreonam

**What did the researchers measure?**

The main thing they looked at was death from any cause. They also looked at serious side effects, need for breathing support, need for heart support, kidney damage, brain development problems, gut infections, and hearing damage.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

None of the 5 studies found clear differences between the antibiotic treatments. The studies did not show that one antibiotic was better than another for preventing death or serious side effects.

However, all 5 studies had problems with how they were done. The studies were also too small. They did not include enough babies to give clear answers.

None of the studies looked at breathing support or hearing damage.

**What do the results mean?**

The researchers cannot say which antibiotic treatment works best. There is not enough good evidence to recommend one antibiotic over another for late-onset sepsis in newborns.

**What happens next?**

Better studies are needed. Future studies should include more babies and be done more carefully. This will help doctors know which antibiotics work best and are safest for newborn babies with infections.",10.1002-14651858.CD013836,"Antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis
Review question 
We reviewed the available evidence on different antibiotic regimens for newborns (from 72 hours of life to one month of life) with late‐onset sepsis. 
Background 
Sepsis in newborns is a severe and potential lethal condition, caused by the body's response to an infection. Neonatal sepsis is the third leading cause of neonatal death globally. Despite this high burden of sepsis in newborns, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. This Cochrane Review was originally published in 2005. To identify the most appropriate antibiotic policies for neonatal sepsis, there is a need to base these policies on an updated well‐conducted review. Therefore, there is a need for such a review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to March 2021. We included five trials randomising 580 participants. The five trials compared five different antibiotic regimens. 
Key results 
We included five trials: one trial compared cefazolin plus amikacin with vancomycin plus amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with flucloxacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared cloxacillin plus amikacin with cefotaxime plus gentamicin; one trial compared meropenem with standard care (ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime plus gentamicin); and one trial compared vancomycin plus gentamicin with vancomycin plus aztreonam. 
None of the five antibiotic comparisons showed that the choice of antibiotics influenced the effects on death from all‐causes, serious adverse events (i.e. major complications), circulatory support, nephrotoxicity (toxicity in the kidneys), neurological developmental impairment (disabilities in the functioning of the brain that affect a child's behaviour, memory, or ability to learn), or necrotising enterocolitis (tissues in the gut become inflamed and start to die). Current evidence cannot confirm or reject, one antibiotic regimen being superior to another due to scarce data. 
Quality of the evidence 
Our conclusions are based on very low‐quality evidence. The five trials were at high risk of bias (i.e. the trials were conducted in a way that may have skewed results to the positive side). In addition, the five trials included few participants, making the results of this review imprecise.

181,10.1002-14651858.CD013717.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
In late 2019, the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) were reported in Wuhan, China, followed by a worldwide spread. Numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, travel restrictions, screening at borders, and quarantine of travellers. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of international travel‐related control measures during the COVID‐19 pandemic on infectious disease transmission and screening‐related outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID‐19‐specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the WHO Global Database on COVID‐19 Research to 13 November 2020. 
Selection criteria
We considered experimental, quasi‐experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel‐related control measures affecting human travel across international borders during the COVID‐19 pandemic. In the original review, we also considered evidence on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In this version we decided to focus on COVID‐19 evidence only. Primary outcome categories were (i) cases avoided, (ii) cases detected, and (iii) a shift in epidemic development. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts. For studies included in the analysis, one review author extracted data and appraised the study. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of data. To assess the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed these GRADE judgements. 
Main results
Overall, we included 62 unique studies in the analysis; 49 were modelling studies and 13 were observational studies. Studies covered a variety of settings and levels of community transmission. 
Most studies compared travel‐related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of stringency of the measures (including relaxation of restrictions), or a combination of measures. 
Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to the selection of travellers and the reference test, and unclear reporting of certain methodological aspects. 
Below we outline the results for each intervention category by illustrating the findings from selected outcomes. 
Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel (31 modelling studies) 
The studies assessed cases avoided and shift in epidemic development. We found very low‐certainty evidence for a reduction in COVID‐19 cases in the community (13 studies) and cases exported or imported (9 studies). Most studies reported positive effects, with effect sizes varying widely; only a few studies showed no effect. 
There was very low‐certainty evidence that cross‐border travel controls can slow the spread of COVID‐19. Most studies predicted positive effects, however, results from individual studies varied from a delay of less than one day to a delay of 85 days; very few studies predicted no effect of the measure. 
Screening at borders (13 modelling studies; 13 observational studies) 
Screening measures covered symptom/exposure‐based screening or test‐based screening (commonly specifying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing), or both, before departure or upon or within a few days of arrival. Studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Studies generally predicted or observed some benefit from screening at borders, however these varied widely. 
For symptom/exposure‐based screening, one modelling study reported that global implementation of screening measures would reduce the number of cases exported per day from another country by 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72% to 95%) (moderate‐certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted delays in epidemic development, although there was wide variation in the results between the studies (very low‐certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted that the proportion of cases detected would range from 1% to 53% (very low‐certainty evidence). Nine observational studies observed the detected proportion to range from 0% to 100% (very low‐certainty evidence), although all but one study observed this proportion to be less than 54%. 
For test‐based screening, one modelling study provided very low‐certainty evidence for the number of cases avoided. It reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases as well as secondary cases. Five observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90% (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Quarantine (12 modelling studies) 
The studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. All studies suggested some benefit of quarantine, however the magnitude of the effect ranged from small to large across the different outcomes (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence). Three modelling studies predicted that the reduction in the number of cases in the community ranged from 450 to over 64,000 fewer cases (very low‐certainty evidence). The variation in effect was possibly related to the duration of quarantine and compliance. 
Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies; 4 observational studies) 
The studies assessed shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Most studies predicted positive effects for the combined measures with varying magnitudes (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence). Four observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected for quarantine and screening at borders ranged from 68% to 92% (low‐certainty evidence). The variation may depend on how the measures were combined, including the length of the quarantine period and days when the test was conducted in quarantine. 
Authors' conclusions
With much of the evidence derived from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real‐world' evidence. The certainty of the evidence for most travel‐related control measures and outcomes is very low and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Symptom/exposure‐based screening measures at borders on their own are likely not effective; PCR testing at borders as a screening measure likely detects more cases than symptom/exposure‐based screening at borders, although if performed only upon arrival this will likely also miss a meaningful proportion of cases. Quarantine, based on a sufficiently long quarantine period and high compliance is likely to largely avoid further transmission from travellers. Combining quarantine with PCR testing at borders will likely improve effectiveness. Many studies suggest that effects depend on factors, such as levels of community transmission, travel volumes and duration, other public health measures in place, and the exact specification and timing of the measure. Future research should be better reported, employ a range of designs beyond modelling and assess potential benefits and harms of the travel‐related control measures from a societal perspective.

How Well Do Travel Rules and Border Checks Stop COVID-19 From Spreading Between Countries?

## Rationale

### What is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?

In late 2019, a new disease called COVID-19 started in China. It spread quickly around the world. The virus that causes COVID-19 passes easily from person to person. This made it hard to control.

### What did countries do about travel?

Many countries tried to stop COVID-19 from spreading across their borders. They used different travel rules. Some countries closed their borders completely. Others checked people at airports and borders. Some countries made travelers stay in quarantine. This means staying away from others for a set time.

### Why did researchers do this study?

Researchers wanted to know if these travel rules actually worked. Did they stop COVID-19 from spreading? Did they find sick people before they could spread the virus? This information could help countries make better choices about travel rules.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study this?

This was not a typical medical study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at many other studies. They searched medical databases up to November 2020. They found 62 studies to review.

Most studies (49 out of 62) used computer models. These models predict what might happen. The other 13 studies looked at real-world data. They watched what actually happened when countries used travel rules.

### What did the studies look at?

The studies looked at different types of travel controls:
- Stopping or limiting travel between countries
- Checking people at borders for symptoms or exposure
- Testing people for COVID-19 at borders
- Making travelers quarantine after arrival
- Using quarantine and testing together

The studies tried to answer these questions:
- How many COVID-19 cases were prevented?
- How many sick people were found?
- Did the measures slow down the spread?

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**Travel restrictions (stopping or limiting travel):**

Studies suggested that travel limits might reduce COVID-19 cases. They might also slow down how fast the virus spreads. However, the results varied a lot between studies. Some showed big effects. Others showed small effects. The evidence quality was very low.

**Checking for symptoms at borders:**

One study found that checking all travelers worldwide could stop 82 out of 100 cases from crossing borders. However, most studies found that symptom checks alone missed many sick people. They only found between 1 and 53 out of 100 cases. Real-world studies showed similar results. Most found fewer than 54 out of 100 cases. The evidence quality was very low to moderate.

**Testing at borders:**

Testing people with a COVID-19 test worked better than symptom checks. Studies found that testing caught between 58 and 90 out of 100 cases. But testing only when people arrive still misses some cases. The evidence quality was very low.

**Quarantine:**

Quarantine helped prevent COVID-19 spread. The effect depended on two things: how long people stayed in quarantine and whether they followed the rules. Studies predicted quarantine could prevent anywhere from 450 to over 64,000 cases. The evidence quality was very low to low.

**Quarantine plus testing:**

Using quarantine and testing together worked better than either one alone. Studies found this combination caught between 68 and 92 out of 100 cases. How well it worked depended on the quarantine length and when tests were done. The evidence quality was low.

### What do these results mean?

Travel rules may help slow COVID-19 spread between countries. However, no single measure works perfectly. Combining measures works better. For example, quarantine plus testing finds more cases than testing alone.

The results also depend on other factors:
- How much COVID-19 is already in the community
- How many people are traveling
- What other health measures are in place

### What are the limitations?

Most evidence came from computer models, not real-world data. The quality of evidence was mostly very low. This means the true effects might be quite different. More real-world studies are needed to know for sure how well these measures work.",10.1002-14651858.CD013717,"Can international travel‐related control measures contain the spread of the COVID‐19 pandemic? 
What are international travel‐related control measures? 
International travel control measures are methods to manage international travel to contain the spread of COVID‐19. Measures include: 
‐ closing international borders to stop travellers crossing from one country to another;
‐ restricting travel to and from certain countries, particularly those with high infection levels; 
‐ screening or testing travellers entering or leaving a country if they have symptoms or have been in contact with an infected person; 
‐ quarantining newly‐arrived travellers from another country, that is, requiring travellers to stay at home or in a specific place for a certain time. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how effective international travel‐related control measures are in containing the COVID‐19 pandemic. 
What we did 
We searched for studies on the effects of these measures on the spread of COVID‐19. Studies had to report how many cases these measures prevented or detected, or whether they changed the course of the pandemic. The studies could include people of any age, anywhere. They could be of any design including those that used ‘real‐life’ data (observational studies) or hypothetical data from computer‐generated simulations (modelling studies). 
This is the first update of our review. This update includes only studies on COVID‐19, published up to 13 November 2020. 
What we found 
We found 62 studies. Most (49 studies) were modelling studies; only 13 used real‐life data (observational studies). Studies took place across the world and at different times during the pandemic. Levels of COVID‐19 within countries varied. 
Most studies compared current travel‐related control measures with no travel‐related controls. However, some modelling studies also compared current measures against possible measures, for example, to see what might happen if controls were more or less relaxed or were combined with other measures. 
Main results 
Below we summarise the findings of some outcomes.
Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel (31 modelling studies) 
Most studies showed that travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel were beneficial, but this beneficial effect ranged from small to large. Additionally, some studies found no effect. Studies also predicted that these restrictions would delay the outbreak, but the delay ranged from one day to 85 days in different studies. 
Screening at borders (13 modelling studies and 13 observational studies) 
These studies assessed screening at borders, including screening people with symptoms or who had potentially been exposed to COVID‐19, or testing people, before or after they travelled. 
For screening based on symptoms or potential exposure to COVID‐19, modelling studies found that screening reduced imported or exported cases and delayed outbreaks. Modelling studies predicted that 1% to 53% of cases would be detected. Observational studies reported a wide range of cases detected, from 0% to 100%, with the majority of studies reporting less than 54% of cases detected. 
For screening based on testing, studies reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases, and cases detected. Observational studies reported that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90%. This variation might be due to the timing of testing. 
Quarantine (12 modelling studies) 
All studies suggested that quarantine may be beneficial, but the size of this effect ranged from small to large in the different studies. Modelling studies, for example, predicted that quarantine could lead to between 450 and over 64,000 fewer cases in the community. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how well they followed the rules. 
Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies and 4 observational studies) 
For quarantine and screening at borders, most studies suggested some benefit, however the size of this effect differed between studies. For example, observational studies reported that between 68% and 92% of cases would be detected. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how often they were tested while in quarantine. 
How reliable are these results? 
Our confidence in these results is limited. Most studies were based on mathematical predictions (modelling), so we lack real‐life evidence. Further, we were not confident that models used correct assumptions, so our confidence in the evidence on travel restrictions and quarantine, in particular, is very low. Some studies were published quickly online as ‘preprints’. Preprints do not undergo the normal rigorous checks of published studies, so we are not certain how reliable they are. Also, the studies were very different from each other and their results varied according to the specification of each travel measure (e.g. the type of screening approach), how it was put into practice and enforced, the amount of cross‐border travel, levels of community transmission and other types of national measures to control the pandemic. 
What this means 
Overall, international travel‐related control measures may help to limit the spread of COVID‐19 across national borders. Restricting cross‐border travel can be a helpful measure. Screening travellers only for symptoms at borders is likely to miss many cases; testing may be more effective but may also miss cases if only performed upon arrival. Quarantine that lasts at least 10 days can prevent travellers spreading COVID‐19 and may be more effective if combined with another measure such as testing, especially if people follow the rules. 
Future research needs to be better reported. More studies should focus on real‐life evidence, and should assess potential benefits and risks of travel‐related control measures to individuals and society as a whole.

Remote cognitive assessments are increasingly needed to assist in the detection of cognitive disorders, but the diagnostic accuracy of telephone‐ and video‐based cognitive screening remains unclear. 
Objectives
To assess the test accuracy of any multidomain cognitive test delivered remotely for the diagnosis of any form of dementia. 
To assess for potential differences in cognitive test scoring when using a remote platform, and where a remote screener was compared to the equivalent face‐to‐face test. 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov/) databases on 2 June 2021. We performed forward and backward searching of included citations. 
Selection criteria
We included cross‐sectional studies, where a remote, multidomain assessment was administered alongside a clinical diagnosis of dementia or equivalent face‐to‐face test. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data; a third review author moderated disagreements. Our primary analysis was the accuracy of remote assessments against a clinical diagnosis of dementia. Where data were available, we reported test accuracy as sensitivity and specificity. We did not perform quantitative meta‐analysis as there were too few studies at individual test level. 
For those studies comparing remote versus in‐person use of an equivalent screening test, if data allowed, we described correlations, reliability, differences in scores and the proportion classified as having cognitive impairment for each test. 
Main results
The review contains 31 studies (19 differing tests, 3075 participants), of which seven studies (six telephone, one video call, 756 participants) were relevant to our primary objective of describing test accuracy against a clinical diagnosis of dementia. All studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain, but were low risk in applicability to the review question. Overall, sensitivity of remote tools varied with values between 26% and 100%, and specificity between 65% and 100%, with no clearly superior test. 
Across the 24 papers comparing equivalent remote and in‐person tests (14 telephone, 10 video call), agreement between tests was good, but rarely perfect (correlation coefficient range: 0.48 to 0.98). 
Authors' conclusions
Despite the common and increasing use of remote cognitive assessment, supporting evidence on test accuracy is limited. Available data do not allow us to suggest a preferred test. Remote testing is complex, and this is reflected in the heterogeneity seen in tests used, their application, and their analysis. More research is needed to describe accuracy of contemporary approaches to remote cognitive assessment. While data comparing remote and in‐person use of a test were reassuring, thresholds and scoring rules derived from in‐person testing may not be applicable when the equivalent test is adapted for remote use.

How Well Do Phone and Video Tests Work to Find Memory and Thinking Problems?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**
Some people have memory and thinking problems. These problems can be a sign of dementia. Dementia makes it hard to remember things, think clearly, and do daily tasks. It affects millions of people around the world.

**Why is this study needed?**
Doctors usually test for memory problems in person. But sometimes people cannot visit a doctor's office. They may live far away. They may have trouble traveling. Or there may be other reasons they cannot come in person.

Doctors now use phone calls and video calls to test memory. But we do not know how well these remote tests work. We need to know if these tests can find memory problems as well as in-person tests.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to answer two main questions:
- Can phone and video tests correctly find people who have dementia?
- Do these remote tests give the same results as in-person tests?

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**
This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at 31 studies that other scientists had already done. These studies included 3,075 people total.

The researchers looked at 19 different types of memory tests. Some tests were done by phone. Some were done by video call.

**What did the studies include?**
Seven studies tested whether remote tests could find dementia. These studies had 756 people. Six studies used phone calls. One study used video calls.

The other 24 studies compared remote tests to in-person tests. They checked if the tests gave similar scores. Fourteen studies used phone calls. Ten studies used video calls.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included adults who might have memory problems. Some had dementia. Some did not. This helped researchers see if the tests could tell the difference.

## Results

**What did researchers find about finding dementia?**
The remote tests did not work the same way every time. Some tests found most people with dementia. Other tests missed many people with dementia.

The tests correctly found between 26 and 100 out of every 100 people with dementia. The tests correctly ruled out dementia in 65 to 100 out of every 100 people without dementia.

No single test was clearly the best.

**What about comparing remote and in-person tests?**
When researchers compared phone or video tests to in-person tests, the results were mostly similar. But they were not exactly the same.

The scores from remote tests and in-person tests matched fairly well. But there were some differences.

**What are the main conclusions?**
Doctors are using remote memory tests more and more. But we do not have enough proof that these tests work well.

The research we have now cannot tell us which test is best. Remote testing is complicated. Different studies used different tests in different ways.

We need more research on remote memory tests. We especially need studies on newer ways of testing.

One important finding: A test that works well in person may not work the same way by phone or video. Doctors may need to use different scoring rules for remote tests.

**Why does this matter?**
This study shows we need better information about remote memory tests. Doctors want to help patients who cannot come to the office. But they need to know which tests work best. More research will help doctors choose the right tests and use them correctly.",10.1002-14651858.CD013724,"How accurate are remote, virtual assessments at diagnosing dementia?
Why is this question important? 
Dementia is a chronic and progressive condition that affects peoples' memory and ability to function day‐to‐day. A clinical diagnosis of dementia usually involves brain scans, physical examinations and history taking. As a first step, we often use memory and thinking tests to identify people who need further assessment. Traditionally these tests are performed in‐person, but modifications of the tests allow them to be used over the telephone or via video calls – sometimes called 'remote assessment'. 
The need for remote assessment has become particularly urgent due to COVID‐19. However, there are potential benefits of remote assessment beyond the COVID‐19 pandemic. Physically attending appointments can be difficult for some people and remote assessments offer greater convenience. Remote assessments are also useful in research, as a large number of people can be reached in a fairly short amount of time. 
A test delivered by telephone may not be as good as the in‐person equivalent, and getting these tests right is important. One the one hand, If a test suggests someone has dementia when they do not (called a false positive), this can have an emotional impact on the person and their family. On the other hand, not identifying memory and thinking problems when they are present (called a false negative), mean that the person does not get the treatment and support that they need. 
What was the aim of this review? 
We aimed to assess whether memory and thinking tests carried out by telephone or video call can detect dementia. 
What was studied in this review? 
We looked at various memory and thinking tests. Many tests have been developed over time and they differ in their content and application, but most are based on a modification of a traditional in‐person test. 
What were the main results of this review? 
The review included 31 studies, using 19 different memory tests, with a total of 3075 participants. 
Only seven tests were relevant to our question regarding accuracy of remote testing. With the limited number of studies, estimates on the accuracy of these tests are imprecise. Our review suggests that remote tests could correctly identify people with dementia between 26% and 100% of the time, and could correctly rule out dementia 65% to 100% of the time. 
The remaining 24 studies compared a remote test with the face‐to‐face equivalent. These studies suggested that remote test scores usually agreed with in‐person testing, but this was not perfect. 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
In these studies, a clinical diagnosis of dementia was used as the reference (gold) standard. We identified a number of issues in the design, conduct and reporting of the studies. A particular issue was around the selection of participants for the studies. Studies often did not include people with hearing or language impairments that may have complicated remote testing. 
Who do the results of this study apply to? 
Most studies investigated older adults (over 65 years). The findings may not be representative of all older adults with dementia, as some studies only examined specific groups of people, for example, after stroke. The studies were usually performed in specialist centres by experts. So, we do not know how well these tests identify dementia in routine community practice. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The review highlights the lack of high‐quality research describing accuracy of telephone‐ and video call‐based memory and thinking tests. There were many differences between the studies included in this review such as the type of test used, participants included, the setting in which the study is carried out and language studied. This made comparisons between studies difficult. Our review suggests that remote assessments and in‐person assessments are not always equivalent. In situations where access to in‐person assessment is difficult, remote testing could be used as a useful first step. Ideally, this should be followed up with an in‐person assessment before a diagnosis is made. Due to limited studies, and differences in the way studies were carried out, we cannot recommend one particular remote test for the assessment of dementia.

","# Plain Language Summary: Hypnosis for Starting Labor

## Plain Title
Can Hypnosis Help Start Labor in Pregnant Women?

## Rationale

**What is labor induction?**
Labor induction means doctors help start labor using medical methods. This is often done when a woman is past her due date or when there are health concerns for the mother or baby.

**What are the current problems?**
Doctors usually use drugs or medical tools to start labor. These methods can sometimes cause problems. Women may bleed more than normal. They may need a cesarean section (surgery to deliver the baby). The uterus (womb) may contract too much or too hard. Both mothers and babies can get infections.

**What is hypnosis?**
Hypnosis is a way to help people relax deeply. The person closes their eyes and focuses on calm thoughts or images. They tune out what is happening around them. Hypnosis has been used to help reduce pain during labor. It may help women who feel very worried or scared about giving birth.

**Why study hypnosis for starting labor?**
Hypnosis might be a safe way to start labor without drugs or medical tools. It may help women feel more confident and calm. It could also cost less money for hospitals and healthcare systems. However, no one has tested whether hypnosis actually works to start labor.

**What did researchers want to find out?**
Researchers wanted to know if hypnosis can safely and effectively help start labor in pregnant women. They especially wanted to study women who feel very anxious about giving birth.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers look for answers?**
The researchers searched for studies that tested hypnosis for starting labor. They looked for a specific type of study called a randomized controlled trial. This is the best way to test if a treatment works.

**What did they find?**
The researchers did not find any studies that met their requirements. No trials have been done yet to test hypnosis for starting labor.

**What type of study is needed?**
Future studies should include pregnant women who need labor induction. The studies should especially include women with high levels of worry or fear. Researchers need to track how long women are in the study. They need to see if hypnosis is safe and if it works.

**What else should be studied?**
Future studies should answer these questions:
- How long should hypnosis sessions last?
- When should hypnosis be used during pregnancy?
- What training do doctors and nurses need?
- What do women think about using hypnosis?
- What do healthcare workers think about it?

## Results

**What did this review find?**
The researchers found no completed studies to review. This means we do not know if hypnosis works to start labor. We also do not know if it is safe.

**What does this mean for patients?**
Right now, there is no proof that hypnosis can help start labor. More research is needed before doctors can recommend it.

**Important safety note:**
If a woman tries hypnosis, it might delay standard medical care. Doctors might wait to see if hypnosis works before using proven methods. This could be risky in some cases.

**What do researchers recommend?**
Doctors should think carefully about each woman's situation. They should only consider hypnosis on a case-by-case basis. The safety of the mother and baby must come first.

**What needs to happen next?**
Scientists need to do proper studies to test hypnosis. These studies will show if hypnosis is safe and helpful. Until then, women should talk to their doctors about proven methods to start labor.

**Conclusion:**
Hypnosis might be a helpful way to start labor, but we need research to prove it. Women who are very anxious about giving birth might benefit most. However, no studies have tested this yet. More research is needed before hypnosis can be recommended as a safe option.",10.1002-14651858.CD010852,"Hypnosis for induction of labour

People with dementia in nursing homes often experience pain, but often do not receive adequate pain therapy. The experience of pain has a significant impact on quality of life in people with dementia, and is associated with negative health outcomes. Untreated pain is also considered to be one of the causes of challenging behaviour, such as agitation or aggression, in this population. One approach to reducing pain in people with dementia in nursing homes is an algorithm‐based pain management strategy, i.e. the use of a structured protocol that involves pain assessment and a series of predefined treatment steps consisting of various non‐pharmacological and pharmacological pain management interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of algorithm‐based pain management interventions to reduce pain and challenging behaviour in people with dementia living in nursing homes. 
To describe the components of the interventions and the content of the algorithms.
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 30 June 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of algorithm‐based pain management interventions for people with dementia living in nursing homes. All interventions had to include an initial pain assessment, a treatment algorithm (a treatment plan consisting of at least two different non‐pharmacological or pharmacological treatment steps to reduce pain), and criteria to assess the success of each treatment step. The control groups could receive usual care or an active control intervention. Primary outcomes for this review were pain‐related outcomes, e.g. the number of participants with pain (self‐ or proxy‐rated), challenging behaviour (we used a broad definition that could also include agitation or behavioural and psychological symptoms assessed with any validated instrument), and serious adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected the articles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of all included studies. We reported results narratively as there were too few studies for a meta‐analysis. We used GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the results. 
Main results
We included three cluster‐randomised controlled trials with a total of 808 participants (mean age 82 to 89 years). In two studies, participants had severe cognitive impairment and in one study mild to moderate impairment. The algorithms used in the studies varied in the number of treatment steps. The comparator was pain education for nursing staff in two studies and usual care in one study. 
We judged the risk of detection bias to be high in one study. The risk of selection bias and performance bias was unclear in all studies. 
Self‐rated pain (i.e. pain rated by participants themselves) was reported in two studies. In one study, all residents in the nursing homes were included, but fewer than half of the participants experienced pain at baseline, and the mean values of self‐rated and proxy‐rated pain at baseline and follow‐up in both study groups were below the threshold of pain that may require treatment. We considered the evidence from this study to be very low‐certainty and therefore are uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had an effect on self‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education (MD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.05, 170 participants; Verbal Descriptor Scale, range 0 to 3). In the other study, all participants had mild to moderate pain at baseline. Here, we found low‐certainty evidence that an algorithm‐based pain management intervention may have little to no effect on self‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education (MD 0.4, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 1.38, 246 participants; Iowa Pain Thermometer, range 0 to 12). 
Pain was rated by proxy in all three studies. Again, we considered the evidence from the study in which mean pain scores indicated no pain, or almost no pain, at baseline to be very low‐certainty and were uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had an effect on proxy‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education. For participants with mild to moderate pain at baseline, we found low‐certainty evidence that an algorithm‐based pain management intervention may reduce proxy‐rated pain intensity in comparison with usual care (MD ‐1.49, 95% CI ‐2.11 to ‐0.87, 1 study, 128 participants; Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale‐Chinese version, range 0 to 10), but may not be more effective than pain education (MD ‐0.2, 95% CI ‐0.79 to 0.39, 1 study, 383 participants; Iowa Pain Thermometer, range 0 to 12). 
For challenging behaviour, we found very low‐certainty evidence from one study in which mean pain scores indicated no pain, or almost no pain, at baseline. We were uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had any more effect than education for nursing staff on challenging behaviour of participants (MD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐1.88 to 1.46, 1 study, 170 participants; Cohen‐Mansfield Agitation Inventory‐Chinese version, range 7 to 203). 
None of the studies systematically assessed adverse effects or serious adverse effects and no study reported information about the occurrence of any adverse effect. None of the studies assessed any of the other outcomes of this review. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no clear evidence for a benefit of an algorithm‐based pain management intervention in comparison with pain education for reducing pain intensity or challenging behaviour in people with dementia in nursing homes. We found that the intervention may reduce proxy‐rated pain compared with usual care. However, the certainty of evidence is low because of the small number of studies, small sample sizes, methodological limitations, and the clinical heterogeneity of the study populations (e.g. pain level and cognitive status). The results should be interpreted with caution. Future studies should also focus on the implementation of algorithms and their impact in clinical practice. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing a Step-by-Step Pain Treatment Plan for People with Dementia in Nursing Homes

## Plain Title
Does using a step-by-step pain treatment plan help reduce pain and difficult behaviors in people with dementia living in nursing homes?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Many people with dementia live in nursing homes. These people often feel pain. But they do not always get the right treatment for their pain. Pain makes life harder for people with dementia. It affects how they feel each day. Pain can also cause difficult behaviors. These behaviors include getting upset, restless, or angry.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to test a new way to treat pain. This method uses a step-by-step plan called an algorithm. The plan works like this: First, staff check if a person has pain. Then they follow treatment steps to help reduce the pain. The steps include different ways to treat pain. Some steps use medicine. Other steps do not use medicine. After each step, staff check if the pain got better. If not, they move to the next step.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if this step-by-step plan works better than usual care. They hoped it would reduce pain. They also hoped it would reduce difficult behaviors caused by pain.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at three studies. These studies included 808 people with dementia. The people were between 82 and 89 years old on average. They all lived in nursing homes.

In two studies, people had severe memory problems. In one study, people had mild to moderate memory problems.

Each study tested a step-by-step pain treatment plan. The plan had different treatment steps. Staff followed these steps to help reduce pain.

Some nursing homes used the step-by-step plan. Other nursing homes did not use this plan. Instead, staff got education about pain. Or they gave usual care.

Researchers then compared the results between the two groups.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The results were mixed and unclear.

**Pain levels:**

Two studies asked people to rate their own pain. In one study, most people had very little pain at the start. Researchers could not tell if the step-by-step plan helped. In the other study, people had mild to moderate pain at the start. The step-by-step plan did not seem to help more than pain education.

All three studies had staff rate pain for the people with dementia. This is called proxy rating. Again, in the study where people had little pain at the start, researchers could not tell if the plan helped. In studies where people had more pain at the start, the step-by-step plan may have helped reduce pain compared to usual care. But it did not work better than pain education.

**Difficult behaviors:**

Only one study looked at difficult behaviors like getting upset or restless. In this study, people had very little pain at the start. Researchers could not tell if the step-by-step plan helped reduce these behaviors.

**Safety:**

None of the studies checked for harmful effects or side effects from the treatments.

**What do these results mean?**

The evidence is not strong or clear. The step-by-step pain plan might help reduce pain compared to usual care. But it does not seem to work better than teaching staff about pain. The plan might not reduce difficult behaviors.

**Why is the evidence unclear?**

There were only three studies. The studies were small. The people in the studies were different from each other. Some had a lot of pain. Others had little pain. Some had severe memory problems. Others had milder problems. These differences make it hard to know what really works.

**What happens next?**

More research is needed. Future studies should test these step-by-step plans with more people. They should also see if nursing homes can use these plans in everyday care.",10.1002-14651858.CD013339,"Step‐by‐step (algorithm‐based) pain management for people with dementia living in nursing homes 
What is the aim of this review? 
We were interested in how nurses can best manage pain in people with dementia living in nursing homes. Pain management involves measuring pain and providing pain treatment if necessary. We aimed to find out whether step‐by‐step guidance (an algorithm) for nurses on how to manage pain can reduce pain or behaviours that may indicate someone is in distress (such as hitting, shouting or wandering). 
What was studied in the review? 
People with dementia in nursing homes often experience pain. However, they cannot always tell their caregivers if they are in pain, so it can be difficult to recognise, and we know that nursing home residents with dementia receive less pain medication than those without dementia. Untreated pain can have a negative impact on well‐being and health, and can also be one reason for challenging behaviour, such as aggression. The use of detailed step‐by‐step guidance for nursing staff, in this review called an algorithm, is designed to improve pain management. Algorithms start with a structured pain assessment and then set out different treatment steps, which can be non‐medication or medication treatments for reducing pain. If pain is detected, the treatment described in the first step is applied. If this treatment does not reduce pain, the treatment from the next step is applied, and so on. 
Studies included in the review 
In June 2021 we searched for trials that investigated pain management based on the use of an algorithm. We found three studies including 808 participants. Two of these studies compared algorithm‐based pain management with education for the nursing staff on pain and dementia, and one study compared algorithm‐based pain management with usual care. 
The level of pain and the severity of the participants' dementia differed in the three studies. One study included all the residents in the nursing homes, most of whom had no pain, or almost no pain, at the start of the study (fewer than half of the included people experienced pain), and two studies included only people with mild to moderate pain. In one study the participants' dementia was of mild or moderate severity and in two studies the participants had severe dementia. 
In two studies, those people with dementia who were able to do so reported on their own pain and the nursing staff also judged whether the participants showed signs of pain. In the third study, pain was rated by members of the research team, but not by the participants themselves. The nurses and the researchers used observations of things like facial expressions, gestures and breathing to judge whether someone was in pain. 
What are the key findings? 
When we looked at the study in which people started out on average with no pain, or almost no pain, we could not be certain whether algorithm‐based pain management had an effect on the intensity of pain they experienced during the study. This was true whether the study participants reported on their own pain or whether nurses judged pain intensity. We also could not tell from this study whether algorithm‐based pain management reduced challenging behaviour. 
For people who started out with mild to moderate pain, we found that, compared to education for nursing staff, algorithm‐based pain management may have little or no effect on pain intensity reported by the people themselves (based on the results from one study). When the pain was rated by somebody else (a 'proxy', who was a nurse or research assistant), we found that algorithm‐based pain management may be better than usual care, although it may not be more effective than pain education. However, it is difficult to be sure about the accuracy of pain ratings made by other people. 
Our confidence in the results was limited because of the small number of included studies, the variation in the intensity of pain and in the severity of the participants' dementia at the start of the trials, and the quality of the studies. 
No study looked for harmful effects, and no study described that any harmful effects occurred. 
What is the conclusion? 
We found no good evidence that introducing an algorithm to guide pain management for people with dementia in nursing homes is any better than education for nursing staff for reducing pain or challenging behaviours, but it may be better than usual care at reducing pain (rated by observers). The amount of evidence was small, and we could not be certain of the results. More research in this area would be valuable.

185,10.1002-14651858.CD013465.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Human milk as compared to formula reduces morbidity in preterm infants but requires fortification to meet their nutritional needs and to reduce the risk of extrauterine growth failure. Standard fortification methods are not individualized to the infant and assume that breast milk is uniform in nutritional content. Strategies for individualizing fortification are available; however it is not known whether these are safe, or if they improve outcomes in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To determine whether individualizing fortification of breast milk feeds in response to infant blood urea nitrogen (adjustable fortification) or to breast milk macronutrient content as measured with a milk analyzer (targeted fortification) reduces mortality and morbidity and promotes growth and development compared to standard, non‐individualized fortification for preterm infants receiving human milk at < 37 weeks' gestation or at birth weight < 2500 grams. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 9), in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Daily and Versions(R); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), on September 20, 2019. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for pertinent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomized trials. 
Selection criteria
We considered randomized, quasi‐randomized, and cluster‐randomized controlled trials of preterm infants fed exclusively breast milk that compared a standard non‐individualized fortification strategy to individualized fortification using a targeted or adjustable strategy. We considered studies that examined any use of fortification in eligible infants for a minimum duration of two weeks, initiated at any time during enteral feeding, and providing any regimen of human milk feeding. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were collected using the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. Two review authors evaluated the quality of the studies and extracted data. We reported analyses of continuous data using mean differences (MDs), and dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
Data were extracted from seven RCTs, resulting in eight publications (521 total participants were enrolled among these studies), with duration of study interventions ranging from two to seven weeks. As compared to standard non‐individualized fortification, individualized (targeted or adjustable) fortification of enteral feeds probably increased weight gain during the intervention (typical mean difference [MD] 1.88 g/kg/d, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26 to 2.50; 6 studies, 345 participants), may have increased length gain during the intervention (typical MD 0.43 mm/d, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.53; 5 studies, 242 participants), and may have increased head circumference gain during the intervention (typical MD 0.14 mm/d, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.23; 5 studies, 242 participants). Compared to standard non‐individualized fortification, targeted fortification probably increased weight gain during the intervention (typical MD 1.87 g/kg/d, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.58; 4 studies, 269 participants) and may have increased length gain during the intervention (typical MD 0.45 mm/d, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57; 3 studies, 166 participants). Adjustable fortification probably increased weight gain during the intervention (typical MD 2.86 g/kg/d, 95% CI 1.69 to 4.03; 3 studies, 96 participants), probably increased gain in length during the intervention (typical MD 0.54 mm/d, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.7; 3 studies, 96 participants), and increased gain in head circumference during the intervention (typical MD 0.36 mm/d, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.5; 3 studies, 96 participants). We are uncertain whether there are differences between individualized versus standard fortification strategies in the incidence of in‐hospital mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, culture‐proven late‐onset bacterial sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, osteopenia, length of hospital stay, or post‐hospital discharge growth. No study reported severe neurodevelopmental disability as an outcome. One study that was published after our literature search was completed is awaiting classification. 
Authors' conclusions
We found moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence suggesting that individualized (either targeted or adjustable) fortification of enteral feeds in very low birth weight infants increases growth velocity of weight, length, and head circumference during the intervention compared with standard non‐individualized fortification. Evidence showing important in‐hospital and post‐discharge clinical outcomes was sparse and of very low certainty, precluding inferences regarding safety or clinical benefits beyond short‐term growth. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Customized Nutrition for Premature Babies Fed Breast Milk

## Plain Title

Does customizing breast milk nutrition help premature babies grow better?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Babies born too early (premature babies) are very small and fragile. They need special care and nutrition to grow and stay healthy. Breast milk is the best food for these babies. It helps protect them from getting sick. However, breast milk alone does not have enough nutrients for premature babies to grow well.

**What do doctors currently do?**

Doctors add extra nutrients to breast milk. This is called fortification. Most hospitals use a standard method. This means all babies get the same amount of extra nutrients. But not all breast milk is the same. And not all babies need the same amount of nutrients.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if customizing the nutrients for each baby works better. There are two ways to customize:

1. **Targeted fortification**: Test the breast milk to see what nutrients it has. Then add what is missing.

2. **Adjustable fortification**: Test the baby's blood to see if the baby needs more protein. Then adjust the nutrients based on the test results.

Researchers wanted to see if these customized methods help babies grow better and stay healthier than the standard method.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at seven different studies. These studies included 521 premature babies in total.

**Who was in the studies?**

The babies in these studies were:
- Born before 37 weeks of pregnancy, or
- Weighed less than 2,500 grams (about 5.5 pounds) at birth

All babies were fed only breast milk with added nutrients.

**What did researchers compare?**

They compared two groups:
- Babies who got standard fortification (same for all babies)
- Babies who got customized fortification (adjusted for each baby)

**How long did the studies last?**

The customized feeding lasted between two and seven weeks in different studies.

## Results

**What did researchers find about growth?**

Babies who got customized nutrition grew faster during the study:

- **Weight gain**: Babies gained about 2 extra grams per kilogram of body weight each day.
- **Length gain**: Babies grew about 0.4 millimeters longer each day.
- **Head size gain**: Babies' heads grew about 0.1 millimeters more each day.

Both types of customized fortification (targeted and adjustable) helped babies grow faster than standard fortification.

**What about other health outcomes?**

Researchers looked at other important health problems. These included:
- Death in the hospital
- Lung problems
- Gut problems
- Eye problems
- Bone problems
- Infections

The studies did not show clear differences between customized and standard fortification for these health problems. There was not enough information to know if customized fortification is safer or prevents these problems.

Researchers did not find information about long-term brain development.

**What do these results mean?**

Customizing breast milk nutrition helps premature babies grow faster while in the hospital. This includes gaining more weight and growing longer. Their heads also grow more.

However, researchers are not sure if customized fortification helps with other health problems. More research is needed to know if it is completely safe. More research is also needed to know if it helps babies after they leave the hospital.

**What are the limitations?**

- The studies were short (only a few weeks).
- Not many babies were included overall.
- Researchers need more information about long-term health and development.

**Conclusion**

Customizing breast milk nutrition for each premature baby helps them grow faster in the hospital. But doctors need more research to know if this method is better for long-term health.",10.1002-14651858.CD013465,"Individualized versus standard diet fortification for growth and development in very low birth weight infants receiving human milk 
Review question: does individualized rather than standard, non‐individualized addition of nutrients and calories to breast milk feeds safely improve growth and other outcomes in preterm infants? 
Background: preterm infants are at risk for poor growth following birth. Breast milk reduces their risk of illness but does not meet their nutritional needs. Therefore, breast milk fed to preterm infants must be fortified with extra nutrients. Usual methods of fortifying breast milk treat all breast milk and all preterm infants the same. However, two methods are available for individualizing fortification for each preterm infant. Targeted fortification adds nutrients to breast milk based on the results of breast milk analysis. Adjustable fortification adds nutrients based on the results of preterm infant laboratory results. Individualized fortification may improve preterm infant growth or other outcomes. However, it is not known whether targeted or adjustable fortification is safe or improves outcomes for preterm infants compared with the standard method. 
Study characteristics: through literature searches updated to September 2019, we found seven studies that tested the effects of targeted or adjustable fortification of breast milk feeds compared to standard fortification in preterm infants, yielding eight publications (521 total participants were enrolled in these studies). One study that was published after our literature search was completed is awaiting classification. 
Key results: targeted or adjustable fortification improves short‐term growth compared to standard fortification in preterm infants. Determining the best way to customize breast milk feeds is necessary, as is clarifying its safety and effects on other clinical outcomes. 
Certainty of evidence: very low to moderate. Moderate certainty means that the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants is likely to be close to the result of this review but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty means that the true effect may be substantially different from the results of this review. Very low certainty means that the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants is likely to be substantially different from the results of this review. Certainty of evidence was downgraded most often in this review due to small numbers of participants in included studies and significant differences in study design and outcome measures among included studies.

Leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg that can last weeks, months or even years. Most leg ulcers are the result of venous diseases. First‐line treatment options often include the use of compression bandages or stockings. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of using compression bandages or stockings, compared with no compression, on the healing of venous leg ulcers in any setting and population. 
Search methods
In June 2020 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions by language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that compared any types of compression bandages or stockings with no compression in participants with venous leg ulcers in any setting. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, and risk‐of‐bias assessment using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool. We assessed the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE methodology. 
Main results
We included 14 studies (1391 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 51 participants). Participants were recruited from acute‐care settings, outpatient settings and community settings, and a large proportion (65.9%; 917/1391) of participants had a confirmed history or clinical evidence of chronic venous disease, a confirmed cause of chronic venous insufficiency, or an ankle pressure/brachial pressure ratio of greater than 0.8 or 0.9. The average age of participants ranged from 58.0 to 76.5 years (median: 70.1 years). The average duration of their leg ulcers ranged from 9.0 weeks to 31.6 months (median: 22.0 months), and a large proportion of participants (64.8%; 901/1391) had ulcers with an area between 5 and 20 cm2. Studies had a median follow‐up of 12 weeks. Compression bandages or stockings applied included short‐stretch bandage, four‐layer compression bandage, and Unna's boot (a type of inelastic gauze bandage impregnated with zinc oxide), and comparator groups used included 'usual care', pharmacological treatment, a variety of dressings, and a variety of treatments where some participants received compression (but it was not the norm). Of the 14 included studies, 10 (71.4%) presented findings which we consider to be at high overall risk of bias. 
Primary outcomes 
There is moderate‐certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias) (1) that there is probably a shorter time to complete healing of venous leg ulcers in people wearing compression bandages or stockings compared with those not wearing compression (pooled hazard ratio for time‐to‐complete healing 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 3.10; I2 = 59%; 5 studies, 733 participants); and (2) that people treated using compression bandages or stockings are more likely to experience complete ulcer healing within 12 months compared with people with no compression (10 studies, 1215 participants): risk ratio for complete healing 1.77, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.21; I2 = 65% (8 studies with analysable data, 1120 participants); synthesis without meta‐analysis suggests more completely‐healed ulcers in compression bandages or stockings than in no compression (2 studies without analysable data, 95 participants). 
It is uncertain whether there is any difference in rates of adverse events between using compression bandages or stockings and no compression (very low‐certainty evidence; 3 studies, 585 participants). 
Secondary outcomes 
Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that people using compression bandages or stockings probably have a lower mean pain score than those not using compression (four studies with 859 participants and another study with 69 ulcers): pooled mean difference −1.39, 95% CI −1.79 to −0.98; I2 = 65% (two studies with 426 participants and another study with 69 ulcers having analysable data); synthesis without meta‐analysis suggests a reduction in leg ulcer pain in compression bandages or stockings, compared with no compression (two studies without analysable data, 433 participants). Compression bandages or stockings versus no compression may improve disease‐specific quality of life, but not all aspects of general health status during the follow‐up of 12 weeks to 12 months (four studies with 859 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
It is uncertain if the use of compression bandages or stockings is more cost‐effective than not using them (three studies with 486 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
If using compression bandages or stockings, people with venous leg ulcers probably experience complete wound healing more quickly, and more people have wounds completely healed. The use of compression bandages or stockings probably reduces pain and may improve disease‐specific quality of life. There is uncertainty about adverse effects, and cost effectiveness. 
Future research should focus on comparing alternative bandages and stockings with the primary endpoint of time to complete wound healing alongside adverse events including pain score, and health‐related quality of life, and should incorporate cost‐effectiveness analysis where possible. Future studies should adhere to international standards of trial conduct and reporting. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using Compression Bandages or Stockings to Heal Leg Ulcers

## Plain Title
Do compression bandages or stockings help heal leg ulcers better than not using them?

## Rationale

### What are leg ulcers?
Leg ulcers are open wounds on the lower leg. They do not heal quickly. Some last for weeks, months, or even years. Most leg ulcers happen because of vein problems. The veins in the legs do not work well. This causes wounds that are hard to heal.

### Why is this a problem?
Leg ulcers cause pain and make daily life hard. People with leg ulcers may have trouble walking. They may not be able to do normal tasks. The wounds can get infected. This makes the problem worse.

### What is the treatment being studied?
Doctors often use compression bandages or stockings to treat leg ulcers. These wrap around the leg. They put gentle pressure on the leg. This pressure helps blood flow better. Better blood flow may help wounds heal faster.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers wanted to know if compression really works. They compared using compression to not using it. They wanted to see which works better for healing leg ulcers.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at 14 different studies. These studies included 1,391 people total. The typical study had about 51 people in it.

### Who was in the studies?
Most people in the studies had vein problems. Their average age was about 70 years. Ages ranged from 58 to 77 years. The studies included both men and women. People had leg ulcers for different amounts of time. Some had ulcers for 9 weeks. Others had them for over 2 years. Most ulcers were between 5 and 20 square centimeters in size.

### What did people in the studies do?
Some people wore compression bandages or stockings. Others did not use compression. Different types of compression were tested. These included short-stretch bandages, four-layer bandages, and special zinc bandages. People who did not use compression got other treatments instead. These included regular wound care, medicines, or different types of dressings.

### How long did the studies last?
Most studies lasted about 12 weeks. Some lasted up to 12 months.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**Wound healing:** People who wore compression bandages or stockings healed faster. Their wounds closed more quickly than people who did not use compression. More people had completely healed wounds within 12 months when they used compression. About 2 out of every 3 people using compression healed completely. Only about 1 out of every 3 people without compression healed completely.

**Pain:** People using compression had less pain. Their pain scores were lower than people not using compression.

**Quality of life:** Compression may help people feel better in their daily lives. It may improve some parts of health. But it may not improve all parts of health.

**Side effects:** The researchers could not tell if compression causes more or fewer side effects. There was not enough clear information about this.

**Cost:** The researchers could not tell if compression saves money or costs more. More research is needed to answer this question.

### What do these results mean?
Compression bandages or stockings probably help leg ulcers heal. They probably reduce pain. They may help people feel better overall. Doctors should consider using compression to treat leg ulcers caused by vein problems.

### What is still unknown?
More research is needed to understand side effects. More research is also needed about cost. Future studies should compare different types of compression. They should measure how fast wounds heal. They should also track pain, quality of life, and costs.",10.1002-14651858.CD013397,"Compression bandages or stockings versus no compression for treating venous leg ulcers
Key messages 
Compared with not using compression, compression therapy that uses bandages or stockings to treat venous leg ulcers: 
‐ probably heals venous leg ulcers more quickly;
‐ probably increases the number of people whose ulcer has completely healed after 12 months; 
‐ probably reduces pain; and
‐ may improve some aspects of people’s quality of life.
However, there is still uncertainty about whether or not compression therapy causes unwanted side effects, and if the health benefits of using compression outweigh its cost. 
What are leg ulcers? 
Leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg that can last weeks, months or even years. Most leg ulcers are caused by venous diseases that affect the circulation of blood in leg veins. Venous leg ulcers can cause distress and pain to patients, and can be very costly to the health service. 
What did we want to find out? 
Standard treatment options for venous leg ulcers often include compression therapy. This involves applying external pressure around the lower leg to help the return of blood from the legs to the heart. Compression therapy uses bandages, stockings or other devices. 
We wanted to find out if compression therapy delivered by bandages and stockings compared with no compression: 
‐ heals venous leg ulcers;
‐ has any unwanted effects;
‐ improves people’s quality of life;
‐ has health benefits that outweigh the costs (cost‐effectiveness); and
‐ reduces pain.
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where the treatment or care people receive is chosen at random). This type of study design provides the most reliable health evidence about the effects of a treatment. We searched for studies that evaluated the effects of any types of compression bandages or stockings compared with no compression in people affected with venous leg ulcers in any care setting. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 14 studies (1391 people, average age: 70.1 years) that lasted on average for 12 weeks. People in eight of the 14 studies were treated in outpatient and community settings. People had venous leg ulcers that had lasted for 22 months on average, and most ulcers had an area between 5 and 20 cm2. 
The studies used three types of compression therapy: short‐stretch bandage, four‐layer compression bandage, and Unna's boot (a type of compression bandage containing zinc oxide). These therapies were compared with no compression in forms of 'usual care', pharmacological treatment, a variety of dressings, and a variety of treatments where only some participants received compression (but it was not the norm). 
(1) Venous leg‐ulcer healing and unwanted effects  
Compared with no compression, the evidence suggests that:
‐ people wearing compression bandages or stockings probably experience complete ulcer healing more quickly; and 
‐ more people treated using the compression bandages or stockings are likely to experience complete ulcer healing within 12 months. 
However, we did not find clear evidence to tell if using compression bandages or stockings causes any unwanted effects. 
(2) Other effects  
The evidence suggests that, compared with not using compression, the use of compression bandages or stockings: 
‐ probably reduces pain more than not using compression; and
‐ may improve some aspects of people’s quality of life in 12 weeks to 12 months.
However, we are uncertain if the use of compression bandages or stockings results in health benefits that outweigh their costs. 
What limited our confidence in the evidence? 
Most studies were small (51 people on average) and 10 of the 14 included studies used methods that could introduce errors in their results. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to June 2020.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence from randomized controlled trials for the benefits and safety of all prescription medicines used to treat critically ill adult patients with delirium in the intensive care units (ICUs) of hospitals. 
Background 
Delirium is commonly associated with surgery, infection, or critical illness. It is experienced as new‐onset, generally short‐term inability to think clearly. Patients with delirium shift between periods of clear thinking and periods of agitation and/or great sleepiness and confusion. Lack of sleep, pain, a noisy environment, physical restraint, and the use of sedatives and strong analgesics are some of the contributing factors. Delirium affects both immediate and longer‐term health outcomes of critically ill patients as it can increase the length of time a breathing machine is required, time spent in the ICU and in hospital, and the chance of functional weakening and death. The odds of a poor outcome with delirium are increased with frail patients and those of advanced age and already present cognitive difficulties. Frequently, delirious ICU patients are given medicines to help treat symptoms such as agitation. 
Study characteristics 
This review is current to 21 March 2019. We found 14 randomized controlled studies that enrolled a total of 1844 adult participants. Six different classes of medicines were tested. These were antipsychotic drugs used as tranquillizers in ten studies; the sedative alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine in three studies; statins that reduce cholesterol in two studies; opioids as part of pain management in one study; serotonin antagonists for nausea and vomiting in one study; and cholinesterase inhibitors, which are medicines for Alzheimer's disease, in one study. Ten studies compared medicine to placebo ‐ an inactive medicine also known as a sugar pill; four studies compared different drugs. Eleven studies with 1153 participants reported on the main outcome of this review ‐ duration of delirium. 
Key findings 
When drug classes were directly compared with placebo, only the alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine was found to reduce the duration of delirium, and the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine was found to prolong the duration of delirium. Each of these results is based on findings from a single small study. The other drugs when compared to placebo did not change delirium duration. The Review authors used the statistical method of network meta‐analysis to compare the six different drug classes. Dexmedetomidine was ranked most effective in reducing delirium duration, followed by atypical antipsychotics. However, network meta‐analysis of delirium duration failed to rule out the possibility of no difference for all six drug classes compared to placebo. Using this method, we did not find that any drug improved the duration of coma, length of stay, long‐term cognitive outcomes, or death. The alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine shortened time spent on a breathing machine. Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or were rare when reported. An analysis of reported events showed that events were similar to those reported with placebo. We found 10 ongoing studies and six studies awaiting classification that, once published and assessed, may change the conclusions of this review. 
Quality of the evidence 
Most of the included studies were small but of good design. Nine of the 14 studies were considered to have low risk of bias. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Medicines to Treat Confusion in Critically Ill Adults

## Plain Title
Testing Medicines to Treat Sudden Confusion in Very Sick Adults in Hospital

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some very sick adults in the hospital get a condition called delirium. Delirium means sudden confusion. People with delirium cannot think clearly. They go back and forth between feeling awake and confused. Sometimes they feel very sleepy. Other times they feel upset or restless.

**What causes this problem?**

Delirium often happens after surgery or when someone has a bad infection. It can also happen when someone is very sick. Things that make delirium worse include not sleeping well, being in pain, loud noises, being tied down, and taking strong pain medicines.

**Why is this a problem for patients?**

Delirium makes sick people get worse. They may need a breathing machine longer. They may stay in the hospital longer. They may become weaker. Some people may die. Older people and people who already have trouble thinking are at higher risk.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors often give medicines to help treat delirium symptoms like agitation. But we need to know which medicines work best and which ones are safe.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to find out if medicines can help treat delirium. They wanted to know if these medicines are safe. They looked at all studies that tested medicines for delirium in very sick adults.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of other studies. Researchers looked at 14 studies done by other scientists. These studies included 1,844 adults who were very sick and in the intensive care unit (ICU). The ICU is a special hospital unit for very sick people.

**What medicines were tested?**

Six types of medicines were tested:
- Antipsychotic drugs (calm people down) – tested in 10 studies
- Dexmedetomidine (helps people sleep) – tested in 3 studies
- Statins (lower cholesterol) – tested in 2 studies
- Opioids (treat pain) – tested in 1 study
- Serotonin antagonists (stop nausea) – tested in 1 study
- Cholinesterase inhibitors (treat memory problems) – tested in 1 study

**How were the studies set up?**

Ten studies compared real medicine to a fake pill (placebo). Four studies compared different medicines to each other. Eleven studies with 1,153 people looked at how long delirium lasted. This was the main thing researchers wanted to know.

**When was this review done?**

Researchers looked at all studies published up to March 21, 2019.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

When medicines were compared to fake pills, only one medicine helped. Dexmedetomidine made delirium shorter. But this result came from just one small study.

One medicine made things worse. Rivastigmine made delirium last longer. This also came from one small study.

Other medicines did not change how long delirium lasted.

**What else did researchers learn?**

Researchers used a special math method to compare all six types of medicines. Dexmedetomidine ranked as most helpful. Atypical antipsychotics ranked second. But the results were not strong enough to be certain.

No medicine helped with:
- How long people were in a coma
- How long people stayed in the hospital
- How well people could think later
- How many people died

Dexmedetomidine did help people spend less time on breathing machines.

**Were the medicines safe?**

Most studies did not report bad effects from medicines. When bad effects happened, they were rare. The medicines seemed as safe as fake pills.

**What do these results mean?**

The evidence is not strong enough to say which medicine works best for delirium. More research is needed. Researchers found 10 new studies still happening and 6 studies waiting to be reviewed. These may change what we know.

**How good was the evidence?**

Most studies were small but well done. Nine out of 14 studies were high quality.",10.1002-14651858.CD011749,"Medicines to treat delirium in critically ill adult patients

Epiretinal membrane is an abnormal sheet of avascular fibrocellular tissue that develops on the inner surface of the retina. Epiretinal membrane can cause impairment of sight as a consequence of progressive distortion of retinal architecture. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of surgery compared to no intervention for epiretinal membrane.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, ISRCTN registry, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. The databases were last searched on 20 May 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing surgical removal of idiopathic epiretinal membrane compared to placebo, no treatment or sham treatment. Paired or within‐person studies were included, as well as those where both eyes of a single participant were treated. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods expected by Cochrane, and assessed certainty using the GRADE system. We considered the following five outcome measures: mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study eye between baseline (before randomisation), 6 months and 12 months later; proportion of people with a gain of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity in the study eye as measured by a logMAR chart at a starting distance of 4 m at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation; proportion of people with a loss of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity in the study eye as measured by a logMAR chart at a starting distance of 4 m at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation; mean quality of life score at 6 months and 12 months following surgery, measured using a validated questionnaire; and any harm identified during follow‐up. 
Main results
We included one study in the review. This was a RCT including 53 eyes of 53 participants with mild symptomatic epiretinal membrane and BCVA of 65 or more Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. Participants were randomly allocated to immediate surgery or to watchful waiting with deferred surgery if indicated by evidence of disease progression. The study was limited by imprecision owing to the small number of participants and was at some risk of bias owing to inconsistencies in the time points for outcome assessment and in the management of lens opacity. 
At 12 months, the visual acuity in the immediate surgery group was higher by a mean of 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.0 to 6.2 ETDRS letters; 53 participants; low‐certainty evidence) than the watchful waiting/deferred surgery group. 
The evidence of the effect of immediate surgery on gains of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.93; 53 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
At 12 months, no participant in either group sustained a loss of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity (53 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
The included study did not measure quality of life.
At 12 months, no serious adverse event was identified in any participant. One participant developed chronic minimal cystoid macular oedema following immediate surgery (53 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We found no RCT that directly investigated the effect of surgery compared to no intervention. For severe disabling epiretinal membrane, the lack of a RCT comparing surgery to no intervention may reflect evidence from non‐randomised studies in favour of surgery; a RCT may be considered unnecessary and ethically unacceptable because a superior effect of surgery is widely accepted. For mild symptomatic epiretinal membrane, however, the value of surgery is uncertain. Low‐certainty evidence from this review suggests that watchful waiting or deferred surgery may offer outcomes as favourable as immediate surgery. However, this finding needs to be confirmed in further RCTs with appropriate statistical power, masking of treatment allocation, consistent management of cataract, and measurement of outcomes including patient‐reported quality of life over a more extended time frame. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Surgery for Epiretinal Membrane

## Plain Title
Is surgery better than waiting and watching for people with epiretinal membrane in the eye?

## Rationale

**What is epiretinal membrane?**
Epiretinal membrane is a thin layer of tissue that grows on the inside surface of the retina. The retina is the part of the eye that helps you see. This tissue layer should not be there.

**What problems does it cause?**
This extra tissue can slowly change the shape of the retina. When this happens, a person's vision can get worse. They may have trouble seeing clearly.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors can do surgery to remove this extra tissue. But researchers wanted to know if surgery really helps. They also wanted to know if it is better to do surgery right away or to wait and watch. Some people with mild epiretinal membrane might not need surgery at all. This study looked at the research to find answers.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to see if surgery works better than not doing surgery. They wanted to know if people can see better after surgery. They also wanted to know if surgery is safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked for studies that compared surgery to no surgery. They found one study that met their needs.

**Who was in the study?**
The study included 53 people. Each person had one eye with mild epiretinal membrane. Their vision was not too bad at the start. All 53 people had some symptoms but could still see fairly well.

**What did the study compare?**
The study put people into two groups by chance. One group had surgery right away. The other group waited and watched. If their vision got worse, they could have surgery later.

**How long did the study last?**
Researchers checked people's vision for 12 months. This is one year.

## Results

**What did researchers find about vision?**
After 12 months, both groups could see about the same. People who had surgery right away saw only slightly better. The difference was very small. It may not matter much in daily life.

Very few people in either group had big improvements in vision. The study was too small to know if surgery helps more people see better.

No one in either group had their vision get much worse. This was true for both the surgery group and the waiting group.

**What did researchers find about safety?**
Surgery was mostly safe. No serious problems happened in either group. One person who had surgery got some swelling in the eye. This swelling was mild and lasted a long time.

**What did researchers find about quality of life?**
The study did not ask people about their quality of life. Researchers do not know if surgery helped people feel better about their daily activities.

**What do these results mean?**
For people with mild epiretinal membrane, waiting and watching may work as well as having surgery right away. People who wait can still have surgery later if needed.

**What are the limits of this study?**
Only one small study was found. Only 53 people were in it. More research is needed with more people. Future studies should last longer than one year. They should also ask people about their quality of life.

**What is the main conclusion?**
For mild epiretinal membrane, surgery right away may not be needed. Waiting and watching is a reasonable choice. People can have surgery later if their vision gets worse. More research is needed to be sure about these findings.",10.1002-14651858.CD013297,"What are the benefits and risks of surgery for epiretinal membrane (a disease of the eye)? 
Why is this question important?An epiretinal membrane is an abnormal layer of tissue that develops at the back of the eye. It affects around one in five people aged 75 years and older. In most people, the development of an epiretinal membrane is linked to the normal ageing processes in the eye and is described as 'idiopathic'. In other instances, epiretinal membrane is caused by a pre‐existing condition affecting the retina, such as inflammation or poor circluation. Epiretinal membrane can also develop after eye surgery. 
Epiretinal membrane typically forms over the part of the eye responsible for seeing fine detail (the macula). In some people, this does not affect vision. In others, it causes distorted or blurred vision, which can affect people’s quality of life. For example, an epiretinal membrane may impair people’s ability to read or drive. 
If an epiretinal membrane affects vision, it is commonly removed by surgery. A local anaesthetic (medication) is used to numb the eye area. As with any procedure, this surgery carries risks of harm from side effects. These include potential problems such as cataract, detached retina, infection and bleeding in the eye. 
To understand when the benefits of surgery outweigh its risks, we reviewed the research evidence. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched the medical literature for studies: 
‐ in which epiretinal membrane was not caused by a pre‐existing condition or surgery;
‐ that compared the effects of surgery against no surgery or a placebo (sham) procedure; and 
‐ where people were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a group that underwent surgery for epiretinal membrane, and a group that did not have surgery for epiretinal membrane. 
We then summarised the evidence and rated our confidence in it, based on factors such as study methods and size. 
What did we find?We found only one study that met our criteria. This study took place in Denmark and included 53 people who had epiretinal membranes causing mild impairment of sight. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Those in one group had immediate surgery. Those in the other group were watched closely and in the event of any deterioration in their condition were invited to have surgery. People in both groups were followed up for one year. 
The study results suggest that immediate surgery for epiretinal membrane causing mild impairment of sight: 
‐ may not benefit vision 12 months after surgery; and
‐ may not lead to serious unwanted effects. One person treated with immediate surgery experienced an unwanted effect that was not considered serious. This was the development of an eye condition caused by fluid building up at the back of the eye. 
The study did not investigate the impact of surgery on participants’ quality of life.
How confident are we in the evidence?We are not confident in the evidence, because: 
‐ it is based on one small study; and
‐ some of the methods used by the researchers who conducted it may have introduced errors in its results. 
What does this mean?For epiretinal membrane causing severe disabling impairment of sight, we found no carefully‐controlled study that measured the effect of surgery. For severe epiretinal membrane, surgery is widely considered to improve the outcome and is routine practice. A carefully controlled trial comparing surgery to no treatment is considered unecessary and ethically inappropriate. 
For epiretinal membrane causing mild impairment of sight, however, the effect of surgery is uncertain. There is some evidence that the outcome of watchful waiting may be as good as the effect of immediate surgery. However, the evidence is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions. Further studies that use robust methods and measure outcomes including quality of life in the longer term would help to determine effect of surgery with more confidence. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to May 2020.

189,10.1002-14651858.CD014955-abstract.txt,"Background
Drowning is responsible for an estimated 320,000 deaths a year, and over 90% of drowning mortality occurs in low‐ to middle‐income countries (LMICs), with peak drowning rates among children aged 1 to 4 years. In this age group, mortality due to drowning is particularly common in rural settings and about 75% of drowning accidents happen in natural bodies of water close to the home. Providing adequate child supervision can protect children from drowning, and organized formal day care programs could offer a way to achieve this. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
• To assess the effects of day care programs for children under 6 years of age on drowning‐related mortality or morbidity, or on total drowning accidents (fatal and non‐fatal), in LMICs, compared to no day care programs or other drowning prevention interventions 
Secondary objectives 
• To assess the effects of day care programs in LMICs for children under 6 years of age on unsafe water exposure 
• To assess safety within these programs (e.g. transmission of infection within day care, physical or sexual abuse of children within day care) 
• To assess the incidence of unintentional injury within these programs
• To describe the cost‐effectiveness of such programs, in relation to averted drowning‐related mortality or morbidity 
Search methods
On November 23, 2019, and for an update on August 18, 2020, we searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, CENTRAL, ERIC, and CINAHL, as well as two trial registries. On December 16, 2019, and for an update on February 9, 2021, we searched 12 other resources, including websites of organizations that develop programs targeted to children. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized, quasi‐randomized, and non‐randomized controlled studies (with explicitly listed specific study design features) that implemented formal day care programs as a single program or combined with additional out‐of‐day care components (such as educational activities aimed at preventing injury or drowning or early childhood development activities) for children of preschool age (below 6 years of age) in LMICs for comparison with no such programs or with other drowning prevention interventions. Studies had to report at least one outcome related to drowning or injury prevention for the children enrolled. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection and data extraction, as well as risk of bias and GRADE assessment. 
Main results
Two non‐randomized observational studies, conducted in rural Bangladesh, involving a total of 252,631 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review. One of these studies compared a formal day care program combined with parent education, playpens provided to parents, and community‐based activities as additional out‐of‐day care components versus no such program. Overall we assessed this study to be at moderate risk of bias (moderate risk of bias due to confounding, low risk of bias for other domains). This study showed that implementation of a formal day care program combined with parent education, provision of playpens to parents, and community‐based activities, in a rural area with a high drowning incidence, likely reduces the risk of death from drowning over the study period of 4 years and 8 months compared to no day care program (hazard ratio 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06 to 0.58; 1 study, 136,577 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Drowning morbidity (non‐fatal drowning resulting in complications), total drowning (fatal and non‐fatal), unsafe water exposure, and program safety (e.g. transmission of infection within day care, physical or sexual abuse of children within day care) were not reported, nor was the incidence of other unintentional injuries. Cost‐effectiveness was reported as 812 USD (95% CI 589 to 1777) per disability‐adjusted life‐year averted as a consequence of drowning (moderate‐certainty evidence). The second study compared day care programs with or without playpens provided to parents as an additional component versus only playpens provided to parents as an alternative drowning prevention intervention. Overall we assessed the study to be at critical risk of bias because we judged bias due to confounding to be at critical risk. As the certainty of evidence was very low, we are uncertain about the effects on drowning mortality rate of implementing a day care program compared to providing playpens (rate ratio 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study; 76,575 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Likewise, we are uncertain about the effects of a day care program with playpens provided as an additional component versus playpens provided alone (rate ratio 0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.12; 1 study, 45,460 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The other outcomes of interest ‐ drowning morbidity, total drowning, unsafe water exposure, program safety, incidence of other unintentional injuries, and cost‐effectiveness ‐ were not reported. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides evidence suggesting that a day care program with additional out‐of‐day care components such as community‐based education, parent education, and playpens provided to parents likely reduces the drowning mortality risk in regions with a high burden of drowning compared to no intervention. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Day Care Programs to Prevent Drowning in Young Children

## Plain Title
Can day care programs help prevent young children from drowning in low- and middle-income countries?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Drowning kills about 320,000 people every year around the world. More than 9 out of 10 drowning deaths happen in low- and middle-income countries. These are countries where many people have less money and fewer resources.

Young children aged 1 to 4 years old are at the highest risk of drowning. About 3 out of 4 drowning accidents happen in natural water sources near the home, such as ponds, rivers, or ditches. This problem is especially common in rural areas where families live near these water sources.

**Why was this study needed?**

Young children need constant watching to stay safe around water. However, parents and caregivers in rural areas often work during the day. They may not be able to watch their children all the time.

Day care programs could help solve this problem. These programs provide a safe place where trained adults watch children during the day. This keeps children away from dangerous water sources while their parents work.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if day care programs could reduce drowning deaths in young children. They also wanted to know if these programs were safe and worth the cost.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for all studies that tested day care programs for young children. They searched medical databases and websites. They looked for studies done in low- and middle-income countries.

They found 2 studies that met their requirements. Both studies were done in rural Bangladesh, a country where many young children drown each year.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included over 250,000 children under 6 years old. These children lived in rural areas near water sources.

**What did the studies compare?**

The first study compared children who attended day care programs to children who did not. The day care program also included teaching parents about water safety, giving families playpens, and community education activities.

The second study compared day care programs to just giving families playpens without day care.

**How long did the studies last?**

The first study lasted almost 5 years. The second study length was not clearly stated.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The first study showed that day care programs combined with parent education, playpens, and community activities likely reduce drowning deaths. Children in the day care program were much less likely to die from drowning compared to children not in the program.

For every drowning death prevented, the program cost about 812 US dollars. Researchers consider this a reasonable cost for saving a child's life.

The second study had some problems with how it was done. Because of these problems, researchers could not be sure about its results.

**What was not measured?**

The studies did not report on:
- Non-fatal drowning accidents that caused injuries
- How often children were near dangerous water
- Safety problems within day care programs
- Other types of accidents

**What do these results mean?**

Day care programs that include parent education and other safety measures likely help prevent young children from drowning. This is especially true in areas where many children drown each year.

These programs work by keeping children in a safe place during the day. They keep children away from dangerous water sources while parents work.

**What is still unknown?**

More research is needed to understand:
- Whether day care programs alone (without extra components) prevent drowning
- How safe day care programs are for children
- Whether these programs prevent other types of accidents
- How well these programs work in different countries and settings

**Conclusion**

Day care programs combined with parent education and other safety measures likely reduce drowning deaths in young children. These programs appear to be worth their cost in areas where many children drown. However, more high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.",10.1002-14651858.CD014955,"Can day care programs for children under 6 years of age in low‐ to middle‐income countries reduce their risk of drowning? 
Key message 
A day care program with extra features such as community‐based education, parent education, and playpens provided to parents outside the day care facility probably reduces the risk of death by drowning for children under 6 years living in areas where large numbers of children drown each year.

Children living in rural areas near open water are at risk of drowning, particularly if they are not attending school or are left unsupervised. Child supervision is recommended to prevent drowning accidents, and organized day care at a center outside the home could help. 
We wanted to know if a day care program for children under 6 years of age in low‐ to middle‐income countries might help to reduce the number of drowning accidents (fatal and non‐fatal). 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the effects of a day care program on drowning accidents in children under 6 years of age. The day care program could include features such as educational activities aimed at preventing injuries or drowning and early childhood development activities. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We included evidence published up to August 18, 2020.
What did we find? 
We found 2 studies that involved 252,631 children and took place in rural Bangladesh.
One study lasted 4 years and 8 months. It assessed the effects of a day care program that combined parent education, playpens provided to parents, and community education as compared to the effects of no day care program. 
The other study lasted 3 years and 4 months. The effects of a day care program alone and the effects of a combined program of day care with playpens provided to parents were each compared with the effects of only playpens provided to parents. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Compared with no day care program, a day care program for children under 6 years of age, combined with parent education, playpens for parents, and community education, probably reduces the risk of death from drowning (evidence from 1 study in 136,577 children). For every 100,000 children under 6 years of age who were not in the day care program, 77 children might die from drowning, compared with 14 children included in the day care program. 
Providing this day care program with additional activities was cheaper than the cost of every year lost to illness, disability, or early death by drowning (evidence from 1 study in 136,577 children). 
We are uncertain about the effects of a day care program when compared with playpens provided to parents, and we are uncertain about the effects of a day care program combined with playpens for parents when compared with playpens alone. 
Neither study reported results on non‐fatal drowning accidents, unsafe water exposure, the safety of the program, or other accidental injuries. 
Limitations of the evidence 
The results were from two observational studies in which researchers observed the effects of a factor (such as a day care program) without trying to change who did, or did not, experience it. Evidence from observational studies is not as reliable as evidence from randomized controlled studies, in which the programs people receive are decided at random. 
We are moderately confident about the effects of a day care program (with extra features) on the risk of death by drowning in children under 6 years of age. Further research is likely to increase our confidence in these results.

Implanted spinal neuromodulation (SNMD) techniques are used in the treatment of refractory chronic pain. They involve the implantation of electrodes around the spinal cord (spinal cord stimulation (SCS)) or dorsal root ganglion (dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS)), and a pulse generator unit under the skin. Electrical stimulation is then used with the aim of reducing pain intensity. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness, adverse events, and cost‐effectiveness of implanted spinal neuromodulation interventions for people with chronic pain. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Web of Science (ISI), Health Technology Assessments, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry from inception to September 2021 without language restrictions, searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SNMD interventions with placebo (sham) stimulation, no treatment or usual care; or comparing SNMD interventions + another treatment versus that treatment alone. We included participants ≥ 18 years old with non‐cancer and non‐ischaemic pain of longer than three months duration. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were disability, analgesic medication use, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and health economic outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened database searches to determine inclusion, extracted data and evaluated risk of bias for prespecified results using the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Outcomes were evaluated at short‐ (≤ one month), medium‐ four to eight months) and long‐term (≥12 months). Where possible we conducted meta‐analyses. We used the GRADE system to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included 15 unique published studies that randomised 908 participants, and 20 unique ongoing studies. All studies evaluated SCS. We found no eligible published studies of DRGS and no studies comparing SCS with no treatment or usual care. We rated all results evaluated as being at high risk of bias overall. For all comparisons and outcomes where we found evidence, we graded the certainty of the evidence as low or very low, downgraded due to limitations of studies, imprecision and in some cases, inconsistency. 
Active stimulation versus placebo  
SCS versus placebo (sham)  
Results were only available at short‐term follow‐up for this comparison.
Pain intensity 
Six studies (N = 164) demonstrated a small effect in favour of SCS at short‐term follow‐up (0 to 100 scale, higher scores = worse pain, mean difference (MD) ‐8.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐15.67 to ‐1.78, very low certainty). The point estimate falls below our predetermined threshold for a clinically important effect (≥10 points). No studies reported the proportion of participants experiencing 30% or 50% pain relief for this comparison. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
The quality and inconsistency of adverse event reporting in these studies precluded formal analysis. 
Active stimulation + other intervention versus other intervention alone  
SCS + other intervention versus other intervention alone (open‐label studies)  
Pain intensity 
Mean difference  
Three studies (N = 303) demonstrated a potentially clinically important mean difference in favour of SCS of ‐37.41 at short term (95% CI ‐46.39 to ‐28.42, very low certainty), and medium‐term follow‐up (5 studies, 635 participants, MD ‐31.22 95% CI ‐47.34 to ‐15.10 low‐certainty), and no clear evidence for an effect of SCS at long‐term follow‐up (1 study, 44 participants, MD ‐7 (95% CI ‐24.76 to 10.76, very low‐certainty). 
Proportion of participants reporting ≥50% pain relief  
We found an effect in favour of SCS at short‐term (2 studies, N = 249, RR 15.90, 95% CI 6.70 to 37.74, I2 0% ; risk difference (RD) 0.65 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.74, very low certainty), medium term (5 studies, N = 597, RR 7.08, 95 %CI 3.40 to 14.71, I2 = 43%; RD 0.43, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.73, low‐certainty evidence), and long term (1 study, N = 87, RR 15.15, 95% CI 2.11 to 108.91 ; RD 0.35, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.49, very low certainty) follow‐up. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
Device related  
No studies specifically reported  device‐related adverse events at short‐term follow‐up. At medium‐term follow‐up, the incidence of lead failure/displacement (3 studies N = 330) ranged from 0.9 to 14% (RD 0.04, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.11, I2 64%, very low certainty). The incidence of infection (4 studies, N = 548) ranged from 3 to 7% (RD 0.04, 95%CI 0.01, 0.07, I2 0%, very low certainty). The incidence of reoperation/reimplantation (4 studies, N =5 48) ranged from 2% to 31% (RD 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.21, I2 86%, very low certainty). One study (N = 44) reported a 55% incidence of lead failure/displacement (RD 0.55, 95% CI 0.35, 0 to 75, very low certainty), and a 94% incidence of reoperation/reimplantation (RD 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07, very low certainty) at five‐year follow‐up. No studies provided data on infection rates at long‐term follow‐up. 
We found reports of some serious adverse events as a result of the intervention. These included autonomic neuropathy, prolonged hospitalisation, prolonged monoparesis, pulmonary oedema, wound infection, device extrusion and one death resulting from subdural haematoma. 
Other  
No studies reported the incidence of other adverse events at short‐term follow‐up. We found no clear evidence of a difference in otherAEs at medium‐term (2 studies, N = 278, RD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.06, I2 0%) or long term (1 study, N = 100, RD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.02) follow‐up. 
Very limited evidence suggested that SCS increases healthcare costs. It was not clear whether SCS was cost‐effective. 
Authors' conclusions
We found very low‐certainty evidence that SCS may not provide clinically important benefits on pain intensity compared to placebo stimulation. We found low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence that SNMD interventions may provide clinically important benefits for pain intensity when added to conventional medical management or physical therapy. SCS is associated with complications including infection, electrode lead failure/migration and a need for reoperation/re‐implantation. The level of certainty regarding the size of those risks is very low. SNMD may lead to serious adverse events, including death. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of DRGS for chronic pain. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Spinal Cord Stimulation for Long-Lasting Pain

## Plain Title
Does using an implanted device to send electrical signals to the spinal cord help reduce long-lasting pain?

## Rationale

### What is long-lasting pain and why is it a problem?
Some people have pain that lasts for months or years. This is called chronic pain. It can make daily life very hard. People may struggle to work, sleep, or enjoy time with family and friends.

### What is spinal cord stimulation?
Doctors sometimes use a special device to treat pain that does not get better with other treatments. This device is called a spinal cord stimulator. Doctors place thin wires near the spinal cord through surgery. They also put a small battery pack under the skin. The device sends electrical signals to the nerves. The goal is to reduce pain.

### Why was this study needed?
Researchers wanted to know if spinal cord stimulation really works. They wanted to find out how well it reduces pain. They also wanted to know if it is safe. This information helps doctors and patients make better choices about treatment.

## Trial Design

### How is this study designed?
The researchers looked at 15 studies that included 908 adults. All the people in these studies had pain lasting more than three months. None had cancer pain.

The studies compared different groups of people:
- Some people got real electrical stimulation
- Some people got fake stimulation (they thought the device was on, but it was not)
- Some people got stimulation plus their regular treatment
- Some people got only their regular treatment

The researchers checked pain levels at different times:
- Short term: one month or less
- Medium term: four to eight months
- Long term: one year or more

All studies looked at spinal cord stimulation. No studies looked at a newer type called dorsal root ganglion stimulation.

## Results

### What were the main results?

**When comparing real stimulation to fake stimulation:**

The researchers found six studies with 164 people. Real stimulation reduced pain slightly more than fake stimulation after one month. On a scale from 0 to 100, pain scores were about 9 points lower. This is a small difference. It may not be enough for patients to notice a real change in their daily lives.

**When comparing stimulation plus regular treatment to regular treatment alone:**

The results looked better in these studies. After one month, pain scores were about 37 points lower (out of 100) for people who got stimulation. After four to eight months, pain scores were about 31 points lower. These differences might be large enough to matter to patients.

Many more people reported that their pain was cut in half or more. This happened at all time points measured.

### What problems did the device cause?

The device can cause problems. Some of these problems are serious:
- The wires can move out of place or stop working (happened in up to 14 out of 100 people)
- Infections can occur (happened in 3 to 7 out of 100 people)
- Some people needed another surgery to fix or replace the device (happened in 2 to 31 out of 100 people)

In one study that followed people for five years, 55 out of 100 people had wire problems. Almost all (94 out of 100) needed another surgery.

Some people had very serious problems. These included nerve damage, lung fluid buildup, and infections. One person died from bleeding in the brain.

### What do these results mean?

The evidence quality was low or very low. This means we cannot be very sure about the results. The studies had problems with how they were done. More and better research is needed.

Spinal cord stimulation might help some people with long-lasting pain, especially when added to other treatments. But it comes with risks. The device can fail or cause infections. Some people need more surgery.

Patients and doctors should carefully weigh the possible benefits against the risks. They should talk about whether this treatment is right for each person.",10.1002-14651858.CD013756,"What are the benefits and risks of electrical spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain in adults? 
Why this question is important 
Persistent (chronic) pain is a common problem that affects people from all walks of life. It can be the result of a wide range of different medical conditions and is sometimes unexplained, but it often causes substantial suffering, distress and disability and can have major impacts on a person's quality of life. 
Implanted spinal neuromodulation (SNMD) interventions involve surgically implanting wires (electrodes) into the space around nerves or the spinal cord that are connected to a ""pulse generator"" device which is usually implanted under the patient's skin. This delivers electrical stimulation to the nerves or spinal cord. It is thought that this stimulation interferes with danger messages being sent to the spinal cord and brain with the goal of reducing the perception of pain. Once implanted with a SNMD device people live with the device implanted, potentially on a permanent basis. We reviewed the evidence to find out whether these interventions were effective at reducing pain, disability and medication use, at improving quality of life and to find out the risk and type of complications they might cause. There are two broad types of SNMD: spinal cord stimulation (SCS), where electrodes are placed near the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) where electrodes are placed near the nerve root, where the nerve branches off from the spinal cord. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed the certainty of the evidence. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we rated the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found 15 published studies that included 908 people with persistent pain due to a variety of causes including nerve disease, chronic low back pain, chronic neck pain and complex regional pain syndrome. All of these studies evaluated SCS; no studies evaluated DRGS. 
Eight studies (that included 205 people) compared SCS with a sham (placebo) stimulation, where the electrodes were implanted, but no stimulation was delivered. Six studies that included 684 people compared SCS added with either medical management or physical therapy with medical management or physical therapy on its own. We rated the evidence as being of low, or very low certainty. Limitations in how the studies were conducted and reported, the amount of evidence we found and inconsistency between studies in some instances means that our confidence in the results is limited. 
The evidence suggests the following.
Compared to receiving medical management or physical therapy alone, people treated with the addition of SCS may experience less pain and higher quality of life after one month or six months of stimulation. There is limited evidence to draw conclusions in the long term of one year or more. It is unclear whether SCS reduces disability or medication use. 
Compared to a sham (placebo) stimulation, SCS may result in small reductions in pain intensity in the short term that may not be clinically important, but this is currently unclear. There is no evidence at medium or long‐term follow‐up points. 
SCS can result in complications. These include movement or malfunction of the electrode wires, wound infections and the need for further surgical procedures to fix issues with the implanted devices. We also found instances of serious complications that included one death, nerve damage, lasting muscle weakness, lung injury, serious infection, prolonged hospital stay and the extrusion of a stimulation device through the skin. 
Very limited evidence around the costs and economics of SCS suggested that SCS increases the costs of healthcare. It was not clear whether SCS was cost‐effective. 
What this means 
SCS may reduce pain intensity in people with chronic pain. It is currently not clear how much of this effect is due to the SCS itself and how much is due to so‐called ""placebo"" effects, which are the result of the experience of undergoing the procedure and the person's expectations that it will help them. Receiving SCS does present a risk of relatively common complications and less common serious complications. We are currently unsure of the precise degree of this risk.

Delirium is an acute neuropsychological disorder that is common in hospitalised patients. It can be distressing to patients and carers and it is associated with serious adverse outcomes. Treatment options for established delirium are limited and so prevention of delirium is desirable. Non‐pharmacological interventions are thought to be important in delirium prevention.  
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of non‐pharmacological interventions designed to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients outside intensive care units (ICU). 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, with additional searches conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization Portal/ICTRP to 16 September 2020. There were no language or date restrictions applied to the electronic searches, and no methodological filters were used to restrict the search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single and multicomponent non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised adults cared for outside intensive care or high dependency settings. We only included non‐pharmacological interventions which were designed and implemented to prevent delirium.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently examined titles and abstracts identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data from full‐text articles. Any disagreements on eligibility and inclusion were resolved by consensus. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcomes were: incidence of delirium; inpatient and later mortality; and new diagnosis of dementia. We included secondary and adverse outcomes as pre‐specified in the review protocol. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes and between‐group mean differences for continuous outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. A complementary exploratory analysis was undertaker using a Bayesian component network meta‐analysis fixed‐effect model to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the individual components of multicomponent interventions and describe which components were most strongly associated with reducing the incidence of delirium. 
Main results
We included 22 RCTs that recruited a total of 5718 adult participants. Fourteen trials compared a multicomponent delirium prevention intervention with usual care. Two trials compared liberal and restrictive blood transfusion thresholds. The remaining six trials each investigated a different non‐pharmacological intervention. Incidence of delirium was reported in all studies.  
Using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, we identified risks of bias in all included trials. All were at high risk of performance bias as participants and personnel were not blinded to the interventions. Nine trials were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors and three more were at unclear risk in this domain.  
Pooled data showed that multi‐component non‐pharmacological interventions probably reduce the incidence of delirium compared to usual care (10.5% incidence in the intervention group, compared to 18.4% in the control group, risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.71, I2 = 39%; 14 studies; 3693 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias).  
There may be little or no effect of multicomponent interventions on inpatient mortality compared to usual care (5.2% in the intervention group, compared to 4.5% in the control group, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.74, I2 = 15%; 10 studies; 2640 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision).  
No studies of multicomponent interventions reported data on new diagnoses of dementia. 
Multicomponent interventions may result in a small reduction of around a day in the duration of a delirium episode (mean difference (MD) ‐0.93, 95% CI ‐2.01 to 0.14 days, I2 = 65%; 351 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of multicomponent interventions on delirium severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.49, 95% CI ‐1.13 to 0.14, I2=64%; 147 participants; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and serious imprecision). Multicomponent interventions may result in a reduction in hospital length of stay compared to usual care (MD ‐1.30 days, 95% CI ‐2.56 to ‐0.04 days, I2=91%; 3351 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and inconsistency), but little to no difference in new care home admission at the time of hospital discharge (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.07; 536 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). Reporting of other adverse outcomes was limited.  
Our exploratory component network meta‐analysis found that re‐orientation (including use of familiar objects), cognitive stimulation and sleep hygiene were associated with reduced risk of incident delirium. Attention to nutrition and hydration, oxygenation, medication review, assessment of mood and bowel and bladder care were probably associated with a reduction in incident delirium but estimates included the possibility of no benefit or harm.  Reducing sensory deprivation, identification of infection, mobilisation and pain control all had summary estimates that suggested potential increases in delirium incidence, but the uncertainty in the estimates was substantial.  
Evidence from two trials suggests that use of a liberal transfusion threshold over a restrictive transfusion threshold probably results in little to no difference in incident delirium (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.36; I2 = 9%; 294 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias).  
Six other interventions were examined, but evidence for each was limited to single studies and we identified no evidence of delirium prevention.  
Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence regarding the benefit of multicomponent non‐pharmacological interventions for the prevention of delirium in hospitalised adults, estimated to reduce incidence by 43% compared to usual care. We found no evidence of an effect on mortality. There is emerging evidence that these interventions may reduce hospital length of stay, with a trend towards reduced delirium duration, although the effect on delirium severity remains uncertain. Further research should focus on implementation and detailed analysis of the components of the interventions to support more effective, tailored practice recommendations.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Can Non-Drug Methods Prevent Confusion in Hospital Patients?

## Plain Title

Can non-drug methods help prevent sudden confusion in people who are in the hospital?

## Rationale

**What is delirium?**

Delirium is a sudden state of confusion that can happen to people in the hospital. People with delirium may not know where they are. They may see or hear things that are not real. They may feel very upset or scared. Delirium is common in hospital patients and can be very distressing for both patients and their families.

**Why is delirium a problem?**

Delirium can lead to serious health problems. It can make hospital stays longer. It can increase the risk of other complications. Because of these risks, it is better to prevent delirium before it starts rather than treat it after it happens.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors have few good options to treat delirium once it starts. Non-drug methods might help prevent delirium from happening in the first place. These methods include things like helping patients stay oriented, making sure they sleep well, and keeping them active. Researchers wanted to know if these non-drug methods really work to prevent delirium.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to see if non-drug methods could prevent delirium in hospital patients. They wanted to know if these methods were safe and helpful.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of many studies. Researchers looked at 22 different studies. These studies included 5,718 adult patients in hospitals. The patients were not in intensive care units.

**What did the studies compare?**

Most studies compared usual hospital care to care that included special non-drug methods to prevent delirium. These special methods often included several parts working together. For example, they might include:
- Helping patients know what day it is and where they are
- Brain exercises and activities
- Help with sleeping better
- Making sure patients eat and drink enough
- Helping patients move around
- Checking medicines

Two studies looked at different rules for blood transfusions. Six other studies each tested one different method.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included adults in the hospital. They were not in intensive care. The studies included both men and women of different ages.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies followed patients during their hospital stay. The length of time varied for each patient.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The studies showed that using several non-drug methods together probably helps prevent delirium. Here is what researchers found:

**Delirium prevention:** Out of 100 patients who got usual care, about 18 developed delirium. Out of 100 patients who got the special non-drug care, only about 11 developed delirium. This means the non-drug methods reduced delirium by almost half.

**Deaths in the hospital:** The non-drug methods did not change how many patients died in the hospital. About 5 out of 100 patients died in both groups.

**How long delirium lasted:** For patients who did get delirium, the special care might have made it last about one day less. But researchers are not completely sure about this finding.

**Hospital stay length:** Patients who got the special care might have left the hospital about one day earlier than other patients.

**Which methods worked best?**

Researchers looked at which parts of the care worked best. They found that these methods seemed most helpful:
- Helping patients remember where they are and what day it is
- Using familiar objects from home
- Brain exercises
- Better sleep routines

Other methods like checking nutrition, reviewing medicines, and helping with mood might also help. But researchers need more studies to be sure.

**Blood transfusions:** Using different rules for when to give blood transfusions did not change delirium rates.

**What do these results mean?**

Non-drug methods that combine several approaches can help prevent delirium in hospital patients. These methods are safe and can reduce confusion by almost half. They may also help patients leave the hospital sooner. Hospitals should consider using these methods to protect patients from delirium.

**What is still unknown?**

Researchers still need to learn exactly which parts of these programs work best. They also need to find the best ways for hospitals to use these methods every day.",10.1002-14651858.CD013307,"Non‐drug approaches for preventing delirium in adults receiving care in hospital outside of intensive care and high dependency units 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for non‐pharmacological (non‐medication‐based) approaches to prevent delirium in adults in hospital, not including those treated in intensive care units (ICU, specialised wards for the care of critically ill patients). 
Background 
Delirium is an important illness which is common among adults, especially older adults who are in hospital. It is sometimes referred to as an 'acute confusional state'. Typically, a person with delirium has sudden onset of confusion, which fluctuates, and often includes impaired concentration, memory and thinking skills; reduced awareness of surroundings; drowsiness or agitation and restlessness; and hallucinations, which are usually visual (seeing things which are not really there). It can be distressing for the individual with delirium and their family. It is also associated with increased risks of complications, such as dying in hospital, having a longer hospital stay, and requiring more care after discharge. Increasingly, there is evidence that delirium is associated with an increased risk of permanent worsening of memory and thinking skills, including development or worsening of dementia.  
Non‐pharmacological approaches are approaches which do not use medications, but which focus on other aspects of care. They are already recognised as important in reducing the risk of delirium, particularly multicomponent interventions which target several of the common risk factors for delirium. It is not known which components of these complex interventions are most important in preventing delirium and this was something we wanted to find out.  
Study characteristics 
We searched up to 16 September 2020 for reports of studies in which people in hospital were randomly allocated to a non‐pharmacological intervention intended to prevent delirium or to usual hospital care.  We found 22 studies with 5718 participants. Fourteen of the studies were of multicomponent approaches; two studies looked at different cut‐offs for giving a blood transfusion after an orthopaedic operation; the remaining six studies all considered different approaches. 
Key findings 
Multicomponent approaches probably reduce occurrence of delirium by 43% compared to usual hospital care. This means that two in five cases of delirium in adults in hospital wards (other than ICU) can be prevented by multicomponent, non‐pharmacological approaches. These interventions may also reduce the length of time people stay in hospital and, if delirium does occur, they may reduce the duration of the delirium episode by about a day. However, these approaches may have little or no effect on the risk of dying in hospital. The studies did not investigate the effect of multicomponent interventions on the development or worsening of dementia. There was little information about whether the interventions had any harmful effects.  
Using a new statistical technique, we found  that the following components within each intervention were most important for preventing delirium:  (a) trying to keep people well‐oriented to their surroundings and making their surroundings more familiar, (b) providing stimulation to memory and thinking skills, and (c) trying to improve sleep (through sleep hygiene measures). We could not be so certain about the effect of other components, largely because not enough evidence was available. More research is needed comparing the specific components included in multicomponent interventions to help determine the most effective and efficient ways to prevent delirium.  
The evidence for other, single‐component, non‐pharmacological interventions was very limited.  
Certainty of the evidence 
There were some limitations in the studies which may affect the results. In many included studies the people in the study and sometimes researchers were aware of who was and was not receiving the intervention.  
There was very little information about people living with dementia, who are at greater risk of experiencing delirium.

What is a radial head fracture? 
The radial head is the topmost part of the radius, which is one of the two forearm bones. The radial head is part of the elbow joint. Fracture or breaking of the radial head is the most common elbow fracture. This injury usually results from a fall onto an outstretched arm. The symptoms of a radial head fracture are pain, swelling and bruising around the elbow, as well as restricted movement. 
What is aspiration? 
One treatment for radial head fracture is aspiration. This is a procedure where a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain excess fluid and blood from the elbow joint to relieve pressure and thus, in theory, relieve pain and improve clinical outcome. However, aspiration is an invasive procedure that puts the patient at further risk of complications, such as infection and injury to nerves and vessels. The procedure is typically done in the first few days after injury. 
Aim of the review 
We aimed to assess the effects (benefits and harms) of aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fracture in adults. 
Description of the studies included in the review  We searched the medical literature up to April 2014 and found two relevant studies that reported results for a total of 108 people with radial head fractures. Most participants were adults, aged 30 or over. They generally had less serious fractures and were all treated without surgery. The two studies were small, poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Neither study used reliable measures to assess function or pain. Consequently, we are very unsure of the findings of these trials. 
Summary of the evidence 
Very low quality evidence showed little difference between those who had joint aspiration and those who did not in being unable to carry heavy loads or having discomfort when carrying loads using their previously injured arm at one year after injury. Very low quality evidence shows that aspiration often provides immediate pain relief and may still provide pain relief at three weeks. Neither trial reported on adverse events from the procedure, but aspiration was reported as being unsuccessful in three participants of one study. Very low quality evidence shows little effect of aspiration on being able to extend the elbow at either six weeks or one year. The reporting of adverse events was incomplete, but one trial reported the absence of three common complications of radial head fractures. 
Conclusions 
Overall, there is not enough evidence to say whether aspiration gives better short‐term or longer‐term results than no aspiration in treating radial head fractures or how safe it is. We suggest that further research is needed to examine the use of aspiration for the initial treatment of radial head fractures. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Draining Fluid from the Elbow After a Radial Head Fracture

## Plain Title
Does Draining Fluid from the Elbow Help People with Radial Head Fractures?

## Rationale

**What is a radial head fracture?**
The radial head is the top part of one of your forearm bones. It helps form your elbow joint. A radial head fracture means this bone is broken. This is the most common type of elbow break. It usually happens when you fall on your arm while it is stretched out.

**What problems does this cause?**
When you break your radial head, you feel pain in your elbow. Your elbow swells up and gets bruised. You cannot move your elbow as well as before. Blood and fluid build up inside the elbow joint. This extra fluid puts pressure on the joint.

**What is aspiration?**
Aspiration is one way to treat this injury. A doctor uses a clean needle and syringe. They drain the extra blood and fluid from your elbow. The goal is to lower the pressure inside the joint. Doctors think this might reduce pain and help you heal better.

**Why study this treatment?**
Aspiration is not without risks. Putting a needle into your elbow can cause problems. You might get an infection. The needle might hurt nerves or blood vessels. Doctors wanted to know if aspiration really helps. They needed to know if the benefits are worth the risks.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked for all studies about elbow aspiration. They searched medical records up to April 2014. They found two studies that fit their needs.

**Who was in these studies?**
The two studies included 108 people total. Most people were adults aged 30 or older. All had radial head fractures. Most had less serious breaks. None needed surgery for their fracture.

**What did the studies compare?**
Some people got aspiration treatment. Other people did not get aspiration. Researchers compared the two groups. They looked at pain levels and elbow movement. They checked how well people could use their arm later.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies followed people for different times. Some checks happened at three weeks. Other checks happened at six weeks. The longest follow-up was one year after injury.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**
The two studies were small and not well done. The results are not very reliable. Here is what they showed:

**Pain relief:**
Aspiration often gave quick pain relief right away. It might still help with pain at three weeks. But the evidence is weak.

**Using the arm later:**
At one year, both groups had similar results. About the same number of people could not carry heavy loads. About the same number felt discomfort when carrying things. Aspiration did not seem to make much difference.

**Elbow movement:**
At six weeks and one year, both groups could extend their elbows about the same. Aspiration did not clearly improve movement.

**Safety concerns:**
The studies did not report safety problems well. One study said aspiration failed in three people. The needle could not drain the fluid. Neither study reported infections or nerve damage. But they may not have looked for these problems carefully.

**Quality of evidence:**
The evidence quality was very low. The studies were too small. They did not measure outcomes well. We cannot be sure about any of the findings.

**What do the results mean?**
We do not have enough good evidence. We cannot say if aspiration helps or not. We do not know if it is safe enough. The short-term benefits are unclear. The long-term benefits are also unclear.

**What is needed next?**
More and better research is needed. Future studies should be larger. They should measure pain and function carefully. They should track all safety problems. Only then can doctors know if aspiration truly helps people with radial head fractures.

**Conclusion:**
Right now, doctors do not have clear proof that draining fluid from the elbow helps. More studies are needed to answer this question.",10.1002-14651858.CD009949,"Aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fractures

Olfactory dysfunction is a common consequence of COVID‐19 infection and persistent symptoms can have a profound impact on quality of life. At present there is little guidance on how best to treat this condition. A variety of interventions have been suggested to promote recovery, including medication and olfactory training. However, it is uncertain whether any intervention is of benefit. This is an update of the 2021 review with one additional study added.  
Objectives
1) To evaluate the benefits and harms of any intervention versus no treatment for people with persisting olfactory dysfunction due to COVID‐19 infection.  
2) To keep the evidence up‐to‐date, using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the latest search was 20 October 2021.   
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with COVID‐19 related olfactory disturbance that had persisted for at least four weeks. We included any intervention compared to no treatment or placebo.  
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were the recovery of sense of smell, disease‐related quality of life and serious adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were the change in sense of smell, general quality of life, prevalence of parosmia and other adverse effects (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included two studies with 30 participants. The studies evaluated the following interventions: systemic corticosteroids plus intranasal corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant and palmitoylethanolamide plus luteolin.  
Systemic corticosteroids plus intranasal corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant compared to no intervention  
We included a single RCT with 18 participants who had anosmia for at least 30 days following COVID‐19 infection. Participants received a 15‐day course of oral corticosteroids combined with nasal irrigation (consisting of an intranasal corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant solution) or no intervention. Psychophysical testing was used to assess olfactory function at 40 days. This is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
Palmitoylethanolamide plus luteolin compared to no intervention  
We included a single RCT with 12 participants who had anosmia or hyposmia for at least 90 days following COVID‐19 infection. Participants received a 30‐day course of palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin or no intervention. Psychophysical testing was used to assess olfactory function at 30 days. This is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
Authors' conclusions
There is very limited evidence available on the efficacy and harms of treatments for persistent olfactory dysfunction following COVID‐19 infection. However, we have identified a number of ongoing trials in this area. As this is a living systematic review we will update the data regularly, as new results become available. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Loss of Smell After COVID-19

## Plain Title
Do treatments help people who have lost their sense of smell after COVID-19?

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Many people lose their sense of smell after having COVID-19. For some people, this problem lasts a long time. Not being able to smell can make life very hard. It affects how people enjoy food and drink. It can also make it hard to smell danger, like smoke or gas leaks.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors are not sure how to best help people who cannot smell after COVID-19. Some doctors suggest medicines. Others suggest smell training, where people practice smelling different scents. But no one knows if these treatments really work.

### What did researchers want to find out?
The researchers wanted to know if any treatment helps people get their sense of smell back after COVID-19. They also wanted to know if treatments cause any harm.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review study. The researchers looked for other studies that tested treatments for smell loss after COVID-19. They searched for studies up to October 2021.

### What types of studies did they include?
They only included studies where people were put into groups by chance. One group got treatment. The other group got no treatment or a fake treatment.

### Who was in the studies?
The researchers found two small studies with 30 people total. All these people had lost their sense of smell for at least 4 weeks after having COVID-19.

### What treatments were tested?
One study tested steroid pills plus nose spray. The nose spray had three types of medicine in it. This study had 18 people. They took the treatment for 15 days.

The other study tested two natural substances. These were called palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin. This study had 12 people. They took the treatment for 30 days.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers could not tell if the treatments worked or not. The studies were too small. The quality of the evidence was very low. This means we cannot trust the results to tell us the truth.

### Why couldn't they draw conclusions?
Both studies had very few people in them. With so few people, it is hard to know if results happened by chance. The researchers need much bigger studies to know if these treatments really help.

### What does this mean for patients?
Right now, we do not have good evidence about treatments for smell loss after COVID-19. Doctors and patients cannot be sure if any treatment will help.

### What happens next?
Many new studies are happening now. The researchers will keep looking for new results. They will update this review when new studies are finished. This is called a ""living review"" because it keeps getting updated with new information.

### Main conclusion
We need more and bigger studies to know if treatments can help people get their sense of smell back after COVID-19. Until then, we cannot say which treatments work or if they are safe.

Why this is important 
The sense of smell is critical to one's enjoyment of odours and tastes, and is important for safety. During the COVID‐19 pandemic there has been an increasing focus on change in sense of smell as one of the early symptoms associated with infection. This can be a reduction, change or complete loss of the sense of smell. For most people this is temporary, however for some this lasts weeks or even months. If a person has lost their sense of smell for a long time (over four weeks after having COVID‐19), we do not know if there are any treatments that might help it to recover.  
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
We searched the medical literature, identifying relevant studies and summarising the results. We assessed the quality of the studies as well as the certainty of the evidence. Factors influencing this included the size of the studies, the methods used to perform them and how results were reported by researchers. Based on this, we classed the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found two small studies to include in the review, including a total of 30 people. All participants had problems with their sense of smell that had lasted for at least four weeks, and started after a COVID‐19 infection. Problems with the sense of smell were identified using special smell identification tests carried out by the research team. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: those who would receive treatment and those who would not.  
The treatment in one study was a course of corticosteroid tablets ('systemic') and nasal irrigation (with a wash consisting of a mix of corticosteroids, decongestant and an agent that breaks down mucus). The second study used a course of a supplement known as palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin.  
Systemic corticosteroids and nasal irrigation (intranasal corticosteroids/decongestant/mucolytic) compared to no treatment 
We do not know whether corticosteroid tablets with nasal irrigation is better or worse than no treatment at: 
 ‐ restoring the sense of smell back to normal after 40 days; ‐ changing the sense of smell after 40 days; ‐ causing any unwanted side effects. 
This is because the evidence that we found was of very low certainty, mainly due to the fact that only one study was identified and it included a small number of patients. 
Palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin compared to no treatment 
We do not know whether palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin is better or worse than no treatment at: 
 ‐ restoring the sense of smell back to normal after 30 days; ‐ changing the sense of smell after 30 days; ‐ causing any unwanted side effects. 
This is because the evidence that we found was of very low certainty, mainly due to the fact that only one study was identified and it included a small number of patients. 
We did find a number of other studies that are being carried out, but no results from these studies are yet available to be included in this review. 
What this means 
It is unclear whether using corticosteroids with nasal irrigation, or using a palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin supplement, might treat problems with the sense of smell after COVID‐19, or whether these treatments can potentially cause harm. 
Other treatments are under investigation. This review is a 'living systematic review', meaning that we will keep checking for new studies that might be relevant, and the review will be continually updated when any extra results are available. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to October 2021.

Pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) have increased rates of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Current clinical guidelines support elective birth, at or near term, because of increased perinatal mortality during the third trimester of pregnancy. 
This review replaces a review previously published in 2001 that included ""diabetic pregnant women"", which has now been split into two reviews. This current review focuses on pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) and a sister review focuses on women with gestational diabetes. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of planned birth (either by induction of labour or caesarean birth) at or near term gestation (37 to 40 weeks’ gestation) compared with an expectant approach, for improving health outcomes for pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes and their infants. The primary outcomes relate to maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (15 August 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised trials (including those using a cluster‐randomised design) and non‐randomised trials (e.g. quasi‐randomised trials using alternate allocation) which compared planned birth, at or near term, with an expectant approach for pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two of the review authors independently assessed study eligibility. In future updates of this review, at least two of the review authors will extract data and assess the risk of bias in included studies. We will also assess the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified no eligible published trials for inclusion in this review.
We did identify one randomised trial which examined whether expectant management reduced the incidence of caesarean birth in uncomplicated pregnancies of women with gestational diabetes (requiring insulin) and with pre‐existing diabetes. However, published data from this trial does not differentiate between pre‐existing and gestational diabetes, and therefore we excluded this trial. 
Authors' conclusions
In the absence of evidence, we are unable to reach any conclusions about the health outcomes associated with planned birth, at or near term, compared with an expectant approach for pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes. 
This review demonstrates the urgent need for high‐quality trials evaluating the effectiveness of planned birth at or near term gestation for pregnant women with pre‐existing (Type 1 or Type 2) diabetes compared with an expectant approach. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Planned birth versus waiting for natural labor in pregnant women with diabetes they had before pregnancy

## Rationale

**What is the health condition?**

Some women have diabetes before they get pregnant. This is called pre-existing diabetes. There are two main types: Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. These women face more risks during pregnancy than women without diabetes.

**What problems can this condition cause?**

Pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes have higher risks of problems for themselves and their babies. The baby may die before or shortly after birth. The mother may have serious health problems. These risks increase in the last three months of pregnancy.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need to decide when these babies should be born. They can plan the birth early, between 37 and 40 weeks of pregnancy. Or they can wait for labor to start naturally. Right now, doctors often plan early births for these women. They do this to try to prevent the baby from dying. However, we do not know if planning an early birth is better than waiting.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know which approach is safer. They wanted to compare planned early birth with waiting for natural labor. They looked for studies that tested this question. They wanted to find out which choice leads to better health for mothers and babies.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a search for research studies. The researchers looked for trials that compared two approaches. One approach was planning birth between 37 and 40 weeks. The other was waiting for labor to start on its own.

**Who would be in these studies?**

The studies would include pregnant women with diabetes they had before pregnancy. This includes both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. It does not include women who got diabetes during pregnancy.

**What did the researchers do?**

The researchers searched medical databases in August 2017. They looked for all studies on this topic. They wanted to find high-quality research trials. They checked many different sources of medical research.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found no studies that could answer this question. They could not find any completed trials comparing planned birth with waiting for natural labor in women with pre-existing diabetes.

They found one trial that seemed relevant. However, that trial mixed together women with pre-existing diabetes and women with pregnancy diabetes. The results did not separate these two groups. Because of this, the researchers could not use that trial.

**What does this mean?**

Without any studies, we cannot say which approach is better. We do not know if planning an early birth is safer than waiting. We also do not know if waiting is safer than planning an early birth.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

There is an urgent need for research in this area. We need high-quality studies that test these two approaches. These studies should include only women with pre-existing diabetes. They should measure important outcomes for mothers and babies.

Until we have this research, doctors and patients must make decisions without clear evidence. This makes it hard to know the best choice for pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes.

**Why is this important?**

Many women with diabetes get pregnant each year. They and their doctors need good information to make the best decisions. Right now, that information does not exist. More research is needed to help these women and their babies stay healthy.",10.1002-14651858.CD012948,"Planned birth at or near term for improving health outcomes for pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes and their infants 
What is the issue? 
The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out if planning an elective birth at or near the term of pregnancy, compared to waiting for labour to start spontaneously, has an impact on the health of women with diabetes and the health of their babies. This review focuses on women who have diabetes before becoming pregnant (pre‐existing diabetes). Elective birth is carried out either by induction of labour or caesarean section, and 'at or near term' means 37 to 40 weeks' gestation. 
To answer this question, we searched for all relevant studies (date of search: 15 August 2017), with the aim of collecting and analysing them together. 
Why is this important? 
When women with diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) become pregnant they are at higher risk of complications than women who do not have diabetes. For example, their babies may be larger and have a higher risk of death in the later weeks of pregnancy. Because of these risks, many clinicians have recommended that women with diabetes have an elective birth (usually by induction) at or near term (37 to 40 weeks' gestation), rather than waiting for labour to start spontaneously or until 41 weeks' gestation if all is well. Induction has the disadvantage of increasing the incidence of forceps or ventouse births, and women often find it difficult to cope with an induced labour. Caesarean section is a major operation which can lead to blood loss, infections and increased chance of problems with subsequence births. Early birth can increase the chance of breathing problems for babies. It is important to know which approach to birth has a better impact on the health outcomes of women with pre‐existing diabetes and their babies. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found no studies that addressed our specific question.
What does this mean? 
In the absence of randomised studies, we are unable to say if women with pre‐existing diabetes and their babies experience better health outcomes if they have a planned birth (by induction of labour or caesarean section at 37 to 40 weeks' gestation) compared to waiting for labour to begin spontaneously or until 41 weeks' gestation if all is well. More research is needed to answer this question.

Chronic exposure to stress has been linked to several negative physiological and psychological health outcomes. Among employees, stress and its associated effects can also result in productivity losses and higher healthcare costs. In‐person (face‐to‐face) and computer‐based (web‐ and mobile‐based) stress management interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing stress in employees compared to no intervention. However, it is unclear if one form of intervention delivery is more effective than the other. It is conceivable that computer‐based interventions are more accessible, convenient, and cost‐effective. 
Objectives
To compare the effects of computer‐based interventions versus in‐person interventions for preventing and reducing stress in workers. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, NIOSHTIC, NIOSHTIC‐2, HSELINE, CISDOC, and two trials registers up to February 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled studies that compared the effectiveness of a computer‐based stress management intervention (using any technique) with a face‐to‐face intervention that had the same content. We included studies that measured stress or burnout as an outcome, and used workers from any occupation as participants. 
Data collection and analysis
Three authors independently screened and selected 75 unique studies for full‐text review from 3431 unique reports identified from the search. We excluded 73 studies based on full‐text assessment. We included two studies. Two review authors independently extracted stress outcome data from the two included studies. We contacted study authors to gather additional data. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to report study results. We did not perform meta‐analyses due to variability in the primary outcome and considerable statistical heterogeneity. We used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
Two studies met the inclusion criteria, including a total of 159 participants in the included arms of the studies (67 participants completed computer‐based interventions; 92 participants completed in‐person interventions). Workers were primarily white, Caucasian, middle‐aged, and college‐educated. Both studies delivered education about stress, its causes, and strategies to reduce stress (e.g. relaxation or mindfulness) via a computer in the computer‐based arm, and via small group sessions in the in‐person arm. Both studies measured stress using different scales at short‐term follow‐up only (less than one month). Due to considerable heterogeneity in the results, we could not pool the data, and we analysed the results of the studies separately. The SMD of stress levels in the computer‐based intervention group was 0.81 standard deviations higher (95% CI 0.21 to 1.41) than the in‐person group in one study, and 0.35 standard deviations lower (95% CI ‐0.76 to 0.05) than the in‐person group in another study. We judged both studies as having a high risk of bias. 
Authors' conclusions
We found very low‐quality evidence with conflicting results, when comparing the effectiveness of computer‐based stress management interventions with in‐person stress management interventions in employees. We could include only two studies with small sample sizes. We have very little confidence in the effect estimates. It is very likely that future studies will change these conclusions.

Comparing Computer Programs to In-Person Classes for Helping Workers Manage Stress

## Rationale

**What is stress and why does it matter?**

Stress is how your body and mind react to hard or difficult things in life. When people feel stressed for a long time, it can hurt their health. They may feel worried, tired, or sad. They may also get sick more often.

**Why is this important for workers?**

Many workers feel stressed at their jobs. This stress can make them feel bad and affect their work. When workers are stressed, they may miss work days. They may also need to see doctors more often. This costs money for both workers and their companies.

**What can help reduce stress?**

Programs that teach people how to manage stress can help. These programs teach workers about what causes stress. They also teach ways to feel calmer, like breathing exercises or relaxation.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

There are two main ways to teach stress management. One way is in-person classes where people meet face-to-face with a teacher. The other way is computer programs that people use on their own. Computer programs might be easier for people to use. They can use them at any time and any place. They might also cost less money.

Researchers wanted to know which way works better. Does learning from a computer work as well as learning from a person?

## Trial Design

**How did researchers set up this study?**

Researchers looked for studies that compared these two ways of teaching stress management. They searched through thousands of research papers. They found only two studies that fit what they needed.

**Who was in these studies?**

The two studies included 159 workers total. Most workers were white, middle-aged adults. Most had gone to college. In one group, 67 workers used computer programs. In another group, 92 workers went to in-person classes.

**What did the programs teach?**

Both the computer programs and in-person classes taught the same things. They taught workers about stress and what causes it. They taught ways to reduce stress, like relaxation and mindfulness. Mindfulness means paying attention to the present moment in a calm way.

**How long did the study last?**

Both studies checked how workers felt less than one month after they finished the programs.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The two studies had very different results. One study found that workers using computer programs felt more stressed than workers in in-person classes. The other study found that workers using computer programs felt slightly less stressed than workers in in-person classes.

**Why were the results unclear?**

The researchers could not combine the results from both studies. The studies were too different from each other. Also, both studies had problems with how they were done. This made the results less trustworthy.

**What does this mean?**

The researchers found very weak evidence. They cannot say for sure if computer programs work better, worse, or the same as in-person classes for reducing stress in workers.

**What are the main conclusions?**

Right now, we do not know which way of teaching stress management works better. The two studies were small. They only included 159 workers total. The results did not agree with each other. More and better studies are needed. Future studies will likely change what we know about this topic.

**Why should we care?**

Many workers need help managing stress. Knowing the best way to teach stress management could help millions of workers feel better. It could also save money for workers and companies. But we need more research to find the answer.",10.1002-14651858.CD011899,"Computer‐based versus in‐person stress management programmes for workers
What is the aim of this review? 
We wanted to find out if stress management programmes at work had a different effect if they were given via a computer, compared to being given in person. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. We found two studies that studied the effect of the delivery method on stress reduction in workers. 
Key messages 
The effects of the delivery method on stress reduction were unclear. More research should be conducted to directly compare equivalent stress management programmes delivered via a computer and in‐person. Any future studies will likely affect the conclusions of this review. 
What was studied in the review?  Many employers wish to reduce stress in their employees and are willing to invest in stress management programmes. It has been shown that workplace stress management programmes can reduce stress in employees, either when delivered by a computer or mobile device, or by a live person. However, it is unclear if the delivery method itself impacts how effective the programme is. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the intervention delivery method (computer or in person) to reduce stress in workers. 
What are the results of the review? 
We found two studies, involving 159 employees, that looked at stress levels in workers after completing stress management programmes on a computer, compared to workers receiving that same programme content from a live person. Both studies taught participants, individually or in small groups, how to recognise and reduce stress, but had conflicting results. 
How up to date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to February 2017.

Tuberculosis is the primary cause of hospital admission in people living with HIV, and the likelihood of death in the hospital is unacceptably high. The Alere Determine TB LAM Ag test (AlereLAM) is a point‐of‐care test and the only lateral flow lipoarabinomannan assay (LF‐LAM) assay currently commercially available and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). A 2019 Cochrane Review summarised the diagnostic accuracy of LF‐LAM for tuberculosis in people living with HIV. This systematic review assesses the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on mortality and other patient‐important outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on mortality in adults living with HIV in inpatient and outpatient settings. 
To assess the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on other patient‐important outcomes in adults living with HIV, including time to diagnosis of tuberculosis, and time to initiation of tuberculosis treatment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (Ovid); Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), BIOSIS Previews, Scopus, LILACS; ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the WHO ICTRP up to 12 March 2021. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials that compared a diagnostic intervention including LF‐LAM with diagnostic strategies that used smear microscopy, mycobacterial culture, a nucleic acid amplification test such as Xpert MTB/RIF, or a combination of these tests. We included adults (≥ 15 years) living with HIV. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility, extracted data, and analysed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized studies. We contacted study authors for clarification as needed. We used risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a fixed‐effect model except in the presence of clinical or statistical heterogeneity, in which case we used a random‐effects model. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included three trials, two in inpatient settings and one in outpatient settings. All trials were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa and assessed the impact of diagnostic strategies that included LF‐LAM on mortality when the test was used in conjunction with other tuberculosis diagnostic tests or clinical assessment for clinical decision‐making in adults living with HIV. 
Inpatient settings  
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy likely reduces mortality in people living with HIV at eight weeks compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (pooled RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.94; 5102 participants, 2 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence). That is, people living with HIV who received LF‐LAM had 15% lower risk of mortality. The absolute effect was 34 fewer deaths per 1000 (from 14 fewer to 55 fewer). 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy probably results in a slight increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (pooled RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.69; 5102 participants, 2 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Outpatient settings 
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality in people living with HIV at six months compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11; 2972 participants, 1 trial; low‐certainty evidence). Although this trial did not detect a difference in mortality, the direction of effect was towards a mortality reduction, and the effect size was similar to that in inpatient settings.  
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may result in a large increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (RR 5.44, 95% CI 4.70 to 6.29, 3022 participants, 1 trial; low‐certainty evidence). 
Other patient‐important outcomes 
Assessment of other patient‐important and implementation outcomes in the trials varied. The included trials demonstrated that a higher proportion of people living with HIV were able to produce urine compared to sputum for tuberculosis diagnostic testing; a higher proportion of people living with HIV were diagnosed with tuberculosis in the group that received LF‐LAM; and the incremental diagnostic yield was higher for LF‐LAM than for urine or sputum Xpert MTB/RIF. 
Authors' conclusions
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic testing strategy likely reduces mortality and probably results in a slight increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. The reduction in mortality may be due to earlier diagnosis, which facilitates prompt treatment initiation. In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality and may result in a large increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. Our results support the implementation of LF‐LAM to be used in conjunction with other WHO‐recommended tuberculosis diagnostic tests to assist in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis in people living with HIV. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing for Tuberculosis in People Living with HIV Using a Urine Test

## What Was This Study About?

Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious lung infection. It is the main reason people living with HIV need to go to the hospital. Sadly, many people with HIV die in the hospital from TB. The death rate is far too high.

Doctors need better ways to find TB quickly in people with HIV. A test called LF-LAM can help. This test uses a small sample of urine. It gives results in about 25 minutes. Doctors can use it right at the patient's bedside. The World Health Organization says doctors should use this test.

Researchers wanted to know if using the LF-LAM test would help save lives. They also wanted to know if it would help more people start TB treatment faster.

## How Was This Study Designed?

Researchers looked for all studies that tested the LF-LAM urine test. They found 3 studies. All 3 studies were done in countries in Africa, south of the Sahara Desert.

The studies included over 8,000 adults living with HIV. All participants were 15 years old or older. Some people were in the hospital. Others visited clinics but were not staying in the hospital.

The studies compared two groups:
- One group got the LF-LAM urine test plus regular TB tests
- The other group got only regular TB tests

Researchers tracked how many people died. They also tracked how many people started TB treatment. They followed people for 6 to 8 weeks in most cases. One study followed people for 6 months.

## What Were the Main Results?

**For People in the Hospital:**

Using the LF-LAM test likely saves lives. Out of every 1,000 people in the hospital, 34 fewer people died when doctors used the LF-LAM test. This means the test helped reduce deaths by 15 out of every 100 people who would have died.

The test also helped more people start TB treatment. Slightly more people began treatment when doctors used the LF-LAM test.

**For People Visiting Clinics:**

Using the LF-LAM test may save lives in clinic settings too. The study showed fewer deaths, though researchers need more proof to be certain. The results looked similar to the hospital results.

The test helped many more people start TB treatment. Far more people began treatment when doctors used the LF-LAM test at clinics.

**Other Important Findings:**

The studies showed several helpful things about the LF-LAM test:
- More people could give a urine sample than a sputum sample (the thick mucus you cough up)
- More people were found to have TB when doctors used the LF-LAM test
- The test found TB in people that other tests missed

## What Do These Results Mean?

The LF-LAM urine test helps save lives. It works best for people with HIV who are sick enough to be in the hospital. The test also helps in clinic settings.

The test likely saves lives because it finds TB faster. When doctors find TB early, they can start treatment right away. Quick treatment saves lives.

Doctors should use the LF-LAM test along with other TB tests. Using several tests together helps find more cases of TB. This is very important for people living with HIV.

The test is easy to use. It only needs urine, not sputum. Many sick people cannot cough up sputum. But almost everyone can give a urine sample. The test gives results in less than half an hour. Doctors can start treatment the same day.

These findings support using the LF-LAM test widely. Hospitals and clinics that care for people with HIV should use this test. It can help reduce the number of people who die from TB.",10.1002-14651858.CD014641,"Impact of diagnostic strategies for tuberculosis using lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan test in people living with HIV 
What was the aim of this review? 
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in people living with HIV. The disease is particularly difficult to diagnose in people living with HIV, in part because it is often challenging to produce sputum for diagnosis. The lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan test (LF‐LAM) is a World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended rapid test to assist in the detection of active tuberculosis in people living with HIV. This review is limited to studies that used the Alere Determine TB LAM Ag test (AlereLAM), which is the only LF‐LAM test currently recommended by the WHO; thus LF‐LAM refers only to AlereLAM in this review. Rapid and early tuberculosis diagnosis may allow for prompt treatment and prevent severe illness and death. The aim of this review was to determine whether the use of LF‐LAM testing had an effect on death and other patient‐important outcomes in people living with HIV. 
Key messages 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic testing strategy likely reduces deaths and probably results in a slight increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV.  
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce deaths and may result in a large increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. 
What was studied in the review? 
We searched for trials in adults (15 years and older) that evaluated the effect of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy that included the LF‐LAM test compared to standard care using other WHO‐recommended diagnostic tests in adults living with HIV. 
What were the main results of the review? 
We identified three trials, two in inpatient settings and one in outpatient settings.
Inpatient settings 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy likely reduces mortality in people living with HIV at eight weeks compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (2 trials, 5102 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy probably results in a slight increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (2 trials, 5102 participants moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Outpatient settings 
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality in people living with HIV at six months compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (1 trial, 2972 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may result in a large increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (1 trial, 3022 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Other patient‐important outcomes 
The included studies assessed other patient‐important outcomes in different ways. The studies demonstrated that more people living with HIV were able to produce urine compared to sputum for tuberculosis diagnostic testing, and more people living with HIV were diagnosed with tuberculosis in the group that received LF‐LAM.

Glaucoma is a group of optic neuropathies characterized by progressive degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells, axonal loss and irreversible visual field defects. Glaucoma is classified as primary or secondary, and worldwide, primary glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Several subtypes of glaucoma exist, and primary open‐angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common. The etiology of POAG is unknown, but current treatments aim to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP), thus preventing the onset and progression of the disease. Compared with traditional antiglaucomatous treatments, rho kinase inhibitors (ROKi) have a different pharmacodynamic. ROKi is the only current treatment that effectively lowers IOP by modulating the drainage of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal. As ROKi are introduced into the market more widely, it is important to assess the efficacy and potential AEs of the treatment. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of ROKi with placebo or other glaucoma medication in people diagnosed with open‐angle glaucoma (OAG), primary open‐angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). 
Search methods
We used standard Cochrane methods and searched databases on 11 December 2020.
Selection criteria
We included randomized clinical trials examining commercially available ROKi‐based monotherapy or combination therapy compared with placebo or other IOP‐lowering medical treatments in people diagnosed with (P)OAG or OHT. We included trials where ROKi were administered according to official glaucoma guidelines. There were no restrictions regarding type, year or status of the publication. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias by using Cochrane's RoB 2 tool.  
Main results
We included 17 trials with 4953 participants diagnosed with (P)OAG or OHT. Fifteen were multicenter trials and 15 were masked trials. All participants were aged above 18 years. Trial duration varied from 24 hours to 12 months. Trials were conducted in the USA, Canada and Japan. Sixteen trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies, and one trial provided no information about funding sources. The trials compared ROKi monotherapy (netarsudil or ripasudil) or combination therapy with latanoprost (prostaglandin analog) or timolol (beta‐blocker) with placebo, timolol, latanoprost or netarsudil. Reported outcomes were IOP and safety. Meta‐analyses were applied to 13 trials (IOP reduction from baseline) and 15 trials (ocular AEs).  
Of the trials evaluating IOP, seven were at low risk, three had some concerns, and three were at high risk of bias. Three trials found that netarsudil monotherapy may be superior to placebo (mean difference [MD] 3.11 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.59 to 3.62; I2 = 0%; 155 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Evidence from three trials found that timolol may be superior to netarsudil with an MD of 0.66 mmHg (95% CI 0.41 to 0.91; I2 = 0%; 1415 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Evidence from four trials found that latanoprost may be superior to netarsudil with an MD of 0.97 mmHg (95% CI 0.67 to 1.27; I2 = 4%; 1283 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Evidence from three trials showed that, compared with monotherapy with latanoprost, combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost probably led to an additional pooled mean IOP reduction from baseline of 1.64 mmHg (95% CI −2.16 to −1.11; 1114 participants). Evidence from three trials showed that, compared with monotherapy with netarsudil, combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost probably led to an additional pooled mean IOP reduction from baseline of 2.66 mmHg (95% CI −2.98 to −2.35; 1132 participants). The certainty of evidence was moderate. One trial showed that,  compared with timolol monotherapy, combination therapy with ripasudil and timolol may lead to an IOP reduction from baseline of 0.75 mmHg (95% −1.29 to −CI 0.21; 208 participants). The certainty of evidence was moderate. 
Of the trials assessing total ocular AEs, three were at low risk, four had some concerns, and eight were at high risk of bias.  
We found very low‐certainty evidence that netarsudil may lead to more ocular AEs compared with placebo, with 66 more ocular AEs per 100 person‐months (95% CI 28 to 103; I2 = 86%; 4 trials, 188 participants). We found low‐certainty evidence that netarsudil may lead to more ocular AEs compared with latanoprost, with 29 more ocular AEs per 100 person‐months (95% CI 17 to 42; I2 = 95%; 4 trials, 1286 participants).  
We found moderate‐certainty evidence that, compared with timolol, netarsudil probably led to 21 additional ocular AEs (95% CI 14 to 27; I2 = 93%; 4 trials, 1678 participants). Data from three trials (1132 participants) showed no evidence of differences in the incidence rate of AEs between combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost and netarsudil monotherapy (1 more event per 100 person‐months, 95% CI 0 to 3); however, the certainty of evidence was low. Similarly, we found low‐certainty evidence that, compared with latanoprost, combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost may cause 29 more ocular events per 100 person‐months (95% CI 11 to 47; 3 trials, 1116 participants). We found moderate‐certainty evidence that, compared with timolol monotherapy, combination therapy with ripasudil and timolol probably causes 35 more ocular events per 100 person‐months (95% CI 25 to 45; 1 trial, 208 participants). In all included trials, ROKi was reportedly not associated with any particular serious AEs. 
Authors' conclusions
The current evidence suggests that in people diagnosed with OHT or (P)OAG, the hypotensive effect of netarsudil may be inferior to latanoprost and slightly inferior to timolol. Combining netarsudil and latanoprost probably further reduces IOP compared with monotherapy. Netarsudil as mono‐ or combination therapy may result in more ocular AEs. However, the certainty of evidence was very low or low for all comparisons except timolol. In general, AEs were described as mild, transient, and reversible upon treatment discontinuation. ROKi was not associated with any particular serious AEs. Future trials of sufficient size and follow‐up should be conducted to provide reliable information about glaucoma progression, relevant IOP measurements and a detailed description of AEs using similar terminology. This would ensure the robustness and confidence of the results and assess the intermediate‐ and long‐term efficacy and safety of ROKi. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing New Eye Drops Called Rho Kinase Inhibitors for Glaucoma

## Plain Title

Comparing new eye drops (rho kinase inhibitors) with other treatments for people with glaucoma or high eye pressure

## Rationale

**What is glaucoma and why does it matter?**

Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the nerve at the back of the eye. This damage happens slowly over time. It causes vision loss that cannot be fixed. Glaucoma is one of the main reasons people go blind around the world.

The most common type is called primary open-angle glaucoma. Doctors do not know exactly what causes it. But they do know that high pressure inside the eye can make it worse.

**What are current treatments?**

Most glaucoma treatments work by lowering the pressure inside the eye. This helps stop the disease from getting worse. These treatments include eye drops that patients use every day.

**What are rho kinase inhibitors?**

Rho kinase inhibitors (also called ROKi) are a new type of eye drop. They work differently than older treatments. ROKi help fluid drain out of the eye more easily. This lowers eye pressure. The fluid drains through tiny channels inside the eye.

**Why was this study needed?**

ROKi are becoming more widely available. Doctors need to know how well they work. They also need to know if they are safe. This study compared ROKi with other glaucoma treatments and with fake drops (placebo).

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 17 different studies. These studies included 4,953 people total. All participants were adults over 18 years old. They had either glaucoma or high eye pressure.

Most studies were done at multiple hospitals or clinics. Most studies were ""masked."" This means patients did not know which treatment they received.

**Where and when were the studies done?**

The studies took place in the United States, Canada, and Japan. They lasted from 24 hours to 12 months. Drug companies paid for 16 of the 17 studies.

**What treatments were compared?**

The studies tested two ROKi drugs: netarsudil and ripasudil. Some patients used ROKi alone. Others used ROKi combined with another drug. Researchers compared these with:
- Fake drops (placebo)
- Timolol (an older glaucoma drug)
- Latanoprost (another glaucoma drug)

**What did researchers measure?**

They measured eye pressure. They also tracked side effects.

## Results

**How well did ROKi lower eye pressure?**

Netarsudil alone worked better than fake drops. It lowered eye pressure by about 3 points more.

However, older drugs worked better than netarsudil alone. Timolol lowered pressure slightly more than netarsudil. Latanoprost lowered pressure about 1 point more than netarsudil.

**Did combining drugs work better?**

Yes. Using netarsudil plus latanoprost together worked better than either drug alone. The combination lowered pressure about 2 points more than latanoprost alone. It lowered pressure about 3 points more than netarsudil alone.

Using ripasudil plus timolol also worked better than timolol alone.

**What were the side effects?**

ROKi caused more eye-related side effects than other treatments. For every 100 people using netarsudil for one month:
- 66 more had eye problems compared to fake drops
- 29 more had eye problems compared to latanoprost
- 21 more had eye problems compared to timolol

The combination of netarsudil plus latanoprost also caused more eye problems than latanoprost alone.

**Were the side effects serious?**

No. The side effects were usually mild. They were temporary. They went away when people stopped using the drops. No serious safety problems were found with ROKi.

**What do these results mean?**

Netarsudil does not lower eye pressure as well as some older drugs. But combining it with latanoprost works better than either drug alone. ROKi cause more eye side effects, but these are not serious.

**What is still unknown?**

More research is needed. Future studies should:
- Follow patients for longer periods
- Use the same words to describe side effects
- Check if ROKi prevent vision loss over time

This will help doctors know if ROKi are good long-term treatments for glaucoma.",10.1002-14651858.CD013817,"Rho kinase inhibitors for primary open‐angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension
Question 
What are the benefits and risks of rho kinase inhibitor eye drops to treat people with either glaucoma or increased eye pressure? 
Key messages 
Antiglaucomatous eye drops such as latanoprost and timolol may reduce the eye pressure more compared with treatment with a rho kinase inhibitor, but the difference with timolol is small. When combining rho kinase inhibitors with different types of medicine, the eye pressure may be reduced more. People treated with a rho kinase inhibitor experience more adverse events (side effects) compared with other treatments. Future research in this area should focus on reporting disease progression (how the glaucoma gets worse over time). 
What is glaucoma? 
Glaucoma is a sight‐threatening eye disease that can lead to blindness if left untreated. There are different types of glaucoma and the most common is called primary open‐angle glaucoma. High eye pressure is a known risk factor for developing glaucoma.  
Medical glaucoma treatment 
There are different types of eye drops that can be used to treat glaucoma. All medical treatments of glaucoma work by reducing eye pressure. Latanoprost and timolol are two glaucoma medications, and one of the new types of glaucoma medicine is called a rho kinase inhibitor.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to examine whether the effectiveness and safety of rho kinase inhibitor eye drops were better or worse than other medicines. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared:
‐ rho kinase inhibitor with placebo (a treatment with no therapeutic effect);
‐ rho kinase inhibitor with other types of glaucoma treatments (latanoprost and timolol).
Search date  
We searched medical databases on 11 December 2020.
What did we find? 
We found 17 studies examining 4953 people aged at least 18 years diagnosed with primary open‐angle glaucoma or high eye pressure and treated with a rho kinase inhibitor. The studies varied in treatment duration from 24 hours to 12 months. They were conducted in the USA, Canada and Japan. Of the studies, 16  were funded by pharmaceutical companies and one did not provide information about potential funding sources. The effect of treatment was evaluated by measuring the eye pressure and assessing the adverse events of treatment. 
The studies did not report data disease progression, but they reported data on the lowering of the pressure within the eye and adverse events. Treatment with latanoprost may be better than rho kinase inhibitor. Treatment with timolol may be slightly better than treatment with rho kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, treatment with both rho kinase inhibitor and latanoprost or timolol probably reduces the eye pressure even more. Overall, the studies reported adverse events very differently. More people treated with rho kinase inhibitors may have experienced eye‐related adverse events; however, we are not very certain about these findings. There were no serious adverse events reported for treatment with rho kinase inhibitor. 
Main limitations of the evidence 
The studies did not report all the outcomes that we were interested in. The studies focused on specific outcomes such as eye pressure and adverse events, whereas we wanted to answer other questions as well. The current evidence was based on few studies. Some studies were conducted in a way that may have introduced errors into the results. Studies varied in the way they measured the outcomes and thus may not be comparable to each other.

## Plain Title
Shorter Radiation Treatment for Prostate Cancer: Does It Work as Well as Standard Treatment?

## Rationale

**What is prostate cancer and why is this study important?**

Prostate cancer is a disease that affects the prostate gland in men. When the cancer stays only in the prostate, doctors call it localized prostate cancer.

Doctors often treat this cancer with radiation therapy. This uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. However, radiation can cause problems. Men may have bladder or bowel side effects. Their sexual function may also be affected.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Standard radiation treatment takes many weeks. Patients visit the clinic every day. Each day, they get a small dose of radiation (1.8 to 2 Gray).

Researchers wanted to test a shorter treatment plan. This is called hypofractionation. Patients get fewer visits but larger doses each time (more than 2 Gray per visit).

**Why test this shorter treatment?**

If the shorter treatment works just as well, it could help patients in many ways. Fewer visits mean less time away from home and work. It would be more convenient. It would also cost less and use fewer hospital resources.

But researchers needed to make sure the shorter treatment was safe. They wanted to check if it controlled cancer as well as standard treatment. They also wanted to see if side effects were about the same.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 10 different studies. They combined the results from all these studies together.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included 8,278 men total. These men were 64 years old or older. All had prostate cancer that had not spread beyond the pelvis area.

**What did researchers compare?**

They compared two groups of men:
- One group got standard radiation (many visits with small doses)
- One group got hypofractionation (fewer visits with larger doses)

Researchers tracked the men over time. They looked at how well the treatment worked. They also watched for side effects.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The shorter radiation treatment worked about as well as standard treatment in several ways:

**Cancer control:** Men who got the shorter treatment had a similar risk of dying from prostate cancer. They also lived about the same length of time overall. The cancer was about as likely to spread in both groups.

**Side effects on the bladder:** Late bladder problems (problems that show up months or years later) were probably about the same in both groups. Early bladder problems (during or right after treatment) may also be similar.

**Side effects on the bowel:** Researchers are not sure about late bowel side effects. More research is needed to understand this better.

**What does this mean for patients?**

The shorter radiation treatment appears to work as well as standard treatment for most outcomes. It may be a good choice for men with localized prostate cancer.

The shorter treatment has clear benefits:
- Fewer trips to the hospital
- Less time spent in treatment
- More convenient for patients and families
- Lower cost

**What did the researchers conclude?**

Using fewer but larger doses of radiation seems to control prostate cancer about as well as standard treatment. Most side effects appear similar between the two approaches. However, more research is needed to fully understand bowel side effects.

The evidence supports using shorter radiation treatment as an option for men with localized prostate cancer. This can make treatment easier for patients while still fighting cancer effectively.",10.1002-14651858.CD011462,"Use of shorter radiation treatments for prostate cancer

What is the aim of this review? 
We aimed to understand the experiences and opinions of people using rapid automated tests that identify tuberculosis and resistance to tuberculosis drugs (molecular diagnostic tests). Users include people who might have tuberculosis and their families or caregivers, doctors, nurses, laboratory staff, and managers of services or programmes. 
What was studied in this review?  
Rapid molecular diagnostic tests were designed to make diagnosis easier and faster for people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, because they do not require a well‐equipped laboratory, but can be done in clinics closer to where people live. Since these tests can also suggest whether an individual suffers from drug‐resistant tuberculosis (including multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis (MDR‐TB)), the right treatment can be started earlier. We collected and analysed all relevant studies and found 32 studies conducted in areas where tuberculosis is common in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
MDR‐TB is tuberculosis caused by resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective first‐line drugs used to treat tuberculosis.  
This qualitative evidence synthesis links to another Cochrane Review that examines the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid molecular test for tuberculosis drug resistance. Yet, diagnostic tests only have an impact on health if they are put to use in a correct and timely manner. Accuracy studies do not reveal what users think of or how they experience the test in question. We need to understand the perspectives and experiences of all users. Otherwise, we risk these tests not fitting settings where they are to be used or not being accessible for those in need. 
What are the main findings? 
People with tuberculosis value knowing what is wrong with them. People valued having an accurate diagnosis, avoiding delays in being diagnosed, having accessible testing facilities, and keeping cost low. Similarly, healthcare providers value having accurate tests that give them confidence in the diagnosis, rapid results, and keeping cost low, being able to use different specimens (such as sputum and stool)  and receiving information about drug resistance as part of the test results. Laboratory personnel appreciated that laboratory work was made easier and that staff was more satisfied thanks to rapid molecular diagnostic tests. 
Our review also identified several challenges to realizing these values. Some people with tuberculosis and some healthcare providers were reluctant to use rapid molecular diagnostic tests because of fears of testing positive, concerns of stigma or discredit in the community, or expenses related to the testing. Additional support is required to overcome these barriers that are common to other approaches to testing for tuberculosis. Other challenges that led to delays and underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests were health system inefficiencies; poor quality of specimens; difficulty in transporting specimens; lack of sufficient resources such as staff or equipment; increased workload for providers; inefficiencies in integrating the test into routines at clinics; the complicated or lengthy steps involved in obtaining a tuberculosis diagnosis; clinicians relying too much on the test result while neglecting their own experience with diagnosing tuberculosis; and processes of implementing the test in national programmes that lacked data about real‐life situations and did not include all relevant stakeholders such as local decision‐makers, providers or people seeking a diagnosis. 
Lastly, people expressed concerns about unsustainable funding, maintenance requirements of the tests, lengthy delays in diagnosis, underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests, lack of tuberculosis diagnostic facilities in local communities, conflicts of interest between donors and people who utilize the tests, and too many restrictions on who was allowed to access the test. These concerns hampered access to prompt and accurate testing and treatment. This was particularly the case for vulnerable people, such as children, people with MDR‐TB, or those with limited ability to pay. 
Overall, these challenges risk undoing the added value of rapid molecular diagnostic tests. They risk leading to less frequent use of these tests. Implementation of new diagnostic tests, like those considered in this review, will need to tackle the challenges identified in this review including weak infrastructure and systems, as well as insufficient data about real‐life situations before and during implementation in order to ensure the tests are accessible for those in need. 
How up to date is this review? 
We included studies published between 1 January 2007 and 20 October 2021. We limited all searches to 2007 onward because the development of Xpert MTB/RIF, the first rapid molecular diagnostic test in this review, was completed in 2009. 
","# Plain Language Summary: What People Think About Fast Tests for Tuberculosis

## Plain Title
What Patients and Healthcare Workers Think About Fast Tests That Find Tuberculosis and Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis

## Rationale

**What is tuberculosis?**
Tuberculosis is a serious lung disease. It spreads from person to person through the air. People can die from tuberculosis if they do not get treatment.

**What is drug-resistant tuberculosis?**
Some tuberculosis germs do not respond to common medicines. Doctors call this drug-resistant tuberculosis. It is harder to treat. Patients need different medicines that work better against these germs.

**Why was this study needed?**
In the past, testing for tuberculosis took a long time. Patients had to wait weeks for results. The tests needed special labs far from where people lived. This meant delays in starting treatment.

**What are rapid molecular tests?**
Scientists made new fast tests. These tests can find tuberculosis in hours, not weeks. They can also show if the tuberculosis is drug-resistant. Doctors can use these tests in clinics close to patients' homes.

**Why did researchers do this study?**
The researchers wanted to know what people think about these fast tests. They wanted to hear from patients with tuberculosis. They also wanted to hear from doctors, nurses, and lab workers. Understanding what users think helps make tests work better for everyone.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a test of new medicine. Instead, researchers looked at 32 other studies. These studies asked people about their experiences with fast tuberculosis tests.

**Who was included?**
The studies included:
- People who might have tuberculosis
- Family members and caregivers
- Doctors and nurses
- Laboratory workers
- Program managers

**Where did the studies take place?**
All studies happened in countries where tuberculosis is common. These were low-income and middle-income countries.

**When were the studies done?**
Researchers looked at studies from 2007 to 2021. They started in 2007 because the first fast test was made in 2009.

## Results

**What did people like about the fast tests?**

Patients valued several things:
- Getting accurate answers about their health
- Not waiting long for test results
- Having test sites close to home
- Keeping costs low

Healthcare workers also liked these tests:
- Results they could trust
- Fast answers to help patients quickly
- Lower costs
- Being able to test different samples like spit or stool
- Learning if tuberculosis was drug-resistant

Lab workers found their jobs easier. They felt more satisfied at work.

**What problems did people find?**

Some patients and healthcare workers did not want to use the tests. They feared:
- Testing positive for tuberculosis
- Other people treating them badly
- High costs for testing

Other problems made the tests work poorly:
- Health systems did not run well
- Poor quality samples
- Hard to move samples to labs
- Not enough staff or equipment
- Too much work for healthcare providers
- Tests did not fit into clinic routines
- Too many steps to get a diagnosis
- Doctors relied only on test results and ignored their own knowledge

**What about putting these tests into use?**

People worried about several things:
- Money running out to pay for tests
- Tests breaking down and needing repairs
- Long waits for results
- Not using the tests enough
- No test sites in local areas
- Outside donors having too much control
- Too many rules about who could get tested

These problems hurt vulnerable people the most. This included children, people with drug-resistant tuberculosis, and poor people.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The fast tests have real benefits. But many challenges stop them from working well. Weak health systems cause problems. Not enough information about real-life use causes problems.

To make these tests work, countries need to:
- Fix weak health systems
- Gather information about real-world use
- Include local decision-makers when planning
- Make tests available to everyone who needs them

**Why does this matter?**

Fast tests can save lives. But only if people can use them. Understanding what users think helps make tests work better. This review shows what needs to change so more people can get tested and treated quickly.",10.1002-14651858.CD014877,"Rapid molecular tests for tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance: the views and experiences of people who are tested and healthcare providers

Hip fractures are a major healthcare problem, presenting a considerable challenge and burden to individuals and healthcare systems. The number of hip fractures globally is rising rapidly. The majority of intracapsular hip fractures are treated surgically. 
Objectives
To assess the relative effects (benefits and harms) of all surgical treatments used in the management of intracapsular hip fractures in older adults, using a network meta‐analysis of randomised trials, and to generate a hierarchy of interventions according to their outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and five other databases in July 2020. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, reference lists of retrieved articles and conducted backward‐citation searches. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing different treatments for fragility intracapsular hip fractures in older adults. We included total hip arthroplasties (THAs), hemiarthroplasties (HAs), internal fixation, and non‐operative treatments. We excluded studies of people with hip fracture with specific pathologies other than osteoporosis or resulting from high‐energy trauma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. One review author completed data extraction which was checked by a second review author. We collected data for three outcomes at different time points: mortality and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) ‐ both reported within 4 months, at 12 months, and after 24 months of surgery, and unplanned return to theatre (at end of study follow‐up). 
We performed a network meta‐analysis (NMA) with Stata software, using frequentist methods, and calculated the differences between treatments using risk ratios (RRs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also performed direct comparisons using the same codes. 
Main results
We included 119 studies (102 RCTS, 17 quasi‐RCTs) with 17,653 participants with 17,669 intracapsular fractures in the review; 83% of fractures were displaced. The mean participant age ranged from 60 to 87 years and 73% were women.  
After discussion with clinical experts, we selected 12 nodes that represented the best balance between clinical plausibility and efficiency of the networks: cemented modern unipolar HA, dynamic fixed angle plate, uncemented first‐generation bipolar HA, uncemented modern bipolar HA, cemented modern bipolar HA, uncemented first‐generation unipolar HA, uncemented modern unipolar HA, THA with single articulation, dual‐mobility THA, pins, screws, and non‐operative treatment. Seventy‐five studies (with 11,855 participants) with data for at least two of these treatments contributed to the NMA. 
We selected cemented modern unipolar HA as a reference treatment against which other treatments were compared. This was a common treatment in the networks, providing a clinically appropriate comparison. In order to provide a concise summary of the results, we report only network estimates when there was evidence of difference between treatments. 
We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for serious and very serious risks of bias and when estimates included possible transitivity, particularly for internal fixation which included more undisplaced fractures. We also downgraded for incoherence, or inconsistency in indirect estimates, although this affected few estimates. Most estimates included the possibility of benefits and harms, and we downgraded the evidence for these treatments for imprecision.  
We found that cemented modern unipolar HA, dynamic fixed angle plate and pins seemed to have the greatest likelihood of reducing mortality at 12 months. Overall, 23.5% of participants who received the reference treatment died within 12 months of surgery. Uncemented modern bipolar HA had higher mortality than the reference treatment (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.85; derived only from indirect evidence; low‐certainty evidence), and THA with single articulation also had higher mortality (network estimate RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.32; derived from direct evidence from 2 studies with 225 participants, and indirect evidence; very low‐certainty evidence). In the remaining treatments, the certainty of the evidence ranged from low to very low, and we noted no evidence of any differences in mortality at 12 months.  
We found that THA (single articulation), cemented modern bipolar HA and uncemented modern bipolar HA seemed to have the greatest likelihood of improving HRQoL at 12 months. This network was comparatively sparse compared to other outcomes and the certainty of the evidence of differences between treatments was very low. We noted no evidence of any differences in HRQoL at 12 months, although estimates were imprecise. 
We found that arthroplasty treatments seemed to have a greater likelihood of reducing unplanned return to theatre than internal fixation and non‐operative treatment. We estimated that 4.3% of participants who received the reference treatment returned to theatre during the study follow‐up. Compared to this treatment, we found low‐certainty evidence that more participants returned to theatre if they were treated with a dynamic fixed angle plate (network estimate RR 4.63, 95% CI 2.94 to 7.30; from direct evidence from 1 study with 190 participants, and indirect evidence). We found very low‐certainty evidence that more participants returned to theatre when treated with pins (RR 4.16, 95% CI 2.53 to 6.84; only from indirect evidence), screws (network estimate RR 5.04, 95% CI 3.25 to 7.82; from direct evidence from 2 studies with 278 participants, and indirect evidence), and non‐operative treatment (RR 5.41, 95% CI 1.80 to 16.26; only from indirect evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence of a tendency for an increased risk of unplanned return to theatre for all of the arthroplasty treatments, and in particular for THA, compared with cemented modern unipolar HA, with little evidence to suggest the size of this difference varied strongly between the arthroplasty treatments. 
Authors' conclusions
There was considerable variability in the ranking of each treatment such that there was no one outstanding, or subset of outstanding, superior treatments. However, cemented modern arthroplasties tended to more often yield better outcomes than alternative treatments and may be a more successful approach than internal fixation. There is no evidence of a difference between THA (single articulation) and cemented modern unipolar HA in the outcomes measured in this review. THA may be an appropriate treatment for a subset of people with intracapsular fracture but we have not explored this further.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Surgeries for Hip Fractures in Older Adults

## Plain Title

Comparing different types of surgery to fix broken hips in older people

## Rationale

**What is a hip fracture and why does it matter?**

A hip fracture is a broken bone at the top of the leg. This type of break happens most often in older adults. Hip fractures are a major health problem around the world. The number of people breaking their hips is going up fast.

When someone breaks their hip, it causes serious problems. They often cannot walk or care for themselves. Many people need surgery to fix the broken bone. Without treatment, people may have pain and lose their ability to move around.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors use several different types of surgery to fix broken hips. Some surgeries replace part of the hip joint. Others use pins or screws to hold the broken bone together. Doctors need to know which surgery works best.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

The researchers wanted to compare all the different surgeries used to fix broken hips. They wanted to know which surgeries help people live longer. They also wanted to know which surgeries help people feel better and avoid more surgery later.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

The researchers looked at 119 past studies. These studies included 17,653 older adults who had broken hips. Most of these people were women (73%). Their ages ranged from 60 to 87 years old.

The researchers compared 12 different treatments. Most treatments were different types of hip replacement surgery. Some used cement to hold the new parts in place. Others did not use cement. Some treatments used pins or screws instead of replacement parts. One option was no surgery at all.

The researchers looked at three main things:
- How many people died after surgery
- How well people felt and moved around after surgery
- How many people needed another surgery later

They checked these results at different times. They looked at results within 4 months, at 12 months, and after 24 months.

**Who was in these studies?**

All the people in these studies were older adults with broken hips. Most breaks happened because their bones were weak from aging. The researchers did not include people whose bones broke from major accidents or other diseases.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The researchers found that no single surgery was clearly the best for everyone. Different surgeries had different benefits and risks.

**Results for staying alive:**

About 1 in 4 people died within 12 months after surgery. This happened no matter which surgery they had. Some surgeries seemed slightly better or worse:
- Two types of hip replacement had higher death rates than others
- Surgeries using cement seemed to work slightly better

**Results for quality of life:**

The study could not clearly show which surgery helped people feel best. There was not enough information to be certain. Total hip replacements might help people move and feel better. But the researchers need more studies to be sure.

**Results for needing more surgery:**

About 4 out of 100 people needed another surgery later. This was for people who got one common type of hip replacement. People who got pins or screws were much more likely to need another surgery. About 4 to 5 times as many people with pins or screws needed more surgery.

Hip replacements using cement worked better than pins or screws. Fewer people needed to return for more surgery.

**What do these results mean?**

Hip replacements using cement seem to work better overall than pins or screws. Fewer people need more surgery when they get a cemented hip replacement. Total hip replacement might be good for some people. But doctors need to choose carefully based on each person's health.

The researchers say more studies are needed. They want to know which surgery works best for different types of people.",10.1002-14651858.CD013404,"Which are the best treatments for hip fractures in older adults?
Why is this question important? 
A hip fracture is a break at the top of the leg bone. We included people with a break just below the ball and socket joint. These types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. They often happen after a fall from a standing or sitting position. The broken hip can be treated in different ways, and we don't know whether some treatments are better than others. 
What are the treatments? 
‐ Replacing the broken hip with an artificial one. This can be done using a hemiarthroplasty (HA), which replaces only the ball part of the joint, and can be unipolar (a single artificial joint) or bipolar which has an additional joint within the HA. A total hip arthroplasty (THA) replaces all of the hip joint, including the socket, and usually has just one artifical joint between the ball and the socket (single articulation) or sometimes two (dual‐mobility). All types of artificial joints can be fixed in place with or without bone cement. 
‐ Using metal implants to fix the broken parts of the bones. Pins or screws may be inserted through the two parts of broken bone, or the surgeon may use a 'fixed angle plate' which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone and is attached to the bone with screws or pins.  
‐ Treatment without an operation, usually requiring a period of rest in bed whilst the leg is held in position using traction with weights. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared one or more of these treatments. We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of these different treatments. We combined the findings from studies, and created a 'network' (which is used when researchers perform a 'network meta‐analysis' on the results from studies) to see if we could find out if some treatments were better than others. 
What did we find? 
We found 119 studies, involving 17,653 participants with 17,669 fractures. The average age of study participants ranged from 60 to 87 years; 73% were women, which is usual for people who have this type of hip fracture. We included 75 of these studies in our 'network'. 
We found that a modern design of unipolar HA fixed with bone cement, or some of the metal implants (fixed angle plates and pins), seem to have the greatest chance of reducing the number of deaths within 12 months of injury. Compared to people having these treatments, more people who were treated with an uncemented modern bipolar design of HA or with a THA (single articulation) died.  
We didn't find as many studies to include in our 'network' for health‐related quality of life, and none of the treatments made a meaningful improvement to people's quality of life.  
We also found that people treated with any of the hip replacements were less likely to need additional surgery on their broken hip than people treated with metal implants or treated without an operation. Amongst all the designs of hip replacements, fewer people needed additional surgery after treatment with a cemented modern unipolar design of HA ‐ but there was not a big difference in the findings for these hip replacement treatments. 
So, overall, cemented modern hip replacements tended to produce better outcomes and may be a more successful approach than attempting to fix the broken bone. THA (single articulation) may have increased the risk of death compared with cemented HA, without leading to an important difference in quality of life ‐ but we are not sure about this finding. This type of THA may be an appropriate treatment for some people with these fractures, but we have not studied this in this review. 
Are we confident in what we found? 
The true effects of these treatments might be very different to what we have found in this review. Many of the studies in this review were published before general reporting standards for research were improved, and so we could not be certain whether or not these studies were well‐conducted. Sometimes, the types of fractures were different (particularly between participants treated with metal implants and those treated with hip replacements), and this might have affected the results in the 'network'. We also found that the results included risks of potential benefits and harms, and this is often because there are not enough study participants to find a precise result. 
How up to date is this review? 
We ran our search in July 2020.

201,10.1002-14651858.CD013190-abstract.txt,"Background
Melanoma has one of the fastest rising incidence rates of any cancer. It accounts for a small percentage of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. Early detection and treatment is key to improving survival; however, anxiety around missing early cases needs to be balanced against appropriate levels of referral and excision of benign lesions. Used in conjunction with clinical or dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, or both, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) may reduce unnecessary excisions without missing melanoma cases. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of reflectance confocal microscopy for the detection of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in adults with any lesion suspicious for melanoma and lesions that are difficult to diagnose, and to compare its accuracy with that of dermoscopy. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; and seven other databases. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design that evaluated RCM alone, or RCM in comparison to dermoscopy, in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities per algorithm and threshold using the bivariate hierarchical model. To compare RCM with dermoscopy, we grouped studies by population (defined by difficulty of lesion diagnosis) and combined data using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) methods. Analysis of studies allowing direct comparison between tests was undertaken. To facilitate interpretation of results, we computed values of specificity at the point on the SROC curve with 90% sensitivity as this value lies within the estimates for the majority of analyses. We investigated the impact of using a purposely developed RCM algorithm and in‐person test interpretation. 
Main results
The search identified 18 publications reporting on 19 study cohorts with 2838 lesions (including 658 with melanoma), which provided 67 datasets for RCM and seven for dermoscopy. Studies were generally at high or unclear risk of bias across almost all domains and of high or unclear concern regarding applicability of the evidence. Selective participant recruitment, lack of blinding of the reference test to the RCM result, and differential verification were particularly problematic. Studies may not be representative of populations eligible for RCM, and test interpretation was often undertaken remotely from the patient and blinded to clinical information. 
Meta‐analysis found RCM to be more accurate than dermoscopy in studies of participants with any lesion suspicious for melanoma and in participants with lesions that were more difficult to diagnose (equivocal lesion populations). Assuming a fixed sensitivity of 90% for both tests, specificities were 82% for RCM and 42% for dermoscopy for any lesion suspicious for melanoma (9 RCM datasets; 1452 lesions and 370 melanomas). For a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the median observed melanoma prevalence of 30%, this equated to a reduction in unnecessary excisions with RCM of 280 compared to dermoscopy, with 30 melanomas missed by both tests. For studies in equivocal lesions, specificities of 86% would be observed for RCM and 49% for dermoscopy (7 RCM datasets; 1177 lesions and 180 melanomas). At the median observed melanoma prevalence of 20%, this reduced unnecessary excisions by 296 with RCM compared with dermoscopy, with 20 melanomas missed by both tests. Across all populations, algorithms and thresholds assessed, the sensitivity and specificity of the Pellacani RCM score at a threshold of three or greater were estimated at 92% (95% confidence interval (CI) 87 to 95) for RCM and 72% (95% CI 62 to 81) for dermoscopy. 
Authors' conclusions
RCM may have a potential role in clinical practice, particularly for the assessment of lesions that are difficult to diagnose using visual inspection and dermoscopy alone, where the evidence suggests that RCM may be both more sensitive and specific in comparison to dermoscopy. Given the paucity of data to allow comparison with dermoscopy, the results presented require further confirmation in prospective studies comparing RCM with dermoscopy in a real‐world setting in a representative population.

## Plain Title

Can a Special Skin Microscope Help Doctors Find Melanoma Without Removing Too Many Harmless Moles?

## Rationale

**What is melanoma and why does it matter?**

Melanoma is a serious type of skin cancer. It makes up only a small part of all skin cancers, but it causes most skin cancer deaths. Finding melanoma early and treating it quickly helps people survive.

**What is the problem?**

Doctors face a difficult choice. They worry about missing early melanoma cases. But they also want to avoid cutting out too many harmless moles and skin spots. Right now, doctors look at suspicious spots with their eyes. They may also use a tool called a dermoscope, which is like a magnifying glass with special light.

**What is the possible solution?**

A newer tool called reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) might help. RCM is a special microscope that lets doctors see deeper into the skin without cutting it. It shows skin cells in great detail. Doctors can use RCM along with their regular exam and dermoscope.

**Why do this study?**

Researchers wanted to know if RCM works better than dermoscopy at finding melanoma. They also wanted to see if RCM could reduce unnecessary skin removals while still catching all melanomas.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was not a single study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at many past studies done by other doctors. They searched medical databases from the beginning up to August 2016. They found 18 reports covering 19 groups of patients.

**Who was studied?**

The studies included 2,838 skin spots from adult patients. Of these spots, 658 were melanoma. The rest were not cancer. All patients had skin spots that looked suspicious for melanoma or were hard to diagnose.

**What did researchers compare?**

Researchers compared how well RCM found melanoma versus how well dermoscopy found melanoma. After doctors examined the spots with these tools, they removed the spots or watched them over time. This confirmed whether the spots were truly melanoma or not.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

RCM worked better than dermoscopy at finding melanoma. This was especially true for spots that were hard to diagnose.

**Understanding the numbers:**

Imagine 1,000 suspicious skin spots. About 300 of these are melanoma. Both RCM and dermoscopy would catch 9 out of 10 melanomas (missing 30 cases). But here is the big difference:

- Dermoscopy would lead to removing 406 harmless spots
- RCM would lead to removing only 126 harmless spots

This means RCM would prevent 280 unnecessary removals compared to dermoscopy.

For harder-to-diagnose spots, the benefit was even greater. Out of 1,000 spots where 200 are melanoma, RCM would prevent 296 unnecessary removals compared to dermoscopy.

**What does this mean for patients?**

RCM may help doctors make better decisions. It could reduce the number of harmless moles that get cut out. At the same time, it catches melanoma as well as or better than dermoscopy.

**What are the study limitations?**

Many studies had problems with how they were done. Some studies may not represent real-world patients. Often, doctors looked at RCM images on a computer rather than examining patients in person. More research is needed with real patients in regular doctor visits.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

RCM shows promise for finding melanoma, especially for confusing spots. It appears more accurate than dermoscopy alone. However, doctors need more studies comparing RCM to dermoscopy in everyday practice before knowing for sure how helpful it is.",10.1002-14651858.CD013190,"What is the diagnostic accuracy of the imaging test reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) for the detection of melanoma in adults? 
What was the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) was on its own and used in addition to dermoscopy compared to dermoscopy alone for diagnosing melanoma. Review authors in Cochrane included 18 publications to answer this question. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of melanoma important? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. Not recognising a melanoma when it is present (called a false negative test result) delays surgery to remove it, risking cancer spreading to other parts in the body and possibly death. Diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not present (called a false positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery, further investigations, and patient anxiety. 
What did the review study? 
Microscopic techniques are used by skin cancer specialists to allow a more detailed, magnified examination of suspicious skin lesions than can be achieved using the naked eye alone. Currently, dermoscopy (a handheld device using natural light) can be used as part of the clinical examination of suspicious skin lesions. RCM is a new microscopic technique (a handheld device or static unit using infrared light) that can visualise deeper layers of the skin compared to dermoscopy. Both techniques are painless procedures, but RCM is more expensive, time consuming, and requires additional training. Dermoscopy can be used by general practitioners whereas RCM is likely to only be used by secondary care specialists in people who have been referred with a lesion suspicious for skin cancer. We sought to find out whether RCM should be used instead of, or in addition to, dermoscopy, to diagnose melanoma in any suspicious skin lesion or only in particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions. 
What were the main results of the review? 
The review included 18 publications reporting data for 19 groups of participants with lesions suspected of melanoma. The main results were based on 16 of the 19 datasets (sets of information and results). 
The review included nine datasets with 1452 lesions in people with any suspicious skin lesion, three of which compared RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that in 1000 lesions, of which 300 (30%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ an estimated 396 would have an RCM result indicating melanoma was present, and of these, 126 (32%) would not be melanoma (false positive results); ‐ in the same group of 1000 lesions, dermoscopy would produce 406 false positive results, meaning RCM would avoid unnecessary surgery in 280 lesions compared to dermoscopy; ‐ of the 604 lesions with an RCM result indicating that melanoma was not present (and 324 lesions with a dermoscopy result indicating that melanoma was not present), 30 would actually be melanoma (false negative results). This equated to a false negative rate of 5% for RCM and 9% for dermoscopy. 
The review also included seven datasets with 1177 lesions in people with particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions, three of which compared RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that if skin specialists used RCM in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 200 (20%) were actually melanoma: 
‐ an estimated 292 would have an RCM result indicating melanoma was present, and of these, 112 (38%) would not be melanoma (false positive results); ‐ in the same group of 1000 lesions, dermoscopy would produce 408 false positive results, meaning RCM would avoid unnecessary surgery in 296 lesions compared to dermoscopy; ‐ of the 708 lesions with an RCM result indicating that melanoma was not present (and 412 lesions with a dermoscopy result indicating that melanoma was not present), 20 would actually have melanoma (false negative results). This equates to a false negative rate of 3% for RCM and 5% for dermoscopy. 
How reliable were the results of the studies of this review? 
In all included studies, the diagnosis of melanoma was made by lesion biopsy (RCM/dermoscopy positive) (a biopsy involves taking a sample of body cells and examining them under a microscope), and the absence of melanoma was confirmed by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma (RCM/dermoscopy negative)*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had melanoma. Only a small number of studies compared the accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM. Most were conducted by specialist research teams with high levels of experience with RCM. Therefore, RCM may have appeared more accurate than it actually was. Participants in the nine studies of any suspicious lesion may have had very obvious disease compared to that seen in practice leading to a lower number of false positive results than would actually occur. It is not possible to recommend a definition of a positive RCM test that will reliably produce the results presented here due to differences between studies. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Eleven studies were undertaken in Europe (61%), with the remainder undertaken in Oceania, North America, or more than one continent. Mean age ranged from 39 to 54.7 years. The percentage of people with melanoma ranged between 1.9% and 41.5% (a median (midpoint reading) of 19% for difficult to diagnose skin lesions and 32% for any suspicious lesion). The majority of studies only included people with certain types of skin lesion. In many studies, it was not clear what tests participants had received before RCM. 
What are the implications of this review? 
RCM appears to be an accurate test for identifying melanoma, and it may reduce the number of people receiving unnecessary surgery by up to three‐quarters compared to dermoscopy. There is considerable variation and uncertainty in results and in study conduct, reducing the reliability of findings. Use of RCM may be of most benefit in people with particularly difficult to diagnose lesions rather than people with any lesion suspicious for melanoma. Further research comparing RCM and dermoscopy in well described groups of people with difficult to diagnose skin lesions is needed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses).

Hypertension is a major public health challenge affecting more than one billion people worldwide; it disproportionately affects populations in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), where health systems are generally weak. The increasing prevalence of hypertension is associated with population growth, ageing, genetic factors, and behavioural risk factors, such as excessive salt and fat consumption, physical inactivity, being overweight and obese, harmful alcohol consumption, and poor management of stress. Over the long term, hypertension leads to risk for cardiovascular events, such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, disability, and premature mortality. 
Cardiovascular events can be preventable when high‐risk populations are targeted, for example, through population‐wide screening strategies. When available resources are limited, taking a total risk approach whereby several risk factors of hypertension are taken into consideration (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle factors, diabetes, blood cholesterol) can enable more accurate targeting of high‐risk groups. Targeting of high‐risk groups can help reduce costs in that resources are not spent on the entire population. 
Early detection in the form of screening for hypertension (and associated risk factors) can help identify high‐risk groups, which can result in timely treatment and management of risk factors. Ultimately, early detection can help reduce morbidity and mortality linked to it and can help contain health‐related costs, for example, those associated with hospitalisation due to severe illness and poorly managed risk factors and comorbidities. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of different screening strategies for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. 
Search methods
An Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS‐Web), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) Bireme, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) without language, publication year, or publication status restrictions. The searches were conducted from inception until 9 April 2020. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐RCTs (NRCTs), that is, controlled before and after (CBA), interrupted time series (ITS), and prospective analytic cohort studies of healthy adolescents, adults, and elderly people participating in mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening of hypertension. 
Data collection and analysis
Screening of all retrieved studies was done in Covidence. A team of reviewers, in pairs, independently assessed titles and abstracts of identified studies and acquired full texts for studies that were potentially eligible. Studies were deemed to be eligible for full‐text screening if two review authors agreed, or if consensus was reached through discussion with a third review author. It was planned that at least two review authors would independently extract data from included studies, assess risk of bias using pre‐specified Cochrane criteria, and conduct a meta‐analysis of sufficiently similar studies or present a narrative synthesis of the results. 
Main results
We screened 9335 titles and abstracts. We identified 54 potentially eligible studies for full‐text screening. However, no studies met the eligibility criteria. 
Authors' conclusions
There is an implicit assumption that early detection of hypertension through screening can reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality, but this assumption has not been tested in rigorous research studies. High‐quality evidence from RCTs or programmatic evidence from NRCTs on the effectiveness and costs or harms of different screening strategies for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce hypertension‐related morbidity and mortality is lacking. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Screening for High Blood Pressure to Prevent Heart Disease and Death

## Plain Title

Can screening people for high blood pressure help prevent heart disease and death?

## Rationale

**What is high blood pressure?**

High blood pressure (also called hypertension) affects more than one billion people around the world. It is a major health problem, especially in poorer countries where health care systems are often weak.

**What causes high blood pressure?**

Many things can lead to high blood pressure. These include getting older, family history, eating too much salt and fat, not being active, being overweight, drinking too much alcohol, and stress.

**Why is high blood pressure a problem?**

Over time, high blood pressure can damage the body. It can lead to heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, disability, and early death. These serious health problems can be prevented if we find people at high risk early.

**What is screening?**

Screening means checking people for high blood pressure before they feel sick. There are different ways to screen people:
- Mass screening: checking everyone in a population
- Targeted screening: checking only people at higher risk
- Opportunistic screening: checking people when they visit a doctor for other reasons

**Why is this study needed?**

Finding high blood pressure early through screening could help doctors treat people before serious problems happen. This could save lives and reduce health care costs. However, we need to know which screening method works best.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

The researchers looked for studies that tested different screening methods for high blood pressure. They searched medical databases for research published up to April 2020.

**What types of studies did they look for?**

They looked for high-quality studies that compared different screening methods. These included studies where people were randomly assigned to different groups and studies that compared groups over time.

**Who were they looking for in these studies?**

They wanted studies that included healthy teenagers, adults, and older people who were screened for high blood pressure using mass, targeted, or opportunistic methods.

**What did the researchers do?**

The research team reviewed 9,335 study titles and abstracts. They identified 54 studies that might be suitable. They then read these 54 studies in full detail to see if they met their requirements.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers found no studies that met their requirements. Out of 9,335 studies reviewed, none properly tested whether screening for high blood pressure actually reduces heart disease, stroke, or death.

**What does this mean?**

Many people assume that screening for high blood pressure helps prevent serious health problems. However, this assumption has not been proven through rigorous research.

**What are the conclusions?**

There is currently no high-quality evidence showing whether screening programs for high blood pressure actually work to prevent heart disease and death. We also do not know which screening method (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) works best. More research is needed to answer these important questions.

**Why is this important?**

Without good evidence, we cannot be sure that screening programs are helping people. We also cannot know if the money spent on screening is being used in the best way. Good research studies are needed to test whether screening for high blood pressure truly saves lives and prevents disease.

**What happens next?**

Researchers need to conduct well-designed studies to test different screening methods. These studies should measure whether screening reduces heart attacks, strokes, and deaths. They should also look at costs and any potential harms from screening.",10.1002-14651858.CD013212,"Screening strategies for hypertension
Review question 
What effects do the different ways of screening for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) have in decreasing illness and death? 
Background 
Hypertension is a long‐term non‐communicable disease (NCD), also known as high, raised, or elevated blood pressure. Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements (systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) pressures), which are the maximum and minimum pressures. High blood pressure is generally diagnosed when resting blood pressure is persistently at SBP ≥ 130/140 millimetres mercury (mmHg) or at DBP ≥ 80/90 mmHg for adults. 
Even though blood pressure in the arteries is continuously raised, in many cases, high blood pressure does not cause symptoms. Nonetheless, hypertension can increase the risk for heart failure, stroke, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease, and so on, in the long term. People who have unhealthy diets, consume harmful amounts of alcohol and/or tobacco, and are physically inactive are at higher risk of hypertension. 
Early detection, adequate treatment, and good control of high blood pressure can lower the risk of complications associated with hypertension. Although early detection through screening of hypertension has the potential to contain health‐related costs, reducing the burden of hypertension will to some extent involve addressing behavioural and socioeconomic risk factors (such as income, occupation, and level of education). Therefore, it is unclear whether early detection of mild hypertension can positively impact health‐related costs in the long term and improve health outcomes by reducing the need for hospitalisation and management of hypertension‐related complications, which can be severe. 
Review methods 
We searched various electronic databases on this topic until 9 April 2020. We searched for studies written in any language, whether published or not. We planned to include studies that compared one type of screening strategy for hypertension versus no screening strategy, that is, mass screening versus no screening, targeted screening versus no screening, and opportunistic screening versus no screening. We were interested in studies in which participants were healthy adolescents, adults, and elderly people, and in which researchers measured clinical outcomes, health system outcomes, and adverse events. 
Key results 
We found no studies that met the criteria described above.
Quality of the evidence 
High‐certainty evidence that can tell us whether mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening strategies are effective for reducing illness and death associated with hypertension is lacking.

Diet plays a major role in the aetiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and as a modifiable risk factor is the focus of many prevention strategies. Recently vegan diets have gained popularity and there is a need to synthesise existing clinical trial evidence for their potential in CVD prevention. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of following a vegan dietary pattern for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases on 4 February 2020: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov in January 2021. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) and those with established CVD (secondary prevention). A vegan dietary pattern excludes meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey; the intervention could be dietary advice, provision of relevant foods, or both. The comparison group received either no intervention, minimal intervention, or another dietary intervention. Outcomes included clinical events and CVD risk factors. We included only studies with follow‐up periods of 12 weeks or more, defined as the intervention period plus post‐intervention follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risks of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We conducted three main comparisons: 
1. Vegan dietary intervention versus no intervention or minimal intervention for primary prevention;2. Vegan dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for primary prevention;3. Vegan dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for secondary prevention. 
Main results
Thirteen RCTs (38 papers, 7 trial registrations) and eight ongoing trials met our inclusion criteria. Most trials contributed to primary prevention: comparisons 1 (four trials, 466 participants randomised) and comparison 2 (eight trials, 409 participants randomised). We included only one secondary prevention trial for comparison 3 (63 participants randomised). 
None of the trials reported on clinical endpoints. Other primary outcomes included lipid levels and blood pressure. 
For comparison 1 there was moderate‐certainty evidence from four trials with 449 participants that a vegan diet probably led to a small reduction in total cholesterol (mean difference (MD) −0.24 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.36 to −0.12) and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (MD −0.22 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.32 to −0.11), a very small decrease in high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (MD −0.08 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.11 to −0.04) and a very small increase in triglyceride levels (MD 0.11 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21). The very small changes in HDL and triglyceride levels are in the opposite direction to that expected. There was a lack of evidence for an effect with the vegan dietary intervention on systolic blood pressure (MD 0.94 mmHg, 95% CI −1.18 to 3.06; 3 trials, 374 participants) and diastolic blood pressure (MD −0.27 mmHg, 95% CI −1.67 to 1.12; 3 trials, 372 participants) (low‐certainty evidence). 
For comparison 2 there was a lack of evidence for an effect of the vegan dietary intervention on total cholesterol levels (MD −0.04 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.28 to 0.20; 4 trials, 163 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There was probably little or no effect of the vegan dietary intervention on LDL (MD −0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.21 to 0.11; 4 trials, 244 participants) or HDL cholesterol levels (MD −0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.08 to 0.05; 5 trials, 256 participants) or triglycerides (MD 0.21 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.49; 5 trials, 256 participants) compared to other dietary interventions (moderate‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about any effect of the vegan dietary intervention on systolic blood pressure (MD 0.02 mmHg, 95% CI −3.59 to 3.62)  or diastolic blood pressure (MD 0.63 mmHg, 95% CI −1.54 to 2.80; 5 trials, 247 participants (very low‐certainty evidence)). 
Only one trial (63 participants) contributed to comparison 3, where there was a lack of evidence for an effect of the vegan dietary intervention on lipid levels or blood pressure compared to other dietary interventions (low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence). 
Four trials reported on adverse events, which were absent or minor.
Authors' conclusions
Studies were generally small with few participants contributing to each comparison group. None of the included studies report on CVD clinical events. There is currently insufficient information to draw conclusions about the effects of vegan dietary interventions on CVD risk factors. The eight ongoing studies identified will add to the evidence base, with all eight reporting on primary prevention. There is a paucity of evidence for secondary prevention.

Heart disease affects the heart and blood vessels. It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Heart disease can cause chest pain, heart attacks, and strokes. It can make daily activities difficult and reduce quality of life.

**What is a vegan diet?**

A vegan diet means not eating any animal products. This includes meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, and honey. People eat only plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, grains, beans, nuts, and seeds.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

What we eat plays a big role in heart health. More people are choosing vegan diets. Researchers wanted to know if vegan diets can help prevent heart disease or help people who already have heart disease. They looked at studies that tested vegan diets to see if they improve heart health measures like cholesterol and blood pressure.

**Why might a vegan diet help?**

Plant-based foods may help lower cholesterol and blood pressure. These are important measures of heart health. Lower cholesterol and blood pressure can reduce the risk of heart disease.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked for studies where people were randomly assigned to different diet groups. This is the best way to test if a diet works. They searched medical databases and found 13 studies that met their requirements.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included adults. Most studies looked at healthy people or people at risk for heart disease. This is called primary prevention. Only one small study looked at people who already had heart disease. This is called secondary prevention.

**What did people in the studies do?**

Some people followed a vegan diet. Others either kept their normal diet, made small changes, or followed a different special diet. The studies lasted at least 12 weeks. Some lasted longer.

**How many people were in the studies?**

The studies were small. Different comparisons included between 63 and 466 people total. This means each group had relatively few people.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not answer the most important question. None of the studies tracked whether people had heart attacks or strokes. Instead, they looked at risk factors like cholesterol and blood pressure.

**Vegan diet compared to no diet change:**

When people followed a vegan diet instead of their usual diet, they had small improvements in some cholesterol measures. Total cholesterol went down a small amount. Bad cholesterol (called LDL) also went down a small amount. However, good cholesterol (called HDL) also went down slightly. Triglycerides (another type of fat in blood) went up slightly. These last two changes were unexpected. Blood pressure did not change much.

**Vegan diet compared to other special diets:**

When researchers compared vegan diets to other healthy diets, they found little difference. Cholesterol levels were similar between groups. Blood pressure was also similar. This means a vegan diet was not clearly better or worse than other healthy eating patterns.

**People with existing heart disease:**

Only one very small study looked at people who already had heart disease. It was too small to draw any conclusions.

**Were there any problems?**

Four studies reported on side effects. Side effects were either absent or minor.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, there is not enough evidence to say whether vegan diets prevent heart disease. The studies were too small. None tracked actual heart attacks or strokes. The researchers found eight more studies currently happening. These may provide better answers in the future.

**Main conclusions:**

More research is needed. Larger studies that follow people longer are necessary. Studies should track heart attacks and strokes, not just cholesterol and blood pressure. Almost no research exists for people who already have heart disease.",10.1002-14651858.CD013501,"Vegan diets for the prevention of cardiovascular disease
Background 
It is well known that diet plays a major role in cardiovascular disease risk. This review assesses the effects of providing dietary advice to follow a vegan diet (excluding all meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey) or providing foods relevant to the diet (or both) to healthy adults, to people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and to those with cardiovascular disease, in order to prevent new or recurrent cardiovascular disease, and to reduce the risk factors associated with it. 
Study characteristics 
We searched key databases of medical studies up to February 2020 and found 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (in 38 papers) that met our criteria. We grouped studies into the following three categories to help us with our interpretation of the results: 
1. Vegan dietary intervention compared to no intervention or a minimal intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;2. Vegan dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;3. Vegan dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention for people with existing cardiovascular disease, to prevent recurrence. 
Key results 
None of the trials reported on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease either in those with or without disease to begin with. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease were reported in the included studies. There was moderate‐certainty evidence for some small reductions in lipid levels with the vegan diet compared to no or minimal intervention in people without disease, but also some very small changes in measures in the opposite direction for cardiovascular benefit. In people who already had cardiovascular disease there was very limited information, as only one trial met our criteria. Four trials reported on side effects of the diet, which were either absent or minor. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Most studies had limitations in study design, so the evidence should be interpreted cautiously. In particular, the overall number of people who took part in the studies was too small to rule out the possibility of chance findings, and too small to pick up any differences in effect on our measures. 
Conclusions 
The review concludes that there is no information currently about the effects of a vegan diet on cardiovascular disease occurrence. There is limited information on the effects of the diet on those who already have cardiovascular disease, and mixed results about risk factors for those without disease. We found eight studies that are still ongoing, and when we have the results from these we will incorporate them into the review to help reduce the uncertainty.

## Plain Title
Whole-Body Cryotherapy to Prevent and Treat Muscle Soreness After Exercise

## Rationale

### What is muscle soreness?
When people exercise hard or try new exercises, their muscles often hurt. This pain usually starts a day or two after exercise. Doctors call this ""delayed onset muscle soreness."" The muscles feel sore, tender, and stiff. This can make it hard to move and exercise again.

### What is whole-body cryotherapy?
Whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) is a newer treatment. People stand in a special room or cabin. The air in this room is very cold. It is colder than minus 100 degrees Celsius. People stay in the cold room for 2 to 4 minutes. Some people do this once. Others do it many times.

### Why did researchers study this?
Many treatments try to reduce muscle soreness after exercise. Researchers wanted to know if WBC works. They wanted to see if WBC could reduce muscle pain. They also wanted to know if WBC helps people recover faster. Finally, they wanted to know if WBC is safe.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study this?
Researchers looked for all studies about WBC and muscle soreness. They searched medical databases up to August 2015. They found four small studies. These studies had 64 people total. Almost all were young men who exercised regularly. Only four women were in these studies.

### What did the studies compare?
The studies compared different things. Most studies compared WBC to doing nothing special. Some people got WBC treatment. Other people just rested normally. One very small study compared WBC to another treatment called far-infrared therapy.

### What did the studies measure?
The studies measured muscle pain at different times. They checked pain 1 hour after exercise. They also checked at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours. Some studies asked people how they felt overall.

### Were the studies similar?
No, the studies were very different from each other. They used different temperatures in the cold rooms. They had people stay in the rooms for different amounts of time. Some people went once. Others went many times. The studies also used different exercises to make muscles sore.

## Results

### What did the studies find?
The four studies that compared WBC to rest or no treatment showed mixed results. WBC might reduce muscle soreness at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours after exercise. However, the results were not clear. WBC might not make any difference. It might even make pain worse. The evidence was too weak to be sure.

One study found that WBC might help people feel better overall at 24 hours. But again, this evidence was very weak.

One tiny study compared WBC to far-infrared therapy. It found less muscle soreness one hour after WBC treatment.

### Was WBC safe?
The studies did not report any safety problems. However, they probably did not watch for safety problems carefully. We do not know if WBC is safe.

### What is the quality of this evidence?
All four studies had problems. These problems make the results less trustworthy. Researchers rated the evidence as ""very low quality."" This means we cannot be confident in the findings. Future studies might show completely different results.

### What do researchers conclude?
There is not enough good evidence to recommend WBC for muscle soreness. We do not know if it works. We do not know the best way to use it. We do not know if it is safe. More and better research is needed before doctors can recommend WBC for muscle soreness after exercise.

People should talk to their doctor before trying WBC. More studies with more people are needed. These studies need to be done more carefully. Only then will we know if WBC truly helps with muscle soreness.",10.1002-14651858.CD010789,"Whole‐body cryotherapy for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise

205,10.1002-14651858.CD013505-abstract.txt,"Background
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by infrequent or absent ovulation, and high levels of androgens and insulin (hyperinsulinaemia). Hyperinsulinaemia occurs secondary to insulin resistance and is associated with an increased biochemical risk profile for cardiovascular disease and an increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus. Insulin‐sensitising agents such as metformin may be effective in treating PCOS‐related anovulation. This is an update of Morley 2017 and only includes studies on metformin. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of metformin in combination with or in comparison to clomiphene citrate (CC), letrozole and laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) in improving reproductive outcomes and associated gastrointestinal side effects for women with PCOS undergoing ovulation induction. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases from inception to December 2018: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL. We searched registers of ongoing trials and reference lists from relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of metformin compared with placebo, no treatment, or in combination with or compared with CC, letrozole and LOD for women with PCOS subfertility. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and bias. Primary outcomes were live birth rate and gastrointestinal adverse effects. Secondary outcomes included other pregnancy outcomes and ovulation. We combined data to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I2 statistic and reported quality of the evidence for primary outcomes and reproductive outcomes using GRADE methodology. 
Main results
We included 41 studies (4552 women). Evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate based on GRADE assessment. Limitations were risk of bias (poor reporting of methodology and incomplete outcome data), imprecision and inconsistency. 
Metformin versus placebo or no treatment 
The evidence suggests that metformin may improve live birth rates compared with placebo (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.51; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 435 women; low‐quality evidence). For a live birth rate of 19% following placebo, the live birth rate following metformin would be between 19% and 37%. The metformin group probably experiences more gastrointestinal side effects (OR 4.00, 95% CI 2.63 to 6.09; I2 = 39%; 7 studies, 713 women; moderate‐quality evidence). With placebo, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 10% whereas with metformin this risk is between 22% and 40%. There are probably higher rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.65; I2 = 30%; 11 studies, 1213 women; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be higher rates of ovulation with metformin (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.85 to 3.75; I2 = 61%; 13 studies, 684 women; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect on miscarriage rates (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.35; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 748 women; low‐quality evidence). 
Metformin plus CC versus CC alone 
We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rates compared to CC alone (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.65; I2 = 28%; 10 studies, 1219 women; low‐quality evidence), but gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common with combined therapy (OR 4.26, 95% CI 2.83 to 6.40; I2 = 8%; 6 studies, 852 women; moderate quality evidence). The live birth rate with CC alone is 24%, which may change to between 23% to 34% with combined therapy. With CC alone, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 9%, which increases to between 21% to 37% with combined therapy. The combined therapy group probably has higher rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.99; I2 = 31%; 19 studies, 1790 women; moderate‐quality evidence). The combined group may have higher rates of ovulation (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.03; I2 = 63%;21 studies, 1568 women; low‐quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of an effect on miscarriage (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.00; I2 = 0%; 10 studies, 1206 women; low‐quality evidence). 
Metformin versus CC 
When all studies were combined, findings for live birth were inconclusive and inconsistent (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.01; I2 = 86%; 5 studies, 741 women; very low‐quality evidence). In subgroup analysis by obesity status, obese women had a lower birth rate in the metformin group (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.52; 2 studies, 500 women), while the non‐obese group showed a possible benefit from metformin, with high heterogeneity (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.94; I2 = 78%, 3 studies, 241 women; very low‐quality evidence). However, due to the very low quality of the evidence we cannot draw any conclusions. Among obese women taking metformin there may be lower rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.55; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 500 women; low‐quality evidence) and ovulation (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.43; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 500 women; low‐quality evidence) while among non‐obese women, the metformin group may have more pregnancies (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.29; I2 = 26%; 6 studies, 530 women; low‐quality evidence) and no clear difference in ovulation rates (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.25; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 352 women; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in miscarriage rates between the groups (overall: OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.66; I2 = 36%; 6 studies, 781 women; low‐quality evidence) and no studies reported gastrointestinal side effects. 
Authors' conclusions
Our updated review suggests that metformin may be beneficial over placebo for live birth however, more women probably experience gastrointestinal side effects. We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rates compared to CC alone, but gastrointestinal side effects are probably increased with combined therapy. When metformin was compared with CC, data for live birth were inconclusive, and the findings were limited by lack of evidence. Results differed by body mass index (BMI), emphasising the importance of stratifying results by BMI. No studies reported gastrointestinal side effects in this comparison. Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain of the effect of metformin on miscarriage in all three comparisons. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Metformin for Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Who Want to Get Pregnant

## Plain Title
Does metformin help women with polycystic ovary syndrome get pregnant and have a baby?

## Rationale

**What is polycystic ovary syndrome?**

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common health problem in women. Women with PCOS often have trouble getting pregnant. This happens because their bodies do not release eggs regularly. This is called not ovulating.

**What causes problems in PCOS?**

Women with PCOS have high levels of certain hormones called androgens. They also have high levels of a hormone called insulin in their blood. High insulin happens because the body does not respond well to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. High insulin levels can increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes.

**Why study metformin?**

Metformin is a drug that helps the body use insulin better. Doctors think metformin might help women with PCOS start ovulating again. If women ovulate, they have a better chance of getting pregnant.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if metformin works better than other treatments. They wanted to see if metformin helps women have babies. They also wanted to know about side effects.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 41 studies. These studies included 4,552 women with PCOS who wanted to get pregnant.

The researchers compared metformin to:
- A fake pill (placebo) or no treatment
- Clomiphene citrate (CC), another drug that helps with ovulation
- Metformin plus CC together
- Other treatments

**Who was in the studies?**

All women in the studies had PCOS. They had trouble getting pregnant. Some studies looked at women based on their weight. The studies included women of different ages.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time varied by study. Women took the treatments until they got pregnant or the study ended.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

**Metformin compared to placebo (fake pill):**

Metformin may help more women have a baby. Out of 100 women taking a fake pill, 19 had a baby. With metformin, between 19 and 37 out of 100 women had a baby.

However, metformin causes more stomach problems. Out of 100 women taking a fake pill, 10 had stomach problems. With metformin, between 22 and 40 out of 100 women had stomach problems. These problems include upset stomach, diarrhea, and nausea.

Metformin probably helps more women get pregnant. It may also help more women ovulate.

**Metformin plus CC compared to CC alone:**

Researchers are not sure if adding metformin to CC helps more women have babies. Out of 100 women taking CC alone, 24 had a baby. With both drugs together, between 23 and 34 out of 100 women had a baby.

Stomach problems are more common with both drugs together. Out of 100 women taking CC alone, 9 had stomach problems. With both drugs, between 21 and 37 out of 100 women had stomach problems.

The combination probably helps more women get pregnant. It may help more women ovulate.

**Metformin compared to CC:**

The results were unclear and mixed. Weight seemed to matter a lot.

For women with obesity, metformin may work less well than CC. Fewer women had babies, got pregnant, or ovulated with metformin.

For women without obesity, metformin might work better than CC. More women may get pregnant with metformin.

No studies reported stomach problems for this comparison.

**Miscarriage:**

Researchers are not sure if metformin changes the risk of miscarriage in any of the comparisons.

**What do these results mean?**

Metformin may help some women with PCOS get pregnant and have babies. However, it causes stomach problems in many women. The drug may work differently based on a woman's weight. More research is needed to understand who benefits most from metformin.

Women with PCOS should talk to their doctor about whether metformin is right for them.",10.1002-14651858.CD013505,"Metformin for ovulation induction in women with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome and subfertility 
Review question 
Researchers reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of metformin compared with other ovulation induction agents, for inducing ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Of interest were live birth rate, gastrointestinal side effects and additional reproductive outcomes. 
Background 
Women with PCOS often have infrequent or no periods because they do not ovulate (release an egg), which can result in infertility. They may also develop problems such as obesity and diabetes. High levels of insulin, a hormone that allows the body to use sugar for energy, may be a cause of PCOS and levels are generally higher in obese women. Metformin helps the body use insulin more effectively and improves ovulation in women with PCOS. However, metformin may cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea or constipation (gastrointestinal side effects). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies in women with PCOS that compared metformin alone or with CC, letrozole or LOD, against CC, letrozole, LOD, placebo (sham treatment) or no treatment. This review updates the previous version of the review. We included 41 randomised controlled trials (where women were randomly allocated to a treatment) with 4552 women. 13 studies are new for this update. We combined results from the studies and assessed the quality of the studies to judge how confident we could be in their results. The evidence is current up to December 2018. 
Key results 
Metformin versus placebo/no treatment 
Metformin may increase the chances of having a live birth compared with no treatment or placebo, however women taking metformin probably experience more gastrointestinal side effects. With placebo, the live birth rate is 19%, and it would be between 19% and 37% with metformin. The risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 10% with placebo, but higher with metformin, between 22% and 40%. Women taking metformin are probably more likely to get pregnant and may be more likely to ovulate. We are uncertain about the effect of metformin compared to placebo or no treatment on miscarriage. 
Metformin plus CC versus CC alone 
We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rate compared to CC alone, but gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common. The live birth rate with CC alone is 24% which may change to between 23% to 34% with metformin and CC combined. With CC alone, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 9%, which increases to between 21% to 37% with metformin and CC combined. However, pregnancy rate is probably improved with metformin and CC. Ovulation rates may be improved with metformin and CC. There was no clear evidence of an effect on miscarriage. 
Metformin versus CC 
We combined all the studies and found that the quality of evidence was very low, results were inconsistent, and we could not confidently draw conclusions. Obese women had a lower birth rate with metformin, while non‐obese women showed a possible benefit from metformin. The live birth rate of non‐obese women with CC is 26%, which may increase to between 26% and 50% with metformin. However, in obese women, the live birth rate is 22% which may decrease to between 5% to 13% with metformin. Similarly, among obese women taking metformin there may be lower rates of clinical pregnancy and ovulation while, non‐obese women taking metformin may have more pregnancies; there was no clear difference in ovulation rates. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in miscarriage rates between women taking metformin or CC. No studies reported gastrointestinal side effects. It is possible that a woman's body mass index (a measure of healthy weight based on height and weight) affects which treatment she should take, although further research is required to establish this. The limited improvement in outcomes such as diabetes with metformin highlights the importance of weight loss and lifestyle adjustment, particularly in overweight women with PCOS. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main problems were that the studies’ methods were poor or unclear, or they did not report all their results (risk of bias), or they were inaccurate and inconsistent.

206,10.1002-14651858.CD002201.pub6-abstract.txt,"The use of omega‐3 supplements in people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving omega‐3 supplements to people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
In people with cystic fibrosis recurring cycles of infection and inflammation are thought to worsen lung function. Studies suggest that omega‐3 fatty acids, such as those derived from fish oils, may work to counter the inflammation and may be of benefit in chronic inflammatory diseases including cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 01 April 2020.
Study characteristics 
This review includes five small studies which compare omega‐3 supplements to a different supplement without omega‐3. In total there were 106 participants, including both children and adults. The studies lasted between six weeks and 12 months. 
Key results 
Due to the very low‐quality evidence, we are uncertain whether the following effects are due to supplementation or not. One 12‐month study reported a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations and antibiotic use when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo and one three‐month study reported no change in antibiotic use during the study period. Few side effects were reported in any of the studies. One six‐week study reported that lung function and clinical status improved when taking omega‐3 supplements. Sputum levels were also noted to be reduced in this six‐week study. Three studies reported no difference in lung function when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo. Two longer studies found that people taking omega‐3 supplements showed definite increases in levels of essential fatty acids in their white blood cell membranes and also in levels of phospholipids (molecules that provide structure and protection to cells) measured in blood samples. 
We are uncertain whether regular omega‐3 supplements benefit people with cystic fibrosis and whether they cause side effects, or not. We are not able to draw firm conclusions or recommend the routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. Larger and longer studies are needed to assess the clinical benefit of omega‐3 supplementation and to determine the appropriate dosage. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to very low participant numbers, low event rates, limited reporting and poor study design. There was no consistency with regards to the time points when results were reported or the measurements used for the same outcome in different studies. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Omega-3 Supplements for People with Cystic Fibrosis

## Plain Title
Do Omega-3 Supplements Help People with Cystic Fibrosis?

## Rationale

**What is cystic fibrosis?**
Cystic fibrosis is a long-term health condition. People with this condition get lung infections over and over. These infections cause swelling in the lungs. This swelling is called inflammation. Over time, the infections and inflammation damage the lungs. This makes it harder to breathe.

**What are omega-3 supplements?**
Omega-3 supplements are pills or liquids. They contain special fats called omega-3 fatty acids. These fats often come from fish oil. Some studies show that omega-3 fats may reduce swelling in the body.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors wanted to know if omega-3 supplements could help people with cystic fibrosis. The idea was that omega-3 might reduce lung swelling. Less swelling might mean fewer infections. This could help people breathe better and stay healthier.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review of research studies. The researchers looked at five small studies. These studies tested omega-3 supplements in people with cystic fibrosis.

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included 106 people total. Both children and adults took part. All participants had cystic fibrosis.

**What did participants do?**
Some people took omega-3 supplements. Other people took different supplements without omega-3. This second group is called the placebo group. Researchers compared the two groups.

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies lasted different amounts of time. The shortest study was six weeks. The longest study was 12 months (one year).

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**
The results were unclear. The researchers could not tell if omega-3 supplements really helped or not. Here is what the studies showed:

One study lasted 12 months. It found that people taking omega-3 had fewer lung infections. They also needed fewer antibiotics (medicines that fight infections).

One study lasted three months. It found no change in antibiotic use.

One study lasted six weeks. It found that lung function got better with omega-3. People also had less mucus in their lungs.

Three studies found no difference in lung function. Omega-3 did not help or hurt.

Two longer studies checked blood samples. They found that omega-3 changed the fats in blood cells. People taking omega-3 had more omega-3 fats in their blood.

**Were there side effects?**
Very few side effects were reported. The supplements seemed safe in these studies.

**What do these results mean for patients?**
The researchers are not sure if omega-3 supplements help people with cystic fibrosis. The studies were too small. They did not all measure the same things. The quality of the evidence was very low.

**What are the main conclusions?**
Doctors cannot recommend omega-3 supplements for all people with cystic fibrosis yet. More research is needed. Future studies should include more people. They should last longer. They should all measure the same things. This will help doctors know if omega-3 supplements really work.

**Why was the evidence quality low?**
The studies had very few people in them. Not many events happened during the studies. The studies did not report all their results clearly. Each study measured things differently. This made it hard to compare results.

---

**Bottom Line:** Omega-3 supplements might help people with cystic fibrosis, but we need more research to be sure. Talk to your doctor before taking any supplements.",10.1002-14651858.CD002201,"The use of omega‐3 supplements in people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving omega‐3 supplements to people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
In people with cystic fibrosis recurring cycles of infection and inflammation are thought to worsen lung function. Studies suggest that omega‐3 fatty acids, such as those derived from fish oils, may work to counter the inflammation and may be of benefit in chronic inflammatory diseases including cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 01 April 2020.
Study characteristics 
This review includes five small studies which compare omega‐3 supplements to a different supplement without omega‐3. In total there were 106 participants, including both children and adults. The studies lasted between six weeks and 12 months. 
Key results 
Due to the very low‐quality evidence, we are uncertain whether the following effects are due to supplementation or not. One 12‐month study reported a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations and antibiotic use when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo and one three‐month study reported no change in antibiotic use during the study period. Few side effects were reported in any of the studies. One six‐week study reported that lung function and clinical status improved when taking omega‐3 supplements. Sputum levels were also noted to be reduced in this six‐week study. Three studies reported no difference in lung function when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo. Two longer studies found that people taking omega‐3 supplements showed definite increases in levels of essential fatty acids in their white blood cell membranes and also in levels of phospholipids (molecules that provide structure and protection to cells) measured in blood samples. 
We are uncertain whether regular omega‐3 supplements benefit people with cystic fibrosis and whether they cause side effects, or not. We are not able to draw firm conclusions or recommend the routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. Larger and longer studies are needed to assess the clinical benefit of omega‐3 supplementation and to determine the appropriate dosage.

Overall adverse events were similar between groups and with regards to other outcomes assessed, there was no difference between treatment groups for mortality, quality of life or sputum density.

Quality of the evidence 
Overall quality of evidence was considered to be moderate across all outcomes, which means further research is likely to have an important impact on results. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Long-Term Antibiotic Treatment for Lung Infections in People with Cystic Fibrosis

## Plain Title
Does long-term antibiotic treatment help people with cystic fibrosis who have Burkholderia cepacia lung infections?

## Rationale

**What is cystic fibrosis and why is it a problem?**

People with cystic fibrosis get lung infections over and over again. After a while, germs stay in their lungs all the time. One type of germ is called Burkholderia cepacia complex. This is actually a family of at least 20 different germs.

**Why is this germ a problem?**

This germ causes serious problems for people with cystic fibrosis. Most antibiotics do not work against it. The germ can make lung disease get worse faster. This makes people sicker more quickly.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know if long-term antibiotic treatment could help. They wanted to see if giving antibiotics for a long time would make people with cystic fibrosis feel better. They hoped the treatment would slow down lung damage.

**Why might this treatment work?**

Doctors thought that breathing in antibiotics directly into the lungs might help. The medicine would go straight to where the germs live. This might work better than other treatments.

## Trial Design

**How was this study set up?**

This study included 100 people. They were between 6 and 57 years old. All of them had cystic fibrosis. All of them had Burkholderia cepacia complex in their lungs.

**What did people in the study do?**

Half the people breathed in an antibiotic called aztreonam. The other half breathed in a placebo. A placebo looks like medicine but has no real medicine in it. A computer picked who got which treatment by chance. This made the test fair.

**How long did the study last?**

The study went on for 52 weeks. That is about one year. Doctors checked on people during this time.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The inhaled antibiotic aztreonam did not help people with this infection. It did not make their lungs work better. It did not reduce the number of chest infections they got.

**What else did doctors measure?**

Doctors looked at many things:
- How long until the next bad chest infection: No difference between groups
- How many people went to the hospital: No difference between groups
- How many people died: No difference between groups
- Quality of life: No difference between groups
- Amount of germs in mucus: No difference between groups

**Were there side effects?**

Both groups had about the same number of side effects. The antibiotic did not cause more problems than the placebo.

**What do these results mean?**

This inhaled antibiotic does not help people with cystic fibrosis who have Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. The treatment did not make people healthier. It did not slow down lung damage.

**What should happen next?**

More research is needed. Doctors need to test other inhaled antibiotics. Maybe a different medicine will work better. Scientists need to find better ways to fight this germ.

**How strong is this evidence?**

The quality of evidence was moderate. This means the results are fairly reliable. But more studies could change what we know. Future research might give us different answers.

**When was this information gathered?**

Researchers looked for studies up to April 12, 2021. They only found one study that fit their needs.

**Bottom line:**

Right now, doctors do not have proof that long-term inhaled aztreonam helps people with cystic fibrosis and Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. More research is needed to find treatments that work.",10.1002-14651858.CD013079,"Antibiotic treatments for long‐term Burkholderia cepacia infections in people with cystic fibrosis

Review question 
We sought to determine if any advanced sperm selection techniques used for assisted reproduction, except for ultra‐high magnification, alter the rates of live birth, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, or foetal abnormalities. 
Background 
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a commonly used treatment for subfertile couples. It is thought that the selection of high‐quality sperm may improve outcomes for these couples. Advanced sperm selection techniques use complex methods to select healthy, mature, and structurally sound sperm for fertilisation. Despite the use of these techniques in many centres worldwide, their effectiveness is unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) with a total of 4147 women. Four studies evaluated sperm selection by their ability to bind to hyaluronic acid during the ICSI process (HA‐ICSI) against ICSI. One study compared HA‐ICSI versus SpermSlow. One study compared HA‐ICSI versus magnetic‐activated cell sorting (MACS) versus ICSI. Three studies compared MACS versus ICSI. One study compared sperm selection by surface charge Zeta potential versus ICSI. Six of the included studies reported rates of live birth; seven reported clinical pregnancy; six reported miscarriage per clinical pregnancy and per woman randomly assigned; and none reported on foetal abnormalities. 
Key results 
The current evidence suggests that advanced sperm selection strategies in assisted reproductive technologist (ART) may not result in an increase in the likelihood of live birth. The only sperm selection technique that potentially increases live birth and clinical pregnancy rates is Zeta sperm selection, yet these results were of very low quality and derived from a single study, therefore we are uncertain of the effect. There is low‐quality evidence that HA‐ICSI decreases miscarriage rates when compared with ICSI. We are uncertain whether the other sperm selection techniques alter clinical pregnancy or miscarriage rates. No studies reported on foetal abnormalities, and further studies of suitable quality are required before any of these advanced sperm selection techniques can be recommended for use in clinical practice. 
Evidence quality 
The evidence gathered was of very low to low quality. The main limitations were imprecision associated with low numbers of participants or events and high risk of performance bias. Data on important clinical outcomes such as foetal abnormalities were absent. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do Advanced Sperm Selection Methods Improve Success Rates for Couples Using Fertility Treatment?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Some couples have trouble getting pregnant naturally. This is called subfertility. These couples may need help from doctors to have a baby.

**What treatments are available?**
Doctors can help these couples using fertility treatments. Two common treatments are IVF and ICSI. IVF stands for in vitro fertilization. ICSI stands for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Both treatments help sperm and egg meet outside the body.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors think that picking the best sperm might help couples have better results. Advanced sperm selection uses special methods to find healthy, mature sperm. These methods look for sperm that are strong and shaped correctly. Many fertility clinics around the world use these special methods. However, doctors are not sure if these methods really work better than standard methods.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know if advanced sperm selection methods help more babies be born alive. They also wanted to know if these methods affect pregnancy rates, miscarriage rates, or birth defects.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review study. Researchers looked at eight different studies that had already been done. These were high-quality studies called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, women were put into different treatment groups by chance.

**Who was in the studies?**
A total of 4,147 women took part across all eight studies. All women were trying to get pregnant using fertility treatment.

**What methods were tested?**
Researchers looked at several advanced sperm selection methods:
- HA-ICSI: Sperm are selected based on their ability to stick to a substance called hyaluronic acid
- MACS: Magnetic-activated cell sorting uses magnets to pick healthy sperm
- Zeta potential: Sperm are selected based on their electrical charge
- SpermSlow: Another method for selecting sperm

These methods were compared against standard ICSI treatment.

**What did researchers measure?**
Researchers counted:
- How many babies were born alive
- How many women got pregnant
- How many pregnancies ended in miscarriage
- Whether babies had any birth defects

## Results

**What were the main findings?**

The research showed that most advanced sperm selection methods probably do not increase the chance of having a live birth. They work about the same as standard methods.

One method called Zeta sperm selection might increase live birth rates and pregnancy rates. However, only one small study tested this method. More research is needed to be sure.

One method called HA-ICSI might reduce miscarriage rates compared to standard ICSI. However, the evidence quality was low.

For other sperm selection methods, researchers could not tell if they changed pregnancy rates or miscarriage rates.

No studies looked at birth defects. This is important information that is missing.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Based on current evidence, advanced sperm selection methods do not clearly improve chances of having a baby. Couples should know that these special methods may not work better than standard treatment.

**What are the limitations?**

The quality of evidence was very low to low. This means we cannot be very confident in the results. The main problems were:
- Not enough women in the studies
- Studies were not done in the best way
- Important information about birth defects was missing

**What happens next?**

More high-quality studies are needed. These studies should include more women and measure birth defects. Until better evidence exists, doctors should not routinely recommend these advanced sperm selection methods in fertility clinics.",10.1002-14651858.CD010461,"Advanced sperm selection techniques for assisted reproduction

Lamellar macular holes (LMHs) are small, partial‐thickness defects of the macula defined by characteristic features on optical coherence tomography (OCT), including a newly recognised type of epiretinal membrane termed ‘epiretinal proliferation’. There may be a rationale to recommend surgery for individuals with LMHs, particularly those with functional or anatomical deterioration, or poor baseline vision causing significant disability, to stabilise the LMH and prevent further visual deterioration; however, there is currently no evidence‐based consensus. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of surgical interventions on post‐operative visual and anatomical outcomes in people with a confirmed LMH. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Scopus SciVerse, ISRCTN registry, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We also searched reference lists of included trials to identify other eligible trials which our search strategy may have missed. The date of the search was 20 July 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants with a confirmed LMH diagnosis which reported one or more surgical intervention(s), alone or in combination, in at least one arm of the RCT. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods as expected by Cochrane. Two study authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for included trials. Trial authors were contacted for further information and clarification. 
Main results
A single RCT was eligible for inclusion. Thirty‐six participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio; 24 were allocated to undergo surgery (pars plana vitrectomy, peeling of the epiretial proliferation followed by fovea‐sparing removal of the internal limiting membrane) and 12 (10 following two participant dropouts) to observation. 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence was low for all outcomes due to selection and detection bias, and the low number of participants enrolled in the study which may affect the accuracy of results and reliability of conclusions. 
At six‐month follow‐up, change in vision was better in the surgery group (‐0.27 logMAR improvement) than observation (0.02 worsening) (mean difference (MD): ‐0.29 logMAR, 95% confidence intervals (CI): ‐0.33 to ‐0.25). Central retinal thickness increased in the surgery group over 6 months 126 μm increase) compared with observation group (decrease by 11μm) (MD: 137 μm, 95% CI: 125.87 μm to 148.13 μm). Finally, at six‐month follow‐up, retinal sensitivity was better in the surgery group (3.03 dB increase) compared with the observation group (0.06 dB decrease) (MD: 3.09 dB, 95% CI: 2.07 to 4.11 dB). 
Vision‐related quality of life and metamorphopsia were not reported. No adverse outcomes or complications were reported in the study, however, authors could not provide information on whether any individuals developed deterioration in vision of 0.2 logMAR or worse. 
Authors' conclusions
The included single trial demonstrated improvements in visual and anatomical outcome measures for participants with a LMH who underwent surgery compared with observation only. Therefore, we can conclude that participants who undergo surgery may achieve superior post‐operative best corrected visual acuity and anatomical outcomes compared with observation only. However, the results of a single and small RCT provides limited evidence to support or refute surgery as an effective management option for LMHs. Future RCTs with a larger number of participants and with fewer methodological limitations and biases are necessary to inform future clinical practice. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Surgery for Lamellar Macular Holes

## Plain Title
Does surgery help people with small holes in the center of their eye's retina see better?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**

The macula is the center part of the retina at the back of the eye. It helps us see fine details clearly. A lamellar macular hole (LMH) is a small, partial hole in the macula. It does not go all the way through like a full-thickness hole. Doctors can see these holes using a special eye scan called OCT. People with LMH may have vision problems that affect their daily life.

**Why was this study needed?**

Some people with LMH have their vision get worse over time. Others start with poor vision that makes daily tasks hard. Doctors wanted to know if eye surgery could help stop vision from getting worse or even make it better. Right now, doctors do not agree on whether surgery is the best choice for LMH. This study looked at whether surgery works better than just watching and waiting.

**What did researchers think would happen?**

Researchers thought that surgery might help improve vision. They also thought it might fix the shape of the macula. This could help people see better and stop their vision from getting worse.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a randomized controlled trial. This means people were put into groups by chance, like flipping a coin. This helps make the test fair.

The study included 36 adults with LMH. Twenty-four people were chosen to have surgery. Twelve people were chosen to be watched without surgery. Two people dropped out of the watching group. This left 10 people in that group.

**What was the surgery?**

The surgery had three steps:
- Doctors removed the gel inside the eye
- They peeled away scar tissue on the retina
- They carefully removed a thin layer of tissue around the hole

**How long did the study last?**

People were in the study for six months. Doctors checked their eyes during this time.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

After six months, people who had surgery saw better results than people who were just watched.

**Vision improvements:**
People who had surgery could see better. Their vision improved by about 3 lines on an eye chart. People who were just watched had their vision stay about the same or get slightly worse.

**Retina thickness:**
The retina got thicker in people who had surgery. This means the hole was filling in. In people who were watched, the retina got slightly thinner.

**Retina sensitivity:**
The retina worked better in people who had surgery. It could sense light better than before. In people who were watched, this stayed about the same.

**Side effects:**
The study did not report any problems or complications from surgery. However, the researchers could not tell us if anyone's vision got much worse after surgery.

**What was not measured:**
The study did not ask people about their quality of life. It also did not ask about wavy or distorted vision, which is common with LMH.

**What do the results mean?**

Surgery may help people with LMH see better. It may also help fix the shape of the macula. However, this was a small study with only 36 people. The results might not be reliable because of how the study was done.

**What do researchers conclude?**

More research is needed. Future studies should include more people. They should also be designed better to give clearer answers. Right now, we cannot say for sure if surgery is the best choice for everyone with LMH. Doctors and patients should talk about the options together.

**Important note:**
The quality of evidence from this study was low. This means we should be careful about trusting these results until more studies are done.",10.1002-14651858.CD013678,"The effectiveness of surgery for treating lamellar macular holes
Why is this question important?Lamellar macular holes are small partial‐thickness defects affecting the centre of the retina, called the macula. The retina is the layer at the back of the eye that detects light, and the macula is essential for detailed vision. It has been suggested that surgery can prevent vision loss (or improve vision) in people with lamellar macular holes, but there is no current consensus. We reviewed published research to determine whether surgery improves vision for people with a lamellar macular hole. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of treatment. We then planned to compare the results, and summarise the evidence from the studies. Finally, we then aimed to rate our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and how similar the findings of the different studies were. 
What did we find?We found one study that involved a total of 36 people with a diagnosis of a lamellar macular hole. This study showed that people who underwent surgery may achieve better vision six months after their surgery compared with people who were observed without receiving surgery. However, limitations in the study design and its small size means that our confidence in the evidence was low. 
What does this mean?It remains unclear whether surgery is effective for people with lamellar macular holes. Further research is required.

210,10.1002-14651858.CD013739.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
The primary manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is respiratory insufficiency that can also be related to diffuse pulmonary microthrombosis and thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or arterial thrombosis. People with COVID‐19 who develop thromboembolism have a worse prognosis. 
Anticoagulants such as heparinoids (heparins or pentasaccharides), vitamin K antagonists and direct anticoagulants are used for the prevention and treatment of venous or arterial thromboembolism. Besides their anticoagulant properties, heparinoids have an additional anti‐inflammatory potential. However, the benefit of anticoagulants for people with COVID‐19 is still under debate. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention in people hospitalised with COVID‐19. 
Search methods
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and IBECS databases, the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and medRxiv preprint database from their inception to 14 April 2021. We also checked the reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews identified, and contacted specialists in the field for additional references to trials. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs and cohort studies that compared prophylactic anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention for the management of people hospitalised with COVID‐19. We excluded studies without a comparator group and with a retrospective design (all previously included studies) as we were able to include better study designs. Primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality and necessity for additional respiratory support. Secondary outcomes were mortality related to COVID‐19, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, adverse events, length of hospital stay and quality of life. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used Cochrane RoB 1 to assess the risk of bias for RCTs, ROBINS‐I to assess risk of bias for non‐randomised studies (NRS) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We meta‐analysed data when appropriate. 
Main results
We included seven studies (16,185 participants) with participants hospitalised with COVID‐19, in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. Studies were from Brazil (2), Iran (1), Italy (1), and the USA (1), and two involved more than country. The mean age of participants was 55 to 68 years and the follow‐up period ranged from 15 to 90 days. The studies assessed the effects of heparinoids, direct anticoagulants or vitamin K antagonists, and reported sparse data or did not report some of our outcomes of interest: necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, and quality of life. 
Higher‐dose versus lower‐dose anticoagulants (4 RCTs, 4647 participants) 
Higher‐dose anticoagulants result in little or no difference in all‐cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.16, 4489 participants; 4 RCTs) and increase minor bleeding (RR 3.28, 95% CI 1.75 to 6.14, 1196 participants; 3 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (high‐certainty evidence). Higher‐dose anticoagulants probably reduce pulmonary embolism (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.70, 4360 participants; 4 RCTs), and slightly increase major bleeding (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.80, 4400 participants; 4 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (moderate‐certainty evidence). Higher‐dose anticoagulants may result in little or no difference in deep vein thrombosis (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.03, 3422 participants; 4 RCTs), stroke (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.03, 4349 participants; 3 RCTs), major adverse limb events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.99, 1176 participants; 2 RCTs), myocardial infarction (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.55, 4349 participants; 3 RCTs), atrial fibrillation (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.70, 562 participants; 1 study), or thrombocytopenia (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.24, 2789 participants; 2 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (low‐certainty evidence). It is unclear whether higher‐dose anticoagulants have any effect on necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, and quality of life (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). 
Anticoagulants versus no treatment (3 prospective NRS, 11,538 participants) 
Anticoagulants may reduce all‐cause mortality but the evidence is very uncertain due to two study results being at critical and serious risk of bias (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.74, 8395 participants; 3 NRS; very low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain if anticoagulants have any effect on necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, stroke, myocardial infarction and quality of life (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). 
Ongoing studies 
We found 62 ongoing studies in hospital settings (60 RCTs, 35,470 participants; 2 prospective NRS, 120 participants) in 20 different countries. Thirty‐five ongoing studies plan to report mortality and 26 plan to report necessity for additional respiratory support. We expect 58 studies to be completed in December 2021, and four in July 2022. From 60 RCTs, 28 are comparing different doses of anticoagulants, 24 are comparing anticoagulants versus no anticoagulants, seven are comparing different types of anticoagulants, and one did not report detail of the comparator group. 
Authors' conclusions
When compared to a lower‐dose regimen, higher‐dose anticoagulants result in little to no difference in all‐cause mortality and increase minor bleeding in people hospitalised with COVID‐19 up to 30 days. Higher‐dose anticoagulants possibly reduce pulmonary embolism, slightly increase major bleeding, may result in little to no difference in hospitalisation time, and may result in little to no difference in deep vein thrombosis, stroke, major adverse limb events, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, or thrombocytopenia.  
Compared with no treatment, anticoagulants may reduce all‐cause mortality but the evidence comes from non‐randomised studies and is very uncertain. It is unclear whether anticoagulants have any effect on the remaining outcomes compared to no anticoagulants (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). 
Although we are very confident that new RCTs will not change the effects of different doses of anticoagulants on mortality and minor bleeding, high‐quality RCTs are still needed, mainly for the other primary outcome (necessity for additional respiratory support), the comparison with no anticoagulation, when comparing the types of anticoagulants and giving anticoagulants for a prolonged period of time. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Blood Thinners for People in Hospital with COVID-19

## Plain Title
Do blood thinners help people in hospital with COVID-19?

## Rationale

### What is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?
COVID-19 is a lung disease. It makes it hard to breathe. Some people with COVID-19 get blood clots. These clots can form in the legs, lungs, or other parts of the body. Blood clots can block blood flow. This makes people more sick. People with COVID-19 who get blood clots often do worse.

### What are blood thinners?
Blood thinners are drugs that help stop blood clots. Doctors use them to prevent and treat clots. One type of blood thinner is called heparin. Heparin may also help reduce swelling in the body.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors were not sure if blood thinners help people with COVID-19. They did not know what dose to use. This study looked at the research to find answers. The goal was to see if blood thinners help or harm people in hospital with COVID-19.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review of other studies. The researchers looked at seven studies. These studies included 16,185 people in hospitals with COVID-19. Some people were in intensive care units. Others were in regular hospital rooms or emergency rooms.

### Who was in the studies?
The people in the studies were 55 to 68 years old on average. They came from Brazil, Iran, Italy, and the United States. Some studies included people from more than one country.

### What did the studies compare?
Some studies compared higher doses of blood thinners to lower doses. Other studies compared blood thinners to no treatment. The studies used different types of blood thinners.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies followed people for 15 to 90 days.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

#### Higher dose versus lower dose blood thinners
Four studies with 4,647 people compared different doses.

**Deaths:** Higher doses did not reduce deaths compared to lower doses. About the same number of people died in both groups.

**Blood clots in the lungs:** Higher doses probably reduced blood clots in the lungs. For every 100 people treated, about 3 fewer people got lung clots.

**Bleeding problems:** Higher doses caused more bleeding. Minor bleeding happened about 3 times more often. Major bleeding happened about 2 times more often.

**Other problems:** Higher doses did not change rates of blood clots in legs, stroke, or heart attacks.

#### Blood thinners versus no treatment
Three studies with 11,538 people compared blood thinners to no treatment.

**Deaths:** Blood thinners may reduce deaths. But the researchers were not very sure about this finding. The studies had some problems that made the results less reliable.

**Other outcomes:** The researchers could not tell if blood thinners helped with other problems. There was not enough good information.

### What does this mean?
For people in hospital with COVID-19, higher doses of blood thinners do not save more lives than lower doses. Higher doses do reduce lung clots. But they also cause more bleeding.

Blood thinners might help reduce deaths compared to no treatment. But more research is needed to be sure.

### What happens next?
The researchers found 62 more studies that are still ongoing. These studies include 35,590 people. Most should finish by the end of 2021 or 2022. These new studies will provide more answers.

### Conclusions
The evidence shows that higher doses of blood thinners do not reduce deaths in people with COVID-19. They do help prevent some lung clots. But they increase bleeding risk. Doctors need to balance these benefits and risks.

More high quality studies are needed. These should look at whether blood thinners help people breathe better. They should also compare blood thinners to no treatment more carefully.",10.1002-14651858.CD013739,"Do blood thinners prevent people who are hospitalised with COVID‐19 from developing blood clots? 
Key messages 
‐ High‐dose blood thinners result in little or no difference in death rate and increase minor bleeding compared to low‐dose blood thinners for people hospitalised with COVID‐19. Giving blood thinners compared to not giving blood thinners might reduce the death rate. 
‐ It is very likely that new studies will not change the evidence about the effects of different doses of blood thinners on death rate and minor bleeding. High‐quality studies are still needed to analyse the need for additional respiratory support, giving blood thinners compared to no blood thinners, comparing different blood thinners, and giving blood thinners for extended periods. 
What is COVID‐19? 
COVID‐19 typically affects the lungs and airways; however, in addition to respiratory problems, about 16% of people hospitalised with COVID‐19 experience problems with their blood vessels, leading to blood clots forming in the arteries, veins and lungs. Nearly half of all people with severe COVID‐19 in intensive care units develop clots in their veins or arteries. 
What are blood thinners? 
Blood thinners are medicines that prevent harmful blood clots from forming (deep vein thrombosis). However, they can cause unwanted effects such as bleeding. Some guidelines recommend giving blood thinners when people are first admitted to hospital with COVID‐19 to prevent blood clots from developing, rather than waiting to see whether blood clots develop and then treating them with blood thinners. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether giving blood thinners to people hospitalised with COVID‐19 as a preventive measure reduced the number of deaths compared to people who received no treatment or those who received a placebo treatment (an identical‐seeming treatment but with no active ingredient). We also wanted to determine whether these individuals needed less support with breathing, whether they still developed harmful blood clots, whether they experienced bleeding and whether they experienced any other unwanted events. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed blood thinners given to people hospitalised with COVID‐19 to prevent blood clots. Studies could be of any design as long as they compared a blood thinner with another blood thinner, no treatment or a placebo. Studies could take place anywhere in the world and participants could be any age as long as they were in hospital with confirmed COVID‐19 disease. We pooled the results when appropriate. 
What did we find? 
We included seven studies with 16,185 people hospitalised with COVID‐19 in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. Studies were from Brazil (2), Iran (1), Italy (1), and the USA (1), and two involved more than country. People in the studies were aged from 55 to 68 years on average. Studies lasted from 15 to 90 days and provided evidence on deaths, bleeding, blood clotting, length of hospital stay and unwanted effects. There was little or no evidence on need for respiratory support (help with breathing), deaths related to COVID‐19, and quality of life. 
Higher‐dose of blood thinners compared with lower‐dose (4 studies, 4647 people)  In people who received higher compared to lower doses of blood thinners there was little to no difference in death rate. However, people on higher doses were more likely to experience minor bleeding compared to in those on lower doses. People who received higher doses of blood thinners likely had reduced pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung or blood vessel leading to the lung), slightly increased major (more severe) bleeding, and probably had little to no difference in time spent in hospital compared to those who received the lower doses of blood thinners. In people who received higher doses of blood thinners, there was little to no difference in the rate of deep vein thrombosis, and other unwanted events compared to those who received the lower dose of blood thinners. 
Blood thinners compared with no treatment (3 studies, 11,538 people)  People who received blood thinners had a reduced death rate compared to those who did not receive blood thinners, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are very confident that higher doses of blood thinners do not change the risk of death but do increase the risk of bleeding in people hospitalised with COVID‐19. 
Although our confidence in the evidence is very limited, people who receive blood thinners may have a lower death rate compared to those who did not receive any blood thinners. 
What happens next? 
Our searches found 62 ongoing studies with 35,470 people. We plan to add the results of these studies to our review when they are published. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 14 April 2021.

Chronic rhinosinusitis frequently occurs in people with cystic fibrosis. Several medical interventions are available for treating chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis; for example, different concentrations of nasal saline irrigations, topical or oral corticosteroids, antibiotics ‐ including nebulized antibiotics ‐ dornase alfa and modulators of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (such as lumacaftor, ivacaftor or tezacaftor). However, the efficacy of these interventions is unclear. 
This is an update of a previously published review.
Objectives
The objective of this review is to compare the effects of different medical interventions in people diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and hand searching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search of trials register: 09 September 2021. 
We also searched ongoing trials databases, other medical databases and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest additional searches: 22 November 2021. 
Selection criteria
Randomized and quasi‐randomized trials of different medical interventions compared to each other or to no intervention or to placebo. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials identified for potential inclusion in the review. We planned to conduct data collection and analysis in accordance with Cochrane methods and to independently rate the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE guidelines. 
Main results
We identified no trials that met the pre‐defined inclusion criteria. The most recent searches identified 44 new references, none of which were eligible for inclusion in the current version of this review; 12 studies are listed as excluded and one as ongoing. 
Authors' conclusions
We identified no eligible trials assessing the medical interventions in people with cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis. High‐quality trials are needed which should assess the efficacy of different treatment options detailed above for managing chronic rhinosinusitis, preventing pulmonary exacerbations and improving quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis.

## Plain Title
Review of Medical Treatments for Long-Term Sinus Problems in People with Cystic Fibrosis

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?
Cystic fibrosis is a disease that affects the whole body. It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in different organs. Many people with cystic fibrosis get long-term sinus problems. This is called chronic rhinosinusitis.

### What does this condition cause?
Chronic rhinosinusitis means the sinuses stay swollen and blocked for a long time. The sinuses are air-filled spaces in the face and head. When they are blocked, people may have trouble breathing through their nose. They may have pain in their face. Their sense of smell may be poor. This can make life harder for people with cystic fibrosis.

### What treatments are available?
Doctors use many different treatments for sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis. These include:
- Salt water rinses for the nose
- Steroid medicines (pills or nose sprays)
- Antibiotics (pills or breathed in as a mist)
- A medicine called dornase alfa
- Special medicines that help fix the basic problem in cystic fibrosis (called CFTR modulators)

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors are not sure which of these treatments work best. This review tried to find studies that tested these treatments. The goal was to see which treatments help people with cystic fibrosis and sinus problems the most.

## Trial Design

### How was this review done?
The researchers looked for all studies that tested medical treatments for sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis. They searched medical databases and trial records. They looked for studies that compared different treatments to each other. They also looked for studies that compared treatments to no treatment or to fake treatment (placebo).

The researchers searched up to September 2021. They also did extra searches until November 2021. They looked at 44 new studies that they found.

### What types of studies did they look for?
They wanted to find studies where people were put into treatment groups by chance. This type of study is called a randomized trial. These studies give the most reliable results.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers found no studies that met their requirements. None of the 44 new studies they looked at could be included in the review. This means there is no good evidence about which medical treatments work best for sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis.

### What does this mean?
Right now, doctors do not have clear proof about the best way to treat long-term sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis. More research is needed.

### What is needed next?
The researchers say that high-quality studies are needed. These studies should test the different treatment options listed above. The studies should measure:
- How well the treatments work for sinus problems
- Whether treatments prevent lung infections from getting worse
- How treatments affect quality of life for people with cystic fibrosis

### Conclusions
There are no good studies yet that show which medical treatments work best for chronic sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis. Doctors and researchers need to do more studies. These studies will help find the best ways to help people with cystic fibrosis who have sinus problems.",10.1002-14651858.CD012979,"Medical interventions for chronic inflammation of the nose and sinuses in cystic fibrosis
Review question 
What are the effects of medical interventions for chronic rhinosinusitis on people with cystic fibrosis? 
Background 
Chronic rhinosinusitis is long‐term infection and inflammation of the nasal cavity and air‐filled spaces around the eyes and nose. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that makes secretions in the body thick, and hence stagnant. When this occurs in and around the nose, it causes chronic rhinosinusitis. Better care of people with cystic fibrosis has led to them living longer, increasing the chance of developing chronic rhinosinusitis. Early and effective interventions with antibiotics, steroids, drugs that thin the mucus (e.g. dornase alfa) and drugs to improve how the cell membrane channel functions (CFTR modulators) can help to improve quality of life and prevent the development of lower airway disease. Currently, there are no guidelines based on trials to know how best to treat chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 09 September 2021.
Study characteristics 
We found no trials in our search that met our inclusion criteria. We have listed 12 trials as excluded and one trial as ongoing in the current review. 
Key results 
Although chronic rhinosinusitis is common in people with cystic fibrosis, there is not enough evidence available on its management. This review highlights the need for well‐designed trials assessing which treatment is best for managing chronic rhinosinusitis, preventing lower airway disease and improving quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis.

212,10.1002-14651858.CD014936.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Smoking is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly coronary heart disease (CHD). However, quitting smoking may prevent secondary CVD events in people already diagnosed with CHD.  
Objectives
To examine the impact of smoking cessation on death from CVD and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), in people with incident CHD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the trials registries clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We ran all searches from database inception to 15 April 2021.  
Selection criteria
We included cohort studies, and both cluster‐ and individually randomised controlled trials of at least six months' duration. We treated all included studies as cohort studies and analysed them by smoking status at follow‐up. Eligible studies had to recruit adults (> 18 years) with diagnosed CHD and who smoked tobacco at diagnosis, and assess whether they quit or continued smoking during the study. Studies had to measure at least one of our included outcomes with at least six months' follow‐up. Our primary outcomes were death from CVD and MACE. Secondary outcomes included all‐cause mortality, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, non‐fatal stroke, new‐onset angina and change in quality of life.  
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. 
We assessed the risk of bias for the primary outcomes using the ROBINS‐I tool. We compared the incidence of death from CVD and of MACE (primary outcomes) between participants who quit smoking versus those who continued to smoke for each included study that reported these outcomes. We also assessed differences in all‐cause mortality, incidence of non‐fatal myocardial infarction, incidence of non‐fatal stroke and new onset angina. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For our outcome, change in quality of life, we calculated the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for the difference in change in quality of life from baseline to follow‐up between those who had quit smoking and those who had continued to smoke. For all meta‐analyses we used a generic inverse variance random‐effects model and quantified statistical heterogeneity using the I²statistic. 
We assessed the certainty of evidence for our primary outcomes using the eight GRADE considerations relevant to non‐randomised studies. 
Main results
We included 68 studies, consisting of 80,702 participants.
For both primary outcomes, smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk compared with continuous smoking: CVD death (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.75; I² = 62%; 18 studies, 17,982 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and MACE (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.71; I² = 84%; 15 studies, 20,290 participants; low‐certainty evidence). These findings were robust to our planned sensitivity analyses. Through subgroup analysis, for example comparing adjusted versus non‐adjusted estimates, we found no evidence of differences in the effect size. While there was substantial heterogeneity, this was primarily in magnitude rather than the direction of the effect estimates. Overall, we judged 11 (16%) studies to be at moderate risk of bias and 18 (26%) at serious risk, primarily due to possible confounding. There was also some evidence of funnel plot asymmetry for MACE outcomes. For these reasons, we rated our certainty in the estimates for CVD death as moderate and MACE as low.  
For our secondary outcomes, smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk in all‐cause mortality (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.66; I² = 58%; 48 studies, 59,354 participants), non‐fatal myocardial infarction (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.72; I² = 2%; 24 studies, 23,264 participants) and non‐fatal stroke (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 11,352 participants). As only one study reported new onset of angina, we did not conduct meta‐analysis, but this study reported a lower risk in people who stopped smoking. Quitting smoking was not associated with a worsening of quality of life and suggested improvement in quality of life, with the lower bound of the CI also consistent with no difference (SMD 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.24; I² = 48%; 8 studies, 3182 participants).  
Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence that smoking cessation is associated with a reduction of approximately one‐third in the risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease in people who stop smoking at diagnosis. This association may be causal, based on the link between smoking cessation and restoration of endothelial and platelet function, where dysfunction of both can result in increased likelihood of CVD events.  
Our results provide evidence that there is a decreased risk of secondary CVD events in those who quit smoking compared with those who continue, and that there is a suggested improvement in quality of life as a result of quitting smoking. Additional studies that account for confounding, such as use of secondary CVD prevention medication, would strengthen the evidence in this area.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Quitting Smoking After Heart Disease Diagnosis

## Plain Title
Does Quitting Smoking Help People Who Already Have Heart Disease?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Smoking causes heart disease. Heart disease happens when the heart does not work well. This can cause chest pain, heart attacks, and death.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Many people who smoke get heart disease. Doctors want to know if quitting smoking helps these people stay healthier. When people quit smoking, their blood vessels work better. Their blood also clots less easily. These changes might help prevent more heart problems.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to see if people with heart disease who quit smoking live longer. They also wanted to know if quitting smoking prevents more heart attacks and strokes. A stroke happens when blood cannot reach the brain.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this question?**

Researchers looked at 68 studies. These studies included over 80,000 adults. All these people had heart disease and smoked when doctors first found their heart disease.

Researchers put people into two groups:
- People who quit smoking
- People who kept smoking

Then researchers watched both groups for at least 6 months. Some studies lasted much longer.

**Who was in these studies?**

All people in the studies were adults over 18 years old. All had heart disease. All smoked when they learned about their heart disease.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

People who quit smoking did much better than people who kept smoking.

**Deaths from heart disease:**
Quitting smoking lowered the risk of dying from heart disease. About 4 out of 10 fewer people died when they quit smoking compared to those who kept smoking.

**Major heart problems:**
People who quit had fewer major heart problems. Major heart problems include heart attacks and strokes. About 4 out of 10 fewer people had these problems when they quit smoking.

**Other findings:**
- Fewer deaths from all causes in people who quit
- Fewer heart attacks in people who quit
- Fewer strokes in people who quit
- Quality of life stayed the same or got better after quitting

**How sure are researchers about these results?**

Researchers are fairly sure about these findings. The results were similar across many different studies. The studies included many people from different places.

**What do these results mean?**

Quitting smoking helps people with heart disease live longer. It also helps prevent more heart attacks and strokes. People who quit smoking do not feel worse. They may actually feel better.

**Why is this important?**

This study shows that it is never too late to quit smoking. Even people who already have heart disease can help themselves by quitting. Quitting smoking is one of the best things people with heart disease can do for their health.

Doctors should encourage all patients with heart disease to quit smoking. Patients should know that quitting will help them live longer and healthier lives.

**What happens next?**

More studies are needed. Future studies should look at other treatments people receive for heart disease. This will help researchers understand even better how quitting smoking helps.",10.1002-14651858.CD014936,"Does stopping smoking make people with heart disease less likely to have another heart attack? 
Key messages 
• People with heart disease who stop smoking are likely to experience a decreased risk in future heart attacks or other events linked to the heart or blood vessels, such as stroke.  
• People with heart disease who stop smoking are unlikely to have worse quality of life. 
Smoking and heart disease 
Smoking increases the chances that a person will have a heart attack, however there is less information on whether stopping smoking can reduce the risk of having a second heart attack.  
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out whether stopping smoking after a heart attack can reduce the chances of having further heart attacks or other types of disease linked to the heart or blood vessels. If stopping smoking does prevent further illness this could motivate more people to quit smoking and encourage doctors and nurses to provide more active support to help people to stop.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that lasted at least 6 months, and that included people diagnosed with heart disease who were smoking when the study started. Studies also had to measure whether people did or did not stop smoking and whether or not they had another event linked to their heart or blood vessels, such as another heart attack or a stroke.  
Search date: we included studies published up to 15 April 2021. 
What we found 
We found 68 studies with 80,702 people. Most studies included adult men and women from the general population, however, 11 studies included only men. We looked at the combined results of 60 studies that measured events linked to heart disease and of 8 studies that measured people’s quality of life over a period of 6 months or more.  
What are the results of our review? 
Compared with people who continued to smoke, people who stopped smoking were a third less likely to die from heart disease or stroke (evidence from 17,982 people in 18 studies) and a third less likely to have another heart attack or stroke (evidence from 20,290 people in 15 studies). Our confidence in these results was moderate (death from heart disease or stroke) and low (death from heart disease or stroke, another heart attack or another stroke) respectively. Our confidence in the strength of our results was reduced because of issues with how some of the studies were designed and carried out. However, when we only examined studies of a higher standard, we continued to find that people who stopped smoking were less likely to die from heart disease or stroke. This suggests that while we may be uncertain about how big the reduction in the chance of dying is, people who stop smoking are likely to reduce their chances of dying from heart disease or stroke to some degree. We found similar results for a decreased likelihood of dying from any cause, having another heart attack that does not lead to death and having a stroke that does not lead to death.  
We also found that people who stopped smoking had a suggested improvement in quality of life compared with those who continued smoking after being diagnosed with heart disease.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with dyspnoea, cough or sputum production (or both) and affects quality of life and functional status. More efficient approaches to alternative management that may include patients themselves managing their condition need further exploration in order to reduce the impact on both patients and healthcare services. Digital interventions may potentially impact on health behaviours and encourage patient engagement. 
Objectives
To assess benefits and harms of digital interventions for managing COPD and apply Behaviour Change Technique (BCT) taxonomy to describe and explore intervention content. 
Search methods
We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register (date of last search 28 April 2020). We found other trials at web‐based clinical trials registers. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing digital technology interventions with or without routine supported self‐management to usual care, or control treatment for self‐management. Multi‐component interventions (of which one component was digital self‐management) compared with usual care, standard care or control treatment were included. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved with a third review author. We assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes were impact on health behaviours, self‐efficacy, exacerbations and quality of life, including the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The minimally important difference (MID) for the SGRQ is 4 points. Two review authors independently applied BCT taxonomy to identify mechanisms in the digital interventions that influence behaviours. 
Main results
Fourteen studies were included in the meta‐analyses (1518 participants) ranging from 13 to 52 weeks duration. Participants had mild to very severe COPD. Risk of bias was high due to lack of blinding. GRADE ratings were low to very low certainty due to lack of blinding and imprecision. Common BCT clusters identified as behaviour change mechanisms in interventions were goals and planning, feedback and monitoring, social support, shaping knowledge and antecedents. 
Digital technology intervention with or without routine supported self‐management 
Interventions included mobile phone (three studies), smartphone applications (one study), and web or Internet‐based (five studies). 
Evidence is very uncertain about effects on impact on health behaviours as measured by six‐minute walk distance (6MWD) at 13 weeks (mean difference (MD) 26.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐21.70 to 74.10; participants = 122; studies = 2) or 23 to 26 weeks (MD 14.31, 95% CI ‐19.41 to 48.03; participants = 164; studies = 3). There may be improvement in 6MWD at 52 weeks (MD 54.33 95% CI ‐35.47 to 144.12; participants = 204; studies = 2) but studies were varied (very low certainty). 
There may be no difference in self‐efficacy on managing Chronic Disease Scale (SEMCD) or pulmonary rehabilitation adapted index of self‐efficacy tool (PRAISE). Evidence is very uncertain. 
Quality of life may be slightly improved on the chronic respiratory disease questionnaire (CRQ) at 13 weeks (MD 0.45, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.90; participants = 123; studies = 2; low certainty), but is not clinically important (MID 0.5). There may be little or no difference at 23 or 52 weeks (low to very low certainty). There may be a clinical improvement on SGRQ total at 52 weeks (MD ‐26.57, 95% CI ‐34.09 to ‐19.05; participants = 120; studies = 1; low certainty). Evidence for COPD assessment test (CAT) and Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) is very uncertain. 
There may be little or no difference in dyspnoea symptoms (CRQ dyspnoea) at 13, 23 weeks or 52 weeks (low to very low certainty evidence) or mean number of exacerbations at 26 weeks (low‐certainty evidence). 
There was no evidence for the number of people experiencing adverse events.
Multi‐component interventions 
Digital components included mobile phone (one study), and web or internet‐based (four studies). 
Evidence is very uncertain about effects on impact on health behaviour (6MWD) at 13 weeks (MD 99.60, 95% CI ‐15.23 to 214.43; participants = 20; studies = 1). 
No evidence was found for self‐efficacy. Four studies reported effects on quality of life (SGRQ and CCQ scales). The evidence is very uncertain. 
There may be no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations or mean days to first exacerbation at 52 weeks with a multi‐component intervention compared to standard care. 
Evidence is very uncertain about effects on the number of people experiencing adverse events at 52 weeks. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a clear benefit or harm of digital technology interventions with or without supported self‐management, or multi‐component interventions compared to usual care in improving the 6MWD or self‐efficacy. We found there may be some short‐term improvement in quality of life with digital interventions, but there is no evidence about whether the effect is sustained long term. Dyspnoea symptoms may improve over a longer duration of digital intervention use. The evidence for multi‐component interventions is very uncertain and as there is little or no evidence for adverse events, we cannot determine the benefit or harm of these interventions. The evidence base is predominantly of very low certainty with concerns around high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. Given that variation of interventions and blinding is likely to be a concern, future, larger studies are needed taking these limitations in consideration. Future studies are needed to determine whether the small improvements observed in this review can be applied to the general COPD population. 
A clear understanding of behaviour change through the BCT classification is important to gauge uptake of digital interventions and health outcomes in people with varying severity of COPD. Currently there is no guidance for interpreting BCT components of a digital intervention for changes to health outcomes. We could not interpret the BCT findings to the health outcomes we were investigating due to limited evidence that was of very low certainty. In future research, standardised approaches need to be considered when designing protocols to investigate effectiveness of digital interventions by including a standardised approach to BCT classification in addition to validated behavioural outcome measures that may reflect changes in behaviour. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Digital Tools for Managing Chronic Lung Disease (COPD)

## Plain Title

Can Digital Tools Like Smartphones and Websites Help People Manage Their Chronic Lung Disease?

## Rationale

**What is COPD?**

COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is a long-term lung condition. People with COPD often have trouble breathing. They may cough a lot. They may also produce mucus or phlegm. This disease makes daily life harder. It affects how well people can do normal tasks.

**Why was this study needed?**

COPD puts a heavy burden on patients. It also puts strain on hospitals and doctors. Researchers wanted to find better ways to help. They thought that digital tools might help. Digital tools include things like smartphone apps and websites. These tools might help patients manage their own care at home. They might change how patients behave. They might help patients take a more active role in their health.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if digital tools actually help people with COPD. They wanted to see if these tools improve quality of life. They wanted to know if the tools help people walk farther. They wanted to see if the tools reduce flare-ups of symptoms. They also wanted to understand how these tools work to change behavior.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of many different studies. Researchers looked at 14 studies. These studies included 1,518 people total. The studies lasted between 13 weeks and 52 weeks. That means people were in studies for 3 months to 1 year.

**Who was in these studies?**

All participants had COPD. Some had mild disease. Others had very severe disease. The studies included both men and women. The studies included adults of different ages.

**What did the studies compare?**

Some studies tested mobile phone programs. Some tested smartphone apps. Others tested websites or internet programs. Researchers compared people using these digital tools to people getting usual care. Usual care means regular doctor visits and standard treatment.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at several things. They measured how far people could walk in 6 minutes. They measured quality of life using questionnaires. They looked at breathing difficulty. They counted how many flare-ups people had. They also tried to understand what parts of the digital tools changed behavior.

## Results

**What did the study find about walking ability?**

The results were unclear. Digital tools might help people walk a bit farther after 1 year. But the evidence was very uncertain. Different studies showed different results.

**What about confidence in managing the disease?**

Researchers could not tell if digital tools helped people feel more confident. The evidence was too uncertain.

**Did quality of life improve?**

There may be some small improvement in quality of life. After 13 weeks, people using digital tools felt slightly better. But this improvement was very small. After 1 year, one study showed bigger improvement. But more research is needed. The evidence was not strong enough to be sure.

**Did breathing problems get better?**

Digital tools probably did not reduce breathing difficulty much. The evidence showed little or no difference.

**What about flare-ups?**

Digital tools may not reduce the number of flare-ups. The evidence was unclear.

**Were there any harmful effects?**

Researchers could not tell if digital tools caused harm. There was not enough information about side effects.

**What about programs with multiple parts?**

Some programs combined digital tools with other treatments. The evidence for these programs was very uncertain. Researchers could not tell if they helped or not.

**What are the main conclusions?**

There is not enough good evidence yet. We cannot say for sure if digital tools help people with COPD. There may be some small, short-term benefits for quality of life. But we do not know if these benefits last. We also do not know if digital tools cause any harm.

The studies had problems. People knew which treatment they were getting. This could affect results. The studies were also quite different from each other. This made it hard to compare them.

More and better studies are needed. Future studies should be larger. They should last longer. They need better designs. Only then can we know if digital tools truly help people with COPD manage their condition at home.",10.1002-14651858.CD013246,"Digital interventions for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Review question 
Do digital interventions help people to improve their self‐management of COPD and their health? Do they help to change their behaviour about managing their symptoms? 
What is COPD? 
COPD is a chronic and progressive condition affecting the airways and lungs. Typically, COPD results from prolonged exposure to harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke, leading to inflammation of the airways, as well as abnormal expansion of the airspaces of the lungs. Owing to the highly varied nature of COPD, there is much variety in how the condition affects individuals’ lives. A persistent cough and breathlessness are characteristic symptoms of COPD, worsening during flare‐ups (exacerbations) and becoming more severe over time. This makes activities of daily living more difficult and greatly impacts quality of life. 
Managing COPD is complex and varies depending on the severity of the condition. Self‐management techniques often play a role in relieving symptoms, such as breathing exercises, as well as a combination of medication and supplementary oxygen. 
'Digital interventions' and 'telehealth' are terms used to encompass the use of technology to communicate and send information between a patient and a healthcare provider ‐ helping to manage the patient’s condition remotely. This may involve (but is not restricted to) the use of a mobile phone or tablet computer application to log symptoms and lung function, allowing a clinician to adjust medications in real‐time. It may also involve remotely training a patient in self‐management techniques. There is scope for those living with COPD to greatly benefit from the use of such interventions, offering convenient and accessible healthcare provision. 
Why did we do this review? 
We wanted to find out if digital interventions were helpful for people with COPD in terms of managing their condition, and if these interventions played a part in changing their behaviour towards self‐management. Additionally, we wanted to understand the behaviour change techniques incorporated in different digital interventions. 
What evidence did we find? 
Mostly, digital interventions or multi component approaches did not improve walking distance or betterment in one's own belief in managing their condition. There was small short‐term improvement in quality of life with Internet‐based interventions but we cannot be certain whether the improvement is seen long term. Breathing difficulties may improve with long‐term use of digital interventions, but they may have little to no effect on flare‐ups. Due to limited data available, we cannot say with confidence that digital interventions can be used to improve health in people with COPD, or that they reduce harm. There is little or no evidence about possible unwanted side‐effects of digital interventions. More research in this field can provide more robust conclusions for their use and insight into people's behaviours towards these novel approaches.

Postoperative pain is common and may be severe. Postoperative administration of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces patient opioid requirements and, in turn, may reduce the incidence and severity of opioid‐induced adverse events (AEs). 
Objectives
To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single‐dose intravenous ketorolac, compared with placebo or an active comparator, for moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases without language restrictions: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS on 20 April 2020. We checked clinical trials registers and reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized double‐blind trials that compared a single postoperative dose of intravenous ketorolac with placebo or another active treatment, for treating acute postoperative pain in adults following any surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was the number of participants in each arm achieving at least 50% pain relief over a four‐ and six‐hour period.Our secondary outcomes were time to and number of participants using rescue medication; withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and for any other cause; and number of participants experiencing any AE, serious AEs (SAEs), and NSAID‐related or opioid‐related AEs.For subgroup analysis, we planned to analyze different doses of parenteral ketorolac separately and to analyze results based on the type of surgery performed.We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 12 studies, involving 1905 participants undergoing various surgeries (pelvic/abdominal, dental, and orthopedic), with 17 to 83 participants receiving intravenous ketorolac in each study. Mean study population ages ranged from 22.5 years to 67.4 years. Most studies administered a dose of ketorolac of 30 mg; one study assessed 15 mg, and another administered 60 mg. 
Most studies had an unclear risk of bias for some domains, particularly allocation concealment and blinding, and a high risk of bias due to small sample size. The overall certainty of evidence for each outcome ranged from very low to moderate. Reasons for downgrading certainty included serious study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision. 
Ketorolac versus placebo 
Very low‐certainty evidence from eight studies (658 participants) suggests that ketorolac results in a large increase in the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over four hours compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 2.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80 to 4.37). The number needed to treat for one additional participant to benefit (NNTB) was 2.4 (95% CI 1.8 to 3.7). Low‐certainty evidence from 10 studies (914 participants) demonstrates that ketorolac may result in a large increase in the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over six hours compared to placebo (RR 3.26, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.51). The NNTB was 2.5 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.7). 
Among secondary outcomes, for time to rescue medication, moderate‐certainty evidence comparing intravenous ketorolac versus placebo demonstrated a mean median of 271 minutes for ketorolac versus 104 minutes for placebo (6 studies, 633 participants). For the number of participants using rescue medication, very low‐certainty evidence from five studies (417 participants) compared ketorolac with placebo. The RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.00), that is, it did not demonstrate a difference between groups. 
Ketorolac probably results in a slight increase in total adverse event rates compared with placebo (74% versus 65%; 8 studies, 810 participants; RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.19; number needed to treat for an additional harmful event (NNTH) 16.7, 95% CI 8.3 to infinite, moderate‐certainty evidence). Serious AEs were rare. Low‐certainty evidence from eight studies (703 participants) did not demonstrate a difference in rates between ketorolac and placebo (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.03). 
Ketorolac versus NSAIDs Ketorolac was compared to parecoxib in four studies and diclofenac in two studies. For our primary outcome, over both four and six hours there was no evidence of a difference between intravenous ketorolac and another NSAID (low‐certainty and moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively). Over four hours, four studies (337 participants) produced an RR of 1.04 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.21) and over six hours, six studies (603 participants) produced an RR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.19). 
For time to rescue medication, low‐certainty evidence from four studies (427 participants) suggested that participants receiving ketorolac waited an extra 35 minutes (mean median 331 minutes versus 296 minutes). For the number of participants using rescue medication, very low‐certainty evidence from three studies (260 participants) compared ketorolac with another NSAID. The RR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.40), that is, there may be little or no difference between groups.   
Ketorolac probably results in a slight increase in total adverse event rates compared with another NSAID (76% versus 68%, 5 studies, 516 participants; RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.23; NNTH 12.5, 95% CI 6.7 to infinite, moderate‐certainty evidence). Serious AEs were rare. Low‐certainty evidence from five studies (530 participants) did not demonstrate a difference in rates between ketorolac and another NSAID (RR 3.18, 95% CI 0.13 to 76.99). Only one of the five studies reported a single serious AE. 
Authors' conclusions
The amount and certainty of evidence for the use of intravenous ketorolac as a treatment for postoperative pain varies across efficacy and safety outcomes and amongst comparators, from very low to moderate. The available evidence indicates that postoperative intravenous ketorolac administration may offer substantial pain relief for most patients, but further research may impact this estimate. Adverse events appear to occur at a slightly higher rate in comparison to placebo and to other NSAIDs. Insufficient information is available to assess whether intravenous ketorolac has a different rate of gastrointestinal or surgical‐site bleeding, renal dysfunction, or cardiovascular events versus other NSAIDs. There was a lack of studies in cardiovascular surgeries and in elderly populations who may be at increased risk for adverse events. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Intravenous Ketorolac for Pain After Surgery

## Plain Title

Does ketorolac given through an IV help adults with pain after surgery?

## Rationale

**What is pain after surgery?**

Pain after surgery is very common. Many people have moderate to severe pain. This pain can make recovery harder.

**How is pain after surgery usually treated?**

Doctors often give opioid pain medicines after surgery. Opioids work well but can cause problems. These problems include feeling sick, throwing up, and trouble breathing.

**What is ketorolac?**

Ketorolac is a pain medicine. It belongs to a group called NSAIDs. NSAIDs work differently than opioids. They reduce swelling and pain.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors want to know if ketorolac works well for pain after surgery. If ketorolac works, patients might need less opioid medicine. This could mean fewer side effects. Ketorolac is given through an IV, which means through a needle into a vein.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if one dose of ketorolac through an IV helps adults with pain after surgery. They also wanted to know if ketorolac is safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of many studies. Researchers looked at 12 different studies. These studies included 1,905 adults total.

**Who was in these studies?**

All participants were adults who had surgery. They had moderate to severe pain after surgery. The types of surgery included:
- Pelvic or belly surgery
- Dental surgery
- Bone and joint surgery

The average age ranged from 22 to 67 years across different studies.

**What did participants receive?**

Some participants got ketorolac through an IV. Others got a placebo, which is a fake treatment with no medicine. Some got other pain medicines for comparison.

Most studies used 30 mg of ketorolac. One study used 15 mg. Another used 60 mg.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies measured pain relief over 4 to 6 hours after giving the medicine.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**Ketorolac compared to placebo:**

Ketorolac worked much better than placebo for pain relief. About 2 to 3 times more people got good pain relief with ketorolac. Good pain relief means at least half of their pain went away.

For every 2 to 3 people who got ketorolac, one extra person got good pain relief compared to placebo.

People who got ketorolac waited longer before needing more pain medicine. They waited about 271 minutes. People who got placebo needed more medicine after about 104 minutes.

**Ketorolac compared to other NSAIDs:**

Ketorolac worked about the same as other NSAIDs. These included parecoxib and diclofenac. There was little difference in pain relief between ketorolac and these other medicines.

**What about side effects?**

Ketorolac caused slightly more side effects than placebo. About 74 out of 100 people had side effects with ketorolac. About 65 out of 100 people had side effects with placebo.

Ketorolac also caused slightly more side effects than other NSAIDs. About 76 out of 100 people had side effects with ketorolac. About 68 out of 100 people had side effects with other NSAIDs.

Serious side effects were rare with all treatments. The studies did not show a clear difference in serious side effects.

**What are the limitations?**

The researchers noted some problems:
- Many studies were small
- Some studies had unclear methods
- There were not enough studies in older adults
- There were no studies in people having heart surgery

**What do the results mean?**

Ketorolac given through an IV may help most people with pain after surgery. It provides good pain relief for many patients. However, more research is needed to be certain.

Ketorolac appears safe for most people. But doctors need more information about certain groups. These include older adults and people having heart surgery.

The evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate. This means researchers are somewhat confident but not completely certain about these findings.",10.1002-14651858.CD013263,"What are the benefits and risks of a single injection of ketorolac (an anti‐inflammation medicine) for relieving short‐term pain after surgery in adults? 
Key messages 
· Ketorolac may reduce short‐term pain after surgery by 50% (half) or more in more people than a placebo (dummy treatment).· There may be little to no difference between ketorolac and other anti‐inflammation medicines in the number of people whose pain is reduced by half or more.· Ketorolac probably causes slightly more unwanted effects than placebo and other anti‐inflammation medicines; more evidence is required to establish if it causes serious unwanted effects. 
Treating short‐term pain after surgery 
It is common for people to feel pain in the short term (within six hours) after surgery. Often, medicines called non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are given to relieve this pain. 
NSAIDS work by stopping the body’s production of chemicals that cause inflammation and pain. A potential advantage of using NSAIDs is that they may limit the need for stronger pain‐relief medicine such as opioids. Opioids can cause unwanted (adverse) events such as nausea and vomiting, constipation, breathing problems and allergic reactions. People may become addicted to opioids if they take a lot of them. 
NSAIDs can also cause unwanted effects. These include bleeding at the site of the surgical wound, and potential injury to the kidneys and gut. It is therefore important to weigh the benefits and risks of NSAIDs when considering using them to reduce pain shortly after surgery. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out about the benefits and risks of using a specific NSAID, ketorolac, for relief of short‐term pain after surgery. Ketorolac can be given as an injection, which may be useful when patients cannot take medicines by mouth. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that involved adults (aged over 18) and compared a single injection of ketorolac against: 
· a placebo (dummy treatment); or· another treatment. 
We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 12 studies that involved 1905 people in total. The studies investigated the treatment of pain after surgery on the abdomen, pelvis, teeth, bones, joints and muscles. Most studies (10) treated people with a dose of 30 milligrams of ketorolac. They compared ketorolac against: 
· a placebo;· another NSAID; or· an opioid. 
Here we present the findings from comparisons between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDs. 
Pain reduction 
The evidence suggests that:
· around three times more people may have their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within six hours of surgery when treated with ketorolac rather than placebo; and· there could be little to no difference between ketorolac and other NSAIDS in the number of people with pain reduced by 50% or more within four or six hours of surgery. 
Need for extra pain medicines (rescue medication) 
Ketorolac could delay the need for rescue medication compared to placebo or other NSAIDs. The evidence is not robust enough to show if fewer people need rescue medicine when treated with ketorolac. 
Adverse effects 
Ketorolac probably causes slightly more adverse effects than placebo and other NSAIDS. Serious adverse effects (such as blood collecting in the muscles around the abdomen, causing severe pain) were rare in the studies we found; the evidence suggested there may be little to no difference in the number of serious adverse events between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDS. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Studies were small, and most may have been conducted in ways that could introduce errors into their results. This limited our confidence in the evidence. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to April 2020.

Elevated blood pressure, or hypertension, is the leading cause of preventable deaths globally. Diets high in sodium (predominantly sodium chloride) and low in potassium contribute to elevated blood pressure. The WHO recommends decreasing mean population sodium intake through effective and safe strategies to reduce hypertension and its associated disease burden. Incorporating low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) into population strategies has increasingly been recognised as a possible sodium reduction strategy, particularly in populations where a substantial proportion of overall sodium intake comes from discretionary salt. The LSSS contain lower concentrations of sodium through its displacement with potassium predominantly, or other minerals. Potassium‐containing LSSS can potentially simultaneously decrease sodium intake and increase potassium intake.  Benefits of LSSS include their potential blood pressure‐lowering effect and relatively low cost. However, there are concerns about potential adverse effects of LSSS, such as hyperkalaemia, particularly in people at risk, for example, those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or taking medications that impair potassium excretion. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety of replacing salt with LSSS to reduce sodium intake on cardiovascular health in adults, pregnant women and children. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL, EBSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 18 August 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. No language or publication restrictions were applied. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective analytical cohort studies in participants of any age in the general population, from any setting in any country. This included participants with non‐communicable diseases and those taking medications that impair potassium excretion. Studies had to compare any type and method of implementation of LSSS with the use of regular salt, or no active intervention, at an individual, household or community level, for any duration. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full‐text articles to determine eligibility; and extracted data, assessed risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB tool, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by adults, children (≤ 18 years) and pregnant women. Primary effectiveness outcomes were change in diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP and SBP), hypertension and blood pressure control; cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality were additionally assessed as primary effectiveness outcomes in adults. Primary safety outcomes were change in blood potassium, hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia. 
Main results
We included 26 RCTs, 16 randomising individual participants and 10 randomising clusters (families, households or villages). A total of 34,961 adult participants and 92 children were randomised to either LSSS or regular salt, with the smallest trial including 10 and the largest including 20,995 participants. No studies in pregnant women were identified. Studies included only participants with hypertension (11/26), normal blood pressure (1/26), pre‐hypertension (1/26), or participants with and without hypertension (11/26). This was unknown in the remaining studies. The largest study included only participants with an elevated risk of stroke at baseline. Seven studies included adult participants possibly at risk of hyperkalaemia. All 26 trials specifically excluded participants in whom an increased potassium intake is known to be potentially harmful. The majority of trials were conducted in rural or suburban settings, with more than half (14/26) conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
The proportion of sodium chloride replacement in the LSSS interventions varied from approximately 3% to 77%. The majority of trials (23/26) investigated LSSS where potassium‐containing salts were used to substitute sodium. In most trials, LSSS implementation was discretionary (22/26). Trial duration ranged from two months to nearly five years.  
We assessed the overall risk of bias as high in six trials and unclear in 12 trials.
LSSS compared to regular salt in adults: LSSS compared to regular salt probably reduce DBP on average (mean difference (MD) ‐2.43 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.50 to ‐1.36; 20,830 participants, 19 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) and SBP (MD ‐4.76 mmHg, 95% CI ‐6.01 to ‐3.50; 21,414 participants, 20 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) slightly.  
On average, LSSS probably reduce non‐fatal stroke (absolute effect (AE) 20 fewer/100,000 person‐years, 95% CI ‐40 to 2; 21,250 participants, 3 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence), non‐fatal acute coronary syndrome (AE 150 fewer/100,000 person‐years, 95% CI ‐250 to ‐30; 20,995 participants, 1 RCT, moderate‐certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (AE 180 fewer/100,000 person‐years, 95% CI ‐310 to 0; 23,200 participants, 3 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) slightly, and probably increase blood potassium slightly (MD 0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.18; 784 participants, 6 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence), compared to regular salt.  
LSSS may result in little to no difference, on average, in hypertension (AE 17 fewer/1000, 95% CI ‐58 to 17; 2566 participants, 1 RCT, low‐certainty evidence) and hyperkalaemia (AE 4 more/100,000, 95% CI ‐47 to 121; 22,849 participants, 5 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) compared to regular salt. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on blood pressure control, various cardiovascular events, stroke mortality, hypokalaemia, and other adverse events (very‐low certainty evidence). 
LSSS compared to regular salt in children: The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on DBP and SBP in children. We found no evidence about the effects of LSSS on hypertension, blood pressure control, blood potassium, hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia in children. 
Authors' conclusions
When compared to regular salt, LSSS probably reduce blood pressure, non‐fatal cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality slightly in adults. However, LSSS also probably increase blood potassium slightly in adults. These small effects may be important when LSSS interventions are implemented at the population level. Evidence is limited for adults without elevated blood pressure, and there is a lack of evidence in pregnant women and people in whom an increased potassium intake is known to be potentially harmful, limiting conclusions on the safety of LSSS in the general population. We also cannot draw firm conclusions about effects of non‐discretionary LSSS implementations. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on blood pressure in children. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using Low-Sodium Salt to Improve Heart Health

## Plain Title

Can using salt with less sodium and more potassium help lower blood pressure and prevent heart problems?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

High blood pressure is a major health problem around the world. It can lead to heart attacks, strokes, and early death. High blood pressure is the top cause of deaths that could be prevented.

**What causes high blood pressure?**

Eating too much sodium (salt) and not enough potassium can raise blood pressure. Most sodium comes from table salt. Many people add salt to their food when cooking or eating.

**What is low-sodium salt?**

Low-sodium salt is a type of salt that has less sodium in it. It replaces some of the sodium with potassium or other minerals. This means people can still use salt but get less sodium and more potassium at the same time.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to know if low-sodium salt could help lower blood pressure and prevent heart problems. They also wanted to make sure low-sodium salt is safe to use. There was concern that too much potassium might harm some people, such as those with kidney disease.

Low-sodium salt costs less than many other treatments. If it works and is safe, many people could benefit from using it.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this?**

Researchers looked at 26 studies that tested low-sodium salt. These studies included nearly 35,000 adults and 92 children. No studies included pregnant women.

**Who was in the studies?**

Most studies included adults. Some people had high blood pressure, and some had normal blood pressure. One large study included people at high risk for stroke. The studies did not include people who might be harmed by extra potassium, such as those with severe kidney disease.

**Where did the studies take place?**

More than half the studies happened in poorer countries. Most took place in rural or suburban areas.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared low-sodium salt to regular salt. The low-sodium salt had different amounts of sodium removed (from 3% to 77% less). Most low-sodium salts used potassium to replace the sodium.

**How long did the studies last?**

Studies lasted from 2 months to nearly 5 years.

## Results

**What did researchers find in adults?**

Low-sodium salt probably helps lower blood pressure. On average, it lowered the top blood pressure number by about 5 points. It lowered the bottom number by about 2 points.

Low-sodium salt probably helps prevent some heart problems:
- Fewer strokes (20 fewer strokes per 100,000 people each year)
- Fewer heart attacks (150 fewer heart attacks per 100,000 people each year)
- Fewer deaths from heart disease (180 fewer deaths per 100,000 people each year)

Low-sodium salt probably raises potassium levels in the blood slightly. However, it did not cause dangerous levels of potassium in most people.

**What did researchers find in children?**

Researchers could not tell if low-sodium salt helps children. There were not enough studies with children.

**What are the main conclusions?**

Low-sodium salt probably helps adults by lowering blood pressure and preventing some heart problems. These benefits may seem small for one person. But if many people use low-sodium salt, it could help prevent many heart attacks, strokes, and deaths.

Low-sodium salt appears safe for most adults. However, more research is needed for:
- People with normal blood pressure
- Pregnant women
- People with kidney disease or taking certain medications
- Children

**Why is this important?**

This research shows that a simple change—using low-sodium salt instead of regular salt—could help millions of people stay healthier. Low-sodium salt is affordable and easy to use. It could be an important tool for preventing heart disease worldwide.",10.1002-14651858.CD015207,"Does using low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) instead of regular salt reduce blood pressure and heart disease risks, and is it safe? 
Key messages 
• In adults, using LSSS instead of regular salt in food probably lowers blood pressure slightly. Adults using LSSS instead of regular salt probably have a slightly lower risk of non‐fatal heart conditions, such as stroke or a sudden reduced blood flow to the heart, and death from heart disease. 
• Using LSSS instead of regular salt probably also slightly increases the level of blood potassium (a mineral that keeps your heart beating at the right pace) in adults. This could be harmful for people who cannot effectively regulate the potassium in their bodies. Other evidence on safety is very limited. 
• We are not certain about effects of using LSSS instead of regular salt on blood pressure in children, or whether using LSSS is safe in children. 
• This evidence may not directly apply to people known to be at risk of high blood potassium, such as people with kidney problems or on certain medications. 
What are low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS)? 
LSSS are products with less sodium than regular salt. Amounts of sodium in LSSS are lowered by replacing some of the sodium with potassium or other minerals. LSSS may help lower risks of using regular salt, since eating lots of sodium and not enough potassium contributes to high blood pressure. Globally, high blood pressure is the largest cause of preventable deaths, mainly because it causes stroke, acute coronary syndrome (ACS; where less blood flows to the heart), and kidney problems. 
However, LSSS also has potential health risks. Using LSSS may lead to higher than normal blood potassium (hyperkalaemia), which causes problems with the heartbeat speed and rhythm, or can cause the heart to stop. These risks are greater in certain people, for example, those whose kidneys do not work properly to remove potassium. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out what the effects of using LSSS instead of regular salt are on blood pressure as well as on events (stroke and ACS) and heart disease death. We also wanted to know if using LSSS instead of regular salt is safe, both in the general population and in people who are known to be at risk of high blood potassium levels. 
We wanted to find this out for adults, children and pregnant women.
What did we do?We searched five electronic databases and trial registries for studies that compared using LSSS with using regular salt. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the combined evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.  
What did we find? 
We found 26 trials* involving 34,961 adults and 92 children. No studies in pregnant women were found. Most trials were undertaken in rural or suburban areas, with more than half done in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Most trials included some people with high blood pressure (22); the largest included only people with a high risk of stroke. Seven trials were done in people at possible risk of high blood potassium. All trials excluded people where high potassium intake is known to be harmful, such as people with kidney problems or on certain medications. Nearly all trials (23) examined LSSS types where some sodium was replaced with potassium. The amount of sodium replaced in the various LSSS used in the trials ranged from very small (3%) to large (77%). 
*Trials are types of studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure similar groups of participants. 
Main results 
In adults, LSSS probably lowers blood pressure (diastolic and systolic) slightly when compared to regular salt. Using LSSS also probably lowers risk of non‐fatal stroke, non‐fatal ACS and heart disease death slightly when compared to regular salt. 
However, using LSSS instead of regular salt probably also slightly increases the level of potassium in the blood. 
Compared to regular salt, LSSS may result in little to no difference in high blood pressure and hyperkalaemia. 
We could not draw any conclusions about effects of LSSS on blood pressure control, various heart disease events, death caused by stroke, lower than normal blood potassium (hypokalaemia), and other adverse events. 
We could not draw any conclusions about the effects or safety of using LSSS instead of regular salt in children. 
What are the limitations of the evidence?  
We are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence was lowered mainly because of concerns about how some trials were conducted, and whether the results apply to the general population. We are not sure about the effects and safety of LSSS in children, pregnant women, people known to have a risk of high blood potassium, or those who do not have high blood pressure. We are also unsure about the effects of LSSS when used in foods not prepared at home. Further research may change these results. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to August 2021.

216,10.1002-14651858.CD013187-abstract.txt,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management, reduce morbidity and improve survival. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised to the skin but has potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue, while cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma have a much higher potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death. Exfoliative cytology is a non‐invasive test that uses the Tzanck smear technique to identify disease by examining the structure of cells obtained from scraped samples. This simple procedure is a less invasive diagnostic test than a skin biopsy, and for BCC it has the potential to provide an immediate diagnosis that avoids an additional clinic visit to receive skin biopsy results. This may benefit patients scheduled for either Mohs micrographic surgery or non‐surgical treatments such as radiotherapy. A cytology scrape can never give the same information as a skin biopsy, however, so it is important to better understand in which skin cancer situations it may be helpful. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of exfoliative cytology for detecting basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of standard diagnostic practice (visual inspection with or without dermoscopy). Secondary objectives were: to determine the diagnostic accuracy of exfoliative cytology for detecting cSCC, invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, and any other skin cancer; and for each of these secondary conditions to compare the accuracy of exfoliative cytology with visual inspection with or without dermoscopy in direct test comparisons; and to determine the effect of observer experience. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also studied the reference lists of published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies evaluating exfoliative cytology in adults with lesions suspicious for BCC, cSCC or melanoma, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). Where possible we estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. 
Main results
We synthesised the results of nine studies contributing a total of 1655 lesions to our analysis, including 1120 BCCs (14 datasets), 41 cSCCs (amongst 401 lesions in 2 datasets), and 10 melanomas (amongst 200 lesions in 1 dataset). Three of these datasets (one each for BCC, melanoma and any malignant condition) were derived from one study that also performed a direct comparison with dermoscopy. Studies were of moderate to poor quality, providing inadequate descriptions of participant selection, thresholds used to make cytological and histological diagnoses, and blinding. Reporting of participants' prior referral pathways was particularly poor, as were descriptions of the cytodiagnostic criteria used to make diagnoses. No studies evaluated the use of exfoliative cytology as a primary diagnostic test for detecting BCC or other skin cancers in lesions suspicious for skin cancer. Pooled data from seven studies using standard cytomorphological criteria (but various stain methods) to detect BCC in participants with a high clinical suspicion of BCC estimated the sensitivity and specificity of exfoliative cytology as 97.5% (95% CI 94.5% to 98.9%) and 90.1% (95% CI 81.1% to 95.1%). respectively. When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 clinically suspected BCC lesions with a median observed BCC prevalence of 86%, exfoliative cytology would miss 21 BCCs and would lead to 14 false positive diagnoses of BCC. No false positive cases were histologically confirmed to be melanoma. Insufficient data are available to make summary statements regarding the accuracy of exfoliative cytology to detect melanoma or cSCC, or its accuracy compared to dermoscopy. 
Authors' conclusions
The utility of exfoliative cytology for the primary diagnosis of skin cancer is unknown, as all included studies focused on the use of this technique for confirming strongly suspected clinical diagnoses. For the confirmation of BCC in lesions with a high clinical suspicion, there is evidence of high sensitivity and specificity. Since decisions to treat low‐risk BCCs are unlikely in practice to require diagnostic confirmation given that clinical suspicion is already high, exfoliative cytology might be most useful for cases of BCC where the treatments being contemplated require a tissue diagnosis (e.g. radiotherapy). The small number of included studies, poor reporting and varying methodological quality prevent us from drawing strong conclusions to guide clinical practice. Despite insufficient data on the use of cytology for cSCC or melanoma, it is unlikely that cytology would be useful in these scenarios since preservation of the architecture of the whole lesion that would be available from a biopsy provides crucial diagnostic information. Given the paucity of good quality data, appropriately designed prospective comparative studies may be required to evaluate both the diagnostic value of exfoliative cytology by comparison to dermoscopy, and its confirmatory value in adequately reported populations with a high probability of BCC scheduled for further treatment requiring a tissue diagnosis. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Skin Scrapings to Diagnose Skin Cancer

## Plain Title

Can scraping cells from the skin accurately diagnose skin cancer compared to taking a skin sample?

## Rationale

**What is skin cancer and why does it matter?**

Skin cancer comes in different types. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) usually stays in one place but can damage nearby skin. Squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma are more dangerous because they can spread to other parts of the body and may cause death. Finding skin cancer early helps doctors treat it better and helps patients live longer.

**What is the current way to diagnose skin cancer?**

Doctors usually look at suspicious spots on the skin. Sometimes they use a special magnifying tool called a dermoscope. To confirm skin cancer, doctors cut out a small piece of skin. This is called a biopsy. A lab then looks at this sample under a microscope. Patients must wait days or weeks for results.

**What is this study about?**

This study looked at a different test called exfoliative cytology. Doctors gently scrape cells from the skin surface instead of cutting out tissue. They look at these cells under a microscope right away. This test is simpler and less invasive than a biopsy. It does not require cutting the skin. Patients might get answers faster.

**Why might this test be useful?**

For some BCC cases, doctors might give results during the same visit. This could help patients who need certain treatments like radiation therapy or special surgery. However, scraping only gets surface cells. It cannot show as much detail as a full skin sample. Researchers wanted to know when this simpler test might work well enough.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was not a new experiment with patients. Instead, researchers looked at data from nine studies that were already done. They combined information from these studies to see how well the scraping test works.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included adults with skin spots that doctors thought might be cancer. The combined data included 1,655 skin spots. Of these, 1,120 were BCC, 41 were cSCC, and 10 were melanoma.

**What did researchers compare?**

Researchers compared the scraping test results to skin biopsy results. Biopsies are the standard way doctors confirm skin cancer. They checked how often the scraping test gave correct answers.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The scraping test worked well for BCC when doctors already strongly suspected BCC. The test correctly found BCC in about 98 out of 100 cases. It correctly ruled out BCC in about 90 out of 100 cases.

**What does this mean in real numbers?**

Imagine 1,000 skin spots that doctors think are BCC. About 860 of these actually are BCC. Using the scraping test, doctors would miss about 21 BCCs. They would incorrectly diagnose about 14 spots as BCC when they are not. None of the incorrectly diagnosed spots turned out to be melanoma.

**What about other skin cancers?**

There was not enough information to know if the scraping test works well for melanoma or cSCC. Only a few cases of these cancers were included in the studies.

**How does the scraping test compare to using a dermoscope?**

The researchers could not answer this question. Not enough studies compared these two methods directly.

**What are the limitations?**

The studies had several problems. Many did not clearly explain how they chose patients or how doctors made diagnoses. The studies only looked at spots that doctors already strongly suspected were cancer. No studies tested whether the scraping test works when doctors first examine suspicious spots.

**What do the researchers conclude?**

The scraping test might be useful for confirming BCC when doctors are already very sure it is BCC and need confirmation before certain treatments. The test is probably not useful for melanoma or cSCC because these cancers require looking at deeper tissue layers. More research with better study designs is needed before doctors can widely use this test.",10.1002-14651858.CD013187,"How accurate is exfoliative cytology ('skin scrape' cytology) for diagnosing basal cell carcinoma and other skin cancers in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer. The most common is basal cell carcinoma (BCC). BCC is a localised cancer that can grow and destroy the skin around it. They rarely spread into the body like other cancers can. Very small or superficial low‐risk BCCs can generally be treated with treatments such as creams rather than surgery, while it is better to surgically remove BCCs that are more likely to grow and spread. Radiotherapy (a treatment where radiation is used to kill cancer cells) can also be used if BCCs are very large or cannot be removed by surgery. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is also usually a localised skin cancer. In a small proportion of cases it can spread to other parts of the body, so the best treatment is to remove it using surgery. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer as it has a higher potential to spread to other parts of the body, and so it is vital to recognise it and remove it early. If people with BCC do not receive the correct diagnosis (known as a false negative test result), their treatment can be delayed, making the surgical procedure more complicated. Diagnosing BCC when it is actually something else (a false positive result) may result in unnecessary treatment, surgery or other investigations and can cause the patient stress and anxiety. If BCC is incorrectly diagnosed in an individual who actually has an cSCC or melanoma, effective treatment can be delayed and this might lead to a greater chance that the cSCC or melanoma spreads to other organs in the body, which can be very serious. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate a technique called 'exfoliative cytology' is for diagnosing skin cancer. Researchers in Cochrane found nine studies to answer this question. Nine studies were concerned with the diagnosis of BCC, two with the diagnosis of cSCC and one with the diagnosis of melanoma. 
What was studied in the review? 
Exfoliative cytology means scraping the surface of a possible skin cancer with a knife and then spreading a small layer of the scrape onto a glass slide so that the cells in the scrape can be stained and looked at under a microscope. It is less invasive than skin biopsy and quick to perform, with results available immediately. This could save patients an additional clinic visit to receive skin biopsy results. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review examined nine studies with a total of 1655 lesions (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) that were given these final diagnoses*: 1120 BCCs, 41 cSCCs and 10 melanomas. 
For identifying BCC, seven studies show the effect of using exfoliative cytology to confirm BCC in lesions that doctors already suspected were BCCs. In a group of 1000 such lesions, of which 860 (86%) actually do have BCC, then: 
‐ an estimated 853 people will have an exfoliative cytology result confirming that a BCC is present. Of these 14 (1.6%) will not actually have a BCC (false positive result); 
‐ of the 147 people with an exfoliative cytology result indicating that no BCC is present, 21 (14%) will in fact actually have a BCC (false negative result). 
One study compared the accuracy of exfoliative cytology to using a hand‐held microscope (dermoscopy) for making a diagnosis of BCC but used a different method of removing cells and included patients with a higher risk of melanoma than found in the other eight studies. 
There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of exfoliative cytology for diagnosing cSCC or melanoma. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The small number of studies included in this review, poor description of how patients were selected to be included in the study, and limited information on how the test results were used to make diagnoses, reduces the reliability of our results. 
The studies did not explain how patients had been referred to have the exfoliative cytology test. Most important of all, the test was only used in people in whom doctors had already diagnosed a BCC just by looking at the skin lesion. In other words, the test was being used to confirm a doctor's diagnosis. Most studies did not include enough people with skin lesions that are similar in appearance to a BCC to be sure that this test correctly identifies a BCC. This may cause exfoliative cytology to appear more accurate than it would be in actual practice. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in the UK, across Europe and in Australia. Study authors rarely described patient characteristics, such as age and location of the lesion. The percentage of people included in the studies with a final diagnosis of BCC ranged from 18% to 90% (nine studies). For cSCC it was 4% and 18% (two studies), and for melanoma it was 5% (one study). It was not possible to tell from the studies how clinicians had decided that study participants had lesions that could be a skin cancer. 
What are the implications of this review? 
No research has been done using exfoliative cytology to diagnose a skin cancer when a patient is first seen by a doctor. The results of this review suggest that exfoliative cytology can help to confirm BCC in patients with skin lesions that a doctor already suspects of being a BCC. This test could be useful for patients with BCCs that need non‐surgical treatments, such as radiotherapy, where a tissue diagnosis is needed before the treatment can be given. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.

Diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer of the lymphatic system. About 30% to 40% of people with DLBCL experience relapse and 10% are refractory to first‐line treatment usually consisting of R‐CHOP chemotherapy. Of those eligible for second‐line treatment, commonly consisting of salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem‐cell transplantation (ASCT), around 50% experience relapse. With a median overall survival of less than six to 12 months, the prognosis of individuals who relapse or are refractory (r/r) to advanced lines of treatment or of those who are ineligible for ASCT, is very poor. With the introduction of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell therapy, a novel treatment option for these people is available. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell therapy for people with relapsed or refractory (r/r) DLBCL. 
Search methods
An experienced information specialist performed a systematic database search for relevant articles on CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase until September 11th, 2020. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of identified studies up to this date. All search results were screened by two authors independently and a third author was involved in case of discrepancies. 
Selection criteria
We included prospectively planned trials evaluating CAR T‐cell therapy for people with r/r DLBCL. We had planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and we flexibly adapted eligibility criteria to the most reliable study designs available. We excluded studies involving fewer than 10 participants with r/r DLBCL and studies with a proportion of participants with r/r DLBCL below 70%, unless data were reported separately for this subgroup. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data and performed risk of bias ratings independently. A third author was involved in case of disagreements. As our search did not yield any completed RCTs, prospective controlled non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) or prospective observational studies with a control group, we did not meta‐analyse data and reported all results narratively. We adopted the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for prioritised outcomes. 
Main results
We identified 13 eligible uncontrolled studies evaluating a single or multiple arms of CAR T‐cell therapies. We also identified 38 ongoing studies, including three RCTs. Ten studies are awaiting classification due to completion with no retrievable results data or insufficient data to justify inclusion. The mean number of participants enrolled, treated with CAR T‐cell therapy and evaluated in the included studies were 79 (range 12 to 344; data unavailable for two studies), 61 (range 12 to 294; data unavailable for one study) and 52 (range 11 to 256), respectively. 
Most studies included people with r/r DLBCL among people with other haematological B‐cell malignancies. Participants had received at least a median of three prior treatment lines (data unavailable for four studies), 5% to 50% had undergone ASCT (data unavailable for five studies) and, except for two studies, 3% to 18% had undergone allogenic stem‐cell transplantation (data unavailable for eight studies). 
The overall risk of bias was high for all studies, in particular, due to incomplete follow‐up and the absence of blinding. None of the included studies had a control group so that no adequate comparative effect measures could be calculated. The duration of follow‐up varied substantially between studies, in particular, for harms. Our certainty in the evidence is very low for all outcomes. 
Overall survival was reported by eight studies (567 participants). Four studies reported survival rates at 12 months which ranged between 48% and 59%, and one study reported an overall survival rate of 50.5% at 24 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on overall survival. 
Two studies including 294 participants at baseline and 59 participants at the longest follow‐up (12 months or 18 months) described improvements of quality of life measured with the EuroQol 5‐Dimension 5‐Level visual analogue scale (EQ‐5D‐5L VAS) or Function Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Lymphoma (FACT‐Lym). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on quality of life. 
None of the studies reported treatment‐related mortality.
Five studies (550 participants) reported the occurrence of adverse events among participants, ranging between 99% and 100% for any grade adverse events and 68% to 98% for adverse events grade ≥ 3. In three studies (253 participants), 56% to 68% of participants experienced serious adverse events, while in one study (28 participants), no serious adverse events occurred. CAR T‐cell therapy may increase the risk of adverse events and serious adverse events but the evidence is very uncertain about the exact risk. 
The occurrence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was reported in 11 studies (675 participants) under use of various grading criteria. Five studies reported between 42% and 100% of participants experiencing CRS according to criteria described in Lee 2014. CAR T‐cell therapy may increase the risk of CRS but the evidence is very uncertain about the exact risk. 
Nine studies (575 participants) reported results on progression‐free survival, disease‐free survival or relapse‐free survival. Twelve‐month progression‐free survival rates were reported by four studies and ranged between 44% and 75%. In one study, relapse‐free survival remained at a rate of 64% at both 12 and 18 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on progression‐free survival. 
Thirteen studies (620 participants) provided data on complete response rates. At six months, three studies reported complete response rates between 40% and 45%. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on complete response rates. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence on the benefits and harms of CAR T‐cell therapy for people with r/r DLBCL is limited, mainly because of the absence of comparative clinical trials. The results we present should be regarded in light of this limitation and conclusions should be drawn very carefully. Due to the uncertainty in the current evidence, a large number of ongoing investigations and a risk of substantial and potentially life‐threatening complications requiring supplementary treatment, it is critical to continue evaluating the evidence on this new therapy. 
","# Plain Language Summary: CAR T-Cell Therapy for People with Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma

## Plain Title

Does CAR T-cell therapy help people whose diffuse large B-cell lymphoma has come back or stopped responding to treatment?

## Rationale

**What is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma?**

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a fast-growing cancer. It affects the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system helps fight infections in the body.

**What happens to people with this cancer?**

Doctors usually treat DLBCL with chemotherapy drugs called R-CHOP. About 3 to 4 out of 10 people see their cancer come back after treatment. For 1 out of 10 people, the first treatment does not work at all.

When the cancer comes back, doctors may try other treatments. These include different chemotherapy drugs and stem cell transplants. A stem cell transplant uses a person's own healthy cells. But about half of these people see their cancer return again.

**Why is this a problem?**

People whose cancer comes back multiple times or stops responding to treatment have very poor outcomes. Most live less than 6 to 12 months. These people need better treatment options.

**What is CAR T-cell therapy?**

CAR T-cell therapy is a new type of treatment. Doctors take immune cells from a person's blood. These are called T-cells. They change these cells in a lab to help them fight cancer. Then they put the changed cells back into the person's body.

**Why study this treatment?**

Researchers wanted to see if CAR T-cell therapy could help people with DLBCL that has come back or stopped responding to treatment.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Researchers looked at 13 different studies about CAR T-cell therapy. They searched medical databases until September 2020.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included people with DLBCL whose cancer had come back or stopped responding to treatment. Most people had tried at least three different treatments before. Some people had received stem cell transplants.

The studies included different numbers of people. The smallest study had 12 people. The largest had 344 people.

**What did the studies look at?**

None of these studies had a comparison group. All people in the studies received CAR T-cell therapy. This makes it hard to know if the treatment truly works better than other options.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time researchers followed people varied between studies. Some studies followed people for 12 months. One study followed people for 24 months.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers found very limited evidence. They could not be certain about the benefits or harms of CAR T-cell therapy. This is because none of the studies compared CAR T-cell therapy to other treatments.

**How long did people live?**

Eight studies looked at how long people lived. Four studies found that about 5 out of 10 people were alive at 12 months. One study found that about 5 out of 10 people were alive at 24 months. However, researchers are very uncertain about these results.

**Did quality of life improve?**

Two studies asked people about their quality of life. These studies suggested some improvement. But researchers are very uncertain about this finding.

**Did the cancer go away completely?**

Thirteen studies looked at whether the cancer disappeared completely. Three studies found that about 4 out of 10 people had no signs of cancer at six months. But researchers are very uncertain about these results.

**Did the cancer stay away?**

Nine studies looked at whether cancer came back. Four studies found that about 4 to 8 out of 10 people had no cancer growth at 12 months. Researchers are very uncertain about these results.

**What were the side effects?**

Almost all people had side effects. Between 7 and 10 out of 10 people had serious side effects.

A common side effect is called cytokine release syndrome. This happens when the immune system becomes too active. Between 4 and 10 out of 10 people experienced this problem. It can be life-threatening.

**What do the results mean?**

The researchers cannot say for certain whether CAR T-cell therapy helps people with DLBCL. More studies are needed. These studies should compare CAR T-cell therapy to other treatments.

CAR T-cell therapy can cause serious side effects. People considering this treatment need careful monitoring. Doctors must be ready to treat complications.

**What happens next?**

Researchers found 38 ongoing studies. Three of these compare CAR T-cell therapy to other treatments. These studies should provide better evidence in the future.",10.1002-14651858.CD013365,"CAR T‐cell therapy for people with diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma which returns after treatment or no longer responds to treatment 
Background 
Diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a fast‐growing cancer of the lymphatic system, an important part of the immune system. It affects blood cells that produce antibodies to fight infections. 
DLBCL is potentially curable. Most people with DLBCL respond well to initial therapies such as chemotherapy. For some people, the disease becomes refractory, which means it no longer responds to treatment, or it relapses, which means it returns after treatment. As a second‐line treatment, people with DLBCL can receive chemotherapy coupled with stem‐cell transplantation, but not all people are candidates for this therapy. From those who are, around 50% experience relapse after treatment. People who relapse or are refractory to advanced lines of treatment and those who are not candidates for a stem‐cell transplant have a very poor prognosis: Only half of them survive longer than six to 12 months. 
A promising treatment for these people is 'chimeric antigen receptor' (CAR) T‐cell therapy, which utilises the body's own immune cells (T‐cells) to fight DLBCL. T‐cells are removed from the person's blood, equipped with so‐called 'chimeric antigen receptors' (CARs), that help to recognise and destroy the cancer cells, in the laboratory and then delivered back into the person's blood. 
What was our aim? 
We wanted to explore whether CAR T‐cells are an effective treatment for people with DLBCL that returns after treatment (relapses) or no longer responds to treatment (is refractory). We also wanted to explore the frequency of unwanted effects associated with CAR T‐cell therapy. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all available clinical studies on treatment with CAR T‐cells for people with relapsed or refractory DLBCL to summarise the current evidence. We also evaluated the risk of bias in included studies and rated our confidence in the evidence. 
What did we find? 
We found 13 studies with information on 679 participants (who had received several prior lines of therapy) that received CAR T‐cell therapy. None of the studies had a control group. This means CAR T‐cells were not compared with another treatment. We decided not to meta‐analyse the study results and reported all results narratively. We also found 38 ongoing studies. 
What are the key results? 
Eight studies with 567 participants evaluated overall survival. After 12 months, around half of participants were alive in four studies. In one study, around half of participants were alive after 24 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on survival. 
Two studies (294 participants at study start; 59 participants at study end) reported that quality of life improved over time. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on quality of life. 
Deaths related to the therapy were not reported.
Five studies (550 participants) reported on adverse events. Almost all participants (99% to 100%) experienced some kind of adverse event (including mild events). Between 68% and 98% of participants had adverse events that were severe. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of adverse events but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
In three studies (253 participants), 56% to 68% of participants experienced serious adverse events, while in one study (28 participants), participants had no serious adverse events. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of serious adverse events but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
Eleven studies (675 participants) reported on the frequency of 'cytokine release syndrome' (CRS), an overreaction of the immune system that is typically seen in CAR T‐cell therapy. It includes fever and can include symptoms such as chills, muscle pain or dizziness. Several scales were used across the studies to describe CRS. In five studies using the same scale, between 42% and 100% of participants had CRS. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of CRS but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
Nine studies (575 participants) reported when DLBCL relapsed (returned) or progressed (got worse). Four studies reported that, at 12 months, DLBCL did not progress in 44% to 75% of participants. In one study, 64% of participants did not relapse at both 12, and 18 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on DLBCL relapse or progress. 
Thirteen studies (620 participants) reported how many participants had a complete response (all signs of cancer disappeared). In three studies, between 40% and 45% of participants experienced a complete response at six months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on complete response. 
What does this mean? 
The evidence on CAR T‐cells in the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL is very uncertain. This is mainly because, today, there are no direct comparisons of CAR T‐cells with other treatments. People who receive CAR T‐cells can have severe adverse events that require additional treatment. We identified many ongoing studies and some of them compare CAR T‐cells with standard care. We will keep evaluating the evidence on this novel therapy. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to September 2020.

Review question 
We set out to determine whether continuing to take antiplatelet drugs before non‐cardiac surgery that requires general, spinal or regional anaesthesia increases the risk of experiencing serious bleeding, ischaemic event or death in adults, when compared with stopping antiplatelet drugs for at least five days before non‐cardiac surgery. 
Background 
Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel reduce the risk of people getting blood clots, and are routinely prescribed for people who have had coronary stents inserted. They are also recommended for people with unstable angina or heart disease, or people who have had a heart attack, heart surgery or a stroke. Taking antiplatelet therapy introduces an increased risk of bleeding, which could lead to problems if a person needs non‐cardiac surgery. Stopping usual antiplatelet therapy a few days before surgery might reduce the risk of serious bleeding during surgery. Not taking these antiplatelet drugs could, however, increase the risk of a heart attack, stroke, or death. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence from randomized controlled trials is current to January 2018. We included five trials with 666 adults in the review. Three studies are ongoing. All participants were taking antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) at the start of the study. Two studies stopped antiplatelet drugs for at least five days before surgery, and three studies gave participants a placebo instead of antiplatelet therapy during this time. 
Key results 
We found low‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to the number of people who died up to 30 days or six months after surgery (five studies, 659 participants). We found moderate‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy probably makes little or no difference to incidences of bleeding serious enough to need a blood transfusion during or immediately after surgery (four studies, 368 participants). We found low‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to bleeding serious enough to need further surgery (four studies, 368 participants), and may make little or no difference to the number of ischaemic events such as stroke or heart attack (four studies, 616 participants). 
Quality of the evidence 
Some studies had low risk of bias because they had clearly reported their methods for randomizing people to each group, and three studies used a placebo agent so that people did not know whether or not they were continuing their usual antiplatelet therapy. However, we found few studies with few events, with wide variation in results. To continue or stop taking antiplatelet drugs for a few days before non‐cardiac surgery might make little or no difference to the number of people who died, who had bleeding that needed further surgery or who had ischaemic events, and it probably makes little or no difference to bleeding that needed a blood transfusion. We found three ongoing studies which will increase certainty in the effect in future updates of the review. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Should People Keep Taking Blood-Thinning Drugs Before Surgery That Is Not on the Heart?

## Rationale

**What are blood-thinning drugs and why do people take them?**

Some people take drugs called antiplatelet drugs. These include aspirin and clopidogrel. These drugs help stop blood clots from forming. Doctors give these drugs to people who have had heart problems. This includes people who have had heart attacks, strokes, or heart surgery. People with heart tubes called stents also take these drugs.

**What is the problem?**

These drugs make bleeding more likely. This could cause problems during surgery. Doctors must decide what to do before surgery. Should patients keep taking these drugs? Or should they stop taking them for a few days?

**Why is this choice hard?**

Stopping the drugs might reduce bleeding during surgery. But stopping might also cause heart attacks or strokes. Doctors need to know which choice is safer.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Researchers wanted to find out the best choice. They looked at whether continuing or stopping these drugs before surgery was safer. They wanted to help doctors make better decisions.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers study this question?**

Researchers looked at five studies. These studies included 666 adults. All these people were taking blood-thinning drugs. They all needed surgery that was not on the heart.

**What did the studies do?**

Some people kept taking their drugs before surgery. Other people stopped taking their drugs. They stopped at least five days before surgery. In three studies, some people got fake pills instead. This meant they did not know if they were taking real drugs or not.

**Who was in these studies?**

All people in the studies were adults. They were taking aspirin or clopidogrel. They all needed surgery with sleep medicine. This is called general, spinal, or regional anesthesia.

**How long did the studies last?**

Researchers watched people for up to six months after surgery. They looked for problems during and after surgery.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

The studies showed that both choices may be similar. Continuing or stopping the drugs may make little difference.

**Deaths:** Either choice may make little difference in deaths. This was true up to 30 days or six months after surgery. Five studies with 659 people showed this.

**Serious bleeding needing blood:** Either choice probably makes little difference. Four studies with 368 people showed this. About the same number of people needed blood transfusions in both groups.

**Bleeding needing more surgery:** Either choice may make little difference. Four studies with 368 people showed this. Few people needed more surgery for bleeding in either group.

**Heart attacks and strokes:** Either choice may make little difference. Four studies with 616 people showed this. About the same number of people had heart attacks or strokes in both groups.

**How sure are we of these results?**

The researchers are somewhat sure about the blood transfusion results. They are less sure about the other results. This is because there were only a few studies. The studies had small numbers of people. The results varied between studies.

**What does this mean?**

For most people, it may not matter much whether they continue or stop these drugs before surgery. The risks seem similar either way. However, doctors should still decide for each person. Each person's situation is different.

**What happens next?**

Three more studies are still happening. These will help researchers be more sure of the results. Future updates will include these new studies. This will give doctors better information to help their patients.",10.1002-14651858.CD012584,"To continue taking or to stop taking antiplatelet drugs for a few days before non‐cardiac surgery in adults

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effect of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Background 
CF affects approximately one in 3000 live births in white populations and causes frequent lung infection, due to mucus blocking the airways. Chest physiotherapy is often used to try to clear the mucus from the lungs. We wanted to discover whether using a PEP device (a form of chest physiotherapy) was better or worse than other other forms of chest physiotherapy for clearing the mucus from the lungs in people with CF. A PEP device provides positive pressure behind the mucus to try to push it out of the lungs. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 20 February 2019.
Study characteristics 
The review includes 28 studies with 788 people (from infants to adults) with CF with mild to severe lung disease. The studies compared PEP to other methods of chest physiotherapy; the length of treatment ranged from a single session to two years of treatment. 
Key results 
Generally, the efficacy of PEP is similar to other methods of chest physiotherapy such as postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, oscillatory PEP devices such as the flutter and acapella, thoracic oscillating devices such as the 'Vest', and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) (typically used for ventilatory support, but by changing the inspiratory and expiratory pressures on the device and combining it with huffing, BiPaP has been used for airway clearance). We found no difference between PEP and other forms of chest physiotherapy in lung function, the amount of mucus cleared from the airways or its related effects on the health of people with CF. However, the rate of flare ups of respiratory symptoms decreased in people using PEP compared to other forms of physiotherapy such as a vibrating PEP device or a vibrating vest. There was some evidence that people with CF may prefer PEP to other chest physiotherapy methods. There was no evidence of PEP causing harm, except in one study where infants performing either PEP or percussion in various positions which use gravity to help drain secretions, experienced some gastro‐oesophageal reflux (regurgitation of food) in head‐down positions; this was more severe in the group using postural drainage with percussion. In all the other trials PEP was performed in a sitting position. 
In 10 of the 28 studies studied single PEP treatment sessions. The results from these studies are very limited as they could not report on the number of respiratory infections and lung function did not change with just one treatment. Two one‐year studies compared PEP to postural drainage and percussion; in the study with children, PEP improved their lung function, while in the adult study, lung function declined slightly with both PEP and postural drainage and percussion. Also, the method of performing PEP was different in the two age groups. 
Although PEP seems to have an advantage in reducing flare ups (based on the combined results of a few studies), different physiotherapy techniques and devices may be more or less effective at varying times and in different individuals during baseline function and chest flare ups. Each person should talk to their clinician to help choose which method of airway clearance is best for them and which they will adhere to, so as to provide the best quality of life and long‐term outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
Some studies were of low quality. These studies highlight the difficulty in comparing studies using PEP compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy. Factors such as age and severity of lung disease in the participants may affect the results as well as the method of performing each treatment. Overall, the evidence provided by this review for whether PEP reduces flare ups compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy was moderate to high quality, but evidence for other outcomes was of very low to moderate quality, as results were limited. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using a Breathing Device to Clear Mucus from the Lungs in People with Cystic Fibrosis

## Plain Title
Does a Special Breathing Device Help Clear Mucus from the Lungs in People with Cystic Fibrosis?

## Rationale

### What is cystic fibrosis?
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that affects about 1 in 3,000 babies born in white populations. People with CF have thick, sticky mucus that blocks their airways. This mucus traps germs and causes frequent lung infections. Over time, these infections can damage the lungs and make breathing harder.

### What is chest physiotherapy?
Chest physiotherapy helps move mucus out of the lungs. There are many different ways to do this. One method uses a device called PEP (positive expiratory pressure). When a person breathes out through a PEP device, it creates pressure behind the mucus. This pressure helps push the mucus out of the lungs.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors wanted to know if PEP devices work better than other chest physiotherapy methods. They wanted to help people with CF find the best way to clear mucus from their lungs. This could help reduce lung infections and improve breathing.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at 28 different studies. They combined the results to see what worked best. This type of review is called a systematic review.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included 788 people with CF. These people ranged from babies to adults. Some had mild lung disease. Others had severe lung disease. Both males and females were included.

### What did the studies compare?
The studies compared PEP devices to other chest physiotherapy methods. These other methods included:
- Postural drainage with percussion (tapping on the chest while lying in different positions)
- Active cycle of breathing techniques (special breathing exercises)
- Autogenic drainage (another breathing technique)
- Flutter and acapella devices (handheld vibrating devices)
- Vibrating vests
- BiPaP machines (breathing machines that can help clear airways)

### How long did the studies last?
Some studies tested just one treatment session. Other studies lasted up to two years. Most people in the studies used their assigned method regularly during this time.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

#### Lung function and mucus clearance
PEP worked about the same as other chest physiotherapy methods. Researchers found no major difference in:
- How well the lungs worked
- How much mucus came out
- Overall health of people with CF

#### Lung infections and flare-ups
People using PEP had fewer flare-ups of breathing problems. A flare-up is when symptoms suddenly get worse. This was compared to people using vibrating devices or vibrating vests. This finding is important because fewer flare-ups mean better health.

#### What people preferred
Some people with CF liked using PEP better than other methods. When people like their treatment, they are more likely to use it every day.

#### Safety
PEP was safe to use. Researchers found no serious problems. In one study with babies, some reflux occurred (food coming back up). This happened more with postural drainage than with PEP. All other studies had people sit up while using PEP, which avoided this problem.

#### Long-term studies
Two studies lasted one year. In children, PEP improved lung function. In adults, lung function declined slightly with both PEP and other methods. The way PEP was used was different in children and adults.

### What do these results mean?
PEP is a safe and effective way to clear mucus. It works as well as other methods. It may reduce flare-ups better than some other methods. Different methods may work better for different people. What works best may also change over time.

### What should people do?
Each person with CF should talk with their doctor or physiotherapist. Together, they can choose the best method. The best method is one that:
- Works well for that person
- They will use every day
- Fits into their daily life
- Helps them feel their best

Generally, the efficacy of PEP is similar to other methods of chest physiotherapy such as postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, oscillatory PEP devices such as the flutter and acapella, thoracic oscillating devices such as the 'Vest', and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) (typically used for ventilatory support, but by changing the inspiratory and expiratory pressures on the device and combining it with huffing, BiPaP has been used for airway clearance). We found no difference between PEP and other forms of chest physiotherapy in lung function, the amount of mucus cleared from the airways or its related effects on the health of people with CF. However, the rate of flare ups of respiratory symptoms decreased in people using PEP compared to other forms of physiotherapy such as a vibrating PEP device or a vibrating vest. There was some evidence that people with CF may prefer PEP to other chest physiotherapy methods. There was no evidence of PEP causing harm, except in one study where infants performing either PEP or percussion in various positions which use gravity to help drain secretions, experienced some gastro‐oesophageal reflux (regurgitation of food) in head‐down positions; this was more severe in the group using postural drainage with percussion. In all the other trials PEP was performed in a sitting position. 
In 10 of the 28 studies studied single PEP treatment sessions. The results from these studies are very limited as they could not report on the number of respiratory infections and lung function did not change with just one treatment. Two one‐year studies compared PEP to postural drainage and percussion; in the study with children, PEP improved their lung function, while in the adult study, lung function declined slightly with both PEP and postural drainage and percussion. Also, the method of performing PEP was different in the two age groups. 
Although PEP seems to have an advantage in reducing flare ups (based on the combined results of a few studies), different physiotherapy techniques and devices may be more or less effective at varying times and in different individuals during baseline function and chest flare ups. Each person should talk to their clinician to help choose which method of airway clearance is best for them and which they will adhere to, so as to provide the best quality of life and long‐term outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
Some studies were of low quality. These studies highlight the difficulty in comparing studies using PEP compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy. Factors such as age and severity of lung disease in the participants may affect the results as well as the method of performing each treatment. Overall, the evidence provided by this review for whether PEP reduces flare ups compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy was moderate to high quality, but evidence for other outcomes was of very low to moderate quality, as results were limited.

Previous Cochrane Reviews have shown that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders. However, questions remain regarding the following: up‐to‐date evidence of the relative efficacy and acceptability of CBT compared to waiting lists/no treatment, treatment as usual, attention controls, and alternative treatments; benefits across a range of outcomes; longer‐term effects; outcomes for different delivery formats; and amongst children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and children with intellectual impairments. 
Objectives
To examine the effect of CBT for childhood anxiety disorders, in comparison with waitlist/no treatment, treatment as usual (TAU), attention control, alternative treatment, and medication. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (all years to 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (each to October 2019), international trial registries, and conducted grey literature searches. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of CBT that involved direct contact with the child, parent, or both, and included non‐CBT comparators (waitlist/no treatment, treatment as usual, attention control, alternative treatment, medication). Participants were younger than age 19, and met diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Primary outcomes were remission of primary anxiety diagnosis post‐treatment, and acceptability (number of participants lost to post‐treatment assessment), and secondary outcomes included remission of all anxiety diagnoses, reduction in anxiety symptoms, reduction in depressive symptoms, improvement in global functioning, adverse effects, and longer‐term effects. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 87 studies and 5964 participants in quantitative analyses.
Compared with waitlist/no treatment, CBT probably increases post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety diagnoses (CBT: 49.4%, waitlist/no treatment: 17.8%; OR 5.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.90 to 7.60; n = 2697, 39 studies, moderate quality); NNTB 3 (95% CI 2.25 to 3.57) and all anxiety diagnoses (OR 4.43, 95% CI 2.89 to 6.78; n = 2075, 28 studies, moderate quality). 
Low‐quality evidence did not show a difference between CBT and TAU in post‐treatment primary anxiety disorder remission (OR 3.19, 95% CI 0.90 to 11.29; n = 487, 8 studies), but did suggest CBT may increase remission from all anxiety disorders compared to TAU (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.46; n = 203, 5 studies). 
Compared with attention control, CBT may increase post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety disorders (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.89; n = 822, 10 studies, low quality) and all anxiety disorders (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.22 to 6.17; n = 378, 5 studies, low quality). 
There was insufficient available data to compare CBT to alternative treatments on post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety disorders, and low‐quality evidence showed there may be little to no difference between these groups on post‐treatment remission of all anxiety disorders (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.23; n = 401, 4 studies) 
Low‐quality evidence did not show a difference for acceptability between CBT and waitlist/no treatment (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.41; n=3158, 45 studies), treatment as usual (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.56; n = 441, 8 studies), attention control (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.49; n = 797, 12 studies) and alternative treatment (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.13; n=515, 7 studies). 
No adverse effects were reported across all studies; however, in the small number of studies where any reference was made to adverse effects, it was not clear that these were systematically monitored. 
Results from the anxiety symptom outcomes, broader outcomes, longer‐term outcomes and subgroup analyses are provided in the text. 
We did not find evidence of consistent differences in outcomes according to delivery formats (e.g. individual versus group; amount of therapist contact time) or amongst samples with and without ASD, and no studies included samples of children with intellectual impairments. 
Authors' conclusions
CBT is probably more effective in the short‐term than waiting lists/no treatment, and may be more effective than attention control. We found little to no evidence across outcomes that CBT is superior to usual care or alternative treatments, but our confidence in these findings are limited due to concerns about the amount and quality of available evidence, and we still know little about how best to efficiently improve outcomes. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Talking Therapy for Anxious Children

## Plain Title

Does talking therapy help children who feel very worried or anxious?

## Rationale

**What is anxiety in children?**

Some children feel very worried or scared much of the time. This is called anxiety. These feelings can be so strong that they make it hard for children to go to school, make friends, or do everyday things. Anxiety can make children feel sick or upset. It can affect their whole family.

**What is CBT?**

CBT stands for cognitive behavioral therapy. It is a type of talking therapy. In CBT, a trained person helps children understand their worried thoughts. They learn new ways to think and act when they feel scared. CBT can be done with just the child, or with parents too.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors want to know if CBT really helps anxious children. They want to know if it works better than other treatments. They also want to know if it keeps working over time. This study looked at many past research studies to find answers.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 87 different studies. These studies included 5,964 children total. The children were under 19 years old. All of them had been told by a doctor that they had an anxiety problem.

The researchers compared CBT to other options:
- Waiting lists (children got no treatment yet)
- Usual care (regular treatment from their doctor)
- Attention control (children got time with someone but not real therapy)
- Other types of treatment
- Medicine

The studies looked at whether children still had anxiety after treatment. They also looked at how many children dropped out. Some studies checked on children months or years later to see if they stayed better.

**What did researchers measure?**

They measured several things:
- Did the child's main anxiety problem go away?
- Did all of the child's anxiety problems go away?
- Did the child feel less worried?
- Did the child feel less sad?
- Could the child do daily activities better?
- Did any bad things happen from treatment?

## Results

**What were the main results?**

CBT probably helps children more than waiting for treatment. About half of children who got CBT (49 out of 100) no longer had their main anxiety problem. Only about 18 out of 100 children on waiting lists got better. This means CBT helped about 3 out of every 10 children who would not have gotten better otherwise.

CBT may work better than attention control. This means the therapy itself helps, not just spending time with a caring adult.

The researchers found little difference between CBT and usual care from doctors. They also found little difference between CBT and other types of therapy. However, there were not many studies comparing these treatments. More research is needed.

Most children stayed in treatment. About the same number of children dropped out of CBT as dropped out of other treatments.

No studies reported bad effects from CBT. However, most studies did not carefully check for problems.

**What does this mean?**

CBT probably helps anxious children feel better. It works better than doing nothing. For about 1 in 3 children, CBT helps them get over their anxiety when they would not have gotten better on their own.

CBT can be done in different ways. It can be one-on-one or in groups. It can involve parents or just children. The researchers did not find that one way worked much better than others.

The study shows CBT is a good choice for treating childhood anxiety. However, doctors still need to learn more about the best ways to help all anxious children.",10.1002-14651858.CD013162,"Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety in children and young people
Why is this review important? 
Many children and young people experience problems with anxiety. Children and young people with anxiety disorders are more likely than their peers to have difficulty with friendships, family life, and school, and to develop mental health problems later in life. Therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help children and young people to overcome difficulties with anxiety by using new ways of thinking and facing their fears. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Parents, children, and young people; people working in education and mental health services for children and young people; and general practitioners. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review updates and replaces previous Cochrane Reviews from 2005 and 2015, which showed that CBT is an effective treatment for children and young people with anxiety disorders. 
This review aimed to answer the following questions:
• Is CBT more effective than a waiting list or no treatment?
• Is CBT more effective than other treatments and medication?
• Does CBT help to reduce anxiety for children and young people in the longer term?
• Are some types of CBT more effective than others? (e.g. individual versus group therapy) 
• Is CBT effective for specific groups? (e.g. children with autism)
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched the databases to find all studies of CBT for anxiety disorders in children and young people published up to October 2019. In order to be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) and had to include young people under 19 years of age with an anxiety disorder diagnosis. We included 87 studies with a total of 5964 participants in the analysis. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
We rated the overall quality of the evidence as 'moderate’ or 'low'. There is evidence that CBT is more effective than a waiting list or no treatment in reducing anxiety in children and young people, although the findings did vary across studies. There is no clear evidence that CBT is more effective than other treatments. A small number of studies looked at outcomes six months after CBT was given and showed that reductions in anxiety continued. We found no clear evidence that one way of providing CBT is more effective than another (e.g. in a group, longer treatments, with parents) or that CBT is more or less effective for any specific group of children (e.g. children with autism spectrum disorders). 
What should happen next? 
Future research should compare CBT to alternative treatments and medication; identify who does and does not benefit from CBT and what those who do not benefit need; establish how to make CBT more accessible; and give far more consideration to neglected populations, including children and young people from low‐ and middle‐income countries.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease, with an estimated global prevalence ranging from 0.5% to 4.6%. Based on clinical features, psoriasis is generally divided into the following: chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP); psoriasis associated with psoriatic arthritis; and pustular, erythrodermic, or guttate psoriasis. We also considered psoriasis affecting the palms and soles (palmoplantar psoriasis, or PPP). Although psoriasis is rarely life‐threatening, it can affect a person's quality of life significantly. 
Phototherapy is an essential treatment option for people with psoriasis. The most commonly used types of phototherapy are narrow‐band ultraviolet B (NB‐UVB), broad‐band ultraviolet B (BB‐UVB), and psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy (PUVA). PUVA can be further divided into oral, bath, and topical PUVA according to the administrative route of psoralen. NB‐UVB delivers almost exclusively 311 nm radiation, whereas BB‐UVB can be divided into two types: selective BB‐UVB (305 to 325 nm radiation) and conventional BB‐UVB (280 to 320 nm radiation). 
This review included 13 small randomised controlled trials (RCT), with a total of 662 participants. Most of these were of poor methodological quality. 
For treating CPP, the clearance rate between the NB‐UVB and oral PUVA groups were inconsistent in three RCTs. In one, there was no difference between the groups, and in the other two, the clearance rate was in favour of oral PUVA. The evidence from the comparison of NB‐UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left‐right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the two groups, while another RCT favoured bath PUVA. 
Two RCTs found NB‐UVB plus retinoid (re‐NB‐UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re‐PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or guttate psoriasis. One RCT found no significant differences between NB‐UVB and selective BB‐UVB for clearing CPP or in the number of withdrawals due to side‐effects. 
In participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no statistically significant differences between NB‐UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate. 
In summary, NB‐UVB may be preferred to oral or bath PUVA because it is more convenient to use. NB‐UVB seemed to be equal to selective BB‐UVB for clearing CPP. Evidence regarding NB‐UVB and conventional BB‐UVB is limited. The long‐term safety of NB‐UVB needs to be confirmed. The efficacy of NB‐UVB for clearing PPP needs to be confirmed in future studies.

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Types of Light Therapy for Treating Psoriasis

## Rationale

**What is psoriasis?**
Psoriasis is a common skin disease that lasts a long time. Between 1 in 200 and 1 in 20 people around the world have it. The skin becomes red, thick, and scaly. Psoriasis rarely causes death. But it can make daily life much harder for people who have it.

**What are the different types of psoriasis?**
There are several types of psoriasis. The most common type is chronic plaque psoriasis. This causes raised, red patches covered with white scales. Other types include psoriasis with joint pain, pustular psoriasis (with pus-filled bumps), erythrodermic psoriasis (very red and widespread), and guttate psoriasis (small, drop-shaped spots). Psoriasis can also affect the palms of hands and soles of feet.

**What is light therapy?**
Light therapy, also called phototherapy, is an important treatment for psoriasis. It uses special light to help clear the skin. There are three main types: narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB), broad-band ultraviolet B (BB-UVB), and PUVA. PUVA combines a medicine called psoralen with ultraviolet A light. Psoralen can be taken as a pill, added to bath water, or applied to the skin.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors needed to know which type of light therapy works best. This study compared NB-UVB with other light treatments. The goal was to find out which treatment clears psoriasis better and is safer for patients.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 13 different studies. These studies included 662 people total. Each study was a randomized controlled trial. This means patients were put into different treatment groups by chance.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included adults with different types of psoriasis. Most had chronic plaque psoriasis. Some had guttate psoriasis or palmoplantar psoriasis (on hands and feet).

**What did the studies compare?**
The studies compared NB-UVB light therapy with other treatments. These included oral PUVA (psoralen pill plus light), bath PUVA (psoralen bath plus light), topical PUVA (psoralen cream plus light), and BB-UVB light therapy. Some studies also tested light therapy combined with a medicine called retinoid.

**Study quality**
Most of these studies were small. The quality of the studies was generally poor. This makes the results less certain.

## Results

**What did the studies find?**

**NB-UVB compared to oral PUVA:**
Three studies compared these treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis. The results were mixed. One study found no difference between the two. Two other studies found oral PUVA worked better at clearing the skin.

**NB-UVB compared to bath PUVA:**
Three studies looked at this comparison. The results were not consistent. Two studies found no major difference. One study found bath PUVA worked better.

**NB-UVB compared to BB-UVB:**
One study compared NB-UVB with selective BB-UVB. Both treatments worked about the same for clearing chronic plaque psoriasis. Side effects were similar in both groups.

**NB-UVB plus retinoid compared to PUVA plus retinoid:**
Two studies found these combination treatments worked about the same. This was true for both chronic plaque psoriasis and guttate psoriasis.

**NB-UVB for palmoplantar psoriasis:**
One study looked at psoriasis on hands and feet. It found no major difference between NB-UVB and topical PUVA.

**What do these results mean?**
NB-UVB may be a better choice than PUVA for most patients. It is easier to use. Patients do not need to take medicine or have special baths. NB-UVB seems to work as well as selective BB-UVB. More research is needed to know if NB-UVB is safe over many years. More studies are also needed to test NB-UVB for psoriasis on hands and feet.

**Important note:**
The studies were small and not high quality. This means we cannot be completely sure about these findings. Larger, better studies are needed in the future.",10.1002-14651858.CD009481,"Narrow‐band ultraviolet B phototherapy versus broad‐band ultraviolet B or psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy for treating psoriasis

Hepatorenal syndrome is defined as renal failure in people with cirrhosis in the absence of other causes. In addition to supportive treatment such as albumin to restore fluid balance, the other potential treatments include systemic vasoconstrictor drugs (such as vasopressin analogues or noradrenaline), renal vasodilator drugs (such as dopamine), transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and liver support with molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS). There is uncertainty over the best treatment regimen for hepatorenal syndrome. 
Objectives
To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for hepatorenal syndrome in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trial registers until December 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials on hepatorenal syndrome in people with cirrhosis. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in adults with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently identified eligible trials and collected data. The outcomes for this review included mortality, serious adverse events, any adverse events, resolution of hepatorenal syndrome, liver transplantation, and other decompensation events. We performed a network meta‐analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio (OR), rate ratio, hazard ratio (HR), and mean difference (MD) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available‐case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. 
Main results
We included a total of 25 trials (1263 participants; 12 interventions) in the review. Twenty‐three trials (1185 participants) were included in one or more outcomes. All the trials but two were at high risk of bias, and all the evidence was of low or very low certainty. The trials included participants with liver cirrhosis of varied aetiologies as well as a mixture of type I hepatorenal syndrome only, type II hepatorenal syndrome only, or people with both type I and type II hepatorenal syndrome. Participant age ranged from 42 to 60 years, and the proportion of females ranged from 5.8% to 61.5% in the trials that reported this information. The follow‐up in the trials ranged from one week to six months. Overall, 59% of participants died during this period and about 35% of participants recovered from hepatorenal syndrome. The most common interventions compared were albumin plus terlipressin, albumin plus noradrenaline, and albumin alone. 
There was no evidence of a difference in mortality (22 trials; 1153 participants) at maximal follow‐up between the different interventions. None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life. There was no evidence of differences in the proportion of people with serious adverse events (three trials; 428 participants), number of participants with serious adverse events per participant (two trials; 166 participants), proportion of participants with any adverse events (four trials; 402 participants), the proportion of people who underwent liver transplantation at maximal follow‐up (four trials; 342 participants), or other features of decompensation at maximal follow‐up (one trial; 466 participants). Five trials (293 participants) reported number of any adverse events, and five trials (219 participants) reported treatment costs. Albumin plus noradrenaline had fewer numbers of adverse events per participant (rate ratio 0.51, 95% CrI 0.28 to 0.87). Eighteen trials (1047 participants) reported recovery from hepatorenal syndrome (as per definition of hepatorenal syndrome). In terms of recovery from hepatorenal syndrome, in the direct comparisons, albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin plus octreotide had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome than albumin plus terlipressin (HR 0.04; 95% CrI 0.00 to 0.25 and HR 0.26, 95% CrI 0.07 to 0.80 respectively). There was no evidence of differences between the groups in any of the other direct comparisons. In the network meta‐analysis, albumin and albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome compared with albumin plus terlipressin. 
Funding: two trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies; five trials were funded by parties who had no vested interest in the results of the trial; and 18 trials did not report the source of funding. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on very low‐certainty evidence, there is no evidence of benefit or harm of any of the interventions for hepatorenal syndrome with regards to the following outcomes: all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events (proportion), number of serious adverse events per participant, any adverse events (proportion), liver transplantation, or other decompensation events. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that albumin plus noradrenaline had fewer 'any adverse events per participant' than albumin plus terlipressin. Low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence also found that albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome compared with albumin plus terlipressin. 
Future randomised clinical trials should be adequately powered; employ blinding, avoid post‐randomisation dropouts or planned cross‐overs (or perform an intention‐to‐treat analysis); and report clinically important outcomes such as mortality, health‐related quality of life, adverse events, and recovery from hepatorenal syndrome. Albumin plus noradrenaline and albumin plus terlipressin appear to be the interventions that should be compared in future trials. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Kidney Failure in People with Liver Scarring

## Plain Title
Comparing treatments for kidney failure in people with severe liver scarring

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
The liver is a large organ that helps clean the blood and digest food. Some people develop liver cirrhosis, which means their liver becomes scarred and stops working well. When the liver fails badly, it can cause the kidneys to stop working too. This is called hepatorenal syndrome.

### Why is this a problem?
When both the liver and kidneys fail, patients become very sick. Their body cannot clean waste from the blood. Fluid builds up in the wrong places. This condition can be life-threatening.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors have several ways to treat hepatorenal syndrome. They can give fluids called albumin. They can give drugs that tighten blood vessels. They can use special procedures. But doctors were not sure which treatment works best. This study looked at all the research to find the best treatment.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know which treatments help people live longer. They also wanted to know which treatments are safest. They hoped to find out which treatments help the kidneys start working again.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not a single study. Researchers looked at 25 different studies done by other doctors. These studies tested 12 different treatments. The researchers combined all the results together to see the big picture.

### Who was in these studies?
The studies included 1,263 adults with liver cirrhosis and kidney failure. Their ages ranged from 42 to 60 years old. Some studies had mostly men. Other studies had more women. About 1 in 10 to 6 in 10 patients were women.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies followed patients from one week to six months. Most patients were watched for several weeks or months.

### What treatments were tested?
The most common treatments were:
- Albumin alone (a protein fluid given through a vein)
- Albumin plus terlipressin (a drug that tightens blood vessels)
- Albumin plus noradrenaline (another drug that tightens blood vessels)

Other treatments included different drug combinations and special procedures.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**Survival:** About 6 out of 10 patients died during the studies. The researchers found no clear proof that any treatment helped people live longer than other treatments.

**Safety:** Most treatments seemed equally safe. However, albumin plus noradrenaline caused fewer side effects than albumin plus terlipressin.

**Kidney recovery:** About 1 in 3 patients had their kidneys start working again. Albumin plus terlipressin helped more people recover than albumin alone. Albumin plus terlipressin also worked better than albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide.

**Other outcomes:** The treatments seemed similar for liver transplant rates and other complications. No studies looked at quality of life.

### What does this mean?
The evidence was weak because the studies had problems with how they were done. Based on current research, albumin plus terlipressin may help kidneys recover better than some other treatments. Albumin plus noradrenaline may cause fewer side effects. But we cannot say for certain which treatment is best overall.

### What happens next?
Better studies are needed. Future studies should:
- Include more patients
- Follow patients longer
- Measure what matters to patients
- Compare albumin plus noradrenaline to albumin plus terlipressin

Doctors need more information before they can know the best way to treat this serious condition.",10.1002-14651858.CD013103,"Treatment of hepatorenal syndrome
What is the aim of this Cochrane review? 
To find out the best treatment for decreased kidney function (hepatorenal syndrome) in people with liver cirrhosis (a form of advanced liver disease with scarring of the liver) with complications. The authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 25 randomised controlled trials (participants receive the treatment based on method similar to coin toss or lottery; this is to ensure that the people who receive the different treatments are similar in all aspects except the treatment, so that any differences in the results between the treatments can be attributed to the treatment rather than differences in the type of people who received the treatment). During analysis of data, authors used standard Cochrane techniques, which allows comparison of two treatments at a time. Authors also used advanced techniques, that allow comparison of many treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network meta‐analysis' or 'multiple treatment comparisons'). The aim is to gather reliable evidence on the relative benefits and harms of the different treatments. 
Date of literature search December 2018 
Key messages Only two studies were conducted well. The remaining studies had one or more flaws. Therefore, there is high uncertainty in the results of the analysis. The authors could not recommend one treatment over another on the basis of risk of death, serious complications, percentage of people who developed any complication, percentage of participants who underwent liver transplantation (replacement of a diseased liver with a healthy one), or the number of other liver failure events. Health‐related quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. The number of complications of any severity was lower with albumin plus noradrenaline than albumin plus terlipressin. Recovery from hepatorenal syndrome may be lower with albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone than albumin plus terlipressin and albumin plus noradrenaline. 
Funding source was unclear in 18 studies. Industrial organisations funded two studies and the remaining five studies did not receive any funding from industrial organisations. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review studied people of any sex, age, and origin, having advanced liver disease due to various causes, and who had developed hepatorenal syndrome. People were administered different treatments. The review authors excluded studies with liver‐transplanted participants. Participants age, when reported, ranged from 42 to 60 years. The number of females ranged from 6 to 62 out of 100 in the studies that reported this information. The main treatments compared were albumin alone, albumin plus terlipressin, and albumin plus noradrenaline. The authors gathered and analysed data on death, quality of life, serious and non‐serious complications, time to liver transplantation, recovery from hepatorenal syndrome, and disappearance of symptoms. 
What were the main results of the review? 
The 25 studies included a small number of participants (1263 participants). Study data were sparse. Twenty‐three studies with 1185 participants provided data for analyses. The follow‐up in the trials ranged from one week to six months. The review shows that: 
‐ About 60 out of every 100 people died within three months, and 35 out of every 100 people recovered from hepatorenal syndrome. 
‐ The provided treatment may make no difference to the percentage of people who died or developed serious complications, number of serious complications per person, percentage of people who developed complications of any severity, or the percentage of people undergoing liver transplantation. 
‐ None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life.
‐ The number of complications of any severity was lower with albumin plus noradrenaline than albumin plus terlipressin. 
‐ Recovery from hepatorenal syndrome may be lower with albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone than albumin plus terlipressin and albumin plus noradrenaline. 
‐ We have very low confidence in the overall results.
‐ Future trials with proper design and quality are needed to clarify the best treatment for people with advanced liver disease having hepatorenal syndrome.

Uterine leiomyomas, also referred to as myomas or fibroids, are benign tumours arising from the smooth muscle cells of the myometrium. They are the most common pelvic tumour in women. The estimated rate of leiomyosarcoma, found during surgery for presumed benign leiomyomas, is about 0.51 per 1000 procedures, or approximately 1 in 2000. 
Treatment options for symptomatic uterine leiomyomas include medical, surgical, and radiologically‐guided interventions. Laparoscopic myomectomy is the gold standard surgical approach for women who want offspring, or otherwise wish to retain their uterus. A limitation of laparoscopy is the inability to remove large specimens from the abdominal cavity through the laparoscope. To overcome this challenge, the morcellation approach was developed, during which larger specimens are broken into smaller pieces in order to remove them from the abdominal cavity via the port site. However, intracorporeal power morcellation may lead to scattering of benign tissues, with the risk of spreading leiomyoma or endometriosis. In cases of unsuspected malignancy, power morcellation can cause unintentional dissemination of malignant cells, and lead to a poorer prognosis by upstaging the occult cancer. 
A strategy to optimise women's safety is to morcellate the specimens inside a bag. In‐bag morcellation may avoid the dissemination of tissue fragments. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of protected in‐bag extracorporeal manual morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy compared to intra‐abdominal uncontained power morcellation. 
Search methods
On 1 July 2019, we searched; the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialized Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, PubMed, Google Scholar, and two trials registers. 
We reviewed the reference lists of all retrieved full‐text articles, and contacted experts in the field for additional and ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing in‐bag extracorporeal manual morcellation versus intracorporeal uncontained power morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy in premenopausal women. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods.
Two review authors independently reviewed the eligibility of trials, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. Data were checked for accuracy. 
The summary measures were reported as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). 
The outcomes of interest were a composite of intraoperative and postoperative complications, operative times, ease of morcellation, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, conversion to laparotomy, and postoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. Results for the five main outcomes follow. 
Main results
We included two trials, enrolling 176 premenopausal women with fibroids, who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy. 
The experimental group received in‐bag manual morcellation, during which each enucleated myoma was placed into a specimen retrieval bag, and manually morcellated with scalpel or scissors. In the control group, intracorporeal uncontained power morcellation was used to reduce the size of the myomas. 
No intraoperative complications, including accidental morcellation of the liver, conversion to laparotomy, endoscopic bag disruption, bowel injury, bleeding, accidental injury to any viscus or vessel, were reported in either group in either trial. 
We found very low‐quality evidence of inconclusive results for total operative time (MD 9.93 minutes, 95% CI ‐1.35 to 21.20; 2 studies, 176 participants; I² = 35%), and ease of morcellation (MD ‐0.73 points, 95% CI ‐1.64 to 0.18; 1 study, 104 participants). The morcellation operative time was a little longer for the in‐bag manual morcellation group, however the quality of the evidence was very low (MD 2.59 minutes, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.72; 2 studies, 176 participants; I² = 0%). There were no postoperative diagnoses of leiomyosarcoma made in either group in either trial. 
We are very uncertain of any of these results. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to indirectness and imprecision, because of limited sites in high‐income settings and countries, small sample sizes, wide confidence intervals, and few events. 
Authors' conclusions
There are limited data on the effectiveness and safety of in‐bag morcellation at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy compared to uncontained power morcellation. We were unable to determine the effects of in‐bag morcellation on intraoperative complications as no events were reported in either group. We are uncertain if in‐bag morcellation improves total operative time or ease of morcellation compared to control. Regarding morcellation operative time, the quality of the evidence was also very low and we cannot be certain of the effect of in‐bag morcellation compared to uncontained morcellation. No cases of postoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma occurred in either group. We found only two trials comparing in‐bag extracorporeal manual morcellation to intracorporeal uncontained power morcellation at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy. Both trials had morcellation operative time as primary outcome and were not powered for uncommon outcomes such as intraoperative complications, and postoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. 
Large, well‐planned and executed trials are needed.
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Methods to Remove Uterine Fibroids During Surgery

## Plain Title
Comparing Two Ways to Cut and Remove Uterine Fibroids During Keyhole Surgery

## Rationale

**What are uterine fibroids?**
Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous growths in the womb. They grow from the muscle of the womb wall. Fibroids are very common in women. They are the most common growth found in the pelvis.

**Why is this a problem?**
Sometimes fibroids cause symptoms that bother women. When this happens, doctors may need to remove them. Most fibroids are not cancer. But rarely, about 1 in 2,000 times, what looks like a fibroid is actually cancer.

**How do doctors remove fibroids?**
Many women want to keep their womb to have children. For these women, doctors do keyhole surgery to remove just the fibroids. This is called laparoscopic myomectomy. The doctor makes small cuts in the belly instead of one large cut.

**What is the challenge?**
During keyhole surgery, fibroids must come out through very small openings. Large fibroids do not fit through these small holes. Doctors must cut the fibroids into smaller pieces first. This is called morcellation.

**What are the two methods?**
One method uses a power tool to cut the fibroid into pieces inside the belly. This is called power morcellation. The problem is that small pieces can scatter inside the belly. If the growth is actually cancer, these scattered pieces can spread the cancer. This makes the cancer harder to treat.

The other method puts the fibroid in a special bag first. Then doctors cut it by hand with a scalpel or scissors. This is called in-bag morcellation. The bag may stop pieces from scattering.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to know which method is safer and works better. They wanted to protect women from scattered tissue and possible cancer spread.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
Researchers looked at two studies. These studies compared the two cutting methods.

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included 176 women total. All women were premenopausal. This means they still had monthly periods. All women had fibroids. All women had keyhole surgery to remove their fibroids.

**What did the studies compare?**
Half the women had in-bag morcellation. Doctors put each fibroid in a bag. Then they cut it by hand with a scalpel or scissors.

The other half had power morcellation. Doctors used a power tool to cut fibroids inside the belly without a bag.

**What did researchers measure?**
Researchers looked at:
- Problems during surgery
- How long surgery took
- How easy it was to cut the fibroids
- How long women stayed in the hospital
- Pain after surgery
- Whether doctors found cancer

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**Problems during surgery:**
No problems happened in either group. No women had bleeding, organ injury, or other complications. No bags broke during in-bag morcellation. No women needed to switch to open surgery with a large cut.

**Surgery time:**
Total surgery time was similar for both methods. The difference was small and not certain. The time spent just cutting the fibroid was slightly longer with in-bag morcellation. It took about 3 extra minutes. But researchers are not certain about this finding.

**Ease of cutting:**
Both methods seemed similar in how easy they were. But researchers are not certain about this result.

**Cancer diagnosis:**
No women in either group were found to have cancer after surgery.

**Why are researchers uncertain?**
The studies were small. Only 176 women total took part. The studies were done in only a few places. The results do not give clear answers. More research is needed.

**What do the results mean?**
Researchers could not tell which method is better or safer. They need larger studies. These studies should include more women from more places. The studies need to look carefully at rare problems like cancer.

**Conclusions:**
Right now, there is not enough information to know if in-bag morcellation is better than power morcellation. Both methods seemed safe in these small studies. But the studies were too small to find rare problems. Doctors need more research to know the best way to protect women during fibroid surgery.",10.1002-14651858.CD013352,"In‐bag manual versus uncontained power morcellation for laparoscopic myomectomy
Review question 
Cochrane authors reviewed the effectiveness and safety of in‐bag manual morcellation compared to uncontained power morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy. The primary outcome of the review was a composite of intraoperative (during surgery) complications. 
Background 
Myomectomy is a surgical procedure to remove uterine fibroids — also called leiomyomas. These common, non‐cancerous growths usually develop in the uterus during childbearing years, but they can occur at any age. In laparoscopic myomectomy, which is a minimally invasive procedure, the surgeon accesses and removes the fibroids through several small abdominal incisions. 
Laparoscopic myomectomy is the gold standard for women with uterine leiomyomas, but it is difficult to remove large fibroids through the small incisions and tubes (laparoscopes). To overcome this challenge, surgeons developed a technique to break the large fibroids into smaller pieces (morcellation). 
However, power morcellation (using a drill‐like instrument to cut up the fibroids) inside the abdomen may lead to the scattering of the tissues. These tissues may be benign (such as fibroids or endometriosis), but they may also be tissues from an undiagnosed cancer. A strategy to optimise women's safety is to cut up larger fibroids with a scalpel or scissors, inside a bag. 
Study Characteristics 
We included two randomised controlled trials, which enrolled 176 premenopausal women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy; they were randomised to receive either in‐bag manual morcellation (87 women) or uncontained power morcellation (89 women). The literature was searched to 1 July 2019. 
Key results 
Neither study reported complications during or after surgery, including no diagnoses of leiomyosarcoma, for women in either group. 
We are very uncertain whether in‐bag morcellation reduces the total time of the operation, or improves the ease of morcellation. The evidence suggests that the morcellation operative time was slightly longer when the surgeon used in‐bag morcellation. However, the quality of the evidence is very low and we cannot be certain of any of these results. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low quality. The main limitations were indirectness (both trials took place in high‐income settings and countries, therefore, our findings are limited to this type of setting), and imprecision (both trials had small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals).

Background 
An arterial catheter is a thin tube or line that can be inserted into an artery. Arterial catheters are used to monitor blood pressure during complex surgeries and during stays in intensive care. Ultrasound imaging (an image created with sound waves of soft tissue) allows anaesthesiologists and intensivists to see surrounding structures. Ultrasound can help medical practitioners accurately locate the artery and insert the catheter, and, particularly when surgeries involve children, ultrasound can prevent the need for multiple needle sticks.

Our aim was to find out whether ultrasound offers any advantages over palpation of the artery or Doppler auditory assistance. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to January 2016. We found five eligible studies ‐ four comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. 
Key results 
We included in the review children aged one month to 18 years. We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas. Ultrasound also increased the success rate within two attempts. It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children. It is also likely that ultrasound is more useful if the practitioner is experienced in its use. 
Quality of the evidence 
We noted variation in the risk of bias of included studies. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate mainly because the number of studies was limited. For the same reason, we could not confirm the effect of age and expertise in ultrasound usage. 
Conclusions 
Our evidence suggests that ultrasound is superior to other techniques for arterial catheter insertion, particularly in babies and young children. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Using Ultrasound to Help Doctors Insert Tubes into Arteries in Children

## Rationale

### What is an arterial catheter and why is it needed?
An arterial catheter is a very thin tube that doctors put into an artery. An artery is a blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the body. Doctors use these tubes to watch blood pressure closely. This is important during big surgeries or when children are very sick in intensive care.

### What is the problem?
Putting these tubes into arteries can be hard, especially in children. Doctors usually find the artery by feeling for the pulse through the skin. Sometimes they use a special tool that makes sounds to help find the artery. These methods can take many tries. Each try means another needle stick for the child. Multiple needle sticks can cause problems. Blood can collect under the skin, called a haematoma. The artery can also get damaged.

### What did researchers want to find out?
Researchers wanted to know if ultrasound could help. Ultrasound uses sound waves to make pictures of what is inside the body. With ultrasound, doctors can see the artery and the area around it. This might help them put the tube in the right place more easily. The researchers thought ultrasound might work better than feeling for the pulse or using the sound tool.

### Why was this study needed?
Children need the best and safest care possible. If ultrasound works better, fewer children would need multiple needle sticks. This would mean less pain and fewer problems for children.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
The researchers looked at five different studies. Four studies compared ultrasound to feeling for the pulse. One study compared ultrasound to using the sound tool. They combined the results from all these studies.

### Who was in the studies?
The studies included children from one month old to 18 years old. These children needed arterial catheters for their medical care.

### What did the studies measure?
The researchers looked at several things. They counted how many times doctors got the tube in correctly on the first try. They also counted how many tries it took overall. They checked how often haematomas formed. They looked at whether the child's age mattered. They also checked if the doctor's experience with ultrasound made a difference.

### When was this research done?
The researchers looked at all studies published up to January 2016.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
Ultrasound helped doctors succeed more often on the first try. When doctors used ultrasound, they were more likely to get the tube in the artery correctly the first time. Ultrasound also helped doctors succeed within two tries. Fewer haematomas formed when doctors used ultrasound. This means less blood collected under the skin.

### Did ultrasound work better for some children?
Ultrasound seemed to help more with babies and small children. It may not help as much with older children. This makes sense because arteries in babies are very small and hard to find.

### Did the doctor's skill matter?
Doctors who had more practice using ultrasound seemed to do better. Experience with ultrasound appears to be important.

### How good was the evidence?
The researchers rated the evidence as moderate quality. This means the findings are fairly reliable. However, there were only five studies. More studies would make the evidence stronger. Because there were few studies, the researchers could not be completely sure about age and experience effects.

### What do the results mean?
The evidence shows that ultrasound works better than other methods. This is especially true for babies and young children. Using ultrasound means fewer needle sticks. It means less pain and fewer problems for children. Doctors should consider using ultrasound when putting arterial catheters in children.

### What did the researchers conclude?
Ultrasound is better than feeling for the pulse or using sound tools. It helps doctors insert arterial catheters more successfully. This is most helpful in babies and young children.",10.1002-14651858.CD011364,"Ultrasound use for insertion of arterial catheters in children

225,10.1002-14651858.CD013273-abstract.txt,"Background
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is vastly recommended as the first‐line analgesic for osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. However, there has been controversy about this recommendation given recent studies have revealed small effects of paracetamol when compared with placebo. Nonetheless, past studies have not systematically reviewed and appraised the literature to investigate the effects of this drug on specific osteoarthritis sites, that is, hip or knee, or on the dose used. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of paracetamol compared with placebo in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts to 3 October 2017, and ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal on 20 October 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing paracetamol with placebo in adults with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Major outcomes were pain, function, quality of life, adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and abnormal liver function tests. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors used standard Cochrane methods to collect data, and assess risk of bias and quality of the evidence. For pooling purposes, we converted pain and physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function) scores to a common 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability) scale. 
Main results
We identified 10 randomised placebo‐controlled trials involving 3541 participants with hip or knee osteoarthritis. The paracetamol dose varied from 1.95 g/day to 4 g/day, and the majority of trials followed participants for three months only. Most trials did not clearly report randomisation and concealment methods and were at unclear risk of selection bias. Trials were at low risk of performance, detection, and reporting bias. 
At 3 weeks' to 3 months' follow‐up, there was high‐quality evidence that paracetamol provided no clinically important improvements in pain and physical function. Mean reduction in pain was 23 points (0 to 100 scale, lower scores indicated less pain) with placebo and 3.23 points better (5.43 better to 1.02 better) with paracetamol, an absolute reduction of 3% (1% better to 5% better, minimal clinical important difference 9%) and relative reduction of 5% (2% better to 8% better) (seven trials, 2355 participants). Physical function improved by 12 points on a 0 to 100 scale (lower scores indicated better function) with placebo and was 2.9 points better (0.95 better to 4.89 better) with paracetamol, an absolute improvement of 3% (1% better to 5% better, minimal clinical important difference 10%) and relative improvement of 5% (2% better to 9% better) (7 trials, 2354 participants). 
High‐quality evidence from eight trials indicated that the incidence of adverse events was similar between groups: 515/1586 (325 per 1000) in the placebo group versus 537/1666 (328 per 1000, range 299 to 360) in the paracetamol group (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.11). There was less certainty (moderate‐quality evidence) around the risk of serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and the rate of abnormal liver function tests, due to wide CIs or small event rates, indicating imprecision. Seventeen of 1480 (11 per 1000) people treated with placebo and 28/1729 (16 per 1000, range 8 to 29) people treated with paracetamol experienced serious adverse events (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.53; 6 trials). The incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 65/1000 participants in with placebo and 77/1000 (range 59 to 100) participants with paracetamol (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.55; 7 trials). Abnormal liver function occurred in 18/1000 participants treated with placebo and 70/1000 participants treated with paracetamol (RR 3.79, 95% CI 1.94 to 7.39), but the clinical importance of this effect was uncertain. None of the trials reported quality of life. 
Subgroup analyses indicated that the effects of paracetamol on pain and function did not differ according to the dose of paracetamol (3.0 g/day or less versus 3.9 g/day or greater). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on high‐quality evidence this review confirms that paracetamol provides only minimal improvements in pain and function for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis, with no increased risk of adverse events overall. Subgroup analysis indicates that the effects on pain and function do not differ according to the dose of paracetamol. Due to the small number of events, we are less certain if paracetamol use increases the risk of serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and rate of abnormal liver function tests. 
Current clinical guidelines consistently recommend paracetamol as the first‐line analgesic medication for hip or knee osteoarthritis, given its low absolute frequency of substantive harm. However, our results call for reconsideration of these recommendations. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Does Paracetamol Help People with Hip or Knee Osteoarthritis?

## Plain Title

Testing if Paracetamol Works for Hip and Knee Arthritis Pain

## Rationale

**What is osteoarthritis?**

Osteoarthritis is a common joint problem. It happens when the cushion inside joints wears down over time. This causes pain and makes it hard to move. Many people get osteoarthritis in their hips or knees. It can make daily tasks like walking or climbing stairs very hard.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors often tell patients to take paracetamol first for arthritis pain. Paracetamol is also called acetaminophen. It is a common pain medicine. Many people take it because doctors say it is safe.

But some new studies show paracetamol may not work very well for arthritis. No one had looked closely at all the research together. The researchers wanted to find out if paracetamol really helps people with hip or knee arthritis.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

The researchers wanted to know if paracetamol works better than a fake pill (called a placebo). They looked at how much it helped with pain. They also checked if it helped people move better. And they wanted to see if paracetamol caused any harm.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at 10 studies that were already done. They combined all the results together. This helps show a clearer picture.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 3,541 adults with hip or knee arthritis. The studies tested different amounts of paracetamol each day. Some people took about 2 grams per day. Others took up to 4 grams per day.

**How long did the studies last?**

Most studies lasted about 3 months. Some were as short as 3 weeks.

**What did researchers measure?**

They measured pain levels on a scale from 0 to 100. Zero meant no pain at all. One hundred meant the worst pain possible. They also measured how well people could move and do daily tasks. They used the same type of scale (0 to 100).

## Results

**What did the study find about pain relief?**

Paracetamol helped pain only a tiny bit. People taking fake pills had their pain drop by 23 points. People taking paracetamol had their pain drop by about 26 points. That is only 3 points better.

Doctors say pain needs to drop by at least 9 points to really matter to patients. So this 3-point difference is too small to feel.

**What did the study find about movement and function?**

Paracetamol helped movement only a tiny bit too. People taking fake pills improved by 12 points. People taking paracetamol improved by about 15 points. That is only 3 points better.

Doctors say function needs to improve by at least 10 points to really matter. So this 3-point difference is too small to notice.

**Did higher doses work better?**

No. Taking more paracetamol did not work better than taking less. The results were the same for low and high doses.

**Was paracetamol safe?**

Most people did not have problems with paracetamol. About the same number of people had side effects with paracetamol and fake pills. About 328 out of 1,000 people in each group had side effects.

The researchers were less sure about serious problems. Not many people had serious problems in either group. So it was hard to tell if paracetamol caused more serious problems.

One concern was liver problems. More people taking paracetamol had abnormal liver tests. About 70 out of 1,000 people taking paracetamol had this problem. Only 18 out of 1,000 people taking fake pills had this problem. But researchers do not know if this causes real harm.

**What do these results mean?**

Paracetamol does not help much with arthritis pain or movement. The benefit is too small for patients to feel. Right now, doctors tell patients to try paracetamol first. These results suggest doctors should rethink this advice.

Paracetamol seems mostly safe for most people. But it does not work well enough to be worth taking for arthritis.",10.1002-14651858.CD013273,"Paracetamol for treating people with hip or knee osteoarthritis
Background 
Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee is a progressive disabling disease affecting many people worldwide. Although paracetamol is widely used as a treatment option for this condition, recent studies have called into question how effective this pain relief medication is. 
Search date 
This review includes all trials published up to 3 October 2017.
Study characteristics 
We included randomised clinical trials (where people are randomly put into one of two treatment groups) looking at the effects of paracetamol for people with hip or knee pain due to osteoarthritis against a placebo (a 'sugar tablet' that contains nothing that could act as a medicine). We found 10 trials with 3541 participants. On average, participants in the study were aged between 55 and 70 years, and most presented with knee osteoarthritis. The treatment dose ranged from 1.95 g/day to 4 g/day of paracetamol and participants were followed up between one and 12 weeks in all but one study, which followed people up for 24 weeks. Six trials were funded by companies that produced paracetamol. 
Key results 
Compared with placebo tablets, paracetamol resulted in little benefit at 12 weeks.
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improved by 3% (1% better to 5% better), or 3.2 points (1 better to 5.4 better) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale. 
• People who took paracetamol reported that their pain improved by 26 points.
• People who took placebo reported that their pain improved by 23 points.
Physical function (lower scores mean better function) 
Improved by 3% (1% better to 5% better), or 2.9 points (1.0 better to 4.9 better) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale. 
• People who took paracetamol reported that their function improved by 15 points.
• People who had placebo reported that their function improved by 12 points.
Side effects (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
No more people had side effects with paracetamol (3% less to 3% more), or 0 more people out of 100. 
• 33 out of 100 people reported a side effect with paracetamol.
• 33 out of 100 people reported a side effect with placebo.
Serious side effects (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
1% more people had serious side effects with paracetamol (0% less to 1% more), or one more person out of 100. 
• Two out of 100 people reported a serious side effect with paracetamol.
• One out of 100 people reported a serious side effect with placebo.
Withdrawals due to adverse events (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
1% more people withdrew from treatment with paracetamol (1% less to 3% more), or one more person out of 100. 
• Eight out of 100 people withdrew from paracetamol treatment.
• Seven out of 100 people withdrew from placebo treatment.
Abnormal liver function tests (up to 12 to 24 weeks): 
5% more people had abnormal liver function tests (meaning there was some inflammation or damage to the liver) with paracetamol (1% more to 10% more), or five more people out of 100. 
• Seven out of 100 people had an abnormal liver function test with paracetamol.
• Two out of 100 people had an abnormal liver function test with placebo.
Quality of the evidence 
High‐quality evidence indicated that paracetamol provided only minimal improvements in pain and function for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis, with no increased risk of adverse events overall. None of the studies measured quality of life. Due to the small number of events, we were less certain if paracetamol use increased the risk of serious side effects, increased withdrawals due to side effects, and changed the rate of abnormal liver function tests. However, although there may be more abnormal liver function tests with paracetamol, the clinical implications are unknown.

Review question 
This review assessed the evidence for providing successful local anaesthesia that prevents pain during a dental procedure. Included studies compared injections of local anaesthetic to help people requiring dental treatment and to prevent painful sensations tested in an experimental way (such as using cold, a sharp probe, or an electric stimulus). 
Background 
An injection of local anaesthetic prevents a person from feeling pain. It is given in one specific area rather than in the whole body. Although pain during dental treatment can be successfully managed, it is a common fear of patients. 
Several different local anaesthetics are available to dentists, as well as a variety of ways to deliver them, to prevent pain. Factors that appear to influence success include increased difficulty in anaesthetizing teeth in the presence of inflammation, variable susceptibility of different teeth to local anaesthesia, different operative procedures performed on the tooth (for example, it appears easier to achieve successful anaesthesia for dental extractions than for root canal treatment), and various techniques and solutions used to give the local anaesthetic. 
We investigated whether injection of one local anaesthetic solution was more effective than another for preventing pain during dental treatment or during an experimental study, and whether this effect occurred quickly or lasted a sufficient length of time, if any unwanted effects occurred, and people’s experience of the dental procedures. Local adverse events might include pain during or after injection, or long‐lasting anaesthesia. Systemic effects due to the local anaesthetic solution can include allergic reactions and changes in heart rate and blood pressure. 
Study characteristics 
Two reviewers searched the literature to identify studies that compared different local anaesthetic solutions injected into people undergoing dental treatment or volunteers who had the same outcomes measured in experimental ways. Within every trial, each person was randomly assigned to receive one of the local anaesthetics under study. The search was up‐to‐date as of 31 January 2018. 
We found 123 trials with 19,223 male and female participants. These trials investigated pain experienced during dental treatment including surgery, extraction, periodontal (gum) treatment, tooth preparation, root canal treatment, anaesthesia of nerves within teeth (pulps) tested using an electric pulp tester or cold stimulant, and anaesthesia of soft tissues measured following pricking of gums or self‐reported by the participant. We pooled data from 68 studies (6615 participants). This resulted in eight outcomes when seven different local anaesthetic solutions were tested during dental treatment, two outcomes assessing pain during and after injection of local anaesthetic, and 47 outcomes tested with a pulp tester or by pricking of gums or self‐reported by participants. 
Key results 
The review suggests that of the 14 types of local anaesthetic tested, evidence to support the use of one over another is limited to the outcome of success (absence of pain), from three comparisons of local anaesthetic. Findings show that 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine in posterior teeth with inflamed pulps requiring root canal treatment. No difference between these solutions was seen when pain on injection was assessed, and although lidocaine resulted in less post‐injection pain, the difference was minimal. Researchers found that 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 3% prilocaine, 0.03 IU felypressin and 4% prilocaine plain for surgical procedures and surgical procedures/periodontal treatment, respectively. Speeds of onset were within clinically acceptable times, and durations were variable, making them suitable for different applications. Both of these latter outcomes were tested in experimental ways that may not reflect clinical findings. Unwanted effects were rare. Patients' experience of the procedures was not assessed owing to lack of data. 
Quality of the evidence 
From comparisons of local anaesthetics in this review, all appeared effective and safe with little difference between them. Available evidence ranged from moderate to very low in quality. Some studies fell short, in terms of quality, owing to small numbers of participants, unclear reporting of study methods, and reporting of data in a format that was not easy to combine with other data. Further research is required to clarify the effectiveness and safety of one local anaesthetic over another.

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Numbing Injections Used by Dentists to Prevent Pain During Dental Work

## Rationale

**What is the condition and why does it matter?**
Many people fear pain during dental treatment. This fear can stop them from getting the dental care they need. Pain during dental work is a big problem for patients.

**What are numbing injections?**
Dentists use numbing injections to stop pain. These are called local anesthetics. They make one area of the mouth numb so patients do not feel pain during dental work.

**Why was this study needed?**
Dentists can choose from many different numbing medicines. They can also give these medicines in different ways. Some things make numbing harder to achieve. These include swollen or infected teeth, the type of tooth being treated, and the kind of dental work being done. For example, pulling a tooth may be easier to numb than doing root canal work.

**What did researchers want to find out?**
Researchers wanted to know if one numbing medicine works better than another. They looked at whether the medicine stopped pain, how fast it worked, and how long it lasted. They also checked for unwanted effects and tried to learn about patients' experiences.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 123 studies. These studies included 19,223 men and women. Each study tested different numbing medicines against each other. In each study, people were randomly given one of the numbing medicines being tested.

**What did the studies include?**
The studies looked at different types of dental work. This included surgery, tooth removal, gum treatment, tooth preparation, and root canal treatment. Some studies tested numbness using special tools. These tools used cold, sharp probes, or small electric pulses. Other studies asked people to report if they felt numb.

**How long did the studies last?**
The review looked at studies published up to January 2018. Individual study lengths varied based on the dental procedure.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**
Researchers tested 14 types of numbing medicines. They found limited evidence that one medicine works better than another. Most numbing medicines worked well and were safe.

**Which medicines worked best?**
Three main findings stood out:

First, 4% articaine with epinephrine worked better than 2% lidocaine with epinephrine. This was true for back teeth with swollen nerves needing root canal work. Both medicines caused similar pain during injection. Lidocaine caused slightly less pain after injection, but the difference was very small.

Second, 2% lidocaine with epinephrine worked better than 3% prilocaine with felypressin for surgical procedures.

Third, 2% lidocaine with epinephrine worked better than 4% prilocaine plain for surgery and gum treatment.

**How fast did the medicines work?**
The medicines worked fast enough for dental use. They lasted different amounts of time. This makes them useful for different types of dental work.

**Were there side effects?**
Unwanted effects were rare. This means the medicines were safe.

**What about patient experience?**
Researchers could not assess how patients felt about the procedures. The studies did not provide enough information about this.

**What do these results mean?**
All the numbing medicines tested appeared to work well. They were safe to use. There was little difference between most of them.

**What is the quality of this evidence?**
The quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. Some studies had problems. They included too few people or did not clearly explain their methods. Some results were hard to combine with other studies. More research is needed to better understand which numbing medicine works best.

**Final conclusion:**
Dentists have many good numbing medicines to choose from. Most work well and are safe. For some specific situations, certain medicines may work slightly better than others.",10.1002-14651858.CD006487,"Injectable local anaesthetic agents for preventing pain in participants requiring dental treatment

## Plain Title
Do Fertility Drugs Increase the Risk of Ovarian Cancer in Women Being Treated for Infertility?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Some women have trouble getting pregnant. This is called subfertility or infertility. Doctors have used special drugs to help these women since the 1960s. These drugs help the body release eggs so pregnancy can happen.

**Why is this important?**
Doctors are not sure if these fertility drugs are completely safe. Some worry the drugs might cause cancer in the ovaries. The ovaries are two small organs in a woman's body that make eggs. Research has already shown that women who cannot get pregnant easily have a higher risk of ovarian cancer, even without taking any drugs.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors needed to know if fertility drugs make ovarian cancer more likely. This would help women and their doctors make better choices about treatment. The researchers wanted to compare women who took fertility drugs to women who did not take these drugs.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was not a single new study. Instead, researchers looked at 37 studies that had already been done. They combined all the information from these studies. This type of review is called a systematic review.

**Who was included?**
The 37 studies included a total of 4,684,724 women. All these women had trouble getting pregnant. Some of them took fertility drugs. Others did not take these drugs.

**What did researchers compare?**
The researchers looked at how many women got ovarian cancer in different groups. They compared:
- Women who took fertility drugs to women in the general population
- Women who took fertility drugs to women with infertility who did not take these drugs

**How long did the studies last?**
Different studies followed women for different amounts of time. Some studies followed women for only a short time. Others followed women for many years.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**
Overall, the researchers did not find strong proof that fertility drugs cause ovarian cancer. The evidence was not clear enough to say these drugs are dangerous.

However, some smaller findings showed possible concerns:
- In 12 studies from the United States, women using fertility drugs had a slightly higher risk of ovarian cancer
- This risk was higher in women who never gave birth compared to women who had children
- One study found that women who took a drug called progesterone for more than four treatment cycles had twice the risk of a certain type of ovarian tumor. But very few women were in this group.
- One study suggested that a drug called clomiphene citrate might increase risk of borderline ovarian tumors

**Were the studies good quality?**
Many of the studies that showed increased risk had problems. They did not follow women long enough. They did not account for other important factors that affect cancer risk. This makes their results less reliable.

Newer studies were better. They included more information about how much drug was used and how many treatment cycles women had. This made their results more trustworthy.

**What do the results mean?**
The researchers concluded that infertility itself is an important risk factor for ovarian cancer. But they could not say for certain whether fertility drugs add extra risk.

**What else matters?**
Many other factors affect ovarian cancer risk. These include:
- A woman's age
- Her weight
- Whether she has had children
- Family history of ovarian cancer
- The reason for her infertility

Future studies need to consider all these factors. They also need to follow women for longer periods of time.

**Final conclusion**
Based on current evidence, doctors cannot say that fertility drugs clearly increase ovarian cancer risk. Women with infertility already have higher risk. More research with better methods is needed to answer this question fully.",10.1002-14651858.CD008215,"Is there an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with drugs for subfertility?

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors (COX‐I) may prevent PDA‐related complications. Controversy exists on which COX‐I drug is the most effective and has the best safety profile in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic COX‐I drugs and 'no COXI prophylaxis' in preterm infants using a Bayesian network meta‐analysis (NMA). 
Search methods
Searches of Cochrane CENTRAL via Wiley, OVID MEDLINE and Embase via Elsevier were conducted on 9 December 2021. We conducted independent searches of clinical trial registries and conference abstracts; and scanned the reference lists of included trials and related systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled preterm or low birth weight infants within the first 72 hours of birth without a prior clinical or echocardiographic diagnosis of PDA and compared prophylactic administration of indomethacin or ibuprofen or acetaminophen versus each other, placebo or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. We used the GRADE NMA approach to assess the certainty of evidence derived from the NMA for the following outcomes: severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), mortality, surgical or interventional PDA closure, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), gastrointestinal perforation, chronic lung disease (CLD) and cerebral palsy (CP). 
Main results
We included 28 RCTs (3999 preterm infants). Nineteen RCTs (n = 2877) compared prophylactic indomethacin versus placebo/no treatment, 7 RCTs (n = 914) compared prophylactic ibuprofen versus placebo/no treatment and 2 RCTs (n = 208) compared prophylactic acetaminophen versus placebo/no treatment. Nine RCTs were judged to have high risk of bias in one or more domains.We identified two ongoing trials on prophylactic acetaminophen. 
Bayesian random‐effects NMA demonstrated that prophylactic indomethacin probably led to a small reduction in severe IVH (network RR 0.66, 95% Credible Intervals [CrI] 0.49 to 0.87; absolute risk difference [ARD] 43 fewer [95% CrI, 65 fewer to 16 fewer] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; moderate‐certainty), a moderate reduction in mortality (network RR 0.85, 95% CrI 0.64 to 1.1; ARD 24 fewer [95% CrI, 58 fewer to 16 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐4; moderate‐certainty) and surgical PDA closure (network RR 0.40, 95% CrI 0.14 to 0.66; ARD 52 fewer [95% CrI, 75 fewer to 30 fewer] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐2; moderate‐certainty) compared to placebo. Prophylactic indomethacin resulted in trivial difference in NEC (network RR 0.76, 95% CrI 0.35 to 1.2; ARD 16 fewer [95% CrI, 42 fewer to 13 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; high‐certainty), gastrointestinal perforation (network RR 0.92, 95% CrI 0.11 to 3.9; ARD 4 fewer [95% CrI, 42 fewer to 137 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐3; moderate‐certainty) or CP (network RR 0.97, 95% CrI 0.44 to 2.1; ARD 3 fewer [95% CrI, 62 fewer to 121 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; low‐certainty) and may result in a small increase in CLD (network RR 1.10, 95% CrI 0.93 to 1.3; ARD 36 more [95% CrI, 25 fewer to 108 more] per 1000; median rank 3, 95% CrI 1‐3; low‐certainty). 
Prophylactic ibuprofen probably led to a small reduction in severe IVH (network RR 0.69, 95% CrI 0.41 to 1.14; ARD 39 fewer [95% CrI, 75 fewer to 18 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐4; moderate‐certainty) and moderate reduction in surgical PDA closure (network RR 0.24, 95% CrI 0.06 to 0.64; ARD 66 fewer [95% CrI, from 82 fewer to 31 fewer] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐2; moderate‐certainty) compared to placebo. Prophylactic ibuprofen may result in moderate reduction in mortality (network RR 0.83, 95% CrI 0.57 to 1.2; ARD 27 fewer [95% CrI, from 69 fewer to 32 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐4; low‐certainty) and leads to trivial difference in NEC (network RR 0.73, 95% CrI 0.31 to 1.4; ARD 18 fewer [95% CrI, from 45 fewer to 26 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐3; high‐certainty), or CLD (network RR 1.00, 95% CrI 0.83 to 1.3; ARD 0 fewer [95% CrI, from 61 fewer to 108 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; low‐certainty). The evidence is very uncertain on effect of ibuprofen on gastrointestinal perforation (network RR 2.6, 95% CrI 0.42 to 20.0; ARD 76 more [95% CrI, from 27 fewer to 897 more] per 1000; median rank 3, 95% CrI 1‐3; very low‐certainty). 
The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of prophylactic acetaminophen on severe IVH (network RR 1.17, 95% CrI 0.04 to 55.2; ARD 22 more [95% CrI, from 122 fewer to 1000 more] per 1000; median rank 4, 95% CrI 1‐4; very low‐certainty), mortality (network RR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.16 to 1.4; ARD 82 fewer [95% CrI, from 135 fewer to 64 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐4; very low‐certainty), or CP (network RR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.01 to 6.3; ARD 70 fewer [95% CrI, from 109 fewer to 583 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐3; very low‐certainty). 
In summary, based on ranking statistics, both indomethacin and ibuprofen were equally effective (median ranks 2 respectively) in reducing severe IVH and mortality. Ibuprofen (median rank 1) was more effective than indomethacin in reducing surgical PDA ligation (median rank 2). However, no statistically‐significant differences were observed between the COX‐I drugs for any of the relevant outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Prophylactic indomethacin probably results in a small reduction in severe IVH and moderate reduction in mortality and surgical PDA closure (moderate‐certainty), may result in a small increase in CLD (low‐certainty) and results in trivial differences in NEC (high‐certainty), gastrointestinal perforation (moderate‐certainty) and cerebral palsy (low‐certainty). Prophylactic ibuprofen probably results in a small reduction in severe IVH and moderate reduction in surgical PDA closure (moderate‐certainty), may result in a moderate reduction in mortality (low‐certainty) and trivial differences in CLD (low‐certainty) and NEC (high‐certainty). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acetaminophen on any of the clinically‐relevant outcomes. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Medicines to Prevent Heart Problems in Premature Babies

## Plain Title

Can medicines given early prevent heart and brain problems in babies born too soon?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Babies born too early (premature babies) often have a heart problem. A blood vessel near the heart called the ductus arteriosus should close after birth. In premature babies, it often stays open. Doctors call this patent ductus arteriosus or PDA.

When this blood vessel stays open, it can cause serious problems. These include bleeding in the brain, breathing problems, and even death. The open blood vessel makes the baby's heart and lungs work too hard.

**Why was this study needed?**

Some doctors give medicine right after birth to close this blood vessel. This is called prevention or prophylaxis. Three types of medicine might work: indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen.

Doctors disagree about which medicine works best. They also want to know if these medicines are safe. Some medicines might cause side effects like gut problems.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to find out which medicine works best to prevent problems. They compared giving medicine early versus giving no medicine. They looked at which babies stayed healthier.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 28 studies done by other scientists. These studies included 3,999 premature babies total.

The babies in these studies were born too early or were very small. They were given medicine within the first 3 days of life. The babies did not yet have PDA problems when the medicine started.

The studies compared:
- 19 studies tested indomethacin (2,877 babies)
- 7 studies tested ibuprofen (914 babies)  
- 2 studies tested acetaminophen (208 babies)

Some babies got medicine. Other babies got a fake medicine (placebo) or no medicine.

Researchers used special methods to compare all the studies together. This helped them see which medicine worked best.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

**Indomethacin (a common prevention medicine):**

This medicine probably helps in several ways:
- Reduces serious brain bleeding by a small amount
- Reduces deaths by a moderate amount
- Reduces need for surgery to close the blood vessel

The medicine causes very little difference in:
- Gut problems called NEC
- Holes in the gut
- Brain damage called cerebral palsy

The medicine may slightly increase breathing problems called chronic lung disease.

**Ibuprofen (another prevention medicine):**

This medicine probably helps by:
- Reducing serious brain bleeding by a small amount
- Reducing need for surgery to close the blood vessel

The medicine may reduce deaths by a moderate amount.

The medicine causes very little difference in:
- Gut problems called NEC
- Breathing problems

Researchers are very uncertain if ibuprofen causes holes in the gut.

**Acetaminophen (a third medicine):**

Researchers are very uncertain about whether this medicine helps or causes problems. Not enough babies were studied yet.

**Which medicine works best?**

Both indomethacin and ibuprofen work about equally well for preventing brain bleeding and death. Ibuprofen may work slightly better for preventing surgery. However, the differences between medicines were small.

**What does this mean?**

Giving indomethacin or ibuprofen early to premature babies probably helps prevent some serious problems. These medicines reduce brain bleeding and the need for surgery. They may reduce deaths. The medicines appear mostly safe, though indomethacin may slightly increase breathing problems.

More research is needed on acetaminophen before doctors know if it helps.

Doctors can use this information to decide whether to give these medicines to premature babies right after birth.",10.1002-14651858.CD013846,"Prophylactic cyclo‐oxygenase inhibitor drugs to prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants 
 
Review question 
Among the available cyclo‐oxygenase inhibitor (COX‐I) drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen), which one is the safest and most effective in preventing death and poor outcomes in preterm infants when given prophylactically without the prior knowledge of the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) within the first 72 hours after birth? 
Background 
A PDA is a common complication in preterm or low‐birth weight infants. PDA is an open vascular channel between the lungs and the heart which usually closes shortly after birth. In preterm infants, the PDA frequently remains open and may contribute to life‐threatening complications. COX‐I drugs such as indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen may prevent a PDA and related poor outcomes. Controversy exists on which of the three COX‐I drugs, if any, improves clinical outcomes in preterm infants. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in preterm babies (born at less than 37 weeks into pregnancy) or low‐birthweight (weighing less than 2500 grams) infants where COX‐I drugs were given without the prior knowledge of the presence of a PDA, within the first 72 hours after birth. The included studies compared administration of indomethacin or ibuprofen or acetaminophen versus each other, placebo or no treatment.  
Key results 
This review of 28 clinical trials (3999 preterm infants) found that prophylactic indomethacin probably results in a small reduction in severe brain bleeding, a moderate reduction in death and need for PDA surgery, and may result in a small increase in chronic lung disease. Prophylactic indomethacin likely results in trivial differences in necrotizing enterocolitis, gastrointestinal perforation and cerebral palsy. Prophylactic ibuprofen probably results in a small reduction in severe brain bleeding and a moderate reduction in need for PDA surgery. Prophylactic ibuprofen may result in a moderate reduction in death and trivial differences in chronic lung disease and necrotizing enterocolitis. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acetaminophen on any of the clinically relevant outcomes.There are currently two ongoing trials on prophylactic use of acetaminophen. 
Certainty of the evidence 
According to GRADE (a method to score the certainty of the trials supporting each outcome), the certainty of the evidence varied from very low to high but was moderate for the most important outcomes of severe brain bleeding and death. 
How up to date is the search evidence 
The search is up to date as of 9 December 2021.

Posterior blepharitis is common and causes ocular surface and lid damage as well as discomfort. It affects 37% to 47% of all ophthalmology patients; its incidence increasing with age. It is a multifactorial disease associated with multiple other pathologies, such as rosacea, meibomianitis, and infections. Treatment usually focuses on reliefing the symptoms by using artificial tears, lid scrubs, and warm compresses. The condition may be notoriously difficult to manage adequately once it becomes chronic. One such management approach for chronic blepharitis is the use of oral antibiotics for both their antibacterial as well as anti‐inflammatory properties. There are currently no guidelines regarding the use of oral antibiotics, including antibiotic type, dosage, and treatment duration, for the treatment of chronic blepharitis. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of oral antibiotic use for people with chronic blepharitis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 29 August 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral antibiotics with placebo in adult participants with chronic blepharitis (including staphylococcal, seborrhoeic, or Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD)). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology and graded the certainty of the body of evidence for six outcomes using the GRADE classification. 
Main results
We included two studies with 220 participants (numbers of eyes unclear). One parallel‐group RCT comparing oral doxycycline (40 mg once a day) with placebo enrolled 70 participants with blepharitis and facial rosacea in the USA. Follow‐up duration was three months. One three‐arm RCT conducted in South Korea investigated the effect of high‐dose (200 mg twice a day) and low‐dose (20 mg twice a day) doxycycline versus placebo after one month of study medication. It enrolled 50 participants with chronic MGD in each study arm (i.e. 150 participants enrolled in total). 
The two studies did not evaluate the same outcome measurements, which precluded any meta‐analysis. The evidence for the effect of oral antibiotics on subjective improvement in symptoms was very uncertain. One study suggested that there was little to no effect of oral doxycycline on subjective symptoms based on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores ranging from 0 to 100 (higher score indicates worse condition) (mean difference (MD) 3.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) −4.61 to 11.71; n = 70) and bulbar conjunctival hyperemia ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) (MD −0.01, 95% CI −0.38 to 0.36; n = 70) at 12 weeks. The three‐arm RCT showed that oral doxycycline may slightly improve number of symptoms (MD −0.56, 95% CI −0.95 to −0.17; n = 93 (high‐dose doxycycline versus placebo); MD −0.48, 95% CI −0.86 to −0.10; n = 93 (low‐dose doxycycline versus placebo)) and proportion of participants with symptom improvement (risk ratio (RR) 6.13, 95% CI 2.61 to 14.42; n = 93 (high‐dose doxycycline versus placebo); RR 6.54, 95% CI 2.79 to 15.30; n = 93 (low‐dose doxycycline versus placebo)) at one month, but the evidence is very uncertain. We judged the certainty of evidence for subjective symptoms as very low. 
One study evaluated aqueous tear production by Schirmer's test (mm/5 min) (higher score indicates better condition) and tear film stability by measuring tear film break‐up time (TBUT) in seconds (higher score indicates better condition) at one month. We found very low certainty evidence that oral doxycycline may improve these clinical signs. The estimated MD in Schirmer's test score after one month of treatment was 4.09 mm (95% CI 2.38 to 5.80; n = 93) in the high‐dose doxycycline group versus the placebo group and 3.76 mm (95% CI 1.85 to 5.67; n = 93) in the low‐dose doxycycline group versus the placebo group. The estimated MD in TBUT after one month was 1.58 seconds (95% CI 0.57 to 2.59; n = 93) when comparing the high‐dose doxycycline group with the placebo group, and 1.70 seconds (95% CI 0.96 to 2.44; n = 93) when comparing the low‐dose doxycycline group with the placebo group. Although there was a noted improvement in these scores, their clinical importance remains uncertain. 
One study suggested that oral doxycycline may increase the incidence of serious side effects: 18 (39%) participants in the high‐dose doxycycline group, 8 (17%) in the low‐dose doxycycline group, and 3 (6%) out of 47 participants in the placebo group experienced serious side effects (RR 6.13, 95% CI 1.94 to 19.41; n = 93 (high‐dose doxycycline versus placebo); RR 2.72, 95% CI 0.77 to 9.64; n = 93 (low‐dose doxycycline versus placebo)). Additionally, one study reported that one case of migraine headache and five cases of headache were observed in the oral doxycycline group, and one case of non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma was observed in the placebo group. We judged the certainty of evidence for adverse events as very low. 
Authors' conclusions
There was insufficient evidence to draw any meaningful conclusions on the use of oral antibiotics for chronic blepharitis. Very low certainty evidence suggests that oral antibiotics may improve clinical signs, but may cause more adverse events. The evidence for the effect of oral antibiotics on subjective symptoms is very uncertain. Further trials are needed to provide high quality evidence on the use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of chronic blepharitis. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Oral Antibiotics for Chronic Blepharitis

## Plain Title

Do oral antibiotics help people with long-lasting eyelid inflammation?

## Rationale

**What is chronic blepharitis?**

Blepharitis is a condition where the eyelids become inflamed (red and swollen). This causes discomfort and can damage the eye surface and eyelids. When this condition lasts a long time, it is called chronic blepharitis.

**How common is this condition?**

This condition is very common. About 37 to 47 out of every 100 people who visit eye doctors have it. Older people get it more often than younger people.

**Why is this condition a problem?**

Blepharitis can cause many problems. The eyes may feel uncomfortable, look red, or produce tears differently than normal. Many things can cause this condition, including skin conditions like rosacea and problems with the oil glands in the eyelids.

**How is blepharitis usually treated?**

Doctors usually treat the symptoms with eye drops, eyelid cleaning, and warm compresses. However, these treatments do not always work well when the condition becomes chronic. The condition can be very hard to manage over time.

**Why study oral antibiotics?**

Some doctors give patients pills called oral antibiotics. These pills can kill bacteria and reduce inflammation. However, doctors do not have clear guidelines about which antibiotic to use, how much to give, or how long treatment should last.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to find out if oral antibiotics actually help people with chronic blepharitis. They also wanted to know if these pills cause harmful side effects.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked for high-quality studies that compared oral antibiotics to placebo pills (pills with no medicine). They found two studies with 220 people total.

**Who was in these studies?**

All participants were adults with chronic blepharitis. One study included 70 people who also had rosacea (a skin condition). The other study included 150 people with problems in their eyelid oil glands.

**What treatment did people receive?**

Both studies tested a medicine called doxycycline. One study gave people 40 mg once a day. The other study tested two doses: a high dose (200 mg twice a day) and a low dose (20 mg twice a day). Some people received placebo pills instead.

**How long did the studies last?**

One study lasted three months. The other study lasted one month.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The two studies measured different things, making it hard to combine their results.

**Did symptoms improve?**

The evidence was very uncertain. One study found little to no improvement in how people felt or how red their eyes looked after three months. The other study suggested that doxycycline might slightly reduce the number of symptoms after one month. However, researchers were not confident in these findings.

**Did clinical measurements improve?**

One study measured tear production and how long tears stayed on the eye surface. People taking doxycycline showed some improvement in these measurements after one month. However, doctors are not sure if these improvements actually matter to patients.

**Were there side effects?**

Yes. In one study, side effects were common:
- 18 out of 46 people taking high-dose doxycycline had serious side effects
- 8 out of 47 people taking low-dose doxycycline had serious side effects
- 3 out of 47 people taking placebo had serious side effects

Some people had headaches or migraines. One person in the placebo group developed a serious illness called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

**What do the results mean?**

The researchers could not make clear conclusions. The evidence quality was very low. Oral antibiotics might improve some eye measurements, but they may also cause more side effects. It is unclear if oral antibiotics actually help people feel better.

**What is needed next?**

More high-quality studies are needed. These studies should help doctors understand when and how to use oral antibiotics for chronic blepharitis.",10.1002-14651858.CD013697,"Treating long‐lasting blepharitis (swollen and itchy eyelids): how well do antibiotics (medicines that kill bacteria) work when taken by mouth (orally)? 
Key messages· We did not find enough evidence to show how well antibiotics taken by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
· One antibiotic tested may improve some clinical aspects (symptoms and course of the disease), but we are uncertain about its benefit in this respect, and it may also cause a higher number of unwanted effects. 
· More studies are needed to find out how well antibiotics taken by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What is blepharitis?Blepharitis is a common condition affecting the eyes. It causes swelling and redness on the edges of the eyelids, making them feel sore, and an itching or a gritty feeling in the eyes. The most common causes of blepharitis are infection by a type of bacteria that lives on the surface of the eye, or skin conditions such as dermatitis. 
How is blepharitis treated?Blepharitis is usually treated by regularly cleaning the eyelids, or using a cream or eye drops containing an antibiotic (a type of medicine that kills bacteria). If these do not work, then taking antibiotics by mouth (orally) is often tried. However, there are no guidelines about which type of antibiotic to give, what dose to use, or how long treatment should last. 
What did we want to find out?We wanted to find out how well antibiotics given by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that tested antibiotics given by mouth to treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What did we find?We found 2 studies in 220 adults with long‐lasting blepharitis. One study took place in the USA and lasted for three months; it tested the antibiotic doxycycline compared to placebo treatment (a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain any medicine but looks identical to the medicine being tested). The other study took place in South Korea and tested the effects of high or low doses of doxycycline compared to placebo treatment. 
One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company; the other study did not report a source of funding. The studies measured results of treatment in different ways, so it was not possible to combine the studies' results to analyse them together. 
What are the main results of our review?We are uncertain about the effects of doxycycline on symptoms such as itching, burning, and watery eyes, as evaluated by people taking part in the studies. 
One study measured changes in how much an affected eye watered (produced tears) before and after one month of treatment. High‐ and low‐dose doxycycline may improve the eye's ability to produce tears (evidence from 1 study with 93 people in each dose group). 
One study evaluated dryness of the eye by measuring the time it took for a dry spot to appear on the surface of the eye after blinking (the 'tear film break‐up time'). Taking doxycycline (high‐ and low‐dose) for one month may improve problems with dryness (evidence from 1 study with 93 people in each dose group). 
Taking doxycycline for one month may cause more unwanted effects than taking a placebo (evidence from 1 study in 139 people). The number of unwanted effects reported was higher in the high‐dose doxycycline group. 
No studies measured:
· how many bacteria were present in the eye before or after treatment;
· people's well‐being (quality of life); or
· the costs and benefits of the treatments tested.
What are the limitations of the evidence?We have very low confidence in the evidence because of limitations in the ways the studies were conducted, and because the results of the studies varied widely and were inconsistent. One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company, which could have affected the way the study was designed, conducted, and reported. Further research is likely to change and increase our confidence in the results. 
How up‐to‐date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 29 August 2020.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of beta‐blockers to influence perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus routine prescription of these drugs in an unselected population remains a controversial issue. A previous version of this review assessing the effectiveness of perioperative beta‐blockers in cardiac and non‐cardiac surgery was last published in 2018. The previous review has now been split into two reviews according to type of surgery. This is an update, and assesses the evidence in non‐cardiac surgery only. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of perioperatively administered beta‐blockers for the prevention of surgery‐related mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing non‐cardiac surgery. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis Previews and Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science on 28 June 2019. We searched clinical trials registers and grey literature, and conducted backward‐ and forward‐citation searching of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs and quasi‐randomized studies comparing beta‐blockers with a control (placebo or standard care) administered during the perioperative period to adults undergoing non‐cardiac surgery. If studies included surgery with different types of anaesthesia, we included them if 70% participants, or at least 100 participants, received general anaesthesia. We excluded studies in which all participants in the standard care control group were given a pharmacological agent that was not given to participants in the intervention group, studies in which all participants in the control group were given a beta‐blocker, and studies in which beta‐blockers were given with an additional agent (e.g. magnesium). We excluded studies that did not measure or report review outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. 
Main results
We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 participants; we found no quasi‐randomized studies. All participants were undergoing non‐cardiac surgery, and types of surgery ranged from low to high risk. Types of beta‐blockers were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. In nine studies, beta‐blockers were titrated according to heart rate or blood pressure. Duration of administration varied between studies, as did the time at which drugs were administered; in most studies, it was intraoperatively, but in 18 studies it was before surgery, in six postoperatively, one multi‐arm study included groups of different timings, and one study did not report timing of drug administration. Overall, we found that more than half of the studies did not sufficiently report methods used for randomization. All studies in which the control was standard care were at high risk of performance bias because of the open‐label study design. Only two studies were prospectively registered with clinical trials registers, which limited the assessment of reporting bias. In six studies, participants in the control group were given beta‐blockers as rescue therapy during the study period. 
The evidence for all‐cause mortality at 30 days was uncertain; based on the risk of death in the control group of 25 per 1000, the effect with beta‐blockers was between two fewer and 13 more per 1000 (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.54; 16 studies, 11,446 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Beta‐blockers may reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction by 13 fewer incidences per 1000 (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.87; 12 studies, 10,520 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found no evidence of a difference in cerebrovascular events (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.81; 6 studies, 9460 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or in ventricular arrhythmias (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.47; 5 studies, 476 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation or flutter by 26 fewer incidences per 1000 (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; 9 studies, 9080 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, beta‐blockers may increase bradycardia by 55 more incidences per 1000 (RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.74 to 3.56; 49 studies, 12,239 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and hypotension by 44 more per 1000 (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.51; 49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
We downgraded the certainty of the evidence owing to study limitations; some studies had high risks of bias, and the effects were sometimes altered when we excluded studies with a standard care control group (including only placebo‐controlled trials showed an increase in early mortality and cerebrovascular events with beta‐blockers). We also downgraded for inconsistency; one large, well‐conducted, international study found a reduction in myocardial infarction, and an increase in cerebrovascular events and all‐cause mortality, when beta‐blockers were used, but other studies showed no evidence of a difference. We could not explain the reason for the inconsistency in the evidence for ventricular arrhythmias, and we also downgraded this outcome for imprecision because we found few studies with few participants. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence for early all‐cause mortality with perioperative beta‐blockers was uncertain. We found no evidence of a difference in cerebrovascular events or ventricular arrhythmias, and the certainty of the evidence for these outcomes was low and very low. We found low‐certainty evidence that beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarctions. However, beta‐blockers may increase bradycardia (low‐certainty evidence) and probably increase hypotension (moderate‐certainty evidence). Further evidence from large placebo‐controlled trials is likely to increase the certainty of these findings, and we recommend the assessment of impact on quality of life. We found 18 studies awaiting classification; inclusion of these studies in future updates may also increase the certainty of the evidence. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Beta-Blocker Medications Given Around the Time of Non-Heart Surgery

## Plain Title
Do beta-blocker drugs help prevent death and health problems in adults having surgery that is not on the heart?

## Rationale

**What are beta-blockers and why might they help?**

Beta-blockers are drugs that slow down the heart rate and lower blood pressure. Doctors sometimes give these drugs to people having surgery.

**Why was this study needed?**

Surgery can put stress on the heart and blood vessels. This stress can cause serious problems like heart attacks or death. Some doctors think beta-blockers might protect the heart during surgery. However, past studies have shown mixed results. Some studies found beta-blockers helpful, while others did not. Doctors are not sure if they should give beta-blockers to all people having surgery.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if beta-blockers help prevent death and health problems in adults having surgery that is not on the heart.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at 83 different studies that had already been done. These studies included 14,967 people in total.

**Who was in these studies?**

All people in the studies were adults having surgery that was not on the heart. The types of surgery ranged from low-risk to high-risk operations.

**What did the studies compare?**

Some people got beta-blocker drugs. Other people got either a fake pill (placebo) or standard care without beta-blockers. The studies used different types of beta-blockers. These included drugs with names like propranolol, metoprolol, and esmolol.

**When were the drugs given?**

The timing varied between studies. Most studies gave the drugs during surgery. Some gave them before surgery. A few gave them after surgery.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time people were in the studies varied.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers looked at several important outcomes:

**Death within 30 days:** The evidence was unclear. Beta-blockers might not change the risk of death. Out of every 1,000 people, beta-blockers might cause between 2 fewer deaths and 13 more deaths.

**Heart attacks:** Beta-blockers may reduce heart attacks. Out of every 1,000 people, beta-blockers might prevent 13 heart attacks.

**Strokes:** The evidence showed no clear difference. Beta-blockers might not change the risk of stroke.

**Heart rhythm problems:** For one type called ventricular arrhythmias, the evidence was very unclear. For another type called atrial fibrillation, beta-blockers may help. Out of every 1,000 people, beta-blockers might prevent 26 cases.

**Side effects:** Beta-blockers caused more side effects. They increased bradycardia (very slow heart rate). Out of every 1,000 people, 55 more had this problem. They also increased hypotension (very low blood pressure). Out of every 1,000 people, 44 more had this problem.

**How certain are these results?**

The researchers rated their certainty as low to moderate for most findings. This means future studies might change these results. Some studies had problems with how they were done. One large, well-done study found different results than other studies. This made it hard to be certain about the findings.

**What do the results mean?**

Beta-blockers may help prevent some problems like heart attacks and irregular heartbeats. However, they also cause side effects like slow heart rate and low blood pressure. The evidence about death and strokes is unclear.

**What happens next?**

More large, high-quality studies are needed. These studies should compare beta-blockers to fake pills. They should also look at how beta-blockers affect quality of life. There are 18 more studies waiting to be reviewed. These might help make the findings more certain.",10.1002-14651858.CD013438,"Beta‐blockers to prevent death or serious events after surgery not involving the heart
This review assessed evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on whether beta‐blockers reduce deaths or other serious events when given to people undergoing surgery other than heart surgery. The findings for heart surgery are covered in another review. 
Background 
Surgery increases stress in the body, which responds by releasing the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. Stress from surgery can lead to death or other serious events such as heart attacks, stroke, or an irregular heartbeat. For surgery that does not involve the heart, an estimated 8% of people may have injury to their heart around the time of surgery. Beta‐blockers are drugs that block the action of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart. Beta‐blockers can slow down the heart, and reduce blood pressure, and this may reduce the risk of serious events. However, beta‐blockers may lead to a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure which could increase the risk of death or a stroke. Prevention of early complications after surgery is important, but using beta‐blockers to prevent these complications is controversial. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 28 June 2019. We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 adults who were undergoing different types of surgery other than heart surgery. Eighteen studies are awaiting classification (because we did not have enough details to assess them), and three studies are ongoing. The types of beta‐blockers used in the studies were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. Studies compared these beta‐blockers with either a placebo (disguised to look like a beta‐blocker but containing no medicine) or with standard care. 
Key results 
Beta‐blockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days of surgery (16 studies, 11,446 participants; low‐certainty evidence), have a stroke (6 studies, 9460 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or experience ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat rhythms, starting in the main chambers of the heart, that are potentially life‐threatening and may need immediate medical treatment; 5 studies, 476 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We found that beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat, starting in the atrial chambers of the heart, that increases the risk of stroke if untreated; 9 studies, 9080 participants; low certainty‐evidence), and the number of people who have a heart attack (12 studies, 10,520 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, taking beta‐blockers may increase the number of people who experience a very low heart rate (49 studies, 12,239 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or very low blood pressure (49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), around the time of surgery. 
In a few studies, we also found little or no difference in the number of people who died after 30 days, who died because of a heart problem, or had heart failure. We found no evidence of whether beta‐blockers alter the length of time in hospital. 
No studies assessed whether people who were given beta‐blockers had a better quality of life after heart surgery. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence in this review was limited by including some studies that were at high risk of bias, and we noticed that some of our findings were different if we only included placebo‐controlled studies or studies that reported how participants were randomized. We also found one large, well‐conducted, international study that had different findings to the smaller studies. It showed a reduction in heart attacks and an increase in stroke and all‐cause mortality when beta‐blockers were used, whilst the other studies did not show a clear effect. We were also less certain of the findings for outcomes with few studies, such as for ventricular arrhythmias. 
Conclusion 
Although beta‐blockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days, have a stroke, or have ventricular arrhythmias, they may reduce atrial fibrillation and heart attacks. Taking beta‐blockers may increase the number of people with a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure around the time of surgery. Further evidence from large, placebo‐controlled trials is likely to increase the certainty of these findings, and we recommend the assessment of impact on quality of life.

High intake of added sugar have been suggested to impact the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Knowledge on the subject can contribute to preventing CVD. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of a high versus low‐added sugar consumption for primary prevention of CVD in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S) on 2 July 2021. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal for ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was performed together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no restriction on language of publication or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials, that compared different levels of added sugar intake. Exclusion criteria were: participants aged below 18 years; diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2); and previous CVD. Primary outcomes were incident cardiovascular events (coronary, carotid, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease) and all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL‐cholesterol, HDL‐cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and adverse events (gastrointestinal symptoms and impaired dental health). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 21 RCTs (1110 participants completing the interventions) examining the effects of different levels of added sugar intake with a mean duration of 14 weeks. The study participants were generally described as healthy and the mean age ranged from 22 to 57 years. 
No studies reported on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality. There was minimal effect of low intake of added sugar on total cholesterol levels (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21; I² = 0%; 16 studies; 763 participants; low certainty of evidence) and triglycerides (MD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17; I² = 3%; 14 studies; 725 participants) but no evidence of effect on LDL‐cholesterol and HDL‐cholesterol. There was minimal effect on diastolic blood pressure (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.37; I² = 0%; 13 studies; 873 participants) and on systolic blood pressure (MD 1.44, 95% 0.08 to 2.80; I² = 27%, 14 studies; 873 participants; low certainty of evidence), but no evidence of effect on fasting plasma glucose. 
Only one study reported on dental health, with no events. No other trials reported adverse events (impaired dental health or gastrointestinal symptoms). 
All results were judged as low‐quality evidence according to GRADE. The risk of bias was generally unclear, five studies were classified at an overall low risk of bias (low risk in at least four domains, not including other bias). 
Authors' conclusions
No trials investigating the effect of added sugar on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality were identified in our searches. Evidence is uncertain whether low intake of added sugar has an effect on risk factors for CVD; the effect was small and the clinical relevance is, therefore, uncertain. Practical ways to achieve reductions in dietary added sugar includes following current dietary recommendations. 
Future trials should have longer follow‐up time and report on all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular events in order to clarify the effect of added sugar on these outcomes. Future trials should also aim for more direct interventions and preferably be more independent of industry funding.

## Plain Title
Does Eating Less Added Sugar Help Prevent Heart Disease in Healthy Adults?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**
Heart disease is a major health problem that affects many people. Heart disease can cause heart attacks, strokes, and other serious problems. It can also lead to death.

**What might cause this problem?**
Doctors think that eating a lot of added sugar might increase the risk of heart disease. Added sugar is sugar that is put into foods and drinks when they are made. This is different from natural sugar found in fruits.

**Why was this study needed?**
Many people eat foods with added sugar every day. Researchers wanted to know if eating less added sugar could help prevent heart disease. Learning this could help people stay healthier. If eating less added sugar helps, doctors could give better advice to their patients.

**What did researchers want to find out?**
The researchers wanted to see if eating less added sugar would lower the risk of heart disease compared to eating more added sugar. They looked at studies done with healthy adults.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review study. The researchers looked at 21 smaller studies that had already been done. These studies compared people who ate different amounts of added sugar.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included 1,110 adults who finished the research. All participants were healthy at the start. They did not have diabetes or heart disease. Their ages ranged from 22 to 57 years old on average.

**How long did the studies last?**
The average study lasted 14 weeks (about 3 and a half months).

**What did researchers measure?**
The researchers wanted to see if eating less sugar affected:
- Heart attacks and strokes
- Deaths from any cause
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels (fats in the blood)
- Blood sugar levels
- Side effects like stomach problems or tooth decay

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The main findings were:
- None of the studies looked at heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. This means researchers could not answer the main question.

- Eating less added sugar had very small effects on some health measures:
  - Total cholesterol went up slightly
  - Blood pressure went up slightly
  - Blood fats called triglycerides went up slightly

- Eating less added sugar did not change:
  - Two other types of cholesterol (LDL and HDL)
  - Blood sugar levels

- Only one study looked at tooth health. No problems were found. No other studies reported side effects.

**What does this mean?**
The researchers are not sure if eating less added sugar helps prevent heart disease. The changes they found were very small. These small changes may not matter for a person's health.

**What are the problems with these results?**
The quality of evidence was low. This means we cannot be very confident in the results. The studies had several problems:
- They were short (only 14 weeks on average)
- They did not look at heart attacks or deaths
- Some studies were not well designed

**What do the researchers conclude?**
More research is needed. Future studies should:
- Last longer (many years, not just weeks)
- Look at heart attacks, strokes, and deaths
- Be better designed

People should follow current healthy eating advice. This includes limiting added sugar in their diet.

**Why is this important?**
Right now, we do not have good proof that eating less added sugar prevents heart disease in healthy adults. However, eating less added sugar may still be good for other health reasons.",10.1002-14651858.CD013320,"Low levels of sugar to prevent cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels and the number one cause of death worldwide. It is important to detect modifiable risk factors and find strategies to prevent CVD. There are several established modifiable risk factors for developing CVD, one of them being eating an unhealthy diet rich in sugar. Sugar can be divided in two categories; sugars naturally occurring in food and sugars that are added to food. A high level of added sugar intake is suggested to cause weight gain and affect blood lipids, increasing the risk of CVD. This review assessed different levels of added sugars in the diet and the effect on cardiovascular events (e.g. heart attack or stroke), death, and CVD risk factors in healthy adults. 
Study characteristics 
Databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials in which participants are randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control treatment) were searched. The trials that were included compared different levels of added sugar intake and its effect on risk factors for CVD in healthy adults. People with previous CVD or diabetes were not included in the review. 
Key results 
Twenty‐one trials were found with 1110 participants. None of the trials looked at cardiovascular events or death. The trials reported on blood pressure, blood lipid levels and blood sugar levels. The review found that low levels of added sugar intake led to a small reduction in blood pressure and blood lipid levels, but no effect was seen on blood sugar. The evidence is current to July 2021. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies included in the review provide low‐quality evidence that low levels of added sugar in the diet indirectly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. More long‐term studies of high quality assessing effects of different levels of sugar on CVD risk factors, cardiovascular events and death are needed.

Review question 
Are protocols useful for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit?  Background 
Mechanical ventilation is used to help newborns to breath when they are too sick or born too premature to breath on their own. However, mechanical ventilation is not without risk, and can cause (permanent) damage to the lungs. For example, the pressure needed to fill the lungs with air may destroy the very fragile air sacs, and result in scaring of the lungs. For this reason, it is important to recognize when a newborn is mature and strong enough to start breathing for himself/herself, and to reduce (wean) the ventilator support. There is, unfortunately, no current agreement on the best way to wean newborns off the ventilator. Researchers have studied the usefulness of standardized protocols to guide the process of weaning off the ventilator in adults and children. In adults, 17 studies of weaning protocols have shown benefit in helping the doctors and nurses wean adults off the ventilator in a safe and timely manner. In children, three studies of weaning protocols have shown they are beneficial in reducing time on the ventilator, but the studies were too few to show harms. As yet, we do not know if weaning protocols in neonates provide benefits or harms. However, these standardized protocols have supplied us with firm evidence for their usefulness in weaning from mechanical ventilation in the care of children.  Study characteristics 
The purpose of this review was to look at weaning protocol studies in newborn infants to see if we could draw conclusions on their usefulness for weaning practice in neonatal care.  Key results  We found no studies that involved newborn infants before the 28th day of life. We found two studies with a subpopulation of newborns, but we were not able to extract the data from this subgroup out of the total group studied.  Quality of evidence

","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do Step-by-Step Plans Help Newborn Babies Come Off Breathing Machines Faster?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?
Some newborn babies cannot breathe on their own. This happens when they are born too early or are very sick. These babies need a breathing machine to help them. Doctors call this machine a ventilator.

### Why is this a problem?
Breathing machines can hurt a baby's lungs. The air pressure from the machine can damage the tiny air sacs in the lungs. This damage can cause scars that last forever. Because of this risk, doctors need to know the right time to stop using the machine. They need to know when the baby is strong enough to breathe alone.

### What did researchers want to find out?
Doctors do not agree on the best way to take babies off breathing machines. This process is called weaning. Researchers wanted to know if using a step-by-step plan (called a protocol) would help. These plans tell doctors and nurses exactly what to do and when to do it.

### Why might step-by-step plans help?
Studies in adults showed that step-by-step plans work well. Seventeen studies found that these plans help adults come off breathing machines safely and quickly. Three studies in older children also showed good results. Children spent less time on breathing machines when doctors used these plans. Researchers wanted to see if the same plans would help newborn babies.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers look for answers?
The researchers searched for studies about newborn babies. They looked for studies that tested step-by-step weaning plans. They wanted to compare babies who had a plan to babies who did not have a plan.

### What kind of studies did they look for?
They looked for studies with newborn babies in the first 28 days of life. These babies would be in a special care unit called the neonatal intensive care unit. The babies would need breathing machines to help them breathe.

### What did they find?
The researchers could not find any studies that met their needs. They found two studies that included some newborn babies. But these studies also included older babies and children. The researchers could not separate the newborn baby information from the rest of the data.

## Results

### What were the main findings?
The researchers found no studies to review. There are no studies that compare step-by-step plans to regular care in newborn babies. This means we do not know if these plans help newborn babies or not.

### What does this mean?
Right now, there is no proof that step-by-step plans help newborn babies come off breathing machines. There is also no proof that these plans cause harm. We simply do not have enough information to know either way.

### Why is this important?
Doctors need good information to make the best choices for babies. Without studies, doctors cannot know if step-by-step plans are better than their current methods. More research is needed to answer this question.

### What should happen next?
Researchers need to do studies with newborn babies. These studies should test step-by-step weaning plans. They should measure how long babies stay on breathing machines. They should also check if the plans are safe. Only then will doctors know if these plans help newborn babies breathe on their own sooner and more safely.

### Bottom line
We know step-by-step plans help adults and older children come off breathing machines. But we do not yet know if they help newborn babies. More research is needed to find out.",10.1002-14651858.CD011106,"The usefulness of protocols for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit

Ocrelizumab is a humanised anti‐CD20 monoclonal antibody developed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017 for using in adults with relapsing‐remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Ocrelizumab is the only disease‐modifying therapy (DMT) approved for PPMS. In November 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) also approved ocrelizumab as the first drug for people with early PPMS. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the benefits, harms, and tolerability of ocrelizumab in people with MS. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits, harms, and tolerability of ocrelizumab in people with RRMS and PPMS. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and two trials registers on 8 October 2021. We screened reference lists, contacted experts, and contacted the main authors of studies. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults diagnosed with RRMS or PPMS according to the McDonald criteria, comparing ocrelizumab alone or associated with other medications, at the approved dose of 600 mg every 24 weeks for any duration, versus placebo or any other active drug therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
Four RCTs met our selection criteria. The overall population included 2551 participants; 1370 treated with ocrelizumab 600 mg and 1181 controls. Among the controls, 298 participants received placebo and 883 received interferon beta‐1a. The treatment duration was 24 weeks in one study, 96 weeks in two studies, and at least 120 weeks in one study. One study was at high risk of allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel; all four studies were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. 
For RRMS, compared with interferon beta‐1a, ocrelizumab was associated with: 1. lower relapse rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.73; 2 studies, 1656 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); 2. a lower number of participants with disability progression (hazard ratio (HR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.84; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 3. little to no difference in the number of participants with any adverse event (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; 2 studies, 1651 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); 4. little to no difference in the number of participants with any serious adverse event (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.11; 2 studies, 1651 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 5. a lower number of participants experiencing treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.91; 2 studies, 1651 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 6. a lower number of participants with gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.35; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 7. a lower number of participants with new or enlarging T2‐hyperintense lesions on MRI (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.69; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low‐certainty evidence) at 96 weeks. 
For PPMS, compared with placebo, ocrelizumab was associated with: 1. a lower number of participants with disability progression (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98; 1 study, 731 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 2. a higher number of participants with any adverse events (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.11; 1 study, 725 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); 3. little to no difference in the number of participants with any serious adverse event (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.23; 1 study, 725 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 4. little to no difference in the number of participants experiencing treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.75; 1 study, 725 participants; low‐certainty evidence) for at least 120 weeks. There were no data for number of participants with gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions on MRI and number of participants with new or enlarging T2‐hyperintense lesions on MRI. 
Authors' conclusions
For people with RRMS, ocrelizumab probably results in a large reduction in relapse rate and little to no difference in adverse events when compared with interferon beta‐1a at 96 weeks (moderate‐certainty evidence). Ocrelizumab may result in a large reduction in disability progression, treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events, number of participants with gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions on MRI, and number of participants with new or enlarging T2‐hyperintense lesions on MRI, and may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events (low‐certainty evidence). 
For people with PPMS, ocrelizumab probably results in a higher rate of adverse events when compared with placebo for at least 120 weeks (moderate‐certainty evidence). Ocrelizumab may result in a reduction in disability progression and little to no difference in serious adverse events and treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (low‐certainty evidence). 
Ocrelizumab was well tolerated clinically; the most common adverse events were infusion‐related reactions and nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract and upper respiratory tract infections. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Ocrelizumab for Multiple Sclerosis

## Plain Title

Does ocrelizumab help people with multiple sclerosis?

## Rationale

**What is multiple sclerosis?**

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. It happens when the body's defense system attacks the protective covering around nerves. This damage makes it hard for nerves to send messages. People with MS may have trouble walking, seeing, or thinking clearly. These problems can make daily life very difficult.

**What are the types of MS?**

There are two main types of MS studied in this research:
- Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS): Symptoms come and go in episodes called relapses
- Primary progressive MS (PPMS): Symptoms slowly get worse over time without clear relapses

**What is ocrelizumab?**

Ocrelizumab is a medicine given through a vein every six months. It works by targeting certain cells in the body's defense system. In 2017, health agencies approved it for both types of MS. It is the only approved medicine for PPMS.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers needed to find out if ocrelizumab really helps people with MS. They wanted to know if it works well and if it is safe.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

Researchers looked at four studies that tested ocrelizumab. These studies included 2,551 adults with MS.

**Who was in the studies?**

- 1,370 people received ocrelizumab
- 1,181 people received other treatments (either a dummy treatment called placebo or another MS medicine called interferon beta-1a)

All participants were adults diagnosed with either RRMS or PPMS.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies lasted different lengths of time:
- One study lasted 24 weeks (about 6 months)
- Two studies lasted 96 weeks (about 2 years)
- One study lasted at least 120 weeks (about 2.5 years)

## Results

**What were the main results for people with RRMS?**

Researchers compared ocrelizumab to interferon beta-1a. After 96 weeks, they found:

**Benefits:**
- Fewer relapses: Ocrelizumab reduced the number of MS attacks
- Less disability: Fewer people got worse in their ability to move or function
- Fewer treatment stops: Fewer people had to stop treatment due to side effects
- Better brain scans: Fewer people showed new damage on brain scans

**Safety:**
- About the same number of people had side effects with both medicines
- About the same number of people had serious side effects

**What were the main results for people with PPMS?**

Researchers compared ocrelizumab to placebo. After at least 120 weeks, they found:

**Benefits:**
- Less disability: Fewer people got worse in their ability to move or function

**Safety:**
- More people had side effects with ocrelizumab than with placebo
- About the same number of people had serious side effects
- About the same number of people stopped treatment due to side effects

**What side effects did people have?**

Most people tolerated ocrelizumab well. The most common side effects were:
- Reactions during the infusion (when the medicine goes into the vein)
- Nose and throat infections
- Bladder infections
- Upper breathing tract infections

**What do these results mean?**

For RRMS, ocrelizumab likely works better than interferon beta-1a at reducing relapses and slowing disability. Side effects were similar between the two medicines.

For PPMS, ocrelizumab may help slow disability compared to placebo. However, more people had side effects with ocrelizumab.

**Study quality:**

The researchers noted some concerns about how these studies were done. This means we need more research to be completely sure about these results.

**Conclusion:**

Ocrelizumab appears to help people with both types of MS. It reduces relapses in RRMS and may slow disability in both RRMS and PPMS. Most people can take it without serious problems.",10.1002-14651858.CD013247,"What are the benefits and risks of ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis?
Key messages 
– Ocrelizumab is a recently approved medicine to treat people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In relapsing‐remitting MS (where people experience flare‐ups of symptoms), ocrelizumab probably substantially reduces flare‐ups, may substantially reduce worsening of symptoms, and probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects compared with interferon beta‐1a (a standard treatment for MS), 96 weeks after treatment starts. 
– Compared to placebo (a dummy medicine) after 120 weeks of treatment for primary progressive MS (where people's symptoms worsen gradually), ocrelizumab may reduce worsening of symptoms. Ocrelizumab probably increases unwanted effects but makes little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects. 
– We need more, better‐designed studies to test the effectiveness of ocrelizumab and measure unwanted effects.  
What is multiple sclerosis? 
MS is a condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the nerves in the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system). This damage prevents messages travelling from the central nervous system to other parts of the body. It causes a range of potential symptoms from pins and needles to difficulties with balance and walking.  
There are several types of MS. In relapsing‐remitting MS, people have 'flare‐ups' of disease followed by periods of recovery. In primary progressive MS, people's symptoms gradually worsen over time.  
What is ocrelizumab? 
Ocrelizumab is a medicine that has been recently approved to treat relapsing‐remitting MS and primary progressive MS. It is a disease‐modifying therapy, which is a type of medicine that treats the underlying symptoms of MS. Ocrelizumab targets white blood cells in the body's immune system. It sticks to a type of these cells called B cells, and stops them attacking the central nervous system. This prevents inflammation and nerve damage, reducing the number and severity of relapses and slowing the worsening of symptoms. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if ocrelizumab is more effective than any other medicine or placebo in people with relapsing‐remitting MS and primary progressive MS. 
We were interested in how many people:
– had symptom flare‐ups;
– had worsening symptoms;
– experienced unwanted effects; and
– stopped treatment due to unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared ocrelizumab against any other medicine or placebo for people with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing‐remitting MS or primary progressive MS. People in the studies could be any age or sex, could have mild or severe symptoms, and could have had MS for any length of time. 
We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found four studies with 2551 people with MS. The largest study included 732 people and the smallest included 163 people. The studies were in countries around the world, but mostly in the USA. One study lasted for 24 weeks; two studies for 96 weeks; and one study for at least 120 weeks. Pharmaceutical companies funded the four studies. 
Three studies compared ocrelizumab with interferon beta‐1a in people with relapsing‐remitting MS. Interferon beta‐1a is an older type of disease‐modifying therapy. One study compared ocrelizumab with placebo for people with primary progressive MS. 
Main results 
Ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta‐1a for people with relapsing‐remitting MS, after 96 weeks of treatment: 
– probably substantially reduces the number of people who had flare‐ups;
– may substantially reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse;
– probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects; and 
– may substantially reduce the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects.  
Ocrelizumab compared with placebo for people with primary progressive MS, after 120 weeks of treatment: 
– may reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse; 
– probably increases unwanted effects;  and
– may make little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects and the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the results is moderate to low for several reasons. First, people dropped out of the studies unevenly, which meant more people had one treatment than the other. Second, there was not enough information about some of our points of interest to allow us to draw conclusions for outcomes, there was not enough information available for us to be confident in the results. Finally, changes in symptoms shown by scans could have been due to causes other than disease progression. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 8 October 2021.

GM‐CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor) is a growth factor that is used to supplement culture media in an effort to improve clinical outcomes for those undergoing assisted reproduction. It is worth noting that the use of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media often adds a further cost to the price of an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycle. The purpose of this review was to assess the available evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness and safety of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of GM‐CSF‐supplemented human embryo culture media versus culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF, in women or couples undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Search methods
We used standard methodology recommended by Cochrane. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, DARE, OpenGrey, PubMed, Google Scholar, and two trials registers on 15 October 2019, checked references of relevant papers and communicated with experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing GM‐CSF (including G‐CSF (granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor))‐supplemented embryo culture media versus any other non‐GM‐CSF‐supplemented embryo culture media (control) in women undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were live birth and miscarriage rate. The secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, multiple gestation, preterm birth, birth defects, aneuploidy, and stillbirth rates. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methodology. We undertook one comparison, GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media versus culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF, for those undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Main results
We included five studies, the data for three of which (1532 participants) were meta‐analysed. We are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media makes any difference to the live‐birth rate when compared to using conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF (odds ratio (OR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.52, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 69%, low‐quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of live birth associated with conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF was 22%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media would be between 21% and 30%. 
We are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media makes any difference to the miscarriage rate when compared to using conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.36, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 0%, low‐quality evidence). This evidence suggests that if the miscarriage rate associated with conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF was 4%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media would be between 2% and 5%. 
Furthermore, we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media makes any difference to the following outcomes: clinical pregnancy (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.45, 3 RCTs, N = 1532 women, I2 = 67%, low‐quality evidence); multiple gestation (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.10, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 35%, very low‐quality evidence); preterm birth (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.04, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 76%, very low‐quality evidence); birth defects (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.01, I2 = 0%, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, low‐quality evidence); and aneuploidy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.26, I2 = 0%, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, low‐quality evidence). We were unable to undertake analysis of stillbirth, as there were no events in either arm of the two studies that assessed this outcome. 
Authors' conclusions
Due to the very low to low quality of the evidence, we cannot be certain whether GM‐CSF is any more or less effective than culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF for clinical outcomes that reflect effectiveness and safety. It is important that independent information on the available evidence is made accessible to those considering using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media. The claims from marketing information that GM‐CSF has a positive effect on pregnancy rates are not supported by the available evidence presented here; further well‐designed, properly powered RCTs are needed to lend certainty to the evidence. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Does Adding GM-CSF to Culture Media Improve IVF Success?

## Plain Title

Does adding a growth factor called GM-CSF to the fluid used to grow embryos improve the chances of having a baby through IVF?

## Rationale

**What is IVF and why do people need it?**

Some people cannot get pregnant naturally. They may need help from doctors using a process called IVF (in vitro fertilization). During IVF, doctors take eggs from a woman's body and mix them with sperm in a lab. The fertilized eggs (called embryos) grow in special fluids for a few days. Then doctors place the embryos back into the woman's womb.

**What is GM-CSF?**

GM-CSF is a growth factor. This means it is a substance that helps cells grow. Some doctors add GM-CSF to the fluid where embryos grow. They hope this will help more people have babies. However, adding GM-CSF costs extra money. An IVF cycle with GM-CSF costs more than one without it.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors wanted to know if GM-CSF really helps. Does it increase the chance of having a baby? Is it safe? This study looked at all the research done on this question. The goal was to help people make good choices about their IVF treatment.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. The researchers looked at five different studies. These studies compared two groups of people doing IVF:
- One group used culture fluid with GM-CSF added
- One group used regular culture fluid without GM-CSF

The researchers combined data from three of these studies. This gave them information about 1,532 people.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included women and couples who needed IVF to get pregnant. The studies looked at different ages and health conditions.

**What did the researchers measure?**

The researchers looked at several outcomes:
- How many babies were born alive
- How many pregnancies ended in miscarriage
- How many women got pregnant
- How many had twins or triplets
- How many babies were born too early
- How many babies had birth defects
- Other safety measures

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers found that GM-CSF may not make much difference. Here is what they learned:

**Live births:** The researchers are not sure if GM-CSF helps more babies be born. Without GM-CSF, about 22 out of 100 women had a live birth. With GM-CSF, the number might be between 21 and 30 out of 100 women. This difference is too small to be certain.

**Miscarriages:** The researchers are not sure if GM-CSF changes miscarriage rates. Without GM-CSF, about 4 out of 100 women had a miscarriage. With GM-CSF, the number might be between 2 and 5 out of 100 women.

**Other outcomes:** The researchers also looked at pregnancy rates, twins, early births, and birth defects. For all of these, they could not tell if GM-CSF made things better or worse.

**Quality of the evidence:** The quality of the evidence was low or very low. This means the researchers cannot be certain about the results. More and better studies are needed.

**What do these results mean?**

The claims that GM-CSF helps pregnancy rates are not proven by the evidence. People considering IVF should know that:
- GM-CSF costs extra money
- The evidence does not show clear benefits
- The evidence does not show clear harms either
- More research is needed

**Conclusions from the researchers:**

The researchers concluded that they cannot say for certain whether GM-CSF works better than regular culture media. People thinking about using GM-CSF should have access to honest information about what the research shows. Right now, the research does not support the marketing claims that GM-CSF improves pregnancy rates. Better studies are needed to know for sure.",10.1002-14651858.CD013497,"Growth factor‐supplemented culture media for women undergoing assisted reproduction
Review question 
Does culture media containing the growth factor GM‐CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor) improve the chances of a pregnancy and live‐born baby, and reduce the risk of miscarriage, twin or triplet pregnancy, premature birth, birth defects, genetic problems in the baby, and stillbirth? 
Background 
Assisted reproduction includes processes whereby a woman's eggs and a man's sperm are combined to achieve fertilisation outside of the body. Embryos are placed in a solution called culture medium to support the growing embryo until it can be replaced into the woman's uterus. Culture medium supplemented with GM‐CSF is widely available in clinics and is often offered as an 'add‐on' to an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycle in an effort to improve the success rates of treatment. Using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture medium can make IVF more expensive. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to October 2019. We obtained data from three randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of 1532 infertile women undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a specialised form of IVF whereby the sperm is injected into the egg. We compared GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media versus culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF for those undergoing assisted reproduction. 
What the review found 
Low‐quality evidence reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to the live‐birth rate when compared to using culture media not containing GM‐CSF. This suggests that if the rate of live birth associated with culture media not containing GM‐CSF is 22%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐containing culture media would be between 21% and 30%. Low‐quality evidence also reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to miscarriage when compared to using culture media not containing GM‐CSF. This suggests that if the miscarriage rate associated with culture media not containing GM‐CSF is 4%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐containing culture media would be between 2% and 5%. Low‐quality evidence for pregnancy, birth defects, and genetic problems with the baby, and very low‐quality evidence for twin or triplet pregnancies, and premature birth, reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to these outcomes when compared to culture media not containing GM‐CSF. Two studies looked at stillbirth, but as no stillbirths occurred in either study, we were unable to analyse this outcome. 
Overall conclusions 
Due to the very low to low quality of the evidence, we cannot be certain whether GM‐CSF is any more or less effective or harmful than culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF. It is important that independent information on the available evidence is made accessible to those considering using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media. In the meantime, more large studies are needed to increase the certainty of our conclusions.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a group of musculoskeletal disorders affecting the jaw. They are frequently associated with pain that can be difficult to manage and may become persistent (chronic). Psychological therapies aim to support people with TMDs to manage their pain, leading to reduced pain, disability and distress. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychological therapies in people (aged 12 years and over) with painful TMD lasting 3 months or longer. 
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched six bibliographic databases up to 21 October 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any psychological therapy (e.g. cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), behaviour therapy (BT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), mindfulness) for the management of painful TMD. We compared these against control or alternative treatment (e.g. oral appliance, medication, physiotherapy). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We reported outcome data immediately after treatment and at the longest available follow‐up. 
We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies. Two review authors independently assessed each included study for any risk of bias in sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting of outcomes, and other issues. We judged the certainty of the evidence for each key comparison and outcome as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE criteria. 
Main results
We identified 22 RCTs (2001 participants), carried out between 1967 and 2021. We were able to include 12 of these studies in meta‐analyses. The risk of bias was high across studies, and we judged the certainty of the evidence to be low to very low overall; further research may change the findings. Our key outcomes of interest were: pain intensity, disability caused by pain, adverse events and psychological distress. Treatments varied in length, with the shortest being 4 weeks. The follow‐up time ranged from 3 months to 12 months. Most studies evaluated CBT.   
At treatment completion, there was no evidence of a benefit of CBT on pain intensity when measured against alternative treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.03, confidence interval (CI) ‐0.21 to 0.28; P = 0.79; 5 studies, 509 participants) or control (SMD ‐0.09, CI ‐0.30 to 0.12; P = 0.41; 6 studies, 577 participants). At follow‐up, there was evidence of a small benefit of CBT for reducing pain intensity compared to alternative treatment (SMD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.50 to ‐0.08; 5 studies, 475 participants) and control (SMD ‐0.30, CI ‐0.51 to ‐0.09; 6 studies, 639 participants). 
At treatment completion, there was no evidence of a difference in disability outcomes (interference in activities caused by pain) between CBT and alternative treatment (SMD 0.15, CI ‐0.40 to 0.10; P = 0.25; 3 studies, 245 participants), or between CBT and control/usual care (SMD 0.02, CI ‐0.21 to 0.24; P = 0.88; 3 studies, 315 participants). Nor was there evidence of a difference at follow‐up (CBT versus alternative treatment: SMD ‐0.15, CI ‐0.42 to 0.12; 3 studies, 245 participants; CBT versus control: SMD 0.01 CI ‐ 0.61 to 0.64; 2 studies, 240 participants). 
There were very few data on adverse events. From the data available, adverse effects associated with psychological treatment tended to be minor and to occur less often than in alternative treatment groups. There were, however, insufficient data available to draw firm conclusions. 
CBT showed a small benefit in terms of reducing psychological distress at treatment completion compared to alternative treatment (SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.50 to ‐0.15; 6 studies, 553 participants), which was maintained at follow‐up (SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.51 to ‐0.13; 6 studies, 516 participants). For CBT versus control, only one study reported results for distress and did not find evidence of a difference between groups at treatment completion (mean difference (MD) 2.36, 95% CI ‐1.17 to 5.89; 101 participants) or follow‐up (MD ‐1.02, 95% CI ‐4.02 to 1.98; 101 participants). 
We assessed the certainty of the evidence to be low or very low for all comparisons and outcomes. 
The data were insufficient to draw any reliable conclusions about psychological therapies other than CBT. 
Authors' conclusions
We found mixed evidence for the effects of psychological therapies on painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). There is low‐certainty evidence that CBT may reduce pain intensity more than alternative treatments or control when measured at longest follow‐up,  but not at treatment completion. There is low‐certainty evidence that CBT may be better than alternative treatments, but not control, for reducing psychological distress at treatment completion and follow‐up. There is low‐certainty evidence that CBT may not be better than other treatments or control for pain disability outcomes.  
There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about alternative psychological therapeutic approaches, and there are insufficient data to be clear about adverse effects that may be associated with psychological therapies for painful TMD.  
Overall, we found insufficient evidence on which to base a reliable judgement about the efficacy of psychological therapies for painful TMD. Further research is needed to determine whether or not psychological therapies are effective, the most effective type of therapy and delivery method, and how it can best be targeted. In particular, high‐quality RCTs conducted in primary care and community settings are required, which evaluate a range of psychological approaches against alternative treatments or usual care, involve both adults and adolescents, and collect measures of pain intensity, pain disability and psychological distress until at least 12 months post‐treatment.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Can Talking Therapies Help People with Long-Lasting Jaw Pain?

## Plain Title

Can talking therapies help people who have pain in their jaw that lasts 3 months or longer?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some people have pain in their jaw joint and the muscles around it. This is called temporomandibular disorder, or TMD. The jaw joint connects the lower jaw to the skull. TMD can make it hard to chew, talk, or open your mouth. The pain can last a long time and become chronic (lasting 3 months or more). This ongoing pain can make daily life difficult.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Pain that lasts a long time can affect how people feel and what they can do each day. Talking therapies help people learn new ways to manage their pain. These therapies teach skills to cope with pain and reduce worry or stress about it. Researchers wanted to know if talking therapies could help people with TMD feel better.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to see if talking therapies could:
- Reduce jaw pain
- Help people do daily activities more easily
- Lower feelings of worry or sadness
- Cause any harmful effects

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 22 different studies. These studies included 2,001 people total. The studies were done between 1967 and 2021.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included people aged 12 years and older. All of them had TMD pain that lasted 3 months or longer.

**What treatments did people receive?**

Most studies tested a talking therapy called cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT. CBT helps people change how they think about and respond to pain. Some people received CBT. Other people received different treatments like mouth guards, medicine, or physical therapy. Some people received no special treatment (usual care).

**How long did the studies last?**

The shortest treatment lasted 4 weeks. Researchers checked on people from 3 months to 12 months after treatment ended.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found mixed results. The quality of evidence was low, meaning we cannot be very sure about the findings.

**Pain levels:**
- Right after treatment ended, CBT did not reduce pain more than other treatments or usual care.
- Several months later, CBT showed a small benefit. People who had CBT reported slightly less pain than people who had other treatments or usual care.

**Daily activities:**
- CBT did not help people do daily activities more easily than other treatments or usual care. This was true both right after treatment and months later.

**Worry and sadness:**
- Right after treatment, CBT helped reduce worry and sadness slightly more than other treatments.
- This small benefit lasted for several months.
- Only one study compared CBT to usual care for worry and sadness. It found no difference between groups.

**Harmful effects:**
- Very few studies reported harmful effects.
- When reported, harmful effects from talking therapies were minor.
- Talking therapies seemed to cause fewer problems than other treatments.
- However, there was not enough information to be sure about this.

**What does this mean?**

The evidence suggests CBT might help reduce jaw pain a few months after treatment ends. It might also help reduce worry and sadness. However, the evidence is weak. We need better studies to know for sure if talking therapies work for TMD pain.

**What happens next?**

More high-quality studies are needed. Future studies should:
- Include both adults and teenagers
- Test different types of talking therapies
- Compare talking therapies to other treatments and usual care
- Follow people for at least 12 months after treatment
- Be done in regular doctor offices and community settings

Until better studies are done, we cannot say for certain whether talking therapies help people with long-lasting jaw pain.",10.1002-14651858.CD013515,"What are the benefits and risks of psychological therapies for adults and young people over 12 years old with painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? 
Key messages 
The overall results are mixed, but indicate that psychological therapies may be a useful approach for painful TMD as there is some limited evidence that they can reduce the pain. Our review suggests that they may do this at least as well as other available treatments. Any negative effects of psychological therapies are unclear, and more research is needed before we can know whether they provide a noticeable benefit while causing no or few problems. 
What is the condition? 
Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are conditions that affect the jaw joint and the muscles that move it. They are often associated with pain that lasts more than 3 months (known as chronic pain). Other symptoms include limited mouth opening, and jaw clicking and locking. All symptoms can interfere with quality of life and mood. 
What did we want to know? 
We wanted to find out how effective psychological therapies are for adults and young people over the age of 12 years who have painful TMD that has lasted at least 3 months. 
What did we do? 
We searched databases of medical and dental journals and research studies. We only selected studies known as 'randomised controlled trials (RCTs)'. In this type of study, participants are allocated to groups randomly. One group receives the intervention and the other receives a different treatment or no treatment at all. RCTs aim to reduce the risk of introducing bias in clinical studies. 
We looked for reports of RCTs of psychological therapies compared to different treatments or no treatment in people over 12 years of age. Most of the reports we found compared psychological therapy to medication or the use of a special mouthguard.  
We chose to focus on three measures of success. These were reduction in pain intensity, interference with activities caused by pain ('pain disability'), and psychological distress. We looked for details of these measures immediately after treatment and a few months later. We also looked for information on any 'adverse effects' (negative side effects of the treatments).  
We used standard Cochrane methods to decide which studies to include, collect the key information from the studies, judge whether or not the studies were biased in any way, and judge how certain we can be about the results. 
What did we find? 
Overall we found 22 relevant studies. Most of the studies reported on one particular form of psychological therapy called cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). We did not have enough information to draw any conclusions about any other psychological therapies. 
The results told us that CBT was no different to other treatments (e.g. oral splints, medicine) or usual care/no treatment in reducing the intensity of the TMD pain by the end of treatment. There was some evidence that people who had CBT might have slightly less pain a few months after treatment.  
There was some evidence that CBT might be better than other treatments for reducing psychological distress both at the end of treatment and a few months later. This was not seen in the one study that compared CBT against usual care. 
In terms of how much pain interfered with activities, there was no evidence that there was any difference between CBT and other treatments.  
There was too little information to be sure about whether psychological treatments cause adverse effects (problems caused by treatment such as feeling unwell or worse pain or unexpected effects). Only six of the 22 studies measured what adverse effects participants experienced. In these six studies, adverse effects associated with psychological treatment seemed to be minor in general and to occur less often than in alternative treatment groups.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies had design limitations. There was also variation in the length of treatment and in how it was delivered. This means that we need to be cautious in interpreting the results that we found and they may not be reliable. 
How up to date is the evidence? 
We searched for studies up to 21 October 2021.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by shortness of breath, cough and recurrent exacerbations. People with COPD often live with one or more co‐existing long‐term health conditions (comorbidities). People with more severe COPD often have a higher number of comorbidities, putting them at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of any single intervention for COPD adapted or tailored to their comorbidity(s) compared to any other intervention for people with COPD and one or more common comorbidities (quantitative data, RCTs) in terms of the following outcomes: Quality of life, exacerbations, functional status, all‐cause and respiratory‐related hospital admissions, mortality, pain, and depression and anxiety. 
To assess the effectiveness of an adapted or tailored single COPD intervention (simple or complex) that is aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and one or more common comorbidities (quantitative data, RCTs) compared to usual care in terms of the following outcomes: Quality of life, exacerbations, functional status, all‐cause and respiratory‐related hospital admissions, mortality, pain, and depression and anxiety. 
To identify emerging themes that describe the views and experiences of patients, carers and healthcare professionals when receiving or providing care to manage multimorbidities (qualitative data). 
Search methods
We searched multiple databases including the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL, to identify relevant randomised and qualitative studies. We also searched trial registries and conducted citation searches. The latest search was conducted in January 2021. 
Selection criteria
Eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) compared a) any single intervention for COPD adapted or tailored to their comorbidity(s) compared to any other intervention, or b) any adapted or tailored single COPD intervention (simple or complex) that is aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and one or more comorbidities, compared to usual care. We included qualitative studies or mixed‐methods studies to identify themes. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods for analysis of the RCTs. We used Cochrane's risk of bias tool for the RCTs and the CASP checklist for the qualitative studies. We planned to use the Mixed Methods Appraisal tool (MMAT) to assess the risk of bias in mixed‐methods studies, but we found none. We used GRADE and CERQual to assess the quality of the quantitative and qualitative evidence respectively. The primary outcome measures for this review were quality of life and exacerbations. 
Main results
Quantitative studies 
We included seven studies (1197 participants) in the quantitative analyses, with interventions including telemonitoring, pulmonary rehabilitation, treatment optimisation, water‐based exercise training and case management. Interventions were either compared with usual care or with an active comparator (such as land‐based exercise training). Duration of trials ranged from 4 to 52 weeks. Mean age of participants ranged from 64 to 72 years and COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. Trials included either people with COPD and a specific comorbidity (including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, lung cancer, head or neck cancer, and musculoskeletal conditions), or with one or more comorbidities of any type. 
Overall, we judged the evidence presented to be of moderate to very low certainty (GRADE), mainly due to the methodological quality of included trials and imprecision of effect estimates. 
Intervention versus usual care 
Quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score may improve with tailored pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care at 52 weeks (mean difference (MD) −10.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) −12.66 to −9.04; 1 study, 70 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Tailored pulmonary rehabilitation is likely to improve COPD assessment test (CAT) scores compared with usual care at 52 weeks (MD −8.02, 95% CI −9.44 to −6.60; 1 study, 70 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and with a multicomponent telehealth intervention at 52 weeks (MD −6.90, 95% CI −9.56 to −4.24; moderate‐certainty evidence). Evidence is uncertain about effects of pharmacotherapy optimisation or telemonitoring interventions on CAT improvement compared with usual care. 
There may be little to no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations, or mean exacerbations with case management compared with usual care (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.57; 1 study, 470 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
For secondary outcomes, six‐minute walk distance (6MWD) may improve with pulmonary rehabilitation, water‐based exercise or multicomponent interventions at 38 to 52 weeks (low‐certainty evidence). A multicomponent intervention may result in fewer people being admitted to hospital at 17 weeks, although there may be little to no difference in a telemonitoring intervention. There may be little to no difference between intervention and usual care for mortality. 
Intervention versus active comparator 
We included one study comparing water‐based and land‐based exercise (30 participants). We found no evidence for quality of life or exacerbations. 
There may be little to no difference between water‐ and land‐based exercise for 6MWD (MD 5 metres, 95% CI −22 to 32; 38 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Qualitative studies 
One nested qualitative study (21 participants) explored perceptions and experiences of people with COPD and long‐term conditions, and of researchers and health professionals who were involved in an RCT of telemonitoring equipment. 
Several themes were identified, including health status, beliefs and concerns, reliability of equipment, self‐efficacy, perceived ease of use, factors affecting usefulness and perceived usefulness, attitudes and intention, self‐management and changes in healthcare use. We judged the qualitative evidence presented as of very low certainty overall. 
Authors' conclusions
Owing to a paucity of eligible trials, as well as diversity in the intervention type, comorbidities and the outcome measures reported, we were unable to provide a robust synthesis of data. Pulmonary rehabilitation or multicomponent interventions may improve quality of life and functional status (6MWD), but the evidence is too limited to draw a robust conclusion. The key take‐home message from this review is the lack of data from RCTs on treatments for people living with COPD and comorbidities. 
Given the variation in number and type of comorbidity(s) an individual may have, and severity of COPD, larger studies reporting individual patient data are required to determine these effects. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Treatments for People with COPD and Other Health Problems

## Plain Title
Can treatments for COPD be changed to help people who also have other long-term health problems?

## Rationale

### What is COPD?
COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is a long-term lung disease. People with COPD have trouble breathing. They often cough a lot. Their symptoms can suddenly get worse at times.

### What is the problem?
Many people with COPD also have other health problems. These are called comorbidities. Examples include heart disease, diabetes, and muscle problems. People with worse COPD often have more other health problems. This puts them at higher risk of getting sicker or dying.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors usually treat COPD the same way for everyone. But people with COPD and other health problems may need different care. Researchers wanted to know if changing COPD treatments to fit each person's other health problems would work better.

### What did researchers want to find out?
They wanted to see if treatments made for people with COPD and other health problems would help more than regular care. They looked at things like quality of life, breathing problems getting worse, ability to do daily tasks, hospital visits, and death rates.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked at studies that were already done. They searched medical databases up to January 2021. They looked for two types of studies:
- Studies that tested treatments
- Studies that asked people about their experiences

### Who was in these studies?
The studies included 1,197 people total. These people had COPD plus at least one other health problem. Their other health problems included heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and muscle or bone problems. People in the studies were 64 to 72 years old on average. Their COPD ranged from mild to very severe.

### What treatments were tested?
Different studies tested different treatments:
- Exercise programs in a gym
- Exercise programs in water
- Remote monitoring using computers or phones
- Help managing all their health problems
- Changes to their medicines

### How long did the studies last?
Studies lasted from 4 weeks to 52 weeks (one year).

## Results

### What did researchers find about quality of life?
Exercise programs made for people with COPD and other problems may improve quality of life after one year. Programs that combined several types of help also seemed to improve quality of life. But researchers could not be very sure about these results.

### What did researchers find about breathing problems getting worse?
One study looked at case management (getting extra help managing health). It found little to no difference in how often breathing problems got worse.

### What did researchers find about physical ability?
Exercise programs and combined treatment programs may help people walk farther. This was measured by how far people could walk in six minutes. But again, researchers could not be very sure.

### What did researchers find about hospital visits?
One combined treatment program may have led to fewer hospital visits. A remote monitoring program did not seem to make a difference.

### What did researchers find about death rates?
The treatments did not seem to change death rates.

### What did people say about their experiences?
One small study asked 21 people about using remote monitoring equipment. People talked about how easy the equipment was to use. They discussed whether it helped them manage their health. They shared concerns about whether the equipment worked well.

### What are the main conclusions?
There are not enough studies to give clear answers. The studies that exist are very different from each other. They tested different treatments on people with different health problems. This makes it hard to compare results.

Exercise programs and combined treatment programs may help some people with COPD and other health problems. But we need more research to be sure.

The biggest finding is that very few studies have been done. Most research on COPD does not include people with other health problems. This is a problem because most people with COPD do have other health problems.

### What is needed next?
We need larger studies that include many people with COPD and different health problems. These studies should track each person's results separately. This would help doctors know which treatments work best for which people.",10.1002-14651858.CD013384,"Approaches to help people with COPD who have one or more long‐term conditions
What is COPD and comorbidity? 
COPD is a common condition caused mainly by smoking and can lead to long‐term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, and cough with sputum production due to airways and lung damage. People with COPD may have one or more other long‐term conditions (comorbidities) such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, asthma and lung cancer which can lead to poor health. People living with two or more comorbidities can also be known as living with multimorbidity. 
Why did we do this review?  
Because many people with COPD live with multimorbidity, naturally people in clinical trials will have multimorbidities. However, the results of those trials are usually not reported broken down by multimorbidity. People with comorbidities may need to adapt interventions to take account of their comorbidity — for example taking exercise in water instead of on land so that their bodies are better supported. Historically, Cochrane Airways Reviews have not taken into account people's comorbidities, and this review is a first step to addressing this. We decided to complete a review that centres on people with COPD and comorbidities following a meeting with our COPD patient group, who highlighted concerns over comorbidities. After some deliberation, we decided to include the following two sorts of trials. 
1. Any single intervention for COPD delivered to people with COPD adapted to or targeting their comorbidity compared to routine care or any other intervention. 
2. Any intervention aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and comorbidities, which could be simple (e.g. scheduling COPD and heart clinics on the same day) or more complex (e.g. developing a new care package for management of people with COPD across a local health service), compared to routine care. 
We wanted to know which treatments improve quality of life and reduce exacerbations for people living with COPD and one or more comorbidities. 
We also wanted to find out about how people with COPD, carers and health professionals felt about those treatments. 
What information did we find? 
We carried out a search for studies in January 2021. We found seven  eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 1197 people, and one qualitative study which was part of one of the randomised trials and provided information about people's opinions and experiences of using telehealth equipment. People included in the trials were aged between 64 and 72 years, and their COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. The trials either included people with COPD and a specific comorbidity such as cardiovascular disease or lung cancer, or they included people with COPD and one or more other conditions of any sort. 
Results and conclusions 
There is not enough evidence on people with COPD and other comorbidities to draw firm conclusions about interventions aimed at COPD that are adapted for the comorbidity. The available evidence indicated the following:  
‐ Quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score may improve with tailored pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care (note that there is a strong evidence base for pulmonary rehabilitation in people with COPD). 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation is likely to improve quality of life as measured by the COPD assessment test (CAT) scores compared with usual care at 52 weeks and with a multicomponent telehealth intervention.  
‐ Evidence is uncertain about the effects of pharmacotherapy optimisation or telemonitoring interventions on CAT improvement compared with usual care. 
‐ There may be little to no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations, or mean exacerbations with case management compared with usual care.  
‐ For secondary outcomes, the distance walked by participants in six minutes may improve with pulmonary rehabilitation, water‐based exercise or multicomponent interventions. A multicomponent intervention may result in fewer people being admitted to hospital, although there may be little to no difference in a telemonitoring intervention.  
‐ There may be little to no difference between intervention and usual care for deaths across several studies. 
‐ One study compared water‐based exercise with land‐based exercise. We found no evidence for quality of life or exacerbations. There may be little to no difference between water‐ and land‐based exercise on the distance walked by participants in six minutes. 
‐ One qualitative study explored perceptions and experiences of people with COPD and long‐term conditions, and of researchers and health professionals who were involved in an RCT of telemonitoring equipment. Several themes were identified, including health status, beliefs and concerns, reliability of equipment, self‐efficacy, perceived ease of use, factors affecting usefulness and perceived usefulness, attitudes and intention, self‐management and changes in healthcare use.  
Larger studies with more people with COPD and comorbidities could help to find out if targeted approaches can improve health. 
Certainty of the information 
Overall there were very few studies and most studies were small. This means the results are based on a small amount of information. Trials with different interventions and different or more people may give a different result.

Diagnosis of endometrial (womb) cancer is normally made at an early stage, as most women with the disease experience abnormal vaginal bleeding, which prompts them to seek medical advice. However, delays in presentation and referral can result in delay in diagnosis and management, which can lead to unfavourable treatment outcomes. This is particularly a problem for pre‐ and peri‐menopausal women. Providing educational information to women and healthcare providers regarding symptoms relating to endometrial cancer may raise awareness of the disease and reduce delayed treatment. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of health education interventions targeting healthcare providers, or individuals, or both, to promote early presentation and referral for women with endometrial cancer symptoms. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of review articles. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both individually randomised and cluster‐RCTs. In the absence of RCTs we planned to include well‐designed non‐randomised studies (NRS) with a parallel comparison assessing the benefits of any type of health education interventions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently evaluated whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria for the review, but none were found. 
Main results
A comprehensive search of the literature yielded the following results: CENTRAL (1022 references), MEDLINE (2874 references), and Embase (2820 references). After de‐duplication, we screened titles and abstracts of 4880 references and excluded 4864 that did not meet the review inclusion criteria. Of the 16 references that potentially met the review inclusion, we excluded all 16 reports after reviewing the full texts. We did not identify any ongoing trials. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently an absence of evidence to indicate the effectiveness of health education interventions involving healthcare providers or individuals or both to promote early presentation and referral for women with endometrial cancer symptoms. High‐quality RCTs are needed to assess whether health education interventions enhance early presentation and referral. If health education interventions can be shown to reduce treatment delays in endometrial cancer, further studies would be required to determine which interventions are most effective. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can teaching women and doctors about womb cancer signs help find the disease earlier? A review of studies.

## Rationale

### What is womb cancer and why does it matter?
Womb cancer is also called endometrial cancer. It grows in the lining of the womb. Most women with womb cancer notice unusual bleeding from the vagina. This warning sign helps doctors find the cancer early. Early treatment works better than late treatment.

### What is the problem?
Sometimes women wait too long before seeing a doctor. Sometimes doctors wait too long before sending women to a specialist. These delays mean the cancer is found later. Later treatment may not work as well. This problem happens more often in younger women who have not yet gone through menopause.

### Why was this study needed?
The researchers wanted to know if teaching could help. They looked for studies that taught women about womb cancer signs. They also looked for studies that taught doctors when to refer women to specialists. Better knowledge might help women seek help sooner. It might help doctors act faster. This could lead to earlier treatment and better results.

## Trial Design

### How did the researchers look for answers?
The researchers did not do a new study themselves. Instead, they searched for studies that other people had already done. They looked in three large medical databases. These databases store information about thousands of health studies. They searched for any study that tested teaching programs about womb cancer symptoms.

### What kind of studies were they looking for?
They wanted to find the best type of study. This is called a randomized controlled trial. In this type of study, some people get the teaching program. Other people do not. Researchers then compare the two groups. If they could not find this type of study, they would accept other well-designed studies.

### What did their search find?
The researchers found over 6,800 studies at first. After removing duplicates, they had 4,880 studies to review. They read the titles and summaries of all these studies. Only 16 studies seemed like they might fit. They read these 16 studies completely. In the end, none of these studies met their needs. They found no ongoing studies either.

## Results

### What were the main findings?
The researchers found no studies to review. This means there is no evidence right now. We do not know if teaching programs work. We do not know if they help women seek care sooner. We do not know if they help doctors refer patients faster.

### What does this mean for patients?
Right now, we cannot say if teaching programs help find womb cancer earlier. No one has tested this idea properly yet. This does not mean teaching programs do not work. It means we need research to find out.

### What do the researchers recommend?
Good quality studies are needed. These studies should test teaching programs. They should measure if women see doctors sooner. They should measure if doctors refer patients faster. If teaching programs do help, more studies would be needed. These would find out which teaching methods work best.

### Why is this review important?
This review shows a gap in our knowledge. It tells other researchers what studies are needed. It reminds us that we should not assume teaching programs work without proof. Future studies can fill this gap. They can help us find better ways to catch womb cancer early.",10.1002-14651858.CD013253,"Do health education interventions lead to early treatment for women with symptoms of endometrial (womb) cancer 
Background Endometrial (womb) cancer arises from the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the lining of the womb. Diagnosis when the disease is still at an early stage (cancer is still within the womb, without spread into nearby tissues) is common, as most women with the disease experience abnormal vaginal bleeding and go to their doctors. However, delayed management of endometrial cancer still occurs. This is particularly a problem for women who are about to go through or are in the menopause. Providing educational information to women and healthcare providers regarding symptoms relating to endometrial cancer may raise awareness of the disease and reduce delayed treatment. We undertook this review to assess whether endometrial cancer education led to women with endometrial cancer symptoms visiting their doctors and being referred for treatment earlier than when there was no education. 
The aim of the review We undertook this review to assess whether endometrial cancer education led to women with endometrial cancer symptoms visiting their doctors and being referred for treatment earlier than when there was no educational information available.

Delayed recovery of urinary continence is a major adverse effect of robotic‐assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in men undergoing prostate cancer treatment. To address this issue, a number of surgical techniques have been designed to reconstruct the posterior aspect of the rhabdosphincter, which is responsible for urinary continence after removal of the prostate; however, it is unclear how well they work.  
Objectives
To assess the effects of posterior musculofascial reconstruction RALP compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, trials registries, other sources of the grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to 12 March 2021. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which participants were randomized to undergo variations of posterior musculofascial reconstruction RALP versus no posterior reconstruction during RALP for clinically localized prostate cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. Primary outcomes were: urinary continence recovery within one week after catheter removal, at three months after surgery, and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: urinary continence recovery at six and twelve months after surgery, potency recovery twelve months after surgery, positive surgical margins (PSM), and biochemical recurrence‐free survival (BCRFS). We performed statistical analyses using a random‐effects model. We rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Our search identified 13 records of eight unique RCTs, of which six were published studies and two were abstract proceedings. We included 1085 randomized participants, of whom 963 completed the trials (88.8%). All participants had either cT1c or cT2 or cT3a disease, with a mean prostate‐specific antigen level of 8.15 ng/mL. 
Primary outcomes 
Posterior reconstruction RALP (PR‐RALP) may improve urinary continence one week after catheter removal compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.73; I2 = 42%; studies = 5, participants = 498; low CoE) although the CI also includes the possibility of no effect. Assuming 335 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 84 more men per 1000 (33 fewer to 244 more) reporting urinary continence recovery.  
Posterior reconstruction may have little to no effect on urinary continence three months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.14; I2 = 67%; studies = 6, participants = 842; low CoE). Assuming 701 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 14 fewer men per 1000 (112 fewer to 98 more) reporting urinary continence after three months. 
PR‐RALP probably results in little to no difference in serious adverse events compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.92; I2 = 0%; studies = 6, participants = 835; moderate CoE). Assuming 25 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP experience a serious adverse event at this time point, this corresponds to six fewer men per 1000 (17 fewer to 23 more) reporting serious adverse events.  
Secondary outcomes 
PR‐RALP may result in little to no difference in recovery of continence 12 months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.07; I2 = 25%; studies = 3, participants = 602; low CoE). Assuming 918 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 18 more men per 1000 (18 fewer to 64 more) reporting urinary continence recovery.  
We are very uncertain about the effects of PR‐RALP on recovery of potency 12 months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26; I2 = 3%; studies = 2, participants = 308; very low CoE). Assuming 433 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are potent at this time point, this corresponds to nine more men per 1000 (78 fewer to 113 more) reporting potency recovery.  
PR‐RALP may result in little to no difference in positive surgical margins compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.33; I2 = 50%; studies = 3, participants = 517; low CoE). Assuming 130 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP have a positive surgical margin, this corresponds to 31 more men per 1000 (46 fewer to 173 more) reporting positive surgical margins.  
PR‐RALP may result in little to no difference in biochemical recurrence compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.52; I2 = 0%; studies = 2, participants = 468; low CoE). Assuming 70 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP have experienced biochemical recurrence at this time point, this corresponds to 25 more men per 1000 (18 fewer to 107 more) reporting biochemical recurrence.  
Authors' conclusions
This review found evidence that PR‐RALP may improve early continence one week after catheter removal but not thereafter. Meanwhile, adverse event rates are probably not impacted and surgical margins rates are likely similar. This review was unable to determine if or how these findings may be impacted by the person's age, nerve‐sparing status, or clinical stage. Study limitations, imprecision, and inconsistency lowered the certainty of evidence for the outcomes assessed.

Does Rebuilding Tissue Behind the Bladder During Robotic Prostate Cancer Surgery Help Men Control Their Urine Better?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Prostate cancer is a common cancer in men. One way to treat it is to remove the prostate gland through surgery. Doctors often use a robot to help with this surgery. This is called robotic prostate surgery.

**What problems can this surgery cause?**

After this surgery, many men have trouble controlling their urine. This is called losing bladder control. Men may leak urine when they cough, laugh, or move. This problem can last for weeks or months. It affects how men live their daily lives. Many men find this very upsetting.

**Why does this happen?**

The prostate sits below the bladder. A muscle called the rhabdosphincter helps control urine flow. When doctors remove the prostate, this muscle can be damaged. This makes it hard for men to control their urine.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Doctors created a new way to do the surgery. They rebuild tissue behind the bladder during surgery. This is called posterior reconstruction. Doctors think this might help men control their urine better and faster after surgery.

Researchers wanted to know: Does rebuilding this tissue work better than regular surgery?

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 8 different studies. These studies compared two groups of men:
- One group had surgery with tissue rebuilding
- One group had regular surgery without tissue rebuilding

**Who was in the study?**

A total of 1,085 men joined these studies. Of these men, 963 finished the studies. All men had prostate cancer that had not spread beyond the prostate. The men were similar in both groups.

**How long did the study last?**

Researchers checked on the men at different times:
- One week after removing the catheter (a tube that drains urine)
- Three months after surgery
- Six months after surgery
- Twelve months after surgery

They looked at bladder control, sexual function, and safety.

## Results

**What did researchers find about bladder control?**

*One week after catheter removal:*
The tissue rebuilding method may help more men control their urine early on. Out of every 1,000 men, about 84 more men might have bladder control. However, the results were not completely clear.

*Three months after surgery:*
The tissue rebuilding method made little or no difference. Both groups had similar bladder control.

*Twelve months after surgery:*
The tissue rebuilding method made little or no difference. Most men in both groups could control their urine well by this time.

**What about safety?**

The tissue rebuilding method probably does not cause more serious problems than regular surgery. Both methods appear equally safe.

**What about other outcomes?**

*Sexual function:*
Researchers are very uncertain if tissue rebuilding helps men with sexual function one year after surgery.

*Cancer control:*
The tissue rebuilding method made little or no difference in:
- Whether cancer cells were left behind at surgery edges
- Whether cancer came back

**What do these results mean?**

The tissue rebuilding method may help men control their urine in the first week after surgery. But this benefit does not last. By three months, both groups are similar. By one year, most men in both groups have good bladder control.

The surgery appears safe. Both methods have similar rates of serious problems.

**What are the limitations?**

The researchers noted some concerns:
- Some study results were not consistent with each other
- Some results were not precise
- They could not tell if age or cancer stage made a difference

**What is the bottom line?**

Rebuilding tissue during robotic prostate surgery may help men control their urine slightly better in the first week. But this benefit goes away over time. By three months and beyond, both surgery methods work about the same. The tissue rebuilding method appears safe.

Men considering prostate surgery should talk with their doctors about which method is best for them.",10.1002-14651858.CD013677,"Should we perform posterior reconstruction RALP or standard RALP for clinically localized prostate cancer? 
Review question 
In men with prostate cancer who are having their prostate removed using surgery assisted by a robotic device (called robotic‐assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, or RALP), how does connecting the tissue behind the urethra (so‐called posterior reconstruction) compare to surgery where these connections are not made (standard RALP)? 
Background 
Urologists often use a robot to remove the prostate in men with prostate cancer. After surgery, most men leak urine for some time. This problem is called incontinence and usually improves six to 12 months after surgery in most men. However, it can be very bothersome during this time. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies in which chance determined whether men had posterior reconstruction RALP or standard RALP. These studies included 1085 men with an average age ranging from 60 to 67 years. The average prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) level in the men was 8.15 ng/mL. Higher levels of PSA may indicate worse prostate cancer. 
Key results 
We found that posterior reconstruction RALP may result in better continence one week after the catheter comes out compared to standard RALP (although it is also possible that it is no better), but it may make little to no difference at either three or 12 months after surgery. Posterior reconstruction RALP probably results in little to no difference in serious unwanted effects compared with the standard way of doing the surgery. There may also be little to no difference in positive surgical margins, meaning the risk of there being cancer cells right at the cut edge of the prostate when viewed under the microscope. There may also be no difference between the two techniques in terms of the risk of a PSA level that goes up within 12 months of surgery, which often signals that there is cancer left behind. We are very uncertain how posterior reconstruction RALP effects the ability to achieve an erection, compared to standard RALP. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low depending on the outcome, meaning that we have moderate to very little confidence in the results.

The risk of venous thromboembolism is increased in adults and enhanced by asparaginase‐based chemotherapy, and venous thromboembolism introduces a secondary risk of treatment delay and premature discontinuation of key anti‐leukaemic agents, potentially compromising survival. Yet, the trade‐off between benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated according to asparaginase‐based regimens is uncertain.  
Objectives
The primary objectives were to assess the benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis for first‐time symptomatic venous thromboembolism in adults with ALL receiving asparaginase‐based therapy compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis. 
The secondary objectives were to compare the benefits and harms of different groups of primary systemic thromboprophylaxis by stratifying the main results per type of drug (heparins, vitamin K antagonists, synthetic pentasaccharides, parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors, direct oral anticoagulants, and blood‐derived products for antithrombin substitution). 
Search methods
We conducted a comprehensive literature search on 02 June 2020, with no language restrictions, including (1) electronic searches of Pubmed/MEDLINE; Embase/Ovid; Scopus/Elsevier; Web of Science Core Collection/Clarivate Analytics; and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and (2) handsearches of (i) reference lists of identified studies and related reviews; (ii) clinical trials registries (ClinicalTrials.gov registry; the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry; the World Health Organisation's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP); and pharmaceutical manufacturers of asparaginase including Servier, Takeda, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Ohara Pharmaceuticals, and Kyowa Pharmaceuticals), and (iii) conference proceedings (from the annual meetings of the American Society of Hematology (ASH); the European Haematology Association (EHA); the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO); and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)). We conducted all searches from 1970 (the time of introduction of asparaginase in ALL treatment). We contacted the authors of relevant studies to identify any unpublished material, missing data, or information regarding ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs); including quasi‐randomised, controlled clinical, cross‐over, and cluster‐randomised trial designs) comparing any parenteral/oral preemptive anticoagulant or mechanical intervention with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, or comparing two different pre‐emptive anticoagulant interventions in adults aged at least 18 years with ALL treated according to asparaginase‐based chemotherapy regimens. For the description of harms, non‐randomised observational studies with a control group were eligible for inclusion.  
Data collection and analysis
Using a standardised data collection form, two review authors independently screened and selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias for each outcome using standardised tools (RoB 2.0 tool for RCTs and ROBINS‐I tool for non‐randomised studies) and the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes included first‐time symptomatic venous thromboembolism, all‐cause mortality, and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included asymptomatic venous thromboembolism, venous thromboembolism‐related mortality, adverse events (i.e. clinically relevant non‐major bleeding and heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia for trials using heparins), and quality of life. Analyses were performed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For non‐randomised studies, we evaluated all studies (including studies judged to be at critical risk of bias in at least one of the ROBINS‐I domains) in a sensitivity analysis exploring confounding.  
Main results
We identified 23 non‐randomised studies that met the inclusion criteria of this review, of which 10 studies provided no outcome data for adults with ALL. We included the remaining 13 studies in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, in which we identified invalid control group definition in two studies and judged outcomes of nine studies to be at critical risk of bias in at least one of the ROBINS‐I domains and outcomes of two studies at serious risk of bias. 
We did not assess the benefits of thromboprophylaxis, as no RCTs were included. In the main descriptive analysis of harms, we included two retrospective non‐randomised studies with outcomes judged to be at serious risk of bias. One study evaluated antithrombin concentrates compared to no antithrombin concentrates. We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on all‐cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.19 (intention‐to‐treat analysis); one study, 40 participants; very low certainty of evidence). We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on venous thromboembolism‐related mortality (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.94 (intention‐to‐treat analysis); one study, 40 participants; very low certainty of evidence). We do not know whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on major bleeding, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, and quality of life in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy, as data were insufficient. The remaining study (224 participants) evaluated prophylaxis with low‐molecular‐weight heparin versus no prophylaxis. However, this study reported insufficient data regarding harms including all‐cause mortality, major bleeding, venous thromboembolism‐related mortality, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia, and quality of life. 
In the sensitivity analysis of harms, exploring the effect of confounding, we also included nine non‐randomised studies with outcomes judged to be at critical risk of bias primarily due to uncontrolled confounding. Three studies (179 participants) evaluated the effect of antithrombin concentrates and six studies (1224 participants) evaluated the effect of prophylaxis with different types of heparins. When analysing all‐cause mortality; venous thromboembolism‐related mortality; and major bleeding (studies of heparin only) including all studies with extractable outcomes for each comparison (antithrombin and low‐molecular‐weight heparin), we observed small study sizes; few events; wide CIs crossing the line of no effect; and substantial heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots. Although the observed heterogeneity could arise through the inclusion of a small number of studies with differences in participants; interventions; and outcome assessments, the likelihood that bias due to uncontrolled confounding was the cause of heterogeneity is inevitable. Subgroup analyses were not possible due to insufficient data.  
Authors' conclusions
We do not know from the currently available evidence, if thromboprophylaxis used for adults with ALL treated according to asparaginase‐based regimens is associated with clinically appreciable benefits and acceptable harms. The existing research on this question is solely of non‐randomised design, seriously to critically confounded, and underpowered with substantial imprecision. Any estimates of effect based on the existing insufficient evidence is very uncertain and is likely to change with future research.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Blood Clot Prevention in Adults with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

## Plain Title

Can blood clot prevention medicines help adults with a type of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia?

## Rationale

**What is acute lymphoblastic leukemia?**

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of blood cancer. It affects white blood cells that help fight infection.

**What is the problem?**

Adults with ALL have a higher risk of blood clots in their veins. These blood clots are called venous thromboembolism.

The cancer treatment uses a medicine called asparaginase. This medicine makes blood clots more likely to happen.

Blood clots can be dangerous. They can cause doctors to delay treatment. They can make doctors stop important cancer medicines early. This might make it harder to survive the cancer.

**What might help?**

Doctors can give medicines to prevent blood clots before they happen. These are called blood thinners or anticoagulants.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors do not know if blood clot prevention medicines help adults with ALL. They also do not know if these medicines cause harm. This study looked at all available research to find answers.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at all past studies on this topic. They searched medical databases from 1970 to 2020.

They looked for studies that compared:
- Blood clot prevention medicines versus no prevention
- Blood clot prevention medicines versus fake pills (placebo)
- One type of prevention medicine versus another type

**Who were the patients in these studies?**

The researchers looked for studies with adults aged 18 years or older. All patients had ALL. All patients received treatment with asparaginase.

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found 23 studies. However, none of these studies were high-quality studies. High-quality studies are called randomized controlled trials.

All 23 studies had serious problems with how they were done. Only 2 studies had enough information to review. These 2 studies had 264 patients total.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers could not answer the main question. The available studies were too small and had too many problems.

**What did the 2 reviewed studies show?**

One study looked at 40 patients. It tested a medicine called antithrombin concentrate. This medicine might help prevent blood clots.

The researchers are uncertain if this medicine affects death rates. They are uncertain if it affects deaths caused by blood clots. They do not know if it causes serious bleeding.

The second study looked at 224 patients. It tested a blood thinner called low-molecular-weight heparin. This study did not report enough information about benefits or harms.

**What does this mean for patients?**

Right now, doctors do not know if blood clot prevention medicines help adults with ALL. They do not know if these medicines are safe for this group of patients.

The studies done so far have serious problems. They are too small. They do not compare patients fairly. The results are very uncertain.

**What happens next?**

Better studies are needed. These studies should be randomized controlled trials. They should have more patients. They should measure both benefits and harms clearly.

Until better studies are done, doctors cannot be sure about the best way to prevent blood clots in adults with ALL.

**Conclusions from the researchers**

The current evidence is not good enough to guide treatment decisions. Any conclusions based on existing studies are very uncertain. Future research will likely change what we know about this topic.

Doctors and patients should discuss the risks and benefits of blood clot prevention medicines. Each patient's situation is different.",10.1002-14651858.CD013399,"Prevention of blood clots in adults diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether currently available medications for prevention of blood clots have an appreciable balance between benefits and harms in adults with a subtype of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated with asparaginase‐containing chemotherapy.  
Key messages 
We are uncertain whether blood‐derived products such as antithrombin concentrates for the prevention of blood clots in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy are associated with unacceptable harms such as death. Our confidence in the identified studies is limited because of their non‐randomised design with few participants and no control for underlying factors that could influence the outcome. 
Harms regarding other types of blood clot prevention such as low‐molecular‐weight heparin could not be evaluated, because death and bleeding were not reported.  We did not look at benefits such as reduction in risk of blot clots, given the low quality of identified evidence (no randomised studies). We need high‐quality randomised studies, as the conduct of such studies minimises the risk of underlying factors influencing the outcomes.  
What was studied in this review?  
ALL is a subtype of blood cancer arising from malignant transformation of immature white blood cells of lymphoid origin. Over the last 20 years, the historically poor survival in adults with this disease has markedly improved, primarily due to the introduction of more intensive anti‐leukaemic treatment inspired by that used in children with ALL. One of the hallmarks of this treatment is the intensive use of the anti‐leukaemic agent called asparaginase. However, nothing comes without a price. Both older age and asparaginase treatment increase the risk of blood clots, which can either block the blood vessels (predominantly in those called veins) and change the normal blood flow or shower fractions of the clot into other veins located in important organs, resulting in serious health problems. Additionally, doctors are prone to stop asparaginase treatment, if blood clots occur—potentially compromising survival in these people.  
We do not know if the existing types of blood clot prevention protect against the clots and do not cause bleeding and death in adults with this disease. The medications include heparins, vitamin K antagonists, synthetic pentasaccharides, direct thrombin inhibitors, direct oral anticoagulants, or blood‐derived products for antithrombin substitution (decreased production in the body of this anti‐blood clotting protein during asparaginase), and mechanical prevention such as graduated elastic stockings.  
Therefore, we looked at all currently available research in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐containing chemotherapy who received blood clot prevention compared to placebo or no prevention. We looked at the following outcomes: first‐time symptomatic venous blood clot, all‐cause death, major bleeding, blood clot‐related death, asymptomatic venous blood clot, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, heparin‐induced lowering of blood platelet counts, and quality of life. 
What are the results of this review? 
We found 23 studies, of which we included two studies in our main analyses to help answer the question and nine studies in an additional analysis to help describe the limitations of the evidence. The remaining 12 studies could not be included due to missing outcomes or critical risk of bias, as people in the control group were not 'real' controls.  
The two studies from our main analysis were conducted in UK/Canada and compared antithrombin with no antithrombin concentrates and low‐molecular‐weight heparin with no low‐molecular‐weight heparin, respectively, for people with ALL. We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy improve/reduce all‐cause/blood clot‐related death, because our confidence in the evidence was very low (one study, 40 adults). Harms in relation to the use of low‐molecular‐weight heparin could not be evaluated, because all‐cause/blood clot‐related death, major/clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, or heparin‐induced lowering of platelets were not reported. None of the studies looked at quality of life.  
No studies were found that evaluated any of the other prevention types. We did not look at benefits such as reduction in risk of blood clots, given the low certainty of evidence.

Self‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury regardless of degree of suicidal intent or other types of motivation) is a growing problem in most countries, often repeated, and associated with suicide. Evidence assessing the effectiveness of interventions in the treatment of SH in children and adolescents is lacking, especially when compared with the evidence for psychosocial interventions in adults. This review therefore updates a previous Cochrane Review (last published in 2015) on the role of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychosocial interventions or pharmacological agents or natural products for SH compared to comparison types of care (e.g. treatment‐as‐usual, routine psychiatric care, enhanced usual care, active comparator, placebo, alternative pharmacological treatment, or a combination of these) for children and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) who engage in SH. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialized Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL] and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [CDSR]), together with MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PsycINFO (to 4 July 2020). 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing specific psychosocial interventions or pharmacological agents or natural products with treatment‐as‐usual (TAU), routine psychiatric care, enhanced usual care (EUC), active comparator, placebo, alternative pharmacological treatment, or a combination of these, in children and adolescents with a recent (within six months of trial entry) episode of SH resulting in presentation to hospital or clinical services. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a repeated episode of SH over a maximum follow‐up period of two years. Secondary outcomes included treatment adherence, depression, hopelessness, general functioning, social functioning, suicidal ideation, and suicide. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised trial quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence internals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CIs. The overall quality of evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. repetition of SH at post‐intervention) was appraised for each intervention using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included data from 17 trials with a total of 2280 participants. Participants in these trials were predominately female (87.6%) with a mean age of 14.7 years (standard deviation (SD) 1.5 years). The trials included in this review investigated the effectiveness of various forms of psychosocial interventions. None of the included trials evaluated the effectiveness of pharmacological agents in this clinical population. There was a lower rate of SH repetition for DBT‐A (30%) as compared to TAU, EUC, or alternative psychotherapy (43%) on repetition of SH at post‐intervention in four trials (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.82; N = 270; k = 4; high‐certainty evidence). There may be no evidence of a difference for individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy and TAU for repetition of SH at post‐intervention (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.12 to 7.24; N = 51; k = 2; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether mentalisation based therapy for adolescents (MBT‐A) reduces repetition of SH at post‐intervention as compared to TAU (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.06 to 8.46; N = 85; k = 2; very low‐certainty evidence). Heterogeneity for this outcome was substantial ( I² = 68%). There is probably no evidence of a difference between family therapy and either TAU or EUC on repetition of SH at post‐intervention (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.07; N = 191; k = 2; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, there was no evidence of a difference for compliance enhancement approaches on repetition of SH by the six‐month follow‐up assessment, for group‐based psychotherapy at the six‐ or 12‐month follow‐up assessments, for a remote contact intervention (emergency cards) at the 12‐month assessment, or for therapeutic assessment at the 12‐ or 24‐month follow‐up assessments. 
Authors' conclusions
Given the moderate or very low quality of the available evidence, and the small number of trials identified, there is only uncertain evidence regarding a number of psychosocial interventions in children and adolescents who engage in SH. Further evaluation of DBT‐A is warranted. Given the evidence for its benefit in adults who engage in SH, individual CBT‐based psychotherapy should also be further developed and evaluated in children and adolescents. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing Treatments to Help Young People Who Self-Harm

## Plain Title

Can talking therapies or medicines help children and teens who hurt themselves on purpose?

## Rationale

**What is self-harm?**

Self-harm means when someone hurts themselves on purpose. This can include taking too much medicine or hurting their body. Young people may do this for different reasons. They may or may not want to die.

**Why is this a problem?**

Self-harm is becoming more common around the world. Many young people who self-harm do it more than once. Some young people who self-harm may later die by suicide. This makes self-harm a serious health problem.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need to know which treatments work best for young people who self-harm. We know more about what helps adults than what helps children and teens. This study looked at past research to find out which treatments help young people stop hurting themselves.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

The researchers wanted to see if talking therapies or medicines could help. They compared these treatments to regular care. Regular care is the normal treatment young people get at hospitals or clinics.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This study is called a review. Researchers looked at 17 past studies. These studies tested different treatments. All studies were done properly to get good results.

**Who was in these studies?**

A total of 2,280 young people took part. Most were girls (about 9 out of 10). The average age was about 15 years old. All had hurt themselves within the past six months. All had gone to a hospital or clinic for help.

**What treatments were tested?**

Researchers looked at different talking therapies. These included:
- DBT-A (a therapy that teaches coping skills)
- CBT (a therapy that changes negative thoughts)
- MBT-A (a therapy about understanding feelings)
- Family therapy (treatment with family members)
- Group therapy (treatment with other young people)
- Other types of counseling

No studies tested medicines for this problem in young people.

**How long did the studies last?**

Researchers checked on young people for up to two years. They wanted to see if treatments stopped self-harm from happening again.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

DBT-A worked better than regular care. About 3 out of 10 young people in DBT-A hurt themselves again. About 4 out of 10 young people in regular care hurt themselves again. This difference was clear and reliable.

For CBT, results were unclear. Only two small studies tested this treatment. More research is needed.

For MBT-A, researchers could not be sure if it helped. The studies showed very different results from each other.

Family therapy did not seem to work better than regular care. About the same number of young people hurt themselves again in both groups.

Other treatments also did not show clear benefits. These included:
- Help to attend more therapy sessions
- Group therapy sessions
- Emergency cards to call for help
- Special assessment sessions

**What does this mean?**

DBT-A appears to help young people stop hurting themselves. This treatment teaches skills to handle strong feelings. It helps young people cope in healthier ways.

More research is needed for most other treatments. The studies were too small or had problems. This makes it hard to know what really works.

**What should happen next?**

Researchers should do more studies on DBT-A. They should also test CBT more. CBT helps adults who self-harm. It might help young people too, but we need better studies to know for sure.

**Important note:**

This review only looked at studies published up to July 2020. Newer studies may have been done since then.",10.1002-14651858.CD013667,"Interventions for children and adolescents who self‐harm
We have reviewed the international literature regarding psychosocial interventions, pharmacological (drug), and natural product (dietary supplementation) treatment trials in the field. A total of 17 trials meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. There is little evidence of beneficial effects for individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy, mentalisation‐based therapy for adolescents (MBT‐A), group‐based psychotherapy, enhanced assessment approaches, compliance enhancement approaches, family interventions, or remote contact interventions. There is some evidence of effectiveness for dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT‐A) for adolescents. However, few trials have been conducted and those that have are generally small, meaning that possible beneficial effects of some of these therapies cannot be ruled out. 
Why is this review important? 
Self‐harm (SH), which includes intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is strongly linked with suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed. There has been an increase in the use of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. It is therefore important to assess the evidence for their effectiveness. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Hospital administrators (e.g. service providers), health policy officers and third party payers (e.g. health insurers), clinicians working with patients who engage in SH, patients themselves, and their relatives. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review is an update of a previous Cochrane Review from 2015 which found little evidence of beneficial effects of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. This updated review aims to further evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of interventions for children and adolescents with SH with a broader range of outcomes. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of either psychosocial or drug treatments for children and adolescents up to 18 years of age who had recently engaged in SH. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There have been surprisingly few investigations of treatments for SH in children and adolescents, despite the size of this problem in many countries. We found positive effects of DBT‐A on repetition of SH. There is currently no clear evidence for the effectiveness of individual CBT‐based psychotherapy, MBT‐A, group‐based psychotherapy, enhanced assessment approaches, compliance enhancement approaches, family interventions, or remote contact interventions in preventing repetition of SH. 
What should happen next? 
We recommend further trials of DBT‐A. Given the evidence for its benefit for adults who engage in SH, individual CBT‐based psychotherapy should also be further developed and evaluated in children and adolescents. Given the extent of SH in children and adolescents, greater attention should be paid to the development and evaluation of specific therapies for this population.

Vulnerable days of the menstrual cycle for seizures are perimenstrually (C1 pattern), at ovulation (C2 pattern), and during the luteal phase (C3 pattern). A reduction in progesterone levels premenstrually and reduced secretion during the luteal phase is implicated in catamenial C1 and C3 patterns. A reduction in progesterone has been demonstrated to reduce sensitivity to the inhibitory neurotransmitter in preclinical studies, hence increasing risk of seizures. A pre‐ovulatory surge in oestrogen has been implicated in the C2 pattern of seizure exacerbation, although the exact mechanism by which this surge increases risk is uncertain. Current treatment practices include the use of pulsed hormonal (e.g. progesterone) and non‐hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) in women with regular menses, and complete cessation of menstruation using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone (Depo‐Provera) or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (triptorelin and goserelin)) in women with irregular menses. 
Catamenial epilepsy and seizure exacerbation is common in women with epilepsy. Women may not receive appropriate treatment for their seizures because of uncertainty regarding which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatment should be taken, as well as the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health. This review aims to address these issues to inform clinical practice and future research. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments for seizures exacerbated by the menstrual cycle in women with regular or irregular menses. We synthesised the evidence from randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments in women with catamenial epilepsy of any pattern. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases on 20 July 2021 for the latest update: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 19 July 2021). CRS Web includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the specialised registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Cochrane Epilepsy. We used no language restrictions. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional reports of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs and quasi‐RCTs of blinded or open‐label design that randomised participants individually (i.e. cluster‐randomised trials were excluded). We included cross‐over trials if each treatment period was at least 12 weeks in length and the trial had a suitable wash‐out period. We included the following types of interventions: women with any pattern of catamenial epilepsy who received a hormonal or non‐hormonal drug intervention in addition to an existing antiepileptic drug regimen for a minimum treatment duration of 12 weeks. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on study design factors and participant demographics for the included studies. The primary outcomes of interest were: proportion seizure‐free, proportion of responders (at least 50% decrease in seizure frequency from baseline), and change in seizure frequency. Secondary outcomes included: number of withdrawals, number of women experiencing adverse events of interest (seizure exacerbation, cardiac events, thromboembolic events, osteoporosis and bone health, mood disorders, sedation, menstrual cycle disorders, and fertility issues), and quality of life outcomes. 
Main results
Following title, abstract, and full‐text screening, we included eight full‐text articles reporting on four double‐blind, placebo‐controlled RCTs. We included two cross‐over RCTs of pulsed norethisterone, and two parallel RCTs of pulsed progesterone recruiting a total of 192 women aged between 13 and 45 years with catamenial epilepsy. We found no RCTs for non‐hormonal treatments of catamenial epilepsy or for women with irregular menses. 
Meta‐analysis was not possible for the primary outcomes, therefore we undertook a narrative synthesis. For the two RCTs evaluating norethisterone versus placebo (24 participants), there were no reported treatment differences for change in seizure frequency. Outcomes for the proportion seizure‐free and 50% responders were not reported. For the two RCTs evaluating progesterone versus placebo (168 participants), the studies reported conflicting results for the primary outcomes. One progesterone RCT reported no significant difference between progesterone 600 mg/day taken on day 14 to 28 and placebo with respect to 50% responders, seizure freedom rates, and change in seizure frequency for any seizure type. The other progesterone RCT reported a decrease in seizure frequency from baseline in the progesterone group that was significantly higher than the decrease in seizure frequency from baseline in the placebo group. 
The results of secondary efficacy outcomes showed no significant difference between groups in the pooled progesterone RCTs in terms of treatment withdrawal for any reason (pooled risk ratio (RR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 3.00, P = 0.18, I2 = 0%) or treatment withdrawals due to adverse events (pooled RR 2.91, 95% CI 0.53 to 16.17, P = 0.22, I2 = 0%). No treatment withdrawals were reported from the norethisterone RCTs. The RCTs reported limited information on adverse events, although one progesterone RCT reported no significant difference in the number of women experiencing adverse events (diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, headache, and depression). No studies reported on quality of life. 
We judged the evidence for outcomes related to the included progesterone RCTs to be of low to moderate certainty due to risk of bias, and for outcomes related to the included norethisterone RCTs to be of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and risk of bias. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides very low‐certainty evidence of no treatment difference between norethisterone and placebo, and moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence of no treatment difference between progesterone and placebo for catamenial epilepsy. However, as all the included studies were underpowered, important clinical effects cannot be ruled out. 
Our review highlights an overall deficiency in the literature base on the effectiveness of a wide range of other hormonal and non‐hormonal interventions currently being used in practice, particularly for those women who do not have regular menses. Further clinical trials are needed in this area. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Seizures That Worsen During the Menstrual Cycle

## Plain Title

Do hormone treatments or other drugs help women whose seizures get worse during their monthly period?

## Rationale

### What is catamenial epilepsy?

Some women with epilepsy notice their seizures get worse at certain times during their monthly period. This is called catamenial epilepsy. About 4 out of 10 women with epilepsy may have this problem.

Seizures can get worse at three different times:
- Just before and during the period
- Around the middle of the cycle when the body releases an egg
- During the two weeks before the period starts

### Why does this happen?

The body makes two main hormones during the monthly cycle: progesterone and estrogen. Changes in these hormone levels may trigger more seizures.

When progesterone levels drop, the brain may become more sensitive to seizures. When estrogen levels rise quickly, this may also increase seizure risk.

### Why was this study needed?

Many women with catamenial epilepsy do not get the right treatment. Doctors are not sure which treatments work best. They do not know when during the monthly cycle women should take these treatments.

Doctors also worry about side effects. Some treatments might affect a woman's ability to have children. They might change the monthly cycle. They might harm bone health or heart health.

This review looked at research studies to find out which treatments work and are safe.

## Trial Design

### How is this study designed?

The researchers searched medical databases for high-quality studies. They looked for studies that tested treatments for catamenial epilepsy.

They found four studies that met their standards. These studies included 192 women total. The women were between 13 and 45 years old. All had seizures that got worse during their monthly cycle.

Two studies tested a hormone called norethisterone. Two studies tested a hormone called progesterone. All studies compared the hormone treatment to a fake treatment (placebo).

The studies gave women the hormone treatment only during certain days of their cycle. This is called pulsed treatment.

Each woman stayed in the studies for at least 12 weeks.

The researchers did not find any studies testing:
- Non-hormone treatments like clobazam or acetazolamide
- Treatments for women with irregular periods

## Results

### What were the main results?

**Norethisterone studies (24 women):**
- These studies found no difference between norethisterone and placebo
- Seizure frequency did not improve with treatment
- The studies did not report if any women became seizure-free

**Progesterone studies (168 women):**
- The two studies had different results
- One study found no difference between progesterone and placebo
- The other study found that progesterone reduced seizures more than placebo
- Because the results disagreed, we cannot say if progesterone works

**Side effects:**
- About the same number of women stopped treatment in both groups
- One study reported common side effects like diarrhea, nausea, tiredness, dizziness, and headache
- These side effects happened at similar rates with progesterone and placebo
- No studies looked at quality of life

### What do these results mean?

The evidence does not clearly show that hormone treatments help women with catamenial epilepsy. However, all the studies were small. They may have missed important benefits or harms.

Many treatments used by doctors today were not tested in these studies. No studies looked at women with irregular periods.

### What happens next?

More research is needed. Future studies should:
- Include more women
- Test other hormone and non-hormone treatments
- Include women with irregular periods
- Measure quality of life

Until better evidence exists, doctors and women must make treatment decisions based on limited information.

Background 
Catamenial (menstrual) epilepsy describes a worsening of seizures in relation to the menstrual cycle and may affect around 40% of women with epilepsy. There are specific times within the menstrual cycle when women are most at risk: in the days leading up to a menstrual period and during a menstrual period (perimenstrual or catamenial type 1 pattern); at the time of ovulation (catamenial type 2 pattern); and in the second half of their cycle (luteal phase, or catamenial type 3 pattern). The reason for this increased risk may relate to changes in the levels of progesterone (a hormone released by the ovaries) around the time of a menstrual period and oestrogen (a female sex hormone) surge around ovulation. Studies in animals have demonstrated that lower progesterone may affect how the brain reacts to the brain chemical gamma‐Aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is important in preventing seizures. The link between high levels of oestrogen and risk of seizures remains unclear. 
Current treatment of catamenial epilepsy depends on whether a woman has regular or irregular menstrual periods. If a woman has regular periods, hormonal (e.g. progesterone supplements) and non‐hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) taken prior to and during a period may be used. In women who do not have regular periods, and who therefore cannot predict their period days, stopping periods using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone (Depo‐Provera) or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (triptorelin and goserelin)) are treatment options. 
Catamenial epilepsy is common in women with epilepsy, and may have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Women may not receive appropriate treatment for their catamenial seizures. There is uncertainty regarding which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatments should be taken. There are also concerns about the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health. This review aimed to address these issues in order to inform clinical practice and future research. 
Objectives 
The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments in stopping seizures in women with catamenial epilepsy. 
Methods 
We searched electronic databases to find relevant studies in which treatment was continued for at least 12 weeks. Our outcomes of interest were: average change in seizures, percentage of women achieving a reduction in seizures by at least 50%, and percentage of women who became seizure‐free. We also examined the reasons why women dropped out of the studies and any reported side effects. 
Results 
We included four randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of hormonal treatments in the review, two trials evaluating progesterone and two evaluating norethisterone. In all of these studies, the treatment was compared to a placebo (a harmless sugar pill). We did not find any studies testing non‐hormonal treatments or any studies in women with irregular periods. The four included studies involved a total of 192 women aged between 13 and 45 years experiencing catamenial epilepsy. The included studies did not demonstrate any significant differences between groups when comparing progesterone or norethisterone to placebo for seizure outcomes. The included studies reported limited information on side effects, but women taking progesterone were no more likely to withdraw from the study due to side effects than those receiving placebo. 
The evidence is current to July 2021.
Certainty of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low to moderate, as the included studies provided unclear information on methods of blinding, recruited small numbers of participants, and were inconsistent in reporting treatment outcomes. 
Conclusions 
We found very limited, mostly low‐certainty evidence, of no difference in seizure outcomes for norethisterone and progesterone versus placebo in women with catamenial epilepsy. Our review highlights an overall lack of information on the effectiveness of a wide range of other hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments currently being used. Further studies in women with catamenial epilepsy are needed in this area.

Key messages 
· Covering one eye with a patch improves the eye co‐ordination of children with intermittent exotropia more effectively than regular monitoring by an eye specialist. 
· Few studies have compared other treatments for intermittent exotropia, and those that have do not provide clear answers about their benefits and risks. 
· Well‐conducted studies are needed in this area to improve the management of intermittent exotropia. 
What is intermittent exotropia? 
Intermittent exotropia is an eye condition that develops in the first year of life. It causes one or both eyes to turn out toward the ear, typically when a child looks into the distance, daydreams, is tired, or is in bright sunlight. Only one eye turns out at a time, while the other eye points straight forwards. This can happen infrequently, or regularly throughout the day. 
What treatments are available for intermittent exotropia? 
Regular monitoring (observation) by an eye specialist may be all that is needed when a child’s eyes point in the same direction most of the time, or when intermittent exotropia does not affect vision. 
For children with more severe intermittent exotropia, several treatments are available, including: 
· eye exercises, to improve a child’s control over their eye movements;
· glasses, to encourage the eyes to work together;
· eye muscle surgery, to adjust the position of the eyes; and
· covering one eye with a patch, to strengthen the other eye.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out:
· which treatment works best for intermittent exotropia; and
· whether treatments cause any unwanted (adverse) effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared different treatments for intermittent exotropia against each other. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 6 studies that involved a total of 890 people who were mostly children aged 12 months to 10 years. The studies followed people for between six months and three years, and took place in the USA (four studies), India (one study), and Turkey (one study). The studies compared: 
· patching against observation (two studies); and
· different treatments involving surgery (four studies).
Patching compared to observation 
The evidence:
· shows that patching is better than observation for improving eye co‐ordination; and 
· suggests that patching and observation may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision. 
Different surgical procedures 
The evidence suggests that:
· surgery on the muscles that control the outward movement of both eyes is probably better for improving eye co‐ordination than surgery on the muscles that control both inward and outward movement in one eye; 
· these two procedures may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision and quality of life, and may lead to similar numbers of adverse effects (such as small lumps under the skin); and 
· there may be little to no difference in effect on eye co‐ordination when looking at distant objects between surgical procedures on the inside of the eye (‘plication’ and ‘resection’) when combined with surgery on the outside of the eye. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The evidence is based on a small number of studies, and several studies may have used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. In general, the studies provided limited information about the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia. For example, they often did not investigate adverse effects or effects on sharpness of vision at a distance and quality of life. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is current to January 2021.
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Comparing Treatments for a Childhood Eye Problem Where One Eye Turns Outward

## Rationale

### What is the condition?
Some children develop an eye problem called intermittent exotropia. This starts in the first year of life. One eye turns outward toward the ear while the other eye looks straight ahead. This happens on and off, not all the time. It often occurs when a child looks far away, feels tired, daydreams, or is in bright sunlight. Only one eye turns out at a time.

### Why is this a problem?
This eye problem can affect how well a child sees. It can also impact their daily life. The eyes need to work together for good vision.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors use several treatments for this eye problem. These include watching and waiting, eye patches, glasses, eye exercises, and surgery. Researchers wanted to find out which treatment works best. They also wanted to know if treatments cause any harmful effects.

### What did researchers hope to learn?
Researchers wanted to answer two main questions. First, which treatment works best for children with this eye problem? Second, do any treatments cause unwanted side effects?

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked for studies that compared different treatments. They found 6 studies with 890 people total. Most people in the studies were children. The children were between 12 months and 10 years old.

### Where did the studies take place?
Four studies happened in the USA. One study took place in India. One study was done in Turkey.

### How long did the studies last?
The studies followed children for 6 months to 3 years.

### What treatments did the studies compare?
Two studies compared eye patches to just watching and waiting. Four studies compared different types of eye surgery.

## Results

### What did researchers find about eye patches?
Researchers found that eye patches work better than just watching and waiting. Patches help improve how well the eyes work together. Both patches and watching may work about the same for how clearly children see things up close.

### What did researchers find about surgery?
Researchers looked at different types of eye surgery. They found several things:

Surgery on both eyes may work better than surgery on just one eye. The surgery on both eyes fixes the muscles that move the eyes outward. The surgery on one eye fixes muscles that move the eye both inward and outward.

Both types of surgery may work about the same for several things. These include how clearly children see things up close. They also include quality of life. Both surgeries may cause about the same number of side effects. Side effects can include small bumps under the skin.

Two different surgery methods on the inside of the eye may work about the same. Both are combined with surgery on the outside of the eye. These methods are called plication and resection. They may have similar effects on how well eyes work together when looking at distant objects.

### What are the limits of these findings?
The evidence has some problems. There were only a few studies. Some studies may have had errors in how they were done. The studies did not give much information about some important things. For example, many did not report side effects. Many did not check how clearly children could see distant objects. Many did not measure quality of life.

### What do researchers conclude?
Eye patches help children with this eye problem more than just watching and waiting. More good studies are needed. These studies should compare other treatments. Better studies will help doctors know the best way to treat children with this eye problem.

### How current is this information?
Researchers looked for studies up to January 2021.

243,10.1002-14651858.CD012470.pub2-abstract.txt,"Interventions for treating wrist fractures (broken wrists) in children
Background and aim 
Wrist fractures are the most common bone injury in children. Most are buckle (or torus) fractures, where the bone surface bulges out. These minor fractures heal well. They are often treated with a wrist splint or a below‐elbow plaster cast.  More serious fractures are where the bone breaks, generally resulting in displacement of the bone parts. Usually the bone is manipulated back into place ('reduction'), followed by cast immobilisation, often with an above‐elbow cast including the elbow. When considered, surgery generally involves placing wires through the skin and into the bone (percutaneous wiring). 
We aimed to assess the best‐quality evidence for different treatments of wrist fractures in children. 
Results of the search 
We searched medical databases up to May 2018 and included 30 studies with 2930 children. Studies included more male children and reported mean ages between eight and 10 years. We summarise the results from five key comparisons. 
Key results 
Six studies compared a removable splint with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. One study found there may be little or no difference between the two devices in physical function at four weeks. Few children needed a change or reapplication of either splint or cast (4 studies). There were no refractures. We are uncertain whether there is any difference in pain during device use. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate time to return to former activities (recovery time), minor complications, and child or parent satisfaction. Two studies found lower healthcare costs for splints. 
Four studies compared a soft or elasticated bandage with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. We are uncertain if there is less disability at four weeks after bandaging. Few children changed device or needed extended immobilisation (3 studies). There were no serious adverse events. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate recovery time, wrist pain, minor complications, and satisfaction. Children found the bandage more convenient (1 study). 
Two studies (mainly buckle fractures) compared cast removal at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (a cast saw was not required for home removal). All had recovered function at four weeks (1 study). There were few treatment changes and no serious adverse effects. Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There may be no difference in pain at four weeks (1 study). There may be greater parental satisfaction for cast removal at home (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. 
Four studies compared below‐elbow versus above‐elbow casts in usually displaced fractures. We are uncertain if children are less dependent on help when using below‐elbow casts. We are uncertain if there is a difference between the two casts in physical function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain about the finding that all children with above‐elbow casts needed another fracture reduction. There were no serious adverse events. Recovery time and minor complications were not reported. There may be little difference in needing physiotherapy for stiffness. Pain at one week may be less for below‐elbow casts (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for below‐elbow casts. 
Five studies compared percutaneous wiring and above‐elbow cast immobilisation versus above‐elbow cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures. Short‐term physical function was not reported. There may be no between‐group difference in function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain whether surgery reduces the risk of treatment failure, defined as early or difficult removal of wires, and remanipulation for loss in position. We are uncertain whether there are fewer serious adverse events with surgery. Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There may be less need for physiotherapy after surgery. One USA study found treatment costs were similar. 
Quality of the evidence 
All 30 studies had weaknesses that could affect the reliability of their results. We considered the evidence for all outcomes to be low or very low quality. 
Conclusion 
There is not enough evidence to determine the best ways of treating different types of wrist fractures in children. However, the review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for buckle fractures. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Broken Wrists in Children

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Treatments for Broken Wrists in Children

## Rationale

**What is a broken wrist?**
A broken wrist is the most common bone injury in children. There are two main types:

1. **Buckle fractures** (also called torus fractures): These are minor breaks. The bone surface bulges out but does not break all the way through. These heal well on their own.

2. **Displaced fractures**: These are more serious breaks. The bone breaks completely and the pieces move out of place.

**Why is this a problem?**
Broken wrists cause pain and make it hard for children to use their hands. Children need treatment to help the bone heal properly.

**What treatments are available?**
Doctors use different treatments:
- Removable splints (a support that can be taken off)
- Bandages
- Casts (hard coverings that cannot be removed)
- Surgery (putting wires through the skin into the bone)

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors needed to know which treatment works best for children. This study looked at all the research to find the best evidence.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers searched medical records up to May 2018. They found 30 studies with 2,930 children total.

**Who was in these studies?**
- Most children were boys
- Average age was 8 to 10 years old
- All had broken wrists

**What did researchers compare?**
They looked at five main treatment comparisons:
1. Removable splints versus casts (for minor breaks)
2. Bandages versus casts (for minor breaks)
3. Removing casts at home versus at the hospital
4. Short casts versus long casts (for serious breaks)
5. Surgery with wires versus casts alone (for serious breaks)

## Results

**What did the studies find?**

**For minor buckle fractures:**

*Splints versus casts (6 studies):*
- Children could use their wrists about the same after 4 weeks
- Very few children needed their device changed
- No bones broke again
- Splints cost less money than casts

*Bandages versus casts (4 studies):*
- Results were unclear about which worked better
- Very few children needed their device changed
- No serious problems occurred
- Children liked bandages better because they were easier to use

*Removing casts at home versus hospital (2 studies):*
- All children recovered well by 4 weeks
- Very few treatment changes were needed
- No serious problems occurred
- Parents were happier removing casts at home
- Home removal cost less money

**For serious displaced fractures:**

*Short casts versus long casts (4 studies):*
- Results were unclear about which worked better
- No serious problems occurred
- Pain might be less with short casts after 1 week
- Short casts cost less money

*Surgery with wires versus casts alone (5 studies):*
- Results were unclear about which worked better after 6 months
- It was unclear if surgery reduced treatment failures
- Children might need less physical therapy after surgery
- Costs were about the same

**Important note about the evidence:**
All 30 studies had weaknesses. This means we cannot be completely sure about the results. Researchers rated the quality of evidence as low or very low.

**What do these results mean?**

The researchers could not say for certain which treatment is best. However, the findings support using simpler treatments like splints or bandages instead of casts for minor buckle fractures.

More high-quality research is needed. Future studies should be better designed to give clearer answers about the best treatments for broken wrists in children.",10.1002-14651858.CD012470,"Interventions for treating wrist fractures (broken wrists) in children
Background and aim 
Wrist fractures are the most common bone injury in children. Most are buckle (or torus) fractures, where the bone surface bulges out. These minor fractures heal well. They are often treated with a wrist splint or a below‐elbow plaster cast.  More serious fractures are where the bone breaks, generally resulting in displacement of the bone parts. Usually the bone is manipulated back into place ('reduction'), followed by cast immobilisation, often with an above‐elbow cast including the elbow. When considered, surgery generally involves placing wires through the skin and into the bone (percutaneous wiring). 
We aimed to assess the best‐quality evidence for different treatments of wrist fractures in children. 
Results of the search 
We searched medical databases up to May 2018 and included 30 studies with 2930 children. Studies included more male children and reported mean ages between eight and 10 years. We summarise the results from five key comparisons. 
Key results 
Six studies compared a removable splint with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. One study found there may be little or no difference between the two devices in physical function at four weeks. Few children needed a change or reapplication of either splint or cast (4 studies). There were no refractures. We are uncertain whether there is any difference in pain during device use. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate time to return to former activities (recovery time), minor complications, and child or parent satisfaction. Two studies found lower healthcare costs for splints. 
Four studies compared a soft or elasticated bandage with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. We are uncertain if there is less disability at four weeks after bandaging. Few children changed device or needed extended immobilisation (3 studies). There were no serious adverse events. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate recovery time, wrist pain, minor complications, and satisfaction. Children found the bandage more convenient (1 study). 
Two studies (mainly buckle fractures) compared cast removal at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (a cast saw was not required for home removal). All had recovered function at four weeks (1 study). There were few treatment changes and no serious adverse effects. Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There may be no difference in pain at four weeks (1 study). There may be greater parental satisfaction for cast removal at home (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. 
Four studies compared below‐elbow versus above‐elbow casts in usually displaced fractures. We are uncertain if children are less dependent on help when using below‐elbow casts. We are uncertain if there is a difference between the two casts in physical function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain about the finding that all children with above‐elbow casts needed another fracture reduction. There were no serious adverse events. Recovery time and minor complications were not reported. There may be little difference in needing physiotherapy for stiffness. Pain at one week may be less for below‐elbow casts (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for below‐elbow casts. 
Five studies compared percutaneous wiring and above‐elbow cast immobilisation versus above‐elbow cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures. Short‐term physical function was not reported. There may be no between‐group difference in function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain whether surgery reduces the risk of treatment failure, defined as early or difficult removal of wires, and remanipulation for loss in position. We are uncertain whether there are fewer serious adverse events with surgery. Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There may be less need for physiotherapy after surgery. One USA study found treatment costs were similar. 
Quality of the evidence 
All 30 studies had weaknesses that could affect the reliability of their results. We considered the evidence for all outcomes to be low or very low quality. 
Conclusion 
There is not enough evidence to determine the best ways of treating different types of wrist fractures in children. However, the review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for buckle fractures.

","# Plain Language Summary: Ways to Reduce Injuries in Construction Workers

## Plain Title
Testing Different Safety Methods to Prevent Injuries in Construction Workers

## Rationale

### What is the problem?
Construction workers get hurt on the job more than workers in most other types of jobs. These injuries can cause pain, time off work, and long-term health problems. This makes life harder for workers and their families.

### Why was this study needed?
Many groups suggest ways to keep construction workers safe. These include safety rules, training classes, and new equipment. However, we do not know which of these methods actually work best. Researchers needed to look at all the studies done on this topic. They wanted to find out which safety methods truly help reduce injuries.

### What did researchers want to learn?
The researchers wanted to answer one main question: Which safety methods work best to prevent construction workers from getting hurt on the job?

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not a single study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at many different studies that had already been done. They searched for all published research about preventing construction worker injuries. They looked at studies published up to April 2017.

### What did the researchers review?
The researchers examined 17 different studies. These studies tested various safety methods, including:
- New safety laws and rules
- Safety campaigns to teach workers
- Training programs
- Safety inspections at work sites
- Health services for workers
- Money given to companies to buy safer equipment

### Who was included?
The studies looked at construction workers of different ages and backgrounds. The workers were doing regular construction jobs.

### How long did the studies last?
Each study lasted different amounts of time. Some tracked workers for months. Others followed them for years.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

The researchers found that most safety methods have not been tested well enough. The quality of evidence was very low. This means we cannot be sure about what works.

Here is what they learned:

**Methods that may work:**
- Programs that use many different safety steps together may help reduce injuries
- Giving companies money to buy better equipment, like safer scaffolding, may help reduce injuries
- Programs at individual companies that combine safety campaigns with drug-free workplace rules may help

**Methods that may not work well:**
- Making new safety laws alone may not reduce injuries
- Regional programs like safety campaigns, training, inspections, or health services may not reduce injuries when used alone

### Why are the results important?

These findings show that simple, single solutions do not work well. Using many safety methods together works better than using just one method.

The results also show a big problem. Most safety methods that experts recommend have not been tested properly. We do not have good proof that they work.

### What do the results mean?

Construction sites need better ways to make sure workers and bosses follow safety rules. Just having rules is not enough. Companies need to use several safety methods at the same time.

More research is needed. Scientists must test the safety methods that people use every day. This will help us know what truly keeps workers safe.

### Main conclusions

Workers get hurt less when companies use many safety methods together. Giving companies money for safer equipment may also help. However, we need much more research. Most safety methods used today have not been proven to work. Better studies will help protect construction workers in the future.

245,10.1002-14651858.CD013230-abstract.txt,"Background
Oral poisoning is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide, with estimates of over 100,000 deaths due to unintentional poisoning each year and an overrepresentation of children below five years of age. Any effective intervention that laypeople can apply to limit or delay uptake or to evacuate, dilute or neutralize the poison before professional help arrives may limit toxicity and save lives. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of pre‐hospital interventions (alone or in combination) for treating acute oral poisoning, available to and feasible for laypeople before the arrival of professional help. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and three clinical trials registries to 4 December 2018, and we also carried out reference checking and citation searching. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials comparing interventions (alone or in combination) that are feasible in a pre‐hospital setting for treating acute oral poisoning patients, including but potentially not limited to activated charcoal (AC), emetics, cathartics, diluents, neutralizing agents and body positioning. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, data collection and assessment. Primary outcomes of this review were incidence of mortality and adverse events, plus incidence and severity of symptoms of poisoning. Secondary outcomes were duration of symptoms of poisoning, drug absorption, and incidence of hospitalization and ICU admission. 
Main results
We included 24 trials involving 7099 participants. Using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, we assessed no study as being at low risk of bias for all domains. Many studies were poorly reported, so the risk of selection and detection biases were often unclear. Most studies reported important outcomes incompletely, and we judged them to be at high risk of reporting bias. 
All but one study enrolled oral poisoning patients in an emergency department; the remaining study was conducted in a pre‐hospital setting. Fourteen studies included multiple toxic syndromes or did not specify, while the other studies specifically investigated paracetamol (2 studies), carbamazepine (2 studies), tricyclic antidepressant (2 studies), yellow oleander (2 studies), benzodiazepine (1 study), or toxic berry intoxication (1 study). Twenty‐one trials investigated the effects of activated charcoal (AC), administered as a single dose (SDAC) or in multiple doses (MDAC), alone or in combination with other first aid interventions (a cathartic) and/or hospital treatments. Six studies investigated syrup of ipecac plus other first aid interventions (SDAC + cathartic) versus ipecac alone. The collected evidence was mostly of low to very low certainty, often downgraded for indirectness, risk of bias or imprecision due to low numbers of events. 
First aid interventions that limit or delay the absorption of the poison in the body 
We are uncertain about the effect of SDAC compared to no intervention on the incidence of adverse events in general (zero events in both treatment groups; 1 study, 451 participants) or vomiting specifically (Peto odds ratio (OR) 4.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 57.26, 1 study, 25 participants), ICU admission (Peto OR 7.77, 95% CI 0.15 to 391.93, 1 study, 451 participants) and clinical deterioration (zero events in both treatment groups; 1 study, 451 participants) in participants with mixed types or paracetamol poisoning, as all evidence for these outcomes was of very low certainty. No studies assessed SDAC for mortality, duration of symptoms, drug absorption or hospitalization. 
Only one study compared SDAC to syrup of ipecac in participants with mixed types of poisoning, providing very low‐certainty evidence. Therefore we are uncertain about the effects on Glasgow Coma Scale scores (mean difference (MD) −0.15, 95% CI −0.43 to 0.13, 1 study, 34 participants) or incidence of adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% CI 0.26 to 5.83, 1 study, 34 participants). No information was available concerning mortality, duration of symptoms, drug absorption, hospitalization or ICU admission. 
This review also considered the added value of SDAC or MDAC to hospital interventions, which mostly included gastric lavage. No included studies investigated the use of body positioning in oral poisoning patients. 
First aid interventions that evacuate the poison from the gastrointestinal tract 
We found one study comparing ipecac versus no intervention in toxic berry ingestion in a pre‐hospital setting. Low‐certainty evidence suggests there may be an increase in the incidence of adverse events, but the study did not report incidence of mortality, incidence or duration of symptoms of poisoning, drug absorption, hospitalization or ICU admission (103 participants). 
In addition, we also considered the added value of syrup of ipecac to SDAC plus a cathartic and the added value of a cathartic to SDAC. 
No studies used cathartics as an individual intervention.
First aid interventions that neutralize or dilute the poison 
No included studies investigated the neutralization or dilution of the poison in oral poisoning patients. 
Authors' conclusions
The studies included in this review provided mostly low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence about the use of first aid interventions for acute oral poisoning. A key limitation was the fact that only one included study actually took place in a pre‐hospital setting, which undermines our confidence in the applicability of these results to this setting. Thus, the amount of evidence collected was insufficient to draw any conclusions. 
","# Plain Language Summary: First Aid Treatments for Swallowing Poison

## Plain Title

Can first aid treatments help people who have swallowed poison before they reach the hospital?

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Swallowing poison is a serious problem around the world. More than 100,000 people die each year from accidentally swallowing poison. Young children under 5 years old are especially at risk. When someone swallows poison, getting help quickly is very important.

**Why was this study needed?**

The time before a person reaches the hospital is critical. If family members or other people nearby could give safe first aid treatments, they might be able to:
- Stop the poison from entering the body
- Remove the poison from the stomach
- Make the poison less harmful
- Reduce how much poison the body absorbs

These actions could save lives and prevent serious harm. However, doctors need to know which first aid treatments actually work and are safe for regular people to use.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to learn if first aid treatments given before reaching the hospital help people who swallow poison. They looked at treatments that regular people (not doctors or nurses) could safely give.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at 24 different studies that had already been done. Together, these studies included 7,099 people.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included people of different ages who had swallowed poison. The poisons included:
- Pain medicines like paracetamol
- Medicines for seizures or depression
- Plant poisons
- Other harmful substances

Some studies looked at many different types of poisoning. Others focused on just one type.

**What treatments did researchers look at?**

The main treatments studied were:

1. **Activated charcoal** - A black powder mixed with water that can trap poison in the stomach
2. **Syrup of ipecac** - A liquid that makes people vomit to remove poison from the stomach
3. **Cathartics** - Medicines that help move things through the intestines faster
4. **Body positioning** - How a person sits or lies down

**Important limitation:**

Only 1 out of 24 studies actually tested treatments before people reached the hospital. The other 23 studies tested treatments after people arrived at the emergency room. This is a major problem because this review wanted to know about treatments given before reaching the hospital.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not draw clear conclusions. Here is what they found:

**About activated charcoal:**

Researchers are uncertain if giving activated charcoal helps or causes harm. The studies did not provide enough good information to know if it:
- Prevents death
- Reduces symptoms
- Causes side effects
- Reduces hospital stays

**About syrup of ipecac:**

One small study looked at syrup of ipecac for children who ate toxic berries. The treatment may have caused more side effects like vomiting. However, the evidence was weak. Researchers could not tell if it helped or harmed patients overall.

**About other treatments:**

No studies looked at:
- Giving water or other liquids to dilute poison
- Giving substances to neutralize poison
- Positioning the body in special ways

**Why was the evidence weak?**

The studies had several problems:
- Most studies happened in hospitals, not before reaching the hospital
- Many studies were small
- Studies did not always measure important outcomes like death or serious symptoms
- The quality of how studies were done was often poor

**What do these results mean?**

Researchers do not have enough good evidence to recommend specific first aid treatments for people who swallow poison. More research is needed, especially research that tests treatments in real pre-hospital settings with regular people giving the first aid.

**What should people do?**

If someone swallows poison, call emergency services or a poison control center immediately. Follow their instructions. Do not give treatments unless poison control experts tell you to do so.",10.1002-14651858.CD013230,"First aid treatments for oral poisoning
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of first aid treatments for poisoning that could be feasibly given by people who are not health professionals. 
Background 
Many first aid treatments are recommended for treating people who have ingested poisonous substances. Some treatments, such as activated charcoal (AC), bind to the poison, limiting the body's absorption of it. Others may induce vomiting (such as syrup of ipecac) or dilute or neutralize the poison (such as drinking water, milk or juices). Adjusting the person's body position may also have an effect. 
Study characteristics 
In December 2018 we searched for high‐quality studies (randomly dividing participants into different treatment groups) investigating treatments for poisoning that laypeople can perform. We found 24 studies with 7099 participants. All but one study took place in hospitals; the remaining one was in a home setting. 
Fourteen studies either did not specify the type of poison or studied different kinds. The others investigated overdoses of specific medicines (paracetamol, carbamazepine, antidepressant, benzodiazepine) or poisonous plants (yellow oleander or poisonous berries). 
Twenty‐one trials studied different treatments with activated charcoal: as a single dose or multiple doses, with or without other first aid treatments (a substance to speed up bowel transit), and with or without hospital treatments. Six studies compared syrup of ipecac, with or without other first aid treatments (single‐dose activated charcoal plus bowel transit enhancing substance) versus no treatment. We found no studies that investigated the neutralization or dilution of the poison or the use of certain body positions. 
Key results 
Two studies compared a single dose of activated charcoal to no treatment following poisoning with paracetamol or different kinds of poisoning. We are uncertain about the treatment's side effects, admission to intensive care or worsening of the patient, and there was no information about effects on death, symptom duration, poison uptake or hospitalization. 
One study compared a single dose of activated charcoal to ipecac in mixed types of poisoning. We are uncertain about the effect of activated charcoal compared to ipecac, on the patient's level of coma or the number of unwanted effects. There was no information about effects on death, symptom duration, poison uptake, hospitalization or intensive care admission. 
One study compared ipecac to no treatment in children who ate poisonous berries at home. There may be an increase in the number of unwanted effects for ipecac. There was no information about effects on death, poisoning symptoms, symptoms duration, poison uptake, hospitalization or intensive care admission. 
We also investigated the use of single‐dose or multi‐dose activated charcoal, with or without hospital treatment, compared to each other or no treatment. Furthermore, we investigated the added value of ipecac to single‐dose activated charcoal and the added value of adding bowel transit enhancing substances to AC. 
Certainty of the evidence 
All but one study took place in a hospital setting, which means that the results cannot be directly applied to the lay setting. Because studies did not always report the methods they used, we are uncertain about the quality of the research conduct for many. Outcomes important to patients and pre‐specified by us as important outcomes for this review were often absent or incompletely reported. Our certainty about the results of this review is mostly low to very low. Therefore future research is highly likely to change the findings. 
Conclusion 
Based on the identified evidence, we cannot draw any conclusions about the effects of any of the investigated first aid treatments in a lay setting.

Viral load (VL) testing in people living with HIV (PLHIV) helps to monitor antiretroviral therapy (ART). VL is still largely tested using central laboratory‐based platforms, which have long test turnaround times and involve sophisticated equipment. VL tests with point‐of‐care (POC) platforms capable of being used near the patient are potentially easy to use, give quick results, are cost‐effective, and could replace central or reference VL testing platforms. 
Objectives
To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of POC tests to detect high viral load levels in PLHIV attending healthcare facilities. 
Search methods
We searched eight electronic databases using standard, extensive Cochrane search methods, and did not use any language, document type, or publication status limitations. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and consulted an expert in the field from the World Health Organization (WHO) HIV Department for potentially relevant studies. The latest search was 23 November 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included any primary study that compared the results of a VL test with a POC platform to that of a central laboratory‐based reference test to detect high viral load in PLHIV on HIV/AIDS care or follow‐up. We included all forms of POC tests for VL as defined by study authors, regardless of the healthcare facility in which the test was conducted. We excluded diagnostic case‐control studies with healthy controls and studies that did not provide sufficient data to create the 2 × 2 tables to calculate sensitivity and specificity. We did not limit our study inclusion to age, gender, or geographical setting. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the search results to identify eligible articles. They also independently extracted data using a standardized data extraction form and conducted risk of bias assessment using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool. Using participants as the unit of analysis, we fitted simplified univariable models for sensitivity and specificity separately, employing a random‐effects model to estimate the summary sensitivity and specificity at the current and commonly reported World Health Organization (WHO) threshold (≥ 1000 copies/mL). The bivariate models did not converge to give a model estimate. 
Main results
We identified 18 studies (24 evaluations, 10,034 participants) defining high viral loads at main thresholds ≥ 1000 copies/mL (n = 20), ≥ 5000 copies/mL (n = 1), and ≥ 40 copies/mL (n = 3). All evaluations were done on samples from PLHIV retrieved from routine HIV/AIDS care centres or health facilities. For clinical applicability, we included 14 studies (20 evaluations, 8659 participants) assessing high viral load at the clinical threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL in the meta‐analyses. Of these, sub‐Saharan Africa, Europe, and Asia contributed 16, three, and one evaluation respectively. All included participants were on ART in only nine evaluations; in the other 11 evaluations the proportion of participants on ART was either partial or not clearly stated. Thirteen evaluations included adults only (n = 13), five mixed populations of adults and children, whilst in the remaining two the age of included populations was not clearly stated. The majority of evaluations included commercially available tests (n = 18). Ten evaluations were POC VL tests conducted near the patient in a peripheral or onsite laboratory, whilst the other 10 were evaluations of POC VL tests in a central or reference laboratory setting. The test types evaluated as POC VL tests included Xpert HIV‐1 Viral Load test (n = 8), SAMBA HIV‐1 Semi‐Q Test (n = 9), Alere Q NAT prototype assay for HIV‐1 (n = 2) and m‐PIMA HIV‐1/2 Viral Load test (n = 1). The majority of evaluations (n = 17) used plasma samples, whilst the rest (n = 3) utilized whole blood samples. 
Pooled sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI)) of POC VL at a threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL was 96.6% (94.8 to 97.8) (20 evaluations, 2522 participants), and pooled specificity (95% CI) was 95.7% (90.8 to 98.0) (20 evaluations, 6137 participants). Median prevalence for high viral load (≥ 1000 copies/mL) (n = 20) was 33.4% (range 6.9% to 88.5%). 
Limitations 
The risk of bias was mostly assessed as unclear across the four domains due to incomplete reporting. 
Authors' conclusions
We found POC VL to have high sensitivity and high specificity for the diagnosis of high HIV viral load in PLHIV attending healthcare facilities at a clinical threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Point-of-Care Tests for Measuring HIV Viral Load

## Plain Title

How Well Do Quick HIV Tests Work to Measure Virus Levels in People's Blood?

## Rationale

**What is HIV and why does viral load matter?**

HIV is a virus that attacks the body's defense system. People living with HIV take daily medicines called ART (antiretroviral therapy) to control the virus. Doctors need to check if these medicines are working well.

**What is viral load?**

Viral load means the amount of HIV virus in a person's blood. When the viral load is high (1000 copies or more per milliliter of blood), it means the medicines may not be working well. The person may need different treatment.

**The current problem**

Right now, most viral load tests happen in big central labs. Blood samples must be sent away. Results can take weeks to come back. The equipment is complex and expensive. Many patients never get their results or must make extra trips to the clinic.

**Why this study was needed**

Scientists wanted to know if newer ""point-of-care"" tests work well. These are quick tests done right at the clinic while the patient waits. Results come back in 1 to 2 hours instead of weeks. If these quick tests work well, more patients could get faster results and better care.

**What the researchers wanted to find out**

The researchers asked: Do these quick point-of-care tests correctly identify when someone has high viral load? They compared the quick tests to the standard lab tests to see if they gave the same answers.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. The researchers looked at 18 different studies done by other scientists. They combined all the results together to get a bigger picture.

**Who was included?**

The studies included 10,034 people living with HIV. Most were adults. Some studies included both adults and children. Most people were taking HIV medicines. The studies came from many countries, mostly from Africa (16 studies), but also from Europe (3 studies) and Asia (1 study).

**What tests were checked?**

The researchers looked at four types of quick tests:
- Xpert HIV-1 Viral Load test
- SAMBA HIV-1 Semi-Q Test
- Alere Q NAT test
- m-PIMA HIV-1/2 Viral Load test

**Where were tests done?**

Half the tests were done right at local clinics near patients. The other half were done in central labs but using the quick test machines.

**What samples were used?**

Most tests (17 out of 20) used plasma from blood. Three tests used whole blood.

**Time period**

The researchers searched for studies up to November 2020.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The quick point-of-care tests worked very well.

**Main findings:**

When viral load was high (1000 copies or more):
- The quick tests correctly found high viral load 97 times out of 100 (sensitivity: 96.6%)
- The quick tests correctly found normal viral load 96 times out of 100 (specificity: 95.7%)

**What this means for patients:**

These quick tests are very accurate. They rarely miss high viral loads. They rarely give false alarms. Patients can trust these test results.

**Benefits of quick tests:**

- Results come back the same day
- Patients don't need to make extra clinic visits
- Doctors can change treatment right away if needed
- Tests can reach more people in remote areas
- Less expensive than sending samples to big labs

**Why this matters:**

About 1 in 3 people tested had high viral load. Finding these people quickly helps them get better treatment faster. This keeps them healthier and prevents spreading HIV to others.

**What the researchers concluded:**

Point-of-care viral load tests work very well. They can replace the old lab tests. They correctly identify when someone has high viral load. Clinics should consider using these quick tests to help more patients get faster results and better care.

**Study limitations:**

Some studies did not report all details clearly. This made it hard to judge if the studies were done perfectly. However, the overall results were still very strong and reliable.",10.1002-14651858.CD013208,"Point‐of‐care tests for detecting high viral load in people living with HIV attending healthcare facilities 
Why is improving the diagnosis of high HIV viral load infection important? 
It helps to monitor the HIV virus levels in people living with HIV (PLHIV) who are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). High virus levels indicate that the medications are failing to suppress the virus, a condition known as ART treatment failure, which has a risk of severe illness and death. Rapid diagnostic tests that detect high HIV virus levels quickly near the patient (point‐of‐care) can increase access to early changes in ART. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of point‐of‐care (POC) tests for diagnosing high HIV virus levels in PLHIV attending healthcare facilities. 
What was studied in this review? 
Point‐of‐care tests for viral load detection with results measured against central laboratory tests (reference test). We included all forms of tests with POC platforms for VL regardless of the healthcare facility in which the test was conducted. 
What are the main results in this review? 
Fourteen studies that completed 20 evaluations involving 8659 participants compared molecular POC tests for diagnosing high virus levels at the clinically recommended positivity threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL. 
What are the strengths and limitations of this review? 
The review included sufficient studies done on samples from PLHIV retrieved from routine HIV/AIDS care centres or health facilities, but it was unclear if all included participants were on ART. Also, none of the included tests was a true POC test conducted at the patient's side: half of the included studies (n = 10) evaluated POC tests in onsite laboratories near the patient, and the other half were tests with POC platforms evaluated in a central or reference laboratory (n = 10). 
To whom do the results of this review apply? 
PLHIV with suspected high viral loads attending healthcare facilities.
What are the implications of this review? 
In theory, for a population of 1000 PLHIV where 100 have high virus levels, 136 people would receive a positive result with the molecular POC test; of these, 39 will not have high viral levels (false‐positive result) and would be incorrectly identified as not responding to ART treatment, possibly leading to unnecessary testing or further treatment; and 864 would receive a negative test result with the molecular POC test; of these, three will actually have high virus levels (false‐negative result) and would be missed whilst failing ART treatment. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 23 November 2020.

247,10.1002-14651858.CD013196.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, including bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic condition causing shortness of breath, cough, and exacerbations leading to poor health outcomes. Face‐to‐face visits with health professionals can be hindered by severity of COPD or frailty, and by people living at a distance from their healthcare provider and having limited access to services. Telehealth technologies aimed at providing health care remotely through monitoring and consultations could help to improve health outcomes of people with COPD. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of telehealth interventions that allow remote monitoring and consultation and multi‐component interventions for reducing exacerbations and improving quality of life, while reducing dyspnoea symptoms, hospital service utilisation, and death among people with COPD. 
Search methods
We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register. Additional sources searched included the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the IEEEX Xplore Digital Library. The latest search was conducted in April 2020. We used the GRADE approach to judge the certainty of evidence for outcomes. 
Selection criteria
Eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included adults with diagnosed COPD. Asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and other respiratory conditions were excluded. Interventions included remote monitoring or consultation plus usual care, remote monitoring or consultation alone, and mult‐component interventions from all care settings. Quality of life scales included St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). The dyspnoea symptom scale used was the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire Self‐Administered Standardized Scale (CRQ‐SAS). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We assessed confidence in the evidence for each primary outcome using the GRADE method. Primary outcomes were exacerbations, quality of life, dyspnoea symptoms, hospital service utilisation, and mortality; a secondary outcome consisted of adverse events. 
Main results
We included 29 studies in the review (5654 participants; male proportion 36% to 96%; female proportion 4% to 61%). Most remote monitoring interventions required participants to transfer measurements using a remote device and later health professional review (asynchronous). Only five interventions transferred data and allowed review by health professionals in real time (synchronous). Studies were at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. We found no evidence on comparison of remote consultations with or without usual care. 
Remote monitoring plus usual care (8 studies, 1033 participants)  
Very uncertain evidence suggests that remote monitoring plus usual care may have little to no effect on the number of people experiencing exacerbations at 26 weeks or 52 weeks. There may be little to no difference in effect on quality of life (SGRQ) at 26 weeks (very low to low certainty) or on hospitalisation (all‐cause or COPD‐related; very low certainty). COPD‐related hospital re‐admissions are probably reduced at 26 weeks (hazard ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.93; 106 participants; moderate certainty). There may be little to no difference in deaths between intervention and usual care (very low certainty). We found no evidence for dyspnoea symptoms or adverse events. 
Remote monitoring alone (10 studies, 2456 participants)  
Very uncertain evidence suggests that remote monitoring may result in little to no effect on the number of people experiencing exacerbations at 41 weeks (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.55). There may be little to no effect on quality of life (SGRQ total at 17 weeks, or CAT at 38 and 52 weeks; very low certainty). There may be little to no effect on dyspnoea symptoms on the CRQ‐SAS at 26 weeks (low certainty). There may be no difference in effects on the number of people admitted to hospital (very low certainty) or on deaths (very low certainty). We found no evidence for adverse events. 
Multi‐component interventions with remote monitoring or consultation component (11 studies, 2165 participants)  
Very uncertain evidence suggests that multi‐component interventions may have little to no effect on the number of people experiencing exacerbations at 52 weeks. Quality of life at 13 weeks may improve as seen in SGRQ total score (mean difference ‐9.70, 95% CI ‐18.32 to ‐1.08; 38 participants; low certainty) but not at 26 or 52 weeks (very low certainty). COPD assessment test (CAT) scores may improve at a mean of 38 weeks, but evidence is very uncertain and interventions are varied. 
There may be little to no effect on the number of people admitted to hospital at 33 weeks (low certainty). Multi‐component interventions are likely to result in fewer people re‐admitted to hospital at a mean of 39 weeks (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.81; 344 participants, 3 studies; moderate certainty). There may be little to no difference in death at a mean of 40 weeks (very low certainty). There may be little to no effect on people experiencing adverse events (very low certainty). We found no evidence for dyspnoea symptoms. 
Authors' conclusions
Remote monitoring plus usual care provided asynchronously may not be beneficial overall compared to usual care alone. Some benefit is seen in reduction of COPD‐related hospital re‐admissions, but moderate‐certainty evidence is based on one study. We have not found any evidence for dyspnoea symptoms nor harms, and there is no difference in fatalities when remote monitoring is provided in addition to usual care. 
Remote monitoring interventions alone are no better than usual care overall for health outcomes. 
Multi‐component interventions with asynchronous remote monitoring are no better than usual care but may provide short‐term benefit for quality of life and may result in fewer re‐admissions to hospital for any cause. We are uncertain whether remote monitoring is responsible for the positive impact on re‐admissions, and we are unable to discern the long‐term benefits of receiving remote monitoring as part of patient care. 
Owing to paucity of evidence, it is unclear which COPD severity subgroups would benefit from telehealth interventions. Given there is no evidence of harm, telehealth interventions may be beneficial as an additional health resource depending on individual needs based on professional assessment. Larger studies can determine long‐term effects of these interventions. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using Technology to Monitor and Care for People with Lung Disease at Home

## Plain Title
Can remote health monitoring and video calls help people with chronic lung disease?

## Rationale

**What is COPD?**
COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This is a long-term lung condition that makes it hard to breathe. People with COPD often have a cough and feel short of breath. The disease includes two main types: bronchitis and emphysema.

**Why is COPD a problem?**
COPD causes flare-ups, which doctors call exacerbations. During these times, breathing gets much worse. People may need to go to the hospital. These flare-ups make life harder for patients.

**What makes getting care difficult?**
Some people with COPD cannot easily visit their doctor. They may be too sick or weak to travel. Others live far from their doctor's office. This makes it hard to get the care they need.

**What is telehealth?**
Telehealth uses technology to provide health care from far away. Patients can use devices at home to check their health. They can send this information to their doctor. They can also talk to their doctor using video calls or phone calls.

**Why study telehealth for COPD?**
Researchers wanted to know if telehealth could help people with COPD. They thought it might reduce flare-ups. It might help people feel better. It might keep people out of the hospital. This study looked at whether telehealth really works for COPD patients.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 29 different studies. These studies included 5,654 people with COPD. Most people in the studies were men. The studies tested three types of telehealth:

1. Remote monitoring plus regular care
2. Remote monitoring alone
3. Programs with many parts, including remote monitoring

**What is remote monitoring?**
Patients use devices at home to measure their health. They check things like breathing and oxygen levels. Most programs sent this information to doctors later. Only five programs sent information right away.

**Who was in these studies?**
All participants were adults with COPD. The studies did not include people with asthma or other lung diseases.

**How long did the studies last?**
Different studies lasted different amounts of time. Some lasted 13 weeks. Others lasted up to 52 weeks (one year).

## Results

**What did researchers measure?**
They looked at several things:
- How many flare-ups people had
- Quality of life (how well people felt)
- Shortness of breath
- Hospital visits
- Deaths

**Remote monitoring plus regular care (8 studies, 1,033 people)**
This approach probably did not help much overall. People had about the same number of flare-ups. Their quality of life stayed about the same. Hospital visits were similar. One study found fewer people went back to the hospital for COPD. But researchers are not very sure about these findings. Deaths were about the same in both groups.

**Remote monitoring alone (10 studies, 2,456 people)**
This approach also did not help much. People had similar numbers of flare-ups. Quality of life did not improve. Shortness of breath stayed the same. Hospital visits were similar. Deaths were about the same. Researchers are not very confident about these results.

**Programs with many parts (11 studies, 2,165 people)**
These programs included remote monitoring plus other types of help. Results were mixed. Flare-ups stayed about the same. Quality of life improved a little bit in the short term. This improvement did not last long. Fewer people went back to the hospital. This is good news. Deaths were about the same. Researchers have more confidence in the hospital results.

**Were there any harms?**
The studies found no evidence that telehealth caused harm. It appears to be safe.

**What do the results mean?**
Overall, remote monitoring did not help as much as hoped. It did not reduce flare-ups. It did not greatly improve how people felt. But it may help keep some people out of the hospital. It does not appear to cause harm.

**What are the limitations?**
Researchers are not very confident about many findings. More research is needed. We do not know which patients would benefit most. We do not know if benefits last a long time.

**Final conclusions**
Telehealth may be helpful for some people with COPD. It works best as an extra resource. Doctors should decide based on each person's needs. Telehealth appears safe to use. Larger studies are needed to learn more about long-term benefits.",10.1002-14651858.CD013196,"Telehealth technologies for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Review question 
Do telehealth technologies help improve the health of people who have COPD?
Background 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes a group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnoea), coughing, and increased mucus. COPD causes limited airflow in the lungs when breathing out; this can be measured by spirometry (a measure to assess how well the lungs function). The spirometer takes two measurements: volume of air when breathing out forcefully in one second, and total amount of air breathed out. When COPD gets worse over time, this leads to greater symptom severity and can reduce quality of life. Disease progression and sudden flare‐ups (exacerbations) of symptoms can increase someone's risks of hospitalisation and death. Telehealth technologies could improve delivery of health care for people with COPD, which could reduce exacerbations, improve quality of life, and lower rates of hospitalisation. However, it is unclear whether providing telehealth care improves health‐related outcomes for people with COPD. We wanted to explore whether telehealth technologies were helpful for people with COPD. 
What are telehealth technologies? 
Study investigators used a range of telehealth technologies. Some included remote monitoring technology, which requires daily use of a laptop or a tablet with monitoring equipment, with results received by the healthcare professional. Typical monitoring equipment included a stethoscope (to measure blood pressure and heart rate), a pulse oximeter (to measure oxygen levels in the blood), a spirometer (to measure lung function), a thermometer, and other devices. Interventions involved regular phone calls with healthcare professionals for patients to talk about their symptoms and completion of health questionnaires. 
Identifying and selecting studies 
We searched online databases up until April 2020. We searched for studies published worldwide, in any language, at any time. Two review authors looked at lists of studies separately, then agreed on which studies should be included. 
To find the best answer to our question, we looked for studies that recruited people with COPD of any severity. To make the comparison fair, we looked for studies in which investigators compared remote monitoring, remote monitoring plus usual care, and multi‐component treatments. People included in these studies had to have the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive one of these teleheath technologies or usual care. 
Key results 
We found 29 studies (5654 people with moderate to very severe COPD) that were suitable for inclusion in our review. Duration of these studies ranged from 3 to 12 months. 
We did not find any important benefits or harms for patients who were monitored with any of the telehealth technologies when we looked at number of exacerbations, improvement in quality of life, and reduction in breathing distress symptoms, hospitalisations, or death. However, people who were monitored through telehealth technology plus usual care had some reduction in risk of hospital re‐admission. Thus, telehealth technologies that were part of a care package reduced COPD‐related hospital re‐admissions. 
We could not be certain of any harms of stand‐alone remote monitoring. We are also uncertain of any benefits or harms of stand‐alone remote monitoring of patient experiences or reports of breathing distress. 
Quality of evidence 
Currently, no good quality evidence is available. We are very uncertain about evidence for exacerbations, quality of life, dyspnoea symptoms, hospitalisations, deaths, and side effects. However, we are moderately certain about our findings for hospital re‐admissions. 
Conclusion 
We are not clear whether telehealth technologies for monitoring or consultation provide benefit, but we have not found any information on harms. Telehealth could play a role in the care and management of people with COPD. Telehealth as part of multi‐component care packages may provide short‐term benefit for quality of life and hospital re‐admissions. Telehealth in the form of remote monitoring in addition to usual care may reduce the risk of hospital re‐admission. There is little impact on exacerbations, quality of life, and death. Owing to limited information, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. More studies are needed to determine whether telehealth provides any long‐term benefits for people with COPD of varying severity.

Decision coaching is non‐directive support delivered by a healthcare provider to help patients prepare to actively participate in making a health decision. ‘Healthcare providers’ are considered to be all people who are engaged in actions whose primary intent is to protect and improve health (e.g. nurses, doctors, pharmacists, social workers, health support workers such as peer health workers). 
Little is known about the effectiveness of decision coaching.
Objectives
To determine the effects of decision coaching (I) for people facing healthcare decisions for themselves or a family member (P) compared to (C) usual care or evidence‐based intervention only, on outcomes (O) related to preparation for decision making, decisional needs and potential adverse effects. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (Wiley), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (Ebsco), Nursing and Allied Health Source (ProQuest), and Web of Science from database inception to June 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where the intervention was provided to adults or children preparing to make a treatment or screening healthcare decision for themselves or a family member. Decision coaching was defined as: a) delivered individually by a healthcare provider who is trained or using a protocol; and b) providing non‐directive support and preparing an adult or child to participate in a healthcare decision. Comparisons included usual care or an alternate intervention. There were no language restrictions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened citations, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data on characteristics of the intervention(s) and outcomes. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion to reach consensus. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measures of treatment effect and, where possible, synthesised results using a random‐effects model. If more than one study measured the same outcome using different tools, we used a random‐effects model to calculate the standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI. We presented outcomes in summary of findings tables and applied GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
Out of 12,984 citations screened, we included 28 studies of decision coaching interventions alone or in combination with evidence‐based information, involving 5509 adult participants (aged 18 to 85 years; 64% female, 52% white, 33% African‐American/Black; 68% post‐secondary education). The studies evaluated decision coaching used for a range of healthcare decisions (e.g. treatment decisions for cancer, menopause, mental illness, advancing kidney disease; screening decisions for cancer, genetic testing). Four of the 28 studies included three comparator arms.  
For decision coaching compared with usual care (n = 4 studies), we are uncertain if decision coaching compared with usual care improves any outcomes (i.e. preparation for decision making, decision self‐confidence, knowledge, decision regret, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low.  
For decision coaching compared with evidence‐based information only (n = 4 studies), there is low certainty‐evidence that participants exposed to decision coaching may have little or no change in knowledge (SMD ‐0.23, 95% CI: ‐0.50 to 0.04; 3 studies, 406 participants). There is low certainty‐evidence that participants exposed to decision coaching may have little or no change in anxiety, compared with evidence‐based information. We are uncertain if decision coaching compared with evidence‐based information improves other outcomes (i.e. decision self‐confidence, feeling uninformed) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
For decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with usual care (n = 17 studies), there is low certainty‐evidence that participants may have improved knowledge (SMD 9.3, 95% CI: 6.6 to 12.1; 5 studies, 1073 participants). We are uncertain if decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with usual care improves other outcomes (i.e. preparation for decision making, decision self‐confidence, feeling uninformed, unclear values, feeling unsupported, decision regret, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
For decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with evidence‐based information only (n = 7 studies), we are uncertain if decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with evidence‐based information only improves any outcomes (i.e. feeling uninformed, unclear values, feeling unsupported, knowledge, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Decision coaching may improve participants’ knowledge when used with evidence‐based information. Our findings do not indicate any significant adverse effects (e.g. decision regret, anxiety) with the use of decision coaching. It is not possible to establish strong conclusions for other outcomes. It is unclear if decision coaching always needs to be paired with evidence‐informed information. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of decision coaching for a broader range of outcomes. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Decision Coaching to Help People Make Healthcare Choices

## Plain Title
Does coaching help people make better healthcare decisions?

## Rationale

**What is the health issue?**

People often need to make hard choices about their health. These choices might be about treatment for a disease or tests to check for health problems. Making these choices can be stressful and confusing.

**What is decision coaching?**

Decision coaching is when a trained healthcare worker helps a person get ready to make a health choice. The coach does not tell the person what to choose. Instead, the coach helps the person think through their options. The coach might be a nurse, doctor, or other health worker.

**Why was this study needed?**

We do not know much about whether decision coaching really helps people. Researchers wanted to find out if coaching makes a difference. They wanted to see if people who get coaching feel more ready to make choices. They also wanted to know if coaching helps people learn more about their options.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 28 different studies. These studies tested decision coaching in different ways. The studies included 5,509 adults. These people were between 18 and 85 years old. Most were women. They came from different backgrounds.

**What health choices were studied?**

People in the studies faced many types of health choices. Some needed to decide about cancer treatment. Others needed to choose about genetic testing. Some had to make choices about mental health care or kidney disease treatment.

**How did researchers test decision coaching?**

Researchers compared different groups of people:
- Some people got decision coaching
- Some people got usual care only
- Some people got written information only
- Some people got both coaching and written information

Then researchers checked to see which groups did better.

**What did researchers measure?**

They looked at many things:
- How ready people felt to make a choice
- How much people learned about their options
- How confident people felt about their choice
- Whether people felt worried or had regrets

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The study found some helpful results:

When people got both coaching and written information, they learned more about their health choices. This was better than getting usual care alone. However, the researchers were not very certain about this finding.

When people got coaching alone (without written information), they did not learn much more than people who only got written information.

**Did coaching cause any problems?**

The good news is that coaching did not seem to cause harm. People who got coaching did not feel more worried. They did not have more regrets about their choices.

**What was not clear?**

For most other things researchers measured, the results were not clear. The researchers could not be sure if coaching helped people feel more ready to decide. They could not be sure if coaching made people feel more confident.

**What do these results mean?**

Decision coaching might help people learn more when used with written information. It does not seem to cause harm. But we need more research to know if coaching really helps in other ways.

**What comes next?**

More studies are needed. Future research should look at more types of outcomes. Researchers also need to find out if coaching always needs to be paired with written information. Or can coaching work well on its own?

**Bottom line:**

Decision coaching shows some promise for helping people learn about their health choices. It appears to be safe. But we still need more proof that it helps people feel ready and confident to make healthcare decisions.",10.1002-14651858.CD013385,"Decision coaching for people making healthcare decisions
Background 
There is a need to better involve people who are making healthcare decisions about treatments (e.g. surgery) or screening (e.g. tests to tell if there is a health problem). Quality decisions are made when people know the best available evidence on options and can share what matters with their healthcare provider(s). 
Decision coaching supports people to prepare for making a health decision. It is provided by healthcare providers who are trained or use a protocol for decision coaching (e.g. nurses, doctors, pharmacists, social workers, health support workers such as peer health workers).  
We wanted to find out if decision coaching helps people to prepare for making healthcare decisions. 
 
What did we do? 
We are a team of patient partners, healthcare providers, teachers and researchers from seven countries. 
We looked for studies that tested decision coaching with people (adults and children) to prepare them for making a healthcare decision about treatment or screening for themselves or a family member. 
We included studies if people who received decision coaching were randomly put into study groups (e.g. using a computer to decide who goes in which group). Studies where people are randomly put into groups are the best way to compare findings between groups and give results we can rely on when we look at the effects of an intervention like decision coaching.  
 
Search strategy  
To find studies, we searched eight online data banks. We asked experts and authors of studies about decision coaching. We included studies published up to June 2021.  
 
What we found  
We found 28 studies about decision coaching used alone or with high‐quality patient information based on research (called ‘evidence‐based information’). There was a total of 5509 adults in the 28 studies. None of the studies included children, and only one study included people (parents) making decisions for someone else. The studies tested decision coaching with a range of healthcare decisions such as treatment decisions related to cancer, menopause, or mental illness; cancer screening decisions, and genetic testing.  
Some of the studies looked at decision coaching with, or compared to, disease‐specific information or evidence‐based information such as patient decision aids (booklets, videos, online tools that: make the decision clear, provide options and the pros and cons, and help people be clear on what matters to them). 
 
What does the evidence show? 
People who received decision coaching compared with evidence‐based information only: 
‐ may have little or no change in knowledge (406 patients, 3 studies);
‐ may have little of no change in anxiety (242 patients, 1 study).
 
People who received decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with usual care:  
‐may have improved knowledge (1073 patients, 5 studies)
 
Our confidence in the results 
We have low confidence that decision coaching plus evidence‐based information improves people’s knowledge compared to usual care. We have low confidence that decision coaching may have little or no effect on knowledge and anxiety compared to evidence‐based information. We are less confident about our other findings, as the certainty of the evidence is very low and there were important outcomes that were not reported by the included studies. Many studies had a small number of people taking part and this means that the results of this review might change with more studies.   
 
What this means 
Decision coaching may improve peoples’ knowledge to help them prepare to make healthcare decisions when used with evidence‐based information. The review did not detect any adverse effects with the use of decision coaching.

To assess the efficacy and safety of racecadotril for treating acute diarrhoea in children under five years of age. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, published in the Cochrane Library Issue 3, March 2019); MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), up to 4 March 2019, for clinical trials regardless of publication language or status. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared racecadotril to placebo or no intervention in addition to standard care (oral rehydration therapy) in children under five with acute diarrhoea. The primary outcomes were failure of oral rehydration, duration of diarrhoea, and number of stools. The secondary outcomes were stool output, length of the hospital stay, and adverse events.

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. We presented dichotomous data with risk ratios (RR) and continuous data with mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD). Where appropriate, we combined trials with meta‐analysis and used a random‐effects model if there was significant heterogeneity (I² ≥ 50%). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Seven RCTs with a total of 1140 participants met the inclusion criteria. The trials were carried out on children aged three months to five years, in outpatient and inpatient facilities from France, Spain, Peru, India, Kenya, and Ecuador. The efficacy and safety of racecadotril were compared to placebo or no treatment. Racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.23; 2 RCTs, 192 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Data on duration of diarrhoea, number of stools in the first 48 hours are insufficient to reach a conclusion; stool output in the first 48 hours appears to be lower in the two trials measuring this, although the data is not combinable. Length of hospital stay was similar in two studies measuring this, and overall there was no evidence that racecadotril increased overall rate of adverse events (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.22; 5 RCTs, 688 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Most adverse events in the racecadotril group were mild or moderate. 
Authors' conclusions
Racecadotril seems to be a safe drug but has little benefit in improving acute diarrhoea in children under five years of age. Current evidence does not support routine use of racecadotril in management of acute diarrhoea in children under five outside of the context of placebo controlled RCTs. 
","# Plain Language Summary: A Study on Racecadotril for Treating Diarrhea in Young Children

## Plain Title

Does a medicine called racecadotril help treat diarrhea in children under five years old?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Diarrhea is when a child has loose or watery stools. Acute diarrhea means it starts suddenly and lasts a short time. This is a serious problem for young children around the world. It is one of the main reasons children under five years old die. When children have diarrhea, they lose too much water and important body salts. This can make them very sick.

**What is the usual treatment?**

Doctors usually give children a special drink to replace lost water and salts. This is called oral rehydration therapy. It helps put back what the body loses through diarrhea.

**What is racecadotril?**

Racecadotril is a medicine that works by stopping the gut from making too much fluid. Doctors have used it along with the special rehydration drink. The idea is that it might help stop diarrhea faster.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if racecadotril really works. They also wanted to know if it is safe for young children. This would help doctors decide if they should use this medicine to treat children with diarrhea.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at seven different studies. These studies tested racecadotril in children. All children in the studies also got the usual rehydration drink. Some children got racecadotril. Other children got a fake pill or no extra medicine. This way, researchers could compare the results.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included 1,140 children total. The children were between three months and five years old. All of them had acute diarrhea. The studies took place in six countries: France, Spain, Peru, India, Kenya, and Ecuador. Some children were treated in the hospital. Others were treated as outpatients.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies tracked children during their illness. This was usually for a few days until the diarrhea stopped.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found that racecadotril may help reduce the need for extra rehydration treatment. However, the evidence was not very strong. Two studies with 192 children looked at this.

The studies did not have enough clear information about how long diarrhea lasted. They also did not have clear information about the number of stools children had. Two studies showed that children taking racecadotril had less stool in the first 48 hours. But the researchers could not combine these results.

Two studies looked at how long children stayed in the hospital. The length of stay was about the same for both groups.

**Was the medicine safe?**

The medicine appeared to be safe. Five studies with 688 children looked at side effects. Children taking racecadotril did not have more side effects than other children. Most side effects were mild or moderate.

**What do the results mean?**

Racecadotril seems to be safe for young children. However, it does not help much in treating acute diarrhea. The researchers concluded that doctors should not routinely use racecadotril for treating diarrhea in children under five. The medicine should only be used in research studies where it is compared to a fake pill. This will help gather more information.

**Why might the evidence be limited?**

The researchers rated the quality of evidence as low. This means they are not very confident in the results. More and better studies are needed to know for sure if racecadotril helps.",10.1002-14651858.CD009359,"Racecadotril to treat children under five years of age with acute diarrhoea
What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether racecadotril works for children under five years of age with diarrhoea. Cochrane Review authors collected and analysed all relevant trials to answer this question and included seven trials in this review. 
Key messages 
Racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure. We are uncertain whether or not it influences number of bowel movements or duration of diarrhoea. 
What was studied in the review? 
Diarrhoea is a leading cause of death in children under five years old, especially in low‐income countries. Children who have diarrhoea often suffer from frequent and watery bowel movements, which might cause excessive loss of fluid and electrolytes (dehydration). Fluid replacement is recommended to prevent and treat dehydration caused by diarrhoea. Racecadotril has been used in addition to fluid replacement for treating diarrhoea in children, as it reduces release of water and electrolytes into the digestive tract. The drug is supposed to improve the symptoms of diarrhoea (shorten duration of diarrhoea or reduce the stool frequency) as well as reduce the risk of rehydration failure. However, it is not clear if racecadotril really works for children with diarrhoea. 
What are the main results? 
The review authors searched for available trials and included seven trials. The trials were conducted in a total of 1140 children aged from 3 months to 5 years. Children who were given racecadotril were compared to a control group (children who, instead of racecadotril, received a placebo (a dummy drug that contains no racecadotril) or no drug). The review shows that when children with diarrhoea were given racecadotril, compared to placebo or no drug: 
• racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure (low‐certainty evidence); • we are uncertain whether or not racecadotril shortens duration of diarrhoea (very low‐certainty evidence); • we are uncertain whether racecadotril influences the number of stools (very low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may reduce weight of stool output (low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may make little or no difference to length of hospital stay for inpatients (low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may make little or no difference to rates of side‐effect events (low‐certainty evidence) 
How up to date is this review? 
The review authors searched for trials published up to 4 March 2019.

250,10.1002-14651858.CD013699-abstract.txt,"Background
Reducing the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is a global priority. Contact tracing identifies people who were recently in contact with an infected individual, in order to isolate them and reduce further transmission. Digital technology could be implemented to augment and accelerate manual contact tracing. Digital tools for contact tracing may be grouped into three areas: 1) outbreak response; 2) proximity tracing; and 3) symptom tracking. We conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of digital solutions to contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits, harms, and acceptability of personal digital contact tracing solutions for identifying contacts of an identified positive case of an infectious disease. 
Search methods
An information specialist searched the literature from 1 January 2000 to 5 May 2020 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. Additionally, we screened the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, quasi‐RCTs, cohort studies, cross‐sectional studies and modelling studies, in general populations. We preferentially included studies of contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks (including COVID‐19, Ebola, tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome) as direct evidence, but considered comparative studies of contact tracing outside an outbreak as indirect evidence. 
The digital solutions varied but typically included software (or firmware) for users to install on their devices or to be uploaded to devices provided by governments or third parties. Control measures included traditional or manual contact tracing, self‐reported diaries and surveys, interviews, other standard methods for determining close contacts, and other technologies compared to digital solutions (e.g. electronic medical records). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened records and all potentially relevant full‐text publications. One review author extracted data for 50% of the included studies, another extracted data for the remaining 50%; the second review author checked all the extracted data. One review author assessed quality of included studies and a second checked the assessments. Our outcomes were identification of secondary cases and close contacts, time to complete contact tracing, acceptability and accessibility issues, privacy and safety concerns, and any other ethical issue identified. Though modelling studies will predict estimates of the effects of different contact tracing solutions on outcomes of interest, cohort studies provide empirically measured estimates of the effects of different contact tracing solutions on outcomes of interest. We used GRADE‐CERQual to describe certainty of evidence from qualitative data and GRADE for modelling and cohort studies. 
Main results
We identified six cohort studies reporting quantitative data and six modelling studies reporting simulations of digital solutions for contact tracing. Two cohort studies also provided qualitative data. Three cohort studies looked at contact tracing during an outbreak, whilst three emulated an outbreak in non‐outbreak settings (schools). Of the six modelling studies, four evaluated digital solutions for contact tracing in simulated COVID‐19 scenarios, while two simulated close contacts in non‐specific outbreak settings. 
Modelling studies 
Two modelling studies provided low‐certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases using digital contact tracing (measured as average number of secondary cases per index case ‐ effective reproductive number (Reff)). One study estimated an 18% reduction in Reff with digital contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone, and a 35% reduction with manual contact‐tracing. Another found a reduction in Reff for digital contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone (26% reduction) and a reduction in Reff for manual contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone (53% reduction). However, the certainty of evidence was reduced by unclear specifications of their models, and assumptions about the effectiveness of manual contact tracing (assumed 95% to 100% of contacts traced), and the proportion of the population who would have the app (53%). 
Cohort studies 
Two cohort studies provided very low‐certainty evidence of a benefit of digital over manual contact tracing. During an Ebola outbreak, contact tracers using an app found twice as many close contacts per case on average than those using paper forms. Similarly, after a pertussis outbreak in a US hospital, researchers found that radio‐frequency identification identified 45 close contacts but searches of electronic medical records found 13. The certainty of evidence was reduced by concerns about imprecision, and serious risk of bias due to the inability of contact tracing study designs to identify the true number of close contacts. 
One cohort study provided very low‐certainty evidence that an app could reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts. The certainty of evidence for this outcome was affected by imprecision and serious risk of bias. Contact tracing teams reported that digital data entry and management systems were faster to use than paper systems and possibly less prone to data loss. 
Two studies from lower‐ or middle‐income countries, reported that contact tracing teams found digital systems simpler to use and generally preferred them over paper systems; they saved personnel time, reportedly improved accuracy with large data sets, and were easier to transport compared with paper forms. However, personnel faced increased costs and internet access problems with digital compared to paper systems. 
Devices in the cohort studies appeared to have privacy from contacts regarding the exposed or diagnosed users. However, there were risks of privacy breaches from snoopers if linkage attacks occurred, particularly for wearable devices. 
Authors' conclusions
The effectiveness of digital solutions is largely unproven as there are very few published data in real‐world outbreak settings. Modelling studies provide low‐certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases if digital contact tracing is used together with other public health measures such as self‐isolation. Cohort studies provide very low‐certainty evidence that digital contact tracing may produce more reliable counts of contacts and reduce time to complete contact tracing. Digital solutions may have equity implications for at‐risk populations with poor internet access and poor access to digital technology. 
Stronger primary research on the effectiveness of contact tracing technologies is needed, including research into use of digital solutions in conjunction with manual systems, as digital solutions are unlikely to be used alone in real‐world settings. Future studies should consider access to and acceptability of digital solutions, and the resultant impact on equity. Studies should also make acceptability and uptake a primary research question, as privacy concerns can prevent uptake and effectiveness of these technologies. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Digital Tools to Find People Exposed to Infectious Diseases

## Plain Title
Can Digital Tools Like Phone Apps Help Find People Who Have Been Near Someone With an Infectious Disease?

## Rationale

### What is contact tracing and why is it important?
When someone gets sick with an infectious disease, they can spread it to others. Contact tracing means finding people who were near the sick person. These people may have caught the disease. Finding them quickly helps stop the disease from spreading further.

### How is contact tracing usually done?
Normally, health workers talk to sick people. They ask who the sick person was near. Then health workers call or visit those people. This is called manual contact tracing. It takes time and many workers.

### What did researchers want to learn?
Researchers wanted to know if digital tools could help. Digital tools include phone apps and small devices people wear. These tools might find exposed people faster than manual methods. Researchers looked at studies about digital contact tracing during disease outbreaks. They wanted to know if digital tools work better than manual methods.

### Why might digital tools help?
Digital tools can track when people are near each other. They can send alerts quickly. They might find more exposed people in less time. This could help stop disease outbreaks faster.

## Trial Design

### How did researchers study this question?
Researchers looked at 12 different studies. Six studies watched real people using digital tools. Six studies used computer models to predict what might happen. The studies looked at different diseases. Some looked at COVID-19. Others looked at Ebola and other infections.

### What did the studies compare?
The studies compared digital tools to manual contact tracing. Some studies compared digital tools to paper forms. Others compared different types of digital tools to each other.

### Who was in these studies?
The studies included different groups of people. Some studies happened during real disease outbreaks. Others tested the tools in schools when no outbreak was happening. The studies included people of different ages and backgrounds.

### How long did the studies last?
Each study lasted different amounts of time. Some tracked people during short outbreaks. Others tested tools over several weeks or months.

## Results

### What did the computer models show?
Computer models suggested digital contact tracing might help reduce disease spread. When people used digital tools and stayed home if exposed, fewer people got sick. However, manual contact tracing seemed to work even better in these models. The models assumed most people would use the apps. They also assumed manual tracing would find almost everyone exposed. These assumptions may not match real life.

### What did the real-world studies show?
Six studies watched people actually use digital tools. During an Ebola outbreak, workers using an app found twice as many exposed people as workers using paper forms. In a hospital outbreak, digital tracking found 45 exposed people. Paper records only found 13 people.

One study found digital tools were faster. Workers could complete their contact tracing tasks more quickly with apps than with paper.

### What did workers think about digital tools?
Health workers in some countries said digital tools were easier to use than paper. The tools saved time. They were easier to carry around. Workers made fewer mistakes with large amounts of information. However, digital tools cost more money. Workers sometimes had trouble getting internet access.

### What about privacy and safety?
The digital tools kept information private from most people. However, there were some risks. Hackers might be able to figure out who was sick. This was especially true for devices people wear.

### What problems might digital tools cause?
Not everyone has a smartphone or internet access. Poor people and people in certain areas might not be able to use digital tools. This could make health inequalities worse.

### What do researchers conclude?
We do not have strong proof that digital contact tracing works well in real outbreaks. The evidence suggests it might help when used with other methods like staying home when sick. Digital tools might find more exposed people faster than paper methods. However, more research is needed. Future studies should test digital tools during real outbreaks. They should check if everyone can access and use the tools fairly.",10.1002-14651858.CD013699,"Are digital contact tracing technologies effective during infectious disease outbreaks?
Why is this question important? 
The global COVID‐19 pandemic highlights the importance of accurate and timely contact tracing. Contact tracing tells people that they may have been near someone with ‐ or showing symptoms of ‐ an infectious disease, allowing them to self‐isolate and helping to stop the spread of infection. Traditionally, contact tracing begins with notification that someone has an infectious disease. They are asked to recall their contacts, going back two to three days before symptom onset. This is time‐consuming and may not always give a complete picture, so digital aids could help contact tracers. 
Digital contact tracing uses technology to track and trace contacts. Individuals download an app onto their smartphones and record location and symptom information, or their devices might use location‐finding technology, like Bluetooth or GPS (global positioning system). If the user is infected, the technology identifies close contacts and/or secondary infections (people to whom they passed the disease), and informs people whom they have been near. The technology identifies where the infection was passed on and its duration (the context). 
However, problems may occur where access to technology is limited, in low‐income settings or for elderly people, for example. Also, some people see it as an invasion of privacy and are suspicious of how their data will be used. 
We wanted to know whether digital contact tracing, compared to manual contact tracing, is effective in reducing the spread of infection, as measured by secondary infections, identifying close contacts, tracing a complete set of contacts, and identifying the context of infection. 
What did we do? 
We searched medical databases for studies that assessed digital contact tracing. We preferred studies set during infectious disease outbreaks, which assessed real people in real time, but we included studies in any setting and of any design. 
To answer our question quickly, we shortened some steps of the Cochrane review process, however, we are confident in our conclusions. 
What we found 
We found 12 relevant studies. Six assessed the effectiveness of digital contact tracing on specific groups (cohorts) of people: three during an outbreak (Ebola in Sierra Leone; tuberculosis in Botswana; and whooping cough (pertussis) in USA); and three replicated an outbreak in schools to assess systems for identifying close contacts of participants. The remaining six were modelling studies, which simulated digital contact tracing. 
Main results 
Digital contact tracing with self‐isolation probably reduces the number of secondary infections, but not as much as manual contact tracing with self‐isolation (2 modelling studies). 
Digital contact tracing found more close contacts in two outbreaks than manual (2 studies in USA and Sierra Leone). Devices in non‐outbreak settings can identify more close contacts than self‐reported diaries or surveys. 
An app may reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts (1 study). Digital systems were faster to use than paper systems for recording new contacts and monitoring known contacts, and possibly less prone to data loss. 
Problems with system access (2 studies) included patchy network coverage, lack of data, technical problems and higher staff training needs. Contact tracers' personal expenses increased (1 study) due to travel and recharging phone batteries. Devices all appeared to protect diagnosed users from contacts, snoopers and authorities but one app's users were members of public health agencies. Studies recorded stolen hardware (second‐hand mobile phones); reported that paper forms were ""often lost"", and that digital data were password protected (2 studies) and encrypted (1 study). 
We found no evidence on contextual information and acceptability.
What this means 
It is unlikely that digital technologies would be the sole method of contact tracing during an outbreak; they would probably be used alongside manual methods. Unfortunately, the technology is largely unproven in real‐world outbreak settings and none of our included studies assessed digital plus manual contact tracing with digital contact tracing alone. Our included studies assessed different technologies and used different methods from each other, so we are uncertain about their evidence. 
Governments that implement digital contact tracing should ensure that at‐risk populations are not disadvantaged and take privacy concerns into account. 
This review is up to date to May 2020.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the leading cause of death in developed countries, and current treatment modalities have failed to regenerate the dead myocardium resulting from the ischemic damage. Stem cells have the potential to regenerate the damaged myocardium. These cells can be mobilized from the bone marrow by factors such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of stem cell mobilization following granulocyte colony stimulating factor therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to November week 3, 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010 week 48), BIOSIS Previews (1969 to 30 November 2010), ISI Science Citation Index Expanded (1970 to 4 December 2010) and ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (1990 to 4 December 2010). We also checked reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials including participants with a clinical diagnosis of AMI who were randomly allocated to the subcutaneous administration of G‐CSF through a daily dose of 2.5, 5 or 10 microgram/kg for four to six days or placebo. No age or other restrictions were applied for the selection of patients. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected trials, assessed trials for eligibility and methodological quality, and extracted data regarding the clinical efficacy and adverse outcomes. Disagreements were resolved by the third author. 
Main results
We included seven trials reported in 30 references in the review (354 participants). In all trials, G‐CSF was compared with placebo preparations. Dosage of G‐CSF varied among studies, ranging from 2.5 to 10 microgram/kg/day. Regarding overall risk of bias, data regarding the generation of randomization sequence and incomplete outcome data were at a low risk of bias; however, data regarding binding of personnel were not conclusive. The rate of mortality was not different between the two groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.80, P = 0.55). Regarding safety, the limited amount of evidence is inadequate to reach any conclusions regarding the safety of G‐CSF therapy. Moreover, the results did not show any beneficial effects of G‐CSF in patients with AMI regarding left ventricular function parameters, including left ventricular ejection fraction (RR 3.41, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 7.44, P = 0.1), end systolic volume (RR ‐1.35, 95% CI ‐4.68 to 1.99, P = 0.43) and end diastolic volume (RR ‐4.08, 95% CI ‐8.28 to 0.12, P = 0.06). It should also be noted that the study was limited since the trials included lacked long enough follow up durations. 
Authors' conclusions
Limited evidence from small trials suggested a lack of benefit of G‐CSF therapy in patients with AMI. Since data of the risk of bias regarding blinding of personnel were not conclusive, larger RCTs with appropriate power calculations and longer follow up durations are required in order to address current uncertainties regarding the clinical efficacy and therapy‐related adverse events of G‐CSF treatment. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title

Testing a Drug Called G-CSF to Help Heal the Heart After a Heart Attack

## Rationale

**What is a heart attack and why is it serious?**

A heart attack happens when blood flow to part of the heart stops. This causes heart muscle cells to die. Heart attacks are the top cause of death in wealthy countries. The dead heart muscle cannot grow back with current treatments. This makes the heart weaker and causes serious health problems for patients.

**What did researchers want to test?**

Scientists think stem cells might help repair damaged heart muscle. Stem cells are special cells that can turn into different types of cells in the body. These cells live in bone marrow, which is the soft tissue inside bones. A drug called G-CSF can make stem cells leave the bone marrow and travel through the blood to damaged areas. Researchers wanted to see if G-CSF could help heal hearts after a heart attack.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need better ways to help heart attack patients. If G-CSF could help the heart heal itself, it might save lives and help patients feel better. This study looked at all the research done so far to see if G-CSF really works.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at seven different trials that tested G-CSF. They combined the results from all these trials to get a bigger picture.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 354 people total. All of them had just had a heart attack. The studies included both men and women. There were no age limits.

**What did patients receive?**

Some patients got G-CSF shots under their skin. Others got fake shots with no medicine (called placebo). The G-CSF doses ranged from 2.5 to 10 units per kilogram of body weight each day. Patients got shots for four to six days.

**How long did the studies last?**

The follow-up time varied between studies. Most studies did not follow patients for very long. This was one weakness of the research.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The results showed that G-CSF did not help heart attack patients.

**Did G-CSF affect survival?**

The death rate was similar in both groups. G-CSF did not help patients live longer.

**Did G-CSF help the heart work better?**

Researchers measured how well the heart pumped blood. They also measured the size of the heart chambers. G-CSF did not improve any of these measurements. The heart did not work better with G-CSF treatment.

**Was G-CSF safe?**

The studies did not provide enough information to know if G-CSF is safe for heart attack patients. More research is needed to answer this question.

**What do these results mean?**

Based on current evidence, G-CSF does not appear to help heart attack patients. The treatment did not make hearts stronger or help patients live longer.

**What are the limitations?**

The studies were small. Only 354 people were included total. The studies did not follow patients long enough to see long-term effects. Some details about how the studies were done were unclear. These problems make it hard to be completely certain about the results.

**What comes next?**

Researchers need to do larger studies with more patients. Future studies should follow patients for longer periods of time. These studies should carefully track any side effects. Only then will doctors know for sure whether G-CSF helps heart attack patients.

**Bottom line:**

Current evidence does not support using G-CSF to treat heart attack patients. More research is needed before doctors can recommend this treatment.",10.1002-14651858.CD008844,"Granulocyte colony stimulating factor treatment following a heart attack
People who suffer a heart attack (due to a blockage in the artery supplying blood to the heart) are usually affected by the damage to a portion of their heart muscle. Current treatment options are unable to restore the damaged section of the heart. Recently, stem cells have been shown to be able to restore and replace the damaged tissue in patients with heart attack. These cells could be mobilized to the heart with agents such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF). 
In this review, analysis of seven included studies with low risk of bias using G‐CSF to improve the function of damaged heart of patient with heart attack failed to show any beneficial effects of this treatment. The rate of mortality was not different between the two groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.80, P = 0.55). Also, left ventricular parameters including left ventricular ejection fraction (RR 3.41, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 7.44, P = 0.1), end systolic volume (RR ‐1.35, 95% CI ‐4.68 to 1.99, P = 0.43) and end diastolic volume (RR ‐4.08, 95% CI ‐8.28 to 0.12, P = 0.06) did not show significant changes between the treatment and the control groups. There was no evidence that the study was associated with serious adverse effects, however it should be noted that the study was limited since the trials included lacked long enough follow up durations. Additionally four studies had either high or unclear risk of bias for blinding. Therefore, based on the results of the current study, G‐CSF treatment should not be administered for patients with heart attack.

Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are high‐risk skin cancers, which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised, with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a microscopic imaging technique, which magnifies the surface of a skin lesion using near‐infrared light. Used in conjunction with clinical or dermoscopic examination of suspected skin cancer, or both, OCT may offer additional diagnostic information compared to other technologies. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of OCT for the detection of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in adults. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
We included studies of any design evaluating OCT in adults with lesions suspicious for invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, BCC or cSCC, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up.

Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). Our unit of analysis was lesions. Where possible, we estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. 
Main results
We included five studies with 529 cutaneous lesions (282 malignant lesions) providing nine datasets for OCT, two for visual inspection alone, and two for visual inspection plus dermoscopy. Studies were of moderate to unclear quality, using data‐driven thresholds for test positivity and giving poor accounts of reference standard interpretation and blinding. Studies may not have been representative of populations eligible for OCT in practice, for example due to high disease prevalence in study populations, and may not have reflected how OCT is used in practice, for example by using previously acquired OCT images. 
It was not possible to make summary statements regarding accuracy of detection of melanoma or of cSCC because of the paucity of studies, small sample sizes, and for melanoma differences in the OCT technologies used (high‐definition versus conventional resolution OCT), and differences in the degree of testing performed prior to OCT (i.e. visual inspection alone or visual inspection plus dermoscopy). 
Pooled data from two studies using conventional swept‐source OCT alongside visual inspection and dermoscopy for the detection of BCC estimated the sensitivity of OCT as 95% (95% confidence interval (CI) 91% to 97%) and specificity of 77% (95% CI 69% to 83%). 
When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the mean observed BCC prevalence of 60%, OCT would miss 31 BCCs (91 fewer than would be missed by visual inspection alone and 53 fewer than would be missed by visual inspection plus dermoscopy), and OCT would lead to 93 false‐positive results for BCC (a reduction in unnecessary excisions of 159 compared to using visual inspection alone and of 87 compared to visual inspection plus dermoscopy). 
Authors' conclusions
Insufficient data are available on the use of OCT for the detection of melanoma or cSCC. Initial data suggest conventional OCT may have a role for the diagnosis of BCC in clinically challenging lesions, with our meta‐analysis showing a higher sensitivity and higher specificity when compared to visual inspection plus dermoscopy. However, the small number of studies and varying methodological quality means implications to guide practice cannot currently be drawn. 
Appropriately designed prospective comparative studies are required, given the paucity of data comparing OCT with dermoscopy and other similar diagnostic aids such as reflectance confocal microscopy. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing a Skin Imaging Tool Called OCT to Find Skin Cancer

## Plain Title

Can a Light-Based Imaging Tool Help Doctors Find Skin Cancer?

## Rationale

**What is skin cancer and why does it matter?**

Skin cancer comes in three main types. Two types, melanoma and squamous cell cancer, are high risk. They can spread to other parts of the body and may cause death. The third type, basal cell cancer, usually stays in one place. But it can grow into nearby tissue and cause damage.

Finding skin cancer early is very important. Early detection helps doctors treat it the right way. This can help people live longer and stay healthier.

**What is the problem?**

Doctors worry about missing early skin cancers. But they also want to avoid sending people for treatment they do not need. Removing harmless skin spots that are not cancer can cause worry and harm.

**What is OCT and why study it?**

OCT stands for optical coherence tomography. It is a tool that takes close-up pictures of the skin. It uses a special type of light called near-infrared light. This light makes the skin surface look much bigger, like a microscope does.

Doctors usually look at suspicious spots with their eyes. Sometimes they use another tool called a dermoscope. OCT might give doctors more information than these other methods.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if OCT can accurately find skin cancer. They wanted to see if it works better than other methods doctors already use.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Researchers looked at many studies done by other scientists. They searched medical databases from the beginning of records up to August 2016.

They looked for studies that tested OCT on adults with suspicious skin spots. These spots might be melanoma, basal cell cancer, or squamous cell cancer.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 529 skin spots from adult patients. Of these spots, 282 were actually cancer.

**How did researchers check if OCT was right?**

After using OCT, doctors removed the skin spots. Lab experts looked at the tissue under a microscope. This is called a biopsy. It is the best way to know if a spot is cancer. Sometimes doctors just watched spots over time instead.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers wanted to know two things. First, how often does OCT correctly find cancer when it is there? This is called sensitivity. Second, how often does OCT correctly say a spot is not cancer when it is not? This is called specificity.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The researchers could not make clear conclusions about melanoma or squamous cell cancer. There were too few studies. The studies were too small. The studies also used different types of OCT machines and different testing methods.

**What about basal cell cancer?**

Two studies looked at basal cell cancer. They used OCT along with looking at the skin and using a dermoscope. The results were combined.

OCT found 95 out of 100 basal cell cancers. It missed 5 out of 100.

OCT correctly said 77 out of 100 harmless spots were not cancer. It wrongly said 23 out of 100 harmless spots were cancer.

**What does this mean in real numbers?**

Imagine 1,000 skin spots. About 600 of them are basal cell cancer.

Using OCT would miss 31 cancers. Using just the eyes would miss 122 cancers. Using eyes plus dermoscope would miss 84 cancers. So OCT missed fewer cancers.

OCT would wrongly call 93 harmless spots cancer. Using just the eyes would wrongly call 252 spots cancer. Using eyes plus dermoscope would wrongly call 180 spots cancer. So OCT made fewer mistakes.

**What were the problems with these studies?**

The studies had some issues. Some used old OCT images instead of taking new ones. Some had more cancer cases than doctors would see in real life. The studies did not always explain their methods clearly.

**What do the results mean?**

OCT might help doctors find basal cell cancer better than other methods. But more research is needed. The studies were too small and had quality problems.

There is not enough information about using OCT for melanoma or squamous cell cancer.

**What happens next?**

Scientists need to do larger, better-designed studies. These studies should compare OCT with other tools doctors use. Only then can doctors know if OCT should be used in everyday practice.",10.1002-14651858.CD013189,"What is the diagnostic accuracy of optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging test, for the detection of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are several different types of skin cancer. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms, and it is important that it is recognised early so that it can be removed. If it is not recognised (also known as a false‐negative test result), treatment can be delayed, and this risks the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body, which may lead to eventual death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are usually localised (i.e. limited to a certain part of the body) skin cancers, although cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations and can cause stress and anxiety to the patient. Making the correct diagnosis is important, and mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate optical coherence tomography (OCT) is for diagnosing skin cancer. Researchers in Cochrane included five studies to answer this question. Two studies were concerned with the diagnosis of melanoma and three with the diagnosis of BCC. 
What was studied in the review? 
A number of tools are available to skin cancer specialists which allow a more detailed examination of the skin compared to examination by the naked eye alone. Currently, a dermoscope is used by most skin cancer specialists, which magnifies the skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) using a bright light source. OCT magnifies the surface of a skin lesion to the level of that seen using a microscope using near‐infrared light. It is quick to perform but is more expensive compared to dermoscopy and requires specialist training. Review authors examined how useful OCT is to help diagnose skin cancers when used after visual inspection or visual inspection plus dermoscopy. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included five studies: two studies with 97 participants with 133 skin lesions suspected of being melanoma, and three studies with 305 participants with 396 lesions suspected of being BCC of which one (50 lesions) also analysed cSCCs (nine lesions). 
The studies investigating the accuracy of OCT for diagnosing melanoma were small and too different from each other to allow a reliable estimate of the accuracy of OCT for melanoma to be made. Similarly, only one small, low‐quality study investigated the accuracy of OCT for diagnosing cSCC. 
For identifying BCC, two studies showed the effects of skin specialists using OCT after visual inspection alone, or visual inspection with dermoscopic examination. These two studies indicated that in theory, if OCT were to be used in a group of 1000 people with skin lesions that were particularly difficult to diagnose, of whom 600 (60%) actually had BCC, then: 
‐ an estimated 662 people would have an OCT result confirming that a BCC was present and of these 93 (14%) would not actually have had a BCC (false‐positive result); 
‐ of the 338 people with an OCT result indicating that no BCC was present, 31 (9%) would actually have a BCC (false‐negative result). 
Compared to making a diagnosis of BCC using visual inspection plus dermoscopy, the addition of OCT in this group would reduce the number of false‐positive results by 87 (thus reducing unnecessary surgical procedures) and would miss 53 fewer BCCs. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
In all included studies, the diagnosis of skin cancer was made by lesion biopsy (OCT/dermoscopy positive) (a biopsy involves taking a sample of body cells and examining them under a microscope), and the absence of skin cancer was confirmed by biopsy (OCT/dermoscopy negative)*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer. However, the small number of studies included in this review, and variability between them, reduced the reliability of findings. Included studies also had important limitations, in particular study participants were from more restricted groups than would be eligible for an OCT scan in practice (e.g. all studies included people with skin lesions that had already been selected for surgical removal), while the way in which OCT was used may not reflect real‐life situations. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in Europe and the US only. Average age (reported in only two studies) was 46 years for melanoma and 63 years for BCC. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma was 23% and 27% (in two studies), ranged from 58% to 61% for BCC (three studies), and was 18% for cSCC (one study). For the diagnosis of BCC, the results apply to people with 'pink' and non‐pigmented skin lesions that the clinician considers particularly difficult to diagnose by the naked eye alone. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Not enough research has been done on using OCT in detecting skin cancers. The results of this review suggest that OCT might help to diagnose BCC when it is difficult to distinguish it from benign skin lesions, but it is not yet clear whether it can adequately distinguish between BCC, cSCC, and melanoma skin cancers. More studies are needed comparing OCT to dermoscopy and to other microscopic techniques (such as reflectance confocal microscopy) in well‐described groups of people with suspicious skin lesions. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the standard comparisons.

253,10.1002-14651858.CD012030.pub2-abstract.txt,"Psychological therapies to reduce tiredness in patients with incurable cancer
Background 
Patients with incurable cancer often experience tiredness (fatigue) during cancer treatment. Psychological therapies may help to reduce this symptom. Tiredness in cancer patients receiving cancer treatment may be treated with psychological therapies aimed at influencing or changing thoughts, emotions, behaviours, social interactions, or a combination of these (e.g. cognitive‐behavioural therapies, supportive‐expressive group therapies). This review looked at how effective psychological therapies are in reducing tiredness in patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment. 
Study characteristics 
In November 2016, we searched for clinical trials looking at psychological therapies in patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment. We found 14 small studies of very low quality reporting data on tiredness outcomes, 12 of which provided data for analyses. A limited number (three studies) reported results about side effects; these studies investigated a psychological therapy combined with medication. 
Key findings 
Review authors found no support for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in reducing tiredness when assessed directly following the intervention. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that psychological therapies may improve physical functioning directly after the intervention and may improve tiredness at first follow‐up. Evidence shows no support for the effectiveness of psychosocial therapies in improving other domains of functioning. Limited evaluation of potential harm suggests no differences in side effects between patients receiving psychological therapy and those given usual care. Limited good quality evidence allows no conclusions on the use of psychological therapies in people with incurable cancer. Larger, high‐quality trials are needed to find out whether psychological therapies help reduce tiredness for people with incurable cancer during cancer treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of study evidence using four levels: very low, low, moderate, and high. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Included studies had design problems and included a very small number of participants. Therefore, the quality of the evidence in this review is very low, and results of this review should be interpreted with caution. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Can Talk Therapy Help Reduce Tiredness in People with Advanced Cancer?

## Rationale

Many people with advanced cancer feel very tired. This tiredness is called fatigue. It happens often during cancer treatment. Feeling tired all the time can make daily life very hard. It can affect how people feel and what they can do.

Talk therapy might help reduce this tiredness. Talk therapy means meeting with a trained person to work on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Some types include cognitive-behavioral therapy. This helps people change how they think about things. Other types include group therapy. This is where people meet together for support.

Researchers wanted to know if talk therapy really helps. They wanted to see if it could reduce tiredness in people with advanced cancer. Advanced cancer means the cancer cannot be cured. These patients are still getting cancer treatment. The study was needed because many patients feel tired. Doctors need to know what works to help them.

## Trial Design

Researchers looked for studies done by other scientists. They searched in November 2016. They wanted to find all studies about talk therapy for cancer patients. The studies had to include people with advanced cancer. These people had to be getting cancer treatment.

The researchers found 14 small studies. These studies included adults with cancer that could not be cured. The studies looked at different types of talk therapy. Some studies compared talk therapy to usual care. Usual care means the normal treatment patients get.

The studies were different sizes. They included different numbers of people. The time people spent in each study also varied. Some studies lasted a few weeks. Others lasted longer.

## Results

The researchers found that talk therapy did not help reduce tiredness right after treatment ended. The evidence quality was very low. This means the results may not be reliable.

Some findings showed talk therapy might help in small ways. It might improve how well people's bodies work. This was measured right after treatment. Talk therapy might also reduce tiredness later on. This was at the first check-up after treatment ended. But again, the evidence was very low quality.

Talk therapy did not seem to help other areas of life. These included emotional health and social activities.

Three studies looked at side effects. These studies used talk therapy plus medicine. They found no difference in side effects. People getting talk therapy had the same side effects as people getting usual care.

The main conclusion is clear. There is not enough good evidence to know if talk therapy works. The studies were too small. They also had problems with how they were done. This makes the results uncertain.

Researchers say larger studies are needed. These studies must be done better. They need more people in them. Only then can doctors know if talk therapy truly helps. Right now, doctors cannot be sure if talk therapy reduces tiredness in people with advanced cancer.

People with advanced cancer and their doctors should know these results. Talk therapy might help some people. But there is no strong proof yet. More research is needed to find the best ways to help people feel less tired during cancer treatment.",10.1002-14651858.CD012030,"Psychological therapies to reduce tiredness in patients with incurable cancer

254,10.1002-14651858.CD013495.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Depression and anxiety are the most frequent indication for which antidepressants are prescribed. Long‐term antidepressant use is driving much of the internationally observed rise in antidepressant consumption. Surveys of antidepressant users suggest that 30% to 50% of long‐term antidepressant prescriptions had no evidence‐based indication. Unnecessary use of antidepressants puts people at risk of adverse events. However, high‐certainty evidence is lacking regarding the effectiveness and safety of approaches to discontinuing long‐term antidepressants. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of approaches for discontinuation versus continuation of long‐term antidepressant use for depressive and anxiety disorders in adults. 
Search methods
We searched all databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) until January 2020.
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing approaches to discontinuation with continuation of antidepressants (or usual care) for people with depression or anxiety who are prescribed antidepressants for at least six months. Interventions included discontinuation alone (abrupt or taper), discontinuation with psychological therapy support, and discontinuation with minimal intervention. Primary outcomes were successful discontinuation rate,relapse (as defined by authors of the original study), withdrawal symptoms, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, social and occupational functioning, and severity of illness. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. 
Main results
We included 33 studies involving 4995 participants. Nearly all studies were conducted in a specialist mental healthcare service and included participants with recurrent depression (i.e. two or more episodes of depression prior to discontinuation). All included trials were at high risk of bias. The main limitation of the review is bias due to confounding withdrawal symptoms with symptoms of relapse of depression. Withdrawal symptoms (such as low mood, dizziness) may have an effect on almost every outcome including adverse events, quality of life, social functioning, and severity of illness. 
Abrupt discontinuation  
Thirteen studies reported abrupt discontinuation of antidepressant.
Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that abrupt discontinuation without psychological support may increase risk of relapse (hazard ratio (HR) 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59 to 2.74; 1373 participants, 10 studies) and there is insufficient evidence of its effect on adverse events (odds ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.99; 1012 participants, 7 studies; I² = 37%) compared to continuation of antidepressants, without specific assessment of withdrawal symptoms. Evidence about the effects of abrupt discontinuation on withdrawal symptoms (1 study) is very uncertain. 
None of these studies included successful discontinuation rate as a primary endpoint. 
Discontinuation by ""taper""  
Eighteen studies examined discontinuation by ""tapering"" (one week or longer). Most tapering regimens lasted four weeks or less. 
Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that ""tapered"" discontinuation may lead to higher risk of relapse (HR 2.97, 95% CI 2.24 to 3.93; 1546 participants, 13 studies) with no or little difference in adverse events (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.38; 1479 participants, 7 studies; I² = 0%) compared to continuation of antidepressants, without specific assessment of withdrawal symptoms. Evidence about the effects of discontinuation on withdrawal symptoms (1 study) is very uncertain. 
Discontinuation with psychological support  
Four studies reported discontinuation with psychological support. Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that initiation of preventive cognitive therapy (PCT), or MBCT, combined with ""tapering"" may result in successful discontinuation rates of 40% to 75% in the discontinuation group (690 participants, 3 studies). Data from control groups in these studies were requested but are not yet available. 
Low‐certainty evidence suggests that discontinuation combined with psychological intervention may result in no or little effect on relapse (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.19; 690 participants, 3 studies) compared to continuation of antidepressants. Withdrawal symptoms were not measured. Pooling data on adverse events was not possible due to insufficient information (3 studies). 
Discontinuation with minimal intervention  
Low‐certainty evidence from one study suggests that a letter to the general practitioner (GP) to review antidepressant treatment may result in no or little effect on successful discontinuation rate compared to usual care (6% versus 8%; 146 participants, 1 study) or on relapse (relapse rate 26% vs 13%; 146 participants, 1 study). No data on withdrawal symptoms nor adverse events were provided. 
None of the studies used low‐intensity psychological interventions such as online support or a changed pharmaceutical formulation that allows tapering with low doses over several months. Insufficient data were available for the majority of people taking antidepressants in the community (i.e. those with only one or no prior episode of depression), for people aged 65 years and older, and for people taking antidepressants for anxiety. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently, relatively few studies have focused on approaches to discontinuation of long‐term antidepressants. We cannot make any firm conclusions about effects and safety of the approaches studied to date. The true effect and safety are likely to be substantially different from the data presented due to assessment of relapse of depression that is confounded by withdrawal symptoms. All other outcomes are confounded with withdrawal symptoms. Most tapering regimens were limited to four weeks or less. In the studies with rapid tapering schemes the risk of withdrawal symptoms may be similar to studies using abrupt discontinuation which may influence the effectiveness of the interventions. Nearly all data come from people with recurrent depression.   
There is an urgent need for trials that adequately address withdrawal confounding bias, and carefully distinguish relapse from withdrawal symptoms. Future studies should report key outcomes such as successful discontinuation rate and should include populations with one or no prior depression episodes in primary care, older people, and people taking antidepressants for anxiety and use tapering schemes longer than 4 weeks. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Stopping Long-Term Antidepressant Use

## Plain Title

Can people safely stop taking antidepressants after using them for a long time?

## Rationale

**What is the health issue?**

Many people take antidepressants for depression and anxiety. Some people take these medicines for many years. Studies show that 3 to 5 out of every 10 people who take antidepressants long-term may not need them anymore.

**Why is this a problem?**

Taking medicine you don't need can cause unwanted side effects. These side effects can make people feel unwell. However, stopping antidepressants can also cause problems.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to find out the best way to help people stop taking antidepressants safely. They wanted to know if stopping would cause depression to come back. They also wanted to know about withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms happen when your body adjusts to not having the medicine. These symptoms can include feeling dizzy, having low mood, or feeling anxious.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors need to know the safest ways to help patients stop antidepressants. Right now, we don't have enough good information about this.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 33 studies. These studies included 4,995 people total. The researchers compared different ways of stopping antidepressants.

**Who was in these studies?**

Most people in the studies:
- Had depression that came back two or more times
- Were getting care from mental health specialists
- Had been taking antidepressants for at least 6 months

**What methods were tested?**

The studies tested four ways to stop antidepressants:

1. Stopping suddenly with no extra help
2. Stopping slowly over time (called ""tapering"")
3. Stopping slowly while getting talk therapy support
4. Getting a letter sent to their doctor to review their medicine

**How long did the studies last?**

Most tapering plans lasted 4 weeks or less. The total study time varied.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not make firm conclusions. This is because the studies had major problems. The biggest problem was that withdrawal symptoms look very similar to depression coming back. This made it hard to tell them apart.

**Stopping suddenly:**
- Depression may come back more often (10 studies)
- We don't know enough about side effects (7 studies)
- We don't know enough about withdrawal symptoms (1 study)

**Stopping slowly (tapering):**
- Depression may come back more often (13 studies)
- Side effects were similar to continuing medicine (7 studies)
- We don't know enough about withdrawal symptoms (1 study)

**Stopping with talk therapy support:**
- 4 to 7 out of 10 people successfully stopped their medicine (3 studies)
- Depression came back at similar rates as people who kept taking medicine (3 studies)
- Withdrawal symptoms were not measured

**Getting a letter to the doctor:**
- Very few people stopped their medicine successfully (1 study)
- Depression came back more in people who tried to stop (1 study)

**What was missing?**

The studies did not test:
- Tapering plans longer than 4 weeks
- Online support programs
- Special pill forms that make slow tapering easier
- People who only had depression once or never
- People age 65 and older
- People taking antidepressants for anxiety

**What do the results mean?**

We need better studies to understand how to safely stop antidepressants. The current studies cannot give us clear answers. Future studies must be able to tell the difference between withdrawal symptoms and depression coming back. They also need to include more types of patients and test longer tapering plans.

**Important note:**

If you take antidepressants, do not stop taking them without talking to your doctor first. Stopping suddenly can be harmful.",10.1002-14651858.CD013495,"Stopping long‐term antidepressants in people with depression or anxiety
Review question 
We aimed to find out if it is effective and safe to stop antidepressants for people with depression or anxiety who have been taking them for six months or longer. 
We compared different approaches for stopping long‐term antidepressants versus continuation. We looked at benefits (e.g. successful discontinuation rate) and harms, such as return of the depressive or anxiety episode (relapse), side effects, and withdrawal symptoms (i.e. symptoms people experience when stopping an antidepressant). 
Background 
Antidepressants are widely used for depression and anxiety. Guidelines recommend that an antidepressant should be continued for at least six months after people start to feel better, and for at least two years if they have had two or more periods of depression. Many people take antidepressants for much longer, and as they can cause unpleasant side effects, long‐term use puts people at risk of harm that may outweigh the benefits. 
Study characteristics 
Our search up until January 2020 found 33 studies, which included 4995 adult participants. Most people in these studies had recurrent depression (two or more episodes of depression before stopping antidepressants), and most were recruited from specialist mental healthcare services. In 13 studies, the antidepressant was stopped abruptly; in 18 studies, the antidepressant was stopped gradually over several weeks (""tapering""); in four studies, psychological therapy support was also offered; and in one study, stopping was prompted by a letter to the GP with guidance on tapering. Most tapering schemes lasted four weeks or less. 
Key results 
We found very low‐certainty evidence suggesting that abrupt stopping may lead to higher risk of relapse and there was insufficient evidence of its effect on occurrence of side effects compared to continuation of the antidepressant. 
We found very low‐certainty evidence suggesting that ""tapering"" over a few weeks may lead to higher risk of a return and again may have little or no effect on side effects compared to continuation. 
We found evidence of very low to low certainty to suggest that stopping the antidepressant in combination with providing preventive cognitive therapy (PCT), or MBCT, was possible for 40% to 75% of participants in the group tapering the antidepressant and may show no difference in effects on relapse. 
We found low‐certainty evidence suggesting that a prompt letter and guidance on tapering sent to the GP may have no effect on the number of people who stop their antidepressant. 
We were unable to draw conclusions about withdrawal symptoms after abrupt or gradual stopping of an antidepressant, as this generally was not assessed. 
None of the studies used very slow tapering schemes beyond a few weeks, tapered liquid forms of antidepressants, or used tapering strips (to allow tapering with very low doses). 
None of the identified studies investigated stopping combined with providing supportive therapy such as online support or self‐help therapy. 
Certainty of evidence 
Overall, the certainty of evidence was low to very low. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and new research is likely to change our conclusions. The main reasons for this assessment of evidence certainty were that trials did not distinguish between symptoms of relapse of depression and symptoms of withdrawal. Also, most studies used no tapering or very ""rapid"" tapering schedules (four weeks or less), and nearly all studies included people with recurrent depression (more than two episodes). 
Conclusions 
We found few studies that examined stopping long‐term antidepressants. We are uncertain if the approaches for stopping long‐term antidepressants studied to date are effective and safe in people with recurrent depression. People should discuss with their doctor when they want to stop their antidepressant. 
Future studies should include people in primary care with only one or no earlier episodes of depression, older people, and people taking antidepressants for anxiety. Studies should taper antidepressants slowly while taking care to distinguish withdrawal symptoms from relapse.

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID‐19 because they counter hyper‐inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. So far, systemic corticosteroids are one of the few treatment options for COVID‐19. Nonetheless, size of effect, certainty of the evidence, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated. 
Objectives
To assess whether systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID‐19, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 16 April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID‐19, irrespective of disease severity, participant age, gender or ethnicity.  
We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids. We included the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (plus/minus placebo), dose comparisons, timing comparisons (early versus late), different types of corticosteroids and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances.  
We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome), corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long‐COVID treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all‐cause mortality, ventilator‐free days, new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, quality of life, serious adverse events, adverse events, and hospital‐acquired infections. 
Main results
We included 11 RCTs in 8075 participants, of whom 7041 (87%) originated from high‐income countries. A total of 3072 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 2322). We also identified 42 ongoing studies and 16 studies reported as being completed or terminated in a study registry, but without results yet.  
Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID‐19 
Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo  
We included 10 RCTs (7989 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre‐specified outcomes and thus our analysis included outcome data from nine studies.  
All‐cause mortality (at longest follow‐up available): systemic corticosteroids plus standard care probably reduce all‐cause mortality slightly in people with COVID‐19 compared to standard care alone (median 28 days: risk difference of 30 in 1000 participants fewer than the control group rate of 275 in 1000 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.00; 9 RCTs, 7930 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Ventilator‐free days: corticosteroids may increase ventilator‐free days (MD 2.6 days more than control group rate of 4 days, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.53; 1 RCT, 299 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Ventilator‐free days have inherent limitations as a composite endpoint and should be interpreted with caution.  
New need for invasive ventilation: the evidence is of very low certainty. Because of high risk of bias arising from deaths that occurred before ventilation we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics.  
Quality of life/neurological outcome: no data were available. 
Serious adverse events: we included data on two RCTs (678 participants) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids compared to standard care (plus/minus placebo); for adverse events and hospital‐acquired infections, we included data on five RCTs (660 participants). Because of high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics (very low‐certainty evidence).    
Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids   
We identified one study that compared methylprednisolone with dexamethasone. The evidence for mortality and new need for invasive mechanical ventilation is very low certainty due to the small number of participants (n = 86). No data were available for the other outcomes. 
We did not identify comparisons of different dosages or timing.
Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease 
Currently, there are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease. 
Authors' conclusions
Moderate‐certainty evidence shows that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all‐cause mortality in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID‐19. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that there may also be a reduction in ventilator‐free days. Since we are unable to  adjust for the impact of early death on subsequent endpoints, the findings for ventilation outcomes and harms have limited applicability to inform treatment decisions. Currently, there is no evidence for asymptomatic or mild disease (non‐hospitalised participants).  
There is an urgent need for good‐quality evidence for specific subgroups of disease severity, for which we propose level of respiratory support at randomisation. This applies to the comparison or subgroups of different types and doses of corticosteroids, too. Outcomes apart from mortality should be measured and analysed appropriately taking into account confounding through death if applicable.  
We identified 42 ongoing and 16 completed but not published RCTs in trials registries suggesting possible changes of effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future. Most ongoing studies target people who need respiratory support at baseline. With the living approach of this review, we will continue to update our search and include eligible trials and published data. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Steroids for Treating COVID-19

## Plain Title
Do Steroid Medicines Help People Sick Enough with COVID-19 to Be in the Hospital?

## Rationale

### What is COVID-19 and why is it a problem?
COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus. Some people get very sick from COVID-19. Their bodies fight the virus so hard that this fight itself causes harm. This is called hyper-inflammation. It means the body's defense system works too much and damages the lungs and other organs.

### What are steroids?
Steroids are medicines that calm down the body's defense system. Doctors call these medicines ""systemic corticosteroids."" They travel through the whole body in the blood.

### Why did researchers do this study?
Researchers wanted to know if steroids help people with COVID-19. They wanted to find out if steroids:
- Help people live longer
- Keep people off breathing machines
- Are safe to use

Very few treatments work for COVID-19. Researchers needed to know if steroids are one treatment that helps.

### Why might steroids work?
Steroids might help because they calm down hyper-inflammation. This could protect the lungs and other organs from damage.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not one single study. Researchers looked at many studies done by other scientists. They combined the results to see the bigger picture. This type of research is called a systematic review.

### Who was in these studies?
The studies included 8,075 people total. Most people (87 out of 100) were from wealthy countries. All people in the studies were sick enough with COVID-19 to be in the hospital.

The studies included:
- People of different ages
- Both men and women
- People from different backgrounds

### What treatments did people get?
Most people got a steroid called dexamethasone. Some got other steroids. Researchers compared people who got steroids plus regular care to people who got only regular care.

### How long were people in the studies?
Most studies followed people for about 28 days (4 weeks).

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

**Did steroids help people live?**
Yes, steroids probably help a little bit. Out of every 1,000 people treated:
- Without steroids: 275 people died
- With steroids: 245 people died

This means steroids saved about 30 lives out of every 1,000 people treated. Researchers are moderately confident in this finding.

**Did steroids help people stay off breathing machines?**
Maybe. People who got steroids might have spent about 3 more days breathing on their own. But researchers are less sure about this finding.

**Did steroids cause harm?**
Researchers could not tell for sure. The studies did not report side effects well enough. More research is needed to understand if steroids cause problems.

**What about people not in the hospital?**
No studies looked at people with mild COVID-19 who stayed home. Researchers only know about people sick enough to be in the hospital.

### Why does this matter?
This research shows that steroids are one of the few treatments that help people very sick with COVID-19. Doctors now know that steroids can save some lives.

### What questions remain?
Researchers still need to learn:
- Which dose of steroids works best
- Which type of steroid works best
- Which patients benefit most from steroids
- If steroids cause side effects

### What happens next?
This is a ""living review."" This means researchers will keep updating it as new studies finish. Right now, 42 new studies are happening. These may give more answers in the future.

### Main conclusions
Steroids probably help people who are in the hospital with COVID-19 live longer. The benefit is small but real. Doctors should consider using steroids for patients sick enough to be in the hospital. More research is needed for people with mild disease who are not in the hospital.",10.1002-14651858.CD014963,"Are corticosteroids (anti‐inflammatory medicines) given orally or by injection an effective treatment for people with COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
• Corticosteroids (anti‐inflammatory medicines) given orally or by injection (systemic) are probably effective treatments for people hospitalised with COVID‐19. We don’t know whether they cause unwanted effects.  
• We don’t know which systemic corticosteroid is the most effective. We found no evidence about people without symptoms or with mild COVID‐19 who were not hospitalised.  
• We found 42 ongoing studies and 16 completed studies that have not published their results. We will update this review when we find new evidence.     
What are corticosteroids? 
Corticosteroids are anti‐inflammatory medicines that reduce redness and swelling. They also reduce the activity of the immune system, which defends the body against disease and infection. Corticosteroids are used to treat a variety of conditions, such as asthma, eczema, joint strains and rheumatoid arthritis.  
Systemic corticosteroids can be swallowed or given by injection to treat the whole body. High doses of corticosteroids taken over a long time may cause unwanted effects, such as increased appetite, difficulty sleeping and mood changes.  
Why are corticosteroids possible treatments for COVID‐19?  
COVID‐19 affects the lungs and airways. As the immune system fights the virus, the lungs and airways become inflamed, causing breathing difficulties. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation, so may reduce the need for breathing support with a ventilator (a machine that breathes for a patient). Some patients’ immune systems overreact to the virus causing further inflammation and tissue damage; corticosteroids may help to control this response. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether systemic corticosteroids are an effective treatment for people with COVID‐19 and whether they cause unwanted effects. 
We were interested in:
• deaths from any cause up to 14 days after treatment, or longer if reported;• whether people got better or worse after treatment, based on their need for breathing support;• quality of life;• unwanted effects and infections caught in hospital. 
What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated systemic corticosteroids for people with mild, moderate or severe COVID‐19. People could be any age, sex or ethnicity. 
Studies could compare:
• corticosteroids plus usual care versus usual care with or without placebo (sham medicine);• one corticosteroid versus another;• corticosteroids versus a different medicine;• different doses of a corticosteroid; or• early versus late treatment. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 11 studies with 8075 people. About 3000 people received corticosteroids, mostly dexamethasone (2322 people). Most studies took place in high‐income countries.  
We also found 42 ongoing studies, and 16 completed studies that have not yet published their results.  
Main results 
Ten studies compared corticosteroids plus usual care versus usual care with or without placebo. Only one study compared two corticosteroids. The studies included only hospitalised people with confirmed or suspected COVID‐19. No studies looked at non‐hospitalised people, different doses or timing, or provided information about quality of life. 
Corticosteroids plus usual care compared to usual care with or without placebo (10 studies) 
• Corticosteroids probably reduce the number of deaths from any cause slightly, up to 60 days after treatment (9 studies, 7930 people).• One study (299 people) reported that people on a ventilator at the start of the study were ventilation‐free for more days with corticosteroids than with usual care, so corticosteroids may improve people’s symptoms.• Four studies (427 people) reported whether people not on a ventilator at the start of treatment later needed to be put on a ventilator, but we could not pool the studies’ results, so we are unsure if people’s symptoms get worse with corticosteroids or usual care.• We don’t know if corticosteroids increase or reduce serious unwanted effects (2 studies, 678 people), any unwanted effects (5 studies, 660 people), or infections caught in hospital (5 studies, 660 people). 
Methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone (1 study, 86 people) 
• We don’t know whether the corticosteroid methylprednisolone reduces the number of deaths from any cause compared to dexamethasone in the 28 days after treatment.• We don’t know if methylprednisolone worsens people’s symptoms compared to dexamethasone, based on whether they needed ventilation in the 28 days after treatment.• The study did not provide information about anything else we were interested in. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are moderately confident in the evidence about corticosteroids’ effect on deaths from any cause. However, our confidence in the other evidence is low to very low, because studies did not use the most robust methods, and the way results were recorded and reported differed across studies. We did not find any evidence on quality of life and there was no evidence from low‐income countries or on people with mild COVID‐19 or no symptoms, who were not hospitalised.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
Our evidence is up to date to 16 April 2021.

Most of these were developed for use with children and adolescents who do not have long‐term physical conditions. Some of these, particularly those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and therapies specifically designed to treat depression or anxiety, are effective at reducing mild symptoms of these conditions in the short term. There is limited evidence that such therapies are acceptable to young people and that they can improve quality of life and symptoms of long‐term physical conditions. There is currently a lack of therapies for addressing health‐related anxiety in this population.

Further research should be undertaken to develop more effective psychological therapies to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Can Talking Therapies Help Children with Long-Term Health Problems Who Feel Anxious or Sad?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?
More than 1 in 10 children have long-term health problems. These include asthma, diabetes, and cancer. These health problems last a long time and need ongoing care.

Children with these health problems are more likely to feel very worried or very sad. These feelings are called anxiety and depression. When children feel this way, it can cause problems at home and at school. It can also lead to mental health problems later in life.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors use talking therapies to help children who feel anxious or sad. These are also called psychological therapies. In these therapies, children talk with a trained person about their feelings and learn ways to feel better.

Most talking therapies were made for children who do not have long-term health problems. Doctors were not sure if these same therapies would work for children with long-term health problems.

The researchers wanted to find out if talking therapies can help these children feel less anxious or sad.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not a single study. The researchers looked at many studies done by other scientists. They searched for all high-quality studies from 1970 to 2018.

They looked for studies that tested talking therapies in children and teens. These young people were 18 years old or younger. All of them had long-term health problems. All of them also felt anxious or sad.

The researchers found 29 studies. These studies included 1,349 young people in total. The researchers rated the quality of these studies as low to moderate.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The researchers found that some talking therapies can help. The therapies that worked best were based on something called cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT. In CBT, children learn to change how they think and act. This helps them feel better.

Therapies made specifically to treat anxiety or depression also worked well. These therapies helped reduce mild feelings of worry or sadness in the short term.

There was some evidence that young people found these therapies acceptable. This means they were willing to try them and continue with them.

There was limited evidence that these therapies might improve quality of life. Quality of life means how good children feel about their daily lives. The therapies might also help with symptoms of their long-term health problems.

However, there are not enough therapies to help with anxiety that is specifically about health concerns. Many children with long-term health problems worry about their health. More therapies are needed for this type of worry.

### Why is this important?
This study shows that talking therapies can help children with long-term health problems who feel anxious or sad. Treating these feelings early can prevent bigger problems later.

The study also shows that more research is needed. Scientists need to develop better therapies for these children. They especially need therapies for children who worry about their health.

### What happens next?
More research should be done to create better talking therapies. These therapies should be designed specifically for children and teens with long-term health problems who feel anxious or sad.",10.1002-14651858.CD012488,"Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions

257,10.1002-14651858.CD013287.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Psychosis is an illness characterised by the presence of hallucinations and delusions that can cause distress or a marked change in an individual's behaviour (e.g. social withdrawal, flat or blunted affect). A first episode of psychosis (FEP) is the first time someone experiences these symptoms that can occur at any age, but the condition is most common in late adolescence and early adulthood. This review is concerned with FEP and the early stages of a psychosis, referred to throughout this review as 'recent‐onset psychosis.' 
Specialised early intervention (SEI) teams are community mental health teams that specifically treat people who are experiencing, or have experienced, a recent‐onset psychosis. SEI teams provide a range of treatments including medication, psychotherapy, psychoeducation, educational and employment support, augmented by assertive contact with the service user and small caseloads. Treatment is time limited, usually offered for two to three years, after which service users are either discharged to primary care or transferred to a standard adult community mental health team. Evidence suggests that once SEI treatment ends, improvements may not be sustained, bringing uncertainty about the optimal duration of SEI to ensure the best long‐term outcomes. Extending SEI has been proposed as a way of providing continued intensive treatment and continuity of care, of usually up to five years, in order to a) sustain the positive initial outcomes of SEI; and b) improve the long‐term trajectory of the illness. 
Objectives
To compare extended SEI teams with treatment as usual (TAU) for people with recent‐onset psychosis.To compare extended SEI teams with standard SEI teams followed by TAU (standard SEI + TAU) for people with recent‐onset psychosis. 
Search methods
On 3 October 2018 and 22 October 2019, we searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's study‐based register of trials, including registries of clinical trials. 
Selection criteria
We selected all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing extended SEI with TAU for people with recent‐onset psychosis and all RCTs comparing extended SEI with standard SEI + TAU for people with recent‐onset psychosis. We entered trials meeting these criteria and reporting usable data as included studies. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes we calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and their 95% CIs, or if assessment measures differed for the same construct, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included three RCTs, with a total 780 participants, aged 16 to 35 years. All participants met the criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorders or affective psychoses. No trials compared extended SEI with TAU. All three trials randomly allocated people approximately two years into standard SEI to either extended SEI or standard SEI + TAU. 
The certainty of evidence for outcomes varied from low to very low. Our primary outcomes were recovery and disengagement from mental health services. No trials reported on recovery, and we used remission as a proxy. 
Three trials reported on remission, with the point estimate suggesting a 13% increase in remission in favour of extended SEI, but this included wide confidence intervals (CIs) and a very uncertain estimate of no benefit (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.31; 3 trials, 780 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Two trials provided data on disengagement from services with evidence that extended SEI care may result in fewer disengagements from mental health treatment (15%) in comparison to standard SEI + TAU (34%) (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75; 2 trials, 380 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
There may be no evidence of a difference in rates of psychiatric hospital admission (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.52; 1 trial, 160 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or the number of days spent in a psychiatric hospital (MD ‐2.70, 95% CI ‐8.30 to 2.90; 1 trial, 400 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
One trial found uncertain evidence regarding lower global psychotic symptoms in extended SEI in comparison to standard SEI + TAU (MD ‐1.90, 95% CI ‐3.28 to ‐0.52; 1 trial, 156 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
It was uncertain whether the use of extended SEI over standard SEI + TAU resulted in fewer deaths due to all‐cause mortality, as so few deaths were recorded in trials (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.64; 3 trials, 780 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Very uncertain evidence suggests that using extended SEI instead of standard SEI + TAU may not improve global functioning (SMD 0.23, 95% CI ‐0.29 to 0.76; 2 trials, 560 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
There was low risk of bias in all three trials for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and other biases. All three trials had high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel due to the nature of the intervention. For the risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessments and incomplete outcome data there was at least one trial with high or unclear risk of bias. 
Authors' conclusions
There may be preliminary evidence of benefit from extending SEI team care for treating people experiencing psychosis, with fewer people disengaging from mental health services. Evidence regarding other outcomes was uncertain. The certainty of evidence for the measured outcomes was low or very low. 
Further, suitably powered studies that use a consistent approach to outcome selection are needed, but with only one further ongoing trial, there is unlikely to be any definitive conclusion for the effectiveness of extended SEI for at least the next few years. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Extended Care for People with First-Time Psychosis

## Plain Title
Does longer treatment with specialized mental health teams help people who have recently experienced psychosis for the first time?

## Rationale

**What is psychosis?**
Psychosis is a mental health condition. People with psychosis may hear or see things that are not there (called hallucinations). They may also have strong beliefs that are not based in reality (called delusions). These symptoms can be very upsetting. They can cause people to withdraw from others or show less emotion.

**What is first episode psychosis?**
First episode psychosis means the first time someone has these symptoms. This often happens to young people between ages 16 and 35.

**What is specialized early intervention?**
Special mental health teams help people who recently had their first psychosis. These teams are called specialized early intervention teams, or SEI teams. They provide many types of help:
- Medicine
- Talk therapy
- Education about the illness
- Help with school or jobs
- Regular check-ins and support

Usually, SEI teams work with patients for 2 to 3 years. After that, patients either go back to their regular doctor or move to a standard mental health team.

**Why was this study needed?**
Research shows that when SEI treatment ends, patients sometimes get worse again. Doctors are not sure how long SEI treatment should last. Some experts think extending SEI care to 5 years might help patients stay well longer. This study looked at whether longer SEI treatment works better than standard care.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
This review looked at 3 research studies. These studies included 780 people total. All participants were between 16 and 35 years old. All had recently experienced psychosis.

The studies worked like this:
- People received standard SEI care for about 2 years
- Then they were randomly put into two groups
- One group continued with extended SEI care
- The other group moved to standard care

Researchers compared the two groups to see which did better.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The evidence from these studies was not very strong. More research is needed. Here is what the studies found:

**Staying in treatment:**
Extended SEI care may help more people stay in treatment. About 15 out of 100 people left extended SEI care. But 34 out of 100 people left standard care. This means extended care may help keep people connected to mental health services.

**Getting better:**
The studies did not clearly show if extended care helps more people get better. The results were uncertain.

**Hospital stays:**
Extended care did not clearly reduce how many people went to the hospital. It also did not reduce how many days people spent in the hospital.

**Symptoms:**
One study suggested extended care might reduce psychosis symptoms. But this finding was very uncertain.

**Daily functioning:**
The studies did not clearly show if extended care helps people function better in daily life.

**Deaths:**
Very few people died in these studies. Researchers could not tell if extended care affected death rates.

**What does this mean?**
Extended SEI care may help by keeping more people in treatment. This is important because staying in treatment helps people get better. However, the evidence is weak. Scientists need to do more studies to know for sure if extended care works better.

**Limitations:**
These studies had some problems:
- The evidence quality was low or very low
- Only 3 studies were done
- Participants knew which treatment they received
- Different studies measured results in different ways

More research is needed before doctors can be sure that extended SEI care works better than standard care.",10.1002-14651858.CD013287,"Is extending the treatment time by specialist mental health teams better for people with recent‐onset psychosis? 
What is psychosis? 
Psychosis describes conditions affecting the mind, in which people have trouble distinguishing what is real from what is not real. This might involve seeing or hearing things that other people cannot see or hear (hallucinations), or believing things that are not true (delusions). The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can cause severe distress and a change in behaviour. A first episode psychosis is the first time a person experiences an episode of psychosis. Recent‐onset psychosis is the first few years of the illness after someone experiences it for the first time. 
Psychosis is treatable 
Many people recover from a first episode and never experience another psychotic episode.
Early intervention teams specialise in treating recent‐onset psychosis, and aim to treat psychosis as quickly and intensively as possible. Intensive, early treatment of psychosis may help more people to continue with their treatment and to recover. 
Early intervention treatment usually lasts for two or three years. After early intervention treatment, a person will be cared for by their doctor or by standard community mental health professionals. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out if longer treatment (for up to 5 years) by specialist early intervention teams was more successful at treating recent‐onset psychosis than the usual two or three years of treatment followed by treatment by non‐specialist teams. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the use of longer treatment of recent‐onset psychosis by specialist early intervention teams. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random. This type of study usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
We wanted to find out, at the end of the treatment:
‐ how many people recovered;
‐ how many people stopped their treatment too soon;
‐ how many people were admitted to a psychiatric hospital, and for how long;
‐ people's psychotic symptoms and functioning (how well they cope with daily life); and 
‐ how many people died.
Search date: we included evidence published up to 22 October 2019. 
What we found 
We found three studies conducted in Denmark, Canada and Hong Kong in 780 people (55% men; average age 20 to 25 years). 
The studies compared longer treatment (up to 5 years) with standard treatment (up to 3 years) by an early intervention team followed by treatment as usual (by their doctor or community mental health professionals). 
What are the results of our review? 
We found no difference between standard treatment and longer treatment by an early intervention team in the numbers of people who recovered (assessed by remission of symptoms; 3 studies; 780 people). 
Fewer people may stop their treatment too soon during longer treatment than standard treatment (2 studies; 380 people). 
There may be no difference between standard treatment and longer treatment for how many people are admitted to a psychiatric hospital (1 study; 160 people), or for how long they stay in hospital (1 study; 400 people). 
Longer treatment may reduce psychotic symptoms more than standard treatment (1 study; 156 people); but may not improve people's functioning (2 studies; 560 people). 
We are uncertain about whether longer treatment reduces the number of people who died, compared with standard treatment, because so few deaths were reported in the studies (3 studies; 780 people). 
How reliable are these results? 
Our results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. We are not confident that longer treatment affects how many people stop treatment too soon, how many are admitted to hospital and how long they stay in hospital. 
We are uncertain about the effect of longer treatment on how many people recover, people's psychotic symptoms and functioning, and on the number of people who die. These results will change when more evidence becomes available. 
Key messages 
Longer treatment of recent‐onset psychosis by specialist mental health teams may lead to fewer people stopping their treatment early. However, we need more evidence before we can be certain about whether longer treatment is better overall than the usual two‐ or three‐year treatment.

## Plain Title
Different Ways to Organize Health Services for Adults with Intellectual Disabilities

## Rationale

**What is an intellectual disability?**
An intellectual disability means a person has trouble learning, thinking, and solving problems. This affects their daily life.

**Why is this a problem?**
Adults with intellectual disabilities often struggle to get the healthcare they need. They face many challenges. They have more health problems than other adults. They have trouble finding doctors and clinics. Getting to medical appointments is hard. Paying for care is difficult. This happens for both body health problems and mental health problems.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to find better ways to organize health services. They wanted to help adults with intellectual disabilities get the care they need. They looked at different ways to provide healthcare. The goal was to see which methods work best.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review study. The researchers looked at other studies that had already been done. They searched for all useful studies up to September 2015. They found seven studies to review.

**Who was in the studies?**
All studies looked at adults with intellectual disabilities. All seven studies focused on mental health problems. None of the studies looked at physical health problems.

**What did the studies test?**
The studies tested different ways to help people. Some gave people more health services. Some provided therapy and support for emotions. Some treated people at home instead of at the hospital.

**What did researchers measure?**
The studies looked at several things:
- Did behavior problems get better?
- How hard was it for family members to provide care?
- How much did the services cost?

None of the studies looked at harmful effects or side effects.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The review found limited information. There are not many studies on this topic.

**Behavior therapy in the community might help.**
When people got behavior therapy at home or in their community, their behavior problems might get better. This means fewer outbursts or difficult behaviors.

**Other methods are unclear.**
For other ways of organizing services, we do not know if they help. The studies did not give clear answers.

**Limited information on caregivers.**
The review found little information about family caregivers. We do not know much about how these services help reduce stress on families. Caring for someone with an intellectual disability can be very hard. More research is needed.

**Limited information on costs.**
The review found little information about costs. We do not know if new ways of organizing care cost more or less than usual care.

**No information on physical health.**
All studies focused on mental health and behavior. None looked at physical health problems. This is a big gap. People with intellectual disabilities also need help with body health issues.

**What do the authors conclude?**

There is not enough research in this area. We need more studies. Most studies only looked at mental health and behavior problems. No studies looked at physical health needs. This is a problem because people with intellectual disabilities have many physical health needs too.

Better research is needed to find the best ways to organize healthcare. This would help adults with intellectual disabilities get better care. It would help them live healthier lives.

**Why does this matter?**

Adults with intellectual disabilities deserve good healthcare. Right now, we do not know the best ways to help them. More research will help doctors and health systems provide better care. This could improve the lives of many people and their families.",10.1002-14651858.CD007492,"Healthcare services for adults with an intellectual disability

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication amongst people who are critically ill, and it is associated with an increased risk of death. For people with severe AKI, continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT), which is delivered over 24 hours, is needed when they become haemodynamically unstable. When CKRT is interrupted due to clotting of the extracorporeal circuit, the delivered dose is decreased and thus leading to undertreatment. 
Objectives
This review assessed the efficacy of non‐pharmacological measures to maintain circuit patency in CKRT. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 January 2021 which includes records identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (parallel‐group and cross‐over studies), cluster RCTs and quasi‐RCTs that examined non‐pharmacological interventions to prevent clotting of extracorporeal circuits during CKRT.  
Data collection and analysis
Three pairs of review authors independently extracted information including participants, interventions/comparators, outcomes, study methods, and risk of bias. The primary outcomes were circuit lifespan and death due to any cause at day 28. We used a random‐effects model to perform quantitative synthesis (meta‐analysis). We assessed the risk of bias in included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing the risk of bias. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
Main results
A total of 20 studies involving 1143 randomised participants were included in the review. The methodological quality of the included studies was low, mainly due to the unclear randomisation process and blinding of the intervention. We found evidence on the following 11 comparisons: (i) continuous venovenous haemodialysis (CVVHD) versus continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) or continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF); (ii) CVVHDF versus CVVH; (iii) higher blood flow (≥ 250 mL/minute) versus standard blood flow (< 250 mL/minute); (iv) AN69 membrane (AN69ST) versus other membranes; (v) pre‐dilution versus post‐dilution; (vi) a longer catheter (> 20 cm) placing the tip targeting the right atrium versus a shorter catheter (≤ 20 cm) placing the tip in the superior vena cava; (vii) surface‐modified double‐lumen catheter versus standard double‐lumen catheter with identical geometry and flow design; (viii) single‐site infusion anticoagulation versus double‐site infusion anticoagulation; (ix) flat plate filter versus hollow fibre filter of the same membrane type; (x) a filter with a larger membrane surface area versus a smaller one; and (xi) a filter with more and shorter hollow fibre versus a standard filter of the same membrane type. 
Circuit lifespan was reported in 9 comparisons. Low certainty evidence indicated that CVVHDF (versus CVVH: MD 10.15 hours, 95% CI 5.15 to 15.15; 1 study, 62 circuits), pre‐dilution haemofiltration (versus post‐dilution haemofiltration: MD 9.34 hours, 95% CI ‐2.60 to 21.29; 2 studies, 47 circuits; I² = 13%), placing the tip of a longer catheter targeting the right atrium (versus placing a shorter catheter targeting the tip in the superior vena cava: MD 6.50 hours, 95% CI 1.48 to 11.52; 1 study, 420 circuits), and surface‐modified double‐lumen catheter (versus standard double‐lumen catheter: MD 16.00 hours, 95% CI 13.49 to 18.51; 1 study, 262 circuits) may prolong circuit lifespan. However, higher blood flow may not increase circuit lifespan (versus standard blood flow: MD 0.64, 95% CI ‐3.37 to 4.64; 2 studies, 499 circuits; I² = 70%). More and shorter hollow fibre filters (versus standard filters: MD ‐5.87 hours, 95% CI ‐10.18 to ‐1.56; 1 study, 6 circuits) may reduce circuit lifespan. 
Death from any cause was reported in four comparisons We are uncertain whether CVVHDF versus CVVH, CVVHD versus CVVH or CVVHDF, longer versus a shorter catheter, or surface‐modified double‐lumen catheters versus standard double‐lumen catheters reduced death due to any cause, in very low certainty evidence. 
Recovery of kidney function was reported in three comparisons. We are uncertain whether CVVHD versus CVVH or CVVHDF, CVVHDF versus CVVH, or surface‐modified double‐lumen catheters versus standard double‐lumen catheters increased recovery of kidney function. 
Vascular access complications were reported in two comparisons. Low certainty evidence indicated using a longer catheter (versus a shorter catheter: RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.74) may reduce vascular access complications, however, the use of surface‐modified double lumen catheters versus standard double‐lumen catheters may make little or no difference to vascular access complications. 
Authors' conclusions
The use of CVVHDF as compared with CVVH, pre‐dilution haemofiltration, a longer catheter, and surface‐modified double‐lumen catheter may prolong the circuit lifespan, while higher blood flow and more and shorter hollow fibre filter may reduce circuit life. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed to be low to very low due to the small sample size of the included studies. 
Data from future rigorous and transparent research are much needed in order to fully understand the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions in preventing circuit coagulation amongst people with AKI receiving CKRT. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Ways to Keep Kidney Machines Working Longer for Critically Ill Patients

## Plain Title

Testing different methods to prevent blood clots in kidney machines for critically ill patients

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some very sick patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI). This means their kidneys suddenly stop working properly. AKI is common in people who are critically ill. It increases their risk of dying.

**What treatment do these patients need?**

Patients with severe AKI need a machine to clean their blood. This treatment is called continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT). The machine works 24 hours a day. It does the job that the kidneys cannot do.

**What is the problem with this treatment?**

Blood can clot inside the tubes and filters of the machine. When this happens, the machine stops working. Doctors must replace the tubes and filters. This means patients do not get enough treatment. Their blood is not cleaned properly.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to find ways to keep the machines working longer. They looked for methods that do not use drugs. These methods might help prevent clots. This would help patients get better treatment.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 20 different studies. These studies tested 1,143 critically ill patients with AKI. All patients needed CKRT.

The researchers compared different ways to run the kidney machines. They tested:
- Different types of kidney machine treatments
- Different speeds of blood flow through the machine
- Different types of filters and tubes
- Different types of catheters (tubes that go into blood vessels)
- Different ways to place the catheters

**Who was in these studies?**

All patients were critically ill adults. They all had severe AKI. They all needed CKRT treatment.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time varied across different studies. Researchers measured how long the machine circuits lasted before clotting.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found several methods that may help machines work longer:

1. **Different treatment types**: One type called CVVHDF may work 10 hours longer than another type called CVVH.

2. **Pre-dilution method**: Adding fluid before the filter may help machines work 9 hours longer. This is compared to adding fluid after the filter.

3. **Longer catheters**: Using a longer tube (more than 20 cm) may help machines work 6 hours longer. The tip of this tube reaches a part of the heart called the right atrium.

4. **Special coated catheters**: Tubes with special coatings may help machines work 16 hours longer.

**What did not help?**

Using faster blood flow did not make machines work longer. Using filters with more but shorter fibers made machines work about 6 hours less.

**What about patient survival?**

The researchers could not tell if these methods helped patients live longer. The studies were too small to answer this question clearly.

**What about kidney recovery?**

The researchers could not tell if these methods helped kidneys start working again. More research is needed to answer this question.

**What about safety?**

Longer catheters may cause fewer problems with blood vessels. About 2 out of 5 patients had fewer complications with longer catheters.

**What do these results mean?**

Some methods may help kidney machines work longer without clotting. This could help patients get better treatment. However, the evidence is not very strong. The studies were small. More research is needed.

**What happens next?**

Doctors need larger and better studies. These studies should test these methods more carefully. This will help doctors know the best ways to keep kidney machines working for critically ill patients.",10.1002-14651858.CD013330,"Non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing clotting of extracorporeal circuits during continuous kidney replacement therapy 
What is the issue? 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major problem in people with severe illness. In cases of severe AKI, kidney replacement therapy/dialysis (KRT) using circuits is necessary. Continuous kidney replacement therapy is performed continuously over 24 hours. Clotting of the CKRT circuit can interfere with this treatment. To prevent this, a variety of non‐pharmacological (not using medication) interventions have been studied. We aimed to summarise current evidence regarding the efficacy of non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing clotting of extracorporeal circuits during CKRT. 
What did we do? 
We searched for available evidence from the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 25 January 2021. Our review summarised the results of 20 randomised studies involving a total of 1143 people. 
What did we find? 
We found that the quality of the 20 included studies was low, and the number randomised was small. The majority of the included studies did not report death as an outcome. We found that continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), as compared with continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH), may prolong circuit lifespan. In addition, pre‐dilution haemofiltration, as compared with post‐dilution haemofiltration, a longer catheter placing the tip at the right atrium, as compared with a shorter catheter placing the tip in the superior vena cava, and surface‐modified double lumen catheter, as compared with standard double lumen catheter, may extend the circuit lifespan. However, higher blood flow compared to standard blood flow rate might not affect circuit lifespan. Overall, the data was limited and of very low certainty. 
Conclusions 
We found that the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions in people with AKI receiving CKRT remain unclear. There is a need for studies assessing CKRT circuit lifespan as well as other clinically important outcomes.

Despite being preventable, malaria remains an important public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that overall progress in malaria control has plateaued for the first time since the turn of the century. Researchers and policymakers are therefore exploring alternative and supplementary malaria vector control tools. Research in 1900 indicated that modification of houses may be effective in reducing malaria: this is now being revisited, with new research now examining blocking house mosquito entry points or modifying house construction materials to reduce exposure of inhabitants to infectious bites. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of house modifications on malaria disease and transmission.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CAB) Abstracts (Web of Science); and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS), up to 1 November 2019. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/) to identify ongoing trials up to the same date. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials, including cluster‐randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), cross‐over studies, and stepped‐wedge designs were eligible, as were quasi‐experimental trials, including controlled before‐and‐after studies, controlled interrupted time series, and non‐randomized cross‐over studies. We only considered studies reporting epidemiological outcomes (malaria case incidence, malaria infection incidence or parasite prevalence). We also summarised qualitative studies conducted alongside included studies. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used risk ratios (RR) to compare the effect of the intervention with the control for dichotomous data. For continuous data, we presented the mean difference; and for count and rate data, we used rate ratios. We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Six cRCTs met our inclusion criteria, all conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa; three randomized by household, two by village, and one at the community level. All trials assessed screening of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings or any combination of these; this was either alone, or in combination with eave closure, roof modification or eave tube installation (a ""lure and kill"" device that reduces mosquito entry whilst maintaining some airflow). In two trials, the interventions were insecticide‐based. In five trials, the researchers implemented the interventions. The community implemented the interventions in the sixth trial. 
At the time of writing the review, two of the six trials had published results, both of which compared screened houses (without insecticide) to unscreened houses. One trial in Ethiopia assessed screening of windows and doors. Another trial in the Gambia assessed full screening (screening of eaves, doors and windows), as well as screening of ceilings only. 
Screening may reduce clinical malaria incidence caused by Plasmodium falciparum (rate ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.82; 1 trial, 184 participants, 219.3 person‐years; low‐certainty evidence; Ethiopian study). For malaria parasite prevalence, the point estimate, derived from The Gambia study, was smaller (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.17; 713 participants, 1 trial; low‐certainty evidence), and showed an effect on anaemia (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42, 0.89; 705 participants; 1 trial, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Screening may reduce the entomological inoculation rate (EIR): both trials showed lower estimates in the intervention arm. In the Gambian trial, there was a mean difference in EIR between the control houses and treatment houses ranging from 0.45 to 1.50 (CIs ranged from ‐0.46 to 2.41; low‐certainty evidence), depending on the study year and treatment arm. The Ethiopian trial reported a mean difference in EIR of 4.57, favouring screening (95% CI 3.81 to 5.33; low‐certainty evidence). 
Pooled analysis of the trials showed that individuals living in fully screened houses were slightly less likely to sleep under a bed net (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.09; 2 trials, 203 participants). In one trial, bed net usage was also lower in individuals living in houses with screened ceilings (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95; 1 trial, 135 participants). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the two trials published to date, there is some evidence that screening may reduce malaria transmission and malaria infection in people living in the house. The four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base, and we will add these to this review when they become available. 
","# Plain Language Summary: House Modifications to Prevent Malaria

## Plain Title
Can changing houses to keep mosquitoes out help prevent malaria?

## Rationale

### What is malaria and why is it a problem?
Malaria is a disease spread by mosquito bites. It can make people very sick. Even though we can prevent malaria, it still affects many people around the world. The World Health Organization reports that progress in stopping malaria has slowed down. This means we need to find new ways to fight this disease.

### Why did researchers do this study?
Over 100 years ago, scientists found that changing houses might help stop malaria. Researchers wanted to look at this idea again. They wanted to see if blocking the places where mosquitoes get into houses could help. They also wanted to know if using different building materials could protect people from mosquito bites.

### What did researchers hope to find?
Researchers thought that keeping mosquitoes out of houses might reduce malaria. If people get fewer mosquito bites inside their homes, they might get sick less often. This could be a new way to help control malaria.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was not one single study. Researchers looked at many different studies done by other scientists. They searched for studies done up to November 2019. They only included studies that measured how many people got malaria.

### Who was in these studies?
Six studies met the requirements. All six studies were done in countries in Africa south of the Sahara Desert. The studies included people of different ages living in areas where malaria is common.

### What changes were made to houses?
The studies tested different ways to keep mosquitoes out. These included:
- Screens on windows
- Screens on doors
- Screens on eaves (the space between the wall and roof)
- Screens on ceilings
- Closing gaps in the eaves
- Changes to roofs
- Special tubes in eaves that trap and kill mosquitoes

Some studies used bug-killing chemicals. In most studies, researchers made the changes to houses. In one study, the community made the changes themselves.

### How long did the studies last?
Only two of the six studies had published their results when this review was written. These two studies compared houses with screens to houses without screens.

## Results

### What did the studies find?

#### Did screening reduce malaria?
Screening may help reduce malaria. One study in Ethiopia found that people in screened houses got malaria less often. For every 10 people who would normally get malaria, only about 4 people in screened houses got sick.

A study in The Gambia looked at how many people had malaria parasites in their blood. Screened houses showed some benefit, but the results were less clear.

#### Did screening help with anemia?
Anemia means not having enough healthy red blood cells. Malaria can cause anemia. The Gambia study found that screening helped reduce anemia. For every 10 people who would normally have anemia, only about 6 people in screened houses had it.

#### Did screening reduce mosquito bites?
Both studies found fewer infectious mosquito bites in screened houses. This means people in screened houses were exposed to fewer mosquitoes carrying malaria.

#### Did people still use bed nets?
People in screened houses used bed nets slightly less often. Bed nets are another way to prevent mosquito bites. This might be because people felt safer in screened houses.

### What do these results mean?
The two published studies suggest that screening houses may help prevent malaria. Keeping mosquitoes out of houses appears to protect people from getting sick. However, only two studies have published results so far. Four more studies are waiting to be published. These new studies will help us understand better if house screening really works.

### What do researchers conclude?
There is some evidence that screening houses can reduce malaria. More information will be available when the other four studies are published. This could give us a new tool to fight malaria in areas where it is common.",10.1002-14651858.CD013398,"House modifications for preventing malaria
What is the aim of this review? 
House modifications, such as screening (covering potential house entry points for mosquitoes with netting or mesh), or the use of alternative construction materials, may contribute to reducing the burden of malaria. They work by blocking mosquitoes from entering houses, and reducing the number of bites householders receive indoors. Some of the house modifications under consideration additionally aim to kill any mosquitoes that attempt to enter houses by incorporating insecticide into the modification. 
Key messages 
Screening windows, doors, eaves and ceilings to prevent mosquitoes entering the house may reduce malaria transmission and illness in people living in the house, based on evidence from two studies conducted in Africa. Four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review summarized studies investigating the effects of house modifications on human malaria outcomes. If studies additionally reported the effect of the house modifications on mosquitoes (those with potential to carry malaria), or householders' views, we also summarized this data. After searching for relevant studies, we identified six studies conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa, two of which have published data, and four of which are not yet in the public domain. All trials assessed screening (of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings, or any combination of these), either alone or in combination with eave closure, roof modification, or eave tube installation (a ""lure and kill"" device positioned in eave gaps). 
What are the main results of the review? 
The two trials with published data assessed the effect of screening alone on malaria infection. Both trials showed a reduction in malaria in screened houses, to varying degrees of effect. One trial in Ethiopia showed that people living in screened houses were around 62% less likely to experience an episode of clinical malaria (caused by P falciparum). However, the certainty of this evidence was low due to issues with the study design, and the trial did not study enough people for us to be confident about the results. Another trial in The Gambia showed that people living in screened houses were around 16% less likely to have P falciparum malaria parasites in their blood, and were less likely to experience anaemia. Our confidence in this result was low because the trial did not study enough people. 
How up to date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies available up to 1 November 2019.

Smoking is a leading cause of disease and death worldwide. In people who smoke, quitting smoking can reverse much of the damage. Many people use behavioural interventions to help them quit smoking; these interventions can vary substantially in their content and effectiveness. 
Objectives
To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effect of behavioural interventions designed to support smoking cessation attempts and to conduct a network meta‐analysis to determine how modes of delivery; person delivering the intervention; and the nature, focus, and intensity of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation influence the likelihood of achieving abstinence six months after attempting to stop smoking; and whether the effects of behavioural interventions depend upon other characteristics, including population, setting, and the provision of pharmacotherapy. 
To summarise the availability and principal findings of economic evaluations of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation, in terms of comparative costs and cost‐effectiveness, in the form of a brief economic commentary. 
Methods
This work comprises two main elements. 1. We conducted a Cochrane Overview of reviews following standard Cochrane methods. We identified Cochrane Reviews of behavioural interventions (including all non‐pharmacological interventions, e.g. counselling, exercise, hypnotherapy, self‐help materials) for smoking cessation by searching the Cochrane Library in July 2020. We evaluated the methodological quality of reviews using AMSTAR 2 and synthesised data from the reviews narratively. 2. We used the included reviews to identify randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation compared with other behavioural interventions or no intervention for smoking cessation. To be included, studies had to include adult smokers and measure smoking abstinence at six months or longer. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. We synthesised data using Bayesian component network meta‐analysis (CNMA), examining the effects of 38 different components compared to minimal intervention. Components included behavioural and motivational elements, intervention providers, delivery modes, nature, focus, and intensity of the behavioural intervention. We used component network meta‐regression (CNMR) to evaluate the influence of population characteristics, provision of pharmacotherapy, and intervention intensity on the component effects. We evaluated certainty of the evidence using GRADE domains. We assumed an additive effect for individual components. 
Main results
We included 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which 312 randomised controlled trials, representing 250,563 participants and 845 distinct study arms, met the criteria for inclusion in our component network meta‐analysis. This represented 437 different combinations of components. Of the 33 reviews, confidence in review findings was high in four reviews and moderate in nine reviews, as measured by the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool. The remaining 20 reviews were low or critically low due to one or more critical weaknesses, most commonly inadequate investigation or discussion (or both) of the impact of publication bias. Of note, the critical weaknesses identified did not affect the searching, screening, or data extraction elements of the review process, which have direct bearing on our CNMA. Of the included studies, 125/312 were at low risk of bias overall, 50 were at high risk of bias, and the remainder were at unclear risk. Analyses from the contributing reviews and from our CNMA showed behavioural interventions for smoking cessation can increase quit rates, but effectiveness varies on characteristics of the support provided. There was high‐certainty evidence of benefit for the provision of counselling (odds ratio (OR) 1.44, 95% credibility interval (CrI) 1.22 to 1.70, 194 studies, n = 72,273) and guaranteed financial incentives (OR 1.46, 95% CrI 1.15 to 1.85, 19 studies, n = 8877). Evidence of benefit remained when removing studies at high risk of bias. These findings were consistent with pair‐wise meta‐analyses from contributing reviews. There was moderate‐certainty evidence of benefit for interventions delivered via text message (downgraded due to unexplained statistical heterogeneity in pair‐wise comparison), and for the following components where point estimates suggested benefit but CrIs incorporated no clinically significant difference: individual tailoring; intervention content including motivational components; intervention content focused on how to quit. The remaining intervention components had low‐to very low‐certainty evidence, with the main issues being imprecision and risk of bias. There was no evidence to suggest an increase in harms in groups receiving behavioural support for smoking cessation. Intervention effects were not changed by adjusting for population characteristics, but data were limited. Increasing intensity of behavioural support, as measured through the number of contacts, duration of each contact, and programme length, had point estimates associated with modestly increased chances of quitting, but CrIs included no difference. The effect of behavioural support for smoking cessation appeared slightly less pronounced when people were already receiving smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. 
Authors' conclusions
Behavioural support for smoking cessation can increase quit rates at six months or longer, with no evidence that support increases harms. This is the case whether or not smoking cessation pharmacotherapy is also provided, but the effect is slightly more pronounced in the absence of pharmacotherapy. Evidence of benefit is strongest for the provision of any form of counselling, and guaranteed financial incentives. Evidence suggested possible benefit but the need of further studies to evaluate: individual tailoring; delivery via text message, email, and audio recording; delivery by lay health advisor; and intervention content with motivational components and a focus on how to quit. We identified 23 economic evaluations; evidence did not consistently suggest one type of behavioural intervention for smoking cessation was more cost‐effective than another. Future reviews should fully consider publication bias. Tools to investigate publication bias and to evaluate certainty in CNMA are needed. 
","# Plain Language Summary: How Different Types of Support Help People Quit Smoking

## Plain Title
How Different Types of Counseling and Support Help People Stop Smoking

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Smoking causes many diseases and deaths around the world. When people who smoke decide to quit, their health can get much better. Many people need help and support to quit smoking successfully.

**Why was this study needed?**

There are many different ways to help people quit smoking. These methods can be very different from each other. Some work better than others. Doctors and health workers need to know which types of support work best so they can help people quit smoking.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to learn which types of support help people quit smoking. They looked at things like:
- Who gives the support (doctors, nurses, or other helpers)
- How the support is given (in person, by phone, or by text message)
- What kind of help is offered (advice, counseling, or rewards)
- How much support is given (how many times and how long)

They also wanted to know if these types of support work for different groups of people. They checked if the support works when people also take quit-smoking medicines.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a special type of study. Researchers looked at 33 earlier studies that had already been done. From these, they found 312 smaller studies. These studies included 250,563 adult smokers.

The researchers looked at all types of non-medicine support. This included:
- Counseling and advice
- Self-help books or materials
- Exercise programs
- Hypnosis
- Text messages
- Financial rewards for quitting

**Who was in the studies?**

All the people in the studies were adults who smoked. The studies checked if people had quit smoking after at least six months.

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers counted how many people stopped smoking. They checked this at least six months after people tried to quit. This is important because some people quit for a short time but start smoking again later.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The study found that support and counseling help people quit smoking. Different types of support work differently well.

**What works best?**

Two types of support had the strongest proof that they work:

1. **Counseling**: Any type of counseling helped people quit. This could be talking with a counselor about quitting. People who got counseling were more likely to quit than people who got no help.

2. **Money rewards**: When people were promised money for quitting, they were more likely to stop smoking. The money had to be guaranteed, not just a chance to win.

**What else might help?**

Some other types of support also looked helpful, but researchers need more studies to be sure:
- Text messages sent to phones
- Support made special for each person
- Help that builds motivation to quit
- Advice about how to quit smoking

**Does more support help more?**

Getting more support (more meetings or longer meetings) might help a little more. But the difference was small.

**Does support work with quit-smoking medicines?**

Yes, support helps even when people take medicines to quit smoking. But support seems to help slightly more when people are not taking medicines.

**Are there any harms?**

The study found no proof that getting support to quit smoking causes any harm.

**What does this mean?**

People who want to quit smoking should seek support and counseling. This increases their chances of quitting successfully. Getting any kind of counseling is better than trying to quit alone. Money rewards can also help people quit.

**What is still needed?**

More research is needed to learn which exact types of support work best. Researchers also need better ways to study these questions. More studies should look at whether one type of support costs less money than others while still helping people quit.",10.1002-14651858.CD013229,"Does behavioural support help people to stop smoking?
Key messages 
Behavioural support can help more people to stop smoking for six months or longer, without causing unwanted effects. 
Some types of support appear to work better than others. More studies are needed to identify the best ways to support people who are trying to stop smoking, and to identify the best people to support them. 
Stopping smoking 
The best thing people who smoke can do for their health is to stop smoking.
Most people who smoke want to stop, but many find it difficult. People who smoke may use medicines to help them stop. Behavioural support provides an alternative – or additional – way to help people stop smoking. Sometimes behavioural support can be combined with nicotine replacement or other medicines to help people stop smoking. 
Types of behavioural support can include: advice and counselling on ways to make it easier to stop smoking; information about why or how to stop; or a combination. Behavioural support can be given in group sessions or one‐to‐one. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out:
– which types of behavioural support work best to help people stop smoking;
– the best ways to give behavioural support (including the best people to give it); and 
– what aspects of behavioural support help someone to stop smoking.
We also wanted to know if behavioural support can cause any unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for Cochrane Reviews of behavioural support to stop smoking, to identify relevant studies of adults who smoked. We then compared the studies with each other, to find out how well the different types of behavioural support helped people to stop smoking. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to July 2020. 
What we found 
We found 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which we identified 312 relevant studies in 250,503 adults (aged 18 to 63 years) who smoked cigarettes. The studies investigated 437 different combinations of ways to stop smoking. 
Most studies were conducted in the USA or Western Europe; 115 studies took place in healthcare settings and 195 took place in the community. On average, people taking part in the studies were followed up for 10.5 months. 
The studies compared the effects of behavioural support with:
– no behavioural support;
– usual or standard care;
– less‐intense forms of the behavioural support; or other approaches.
We compared all treatments with each other using a mathematical method called network meta‐analysis. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Compared with no behavioural support it was clear that some types of behavioural support increased people's chances of quitting for six months or longer, including: counselling and giving them money for successfully stopping smoking. More people stopped smoking with these types of support whether or not they were also taking medicines to help them stop smoking. 
Behavioural support by text messages probably helped more people to stop smoking than no support. 
Compared with no support, tailoring behavioural support to the person, or group of people, trying to stop smoking probably slightly increased how many of them stopped smoking, as did support that focused on how to stop smoking. 
Increasing the intensity of the support given, such as contacting people more often or having longer sessions, modestly increased how many people stopped smoking. 
We are uncertain about:
– the effects of other types of behavioural support, including hypnotherapy, exercise‐based support, and entering competitions; and 
– the effect of who gives the behavioural support.
Only some studies reported results for unwanted effects; in these, behavioural support did not increase the numbers of any unwanted effects. 
How confident are we in our results? 
We are confident that counselling and rewards of money help people to stop smoking; we do not expect that more evidence will change these results. 
We are less confident in our results for other types of behavioural support, and about who gives the support and how. We found limitations with some of the studies, including how they were designed, conducted, and reported. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. More studies are needed.

262,10.1002-14651858.CD013270.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Age‐related cataract affects both eyes in most cases. Most people undergo cataract surgery in both eyes on separate days, referred to as delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). An alternative procedure involves operating on both eyes on the same day, but as two separate procedures, known as immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). Potential advantages of ISBCS include fewer hospital visits for the patient, faster visual recovery, and lower healthcare costs. Nevertheless, concerns exist about possible bilateral, postoperative, sight‐threatening adverse effects with ISBCS. Therefore, there is a clear need for evaluating evidence regarding the safety, effectiveness, and cost‐effectiveness of ISBCS versus DSBCS. 
Objectives
To assess the safety of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age‐related cataracts and to summarise current evidence for the incremental resource use, utilities, costs, and cost‐effectiveness associated with the use of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age‐related cataracts (primary objectives). The secondary objective was to assess visual and patient‐reported outcomes of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age‐related cataracts. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; the WHO ICTRP; and DARE and NHS EED on the CRD Database on 11 May 2021. There were no language restrictions. We limited the searches to a date range of 2007 onwards. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess complications, refractive outcomes, best‐corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) and patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs) with ISBCS compared to DSBCS. We included non‐randomised (NRSs), prospective, and retrospective cohort studies comparing ISBCS and DSBCS for safety assessment, because of the rare incidence of important adverse events. To assess cost‐effectiveness of ISBCS compared to DSBCS, we included both full and partial economic evaluations, and both trial‐based and model‐based economic evaluations. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures and assessed risk of bias for NRSs using the ROBINS‐I tool. For cost‐evaluations, we used the CHEC‐list, the CHEERS‐checklist, and the NICE‐checklist to investigate risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with the GRADE tool. We reported results for economic evaluations narratively. 
Main results
We included 14 studies in the review; two RCTs, seven NRSs, and six economic evaluations (one study was both an NRS and economic evaluation). The studies reported on 276,260 participants (7384 for ISBCS and 268,876 for DSBCS) and were conducted in Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, (South) Korea, Spain (Canary Islands), Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Overall, we considered the included RCTs to be at 'high to some concerns' risk of bias for complications, 'some concerns' risk of bias for refractive outcomes and visual acuity, and 'high' risk of bias for PROMs. The overall risk of bias for NRSs was graded 'serious' regarding complications and 'serious to critical' regarding refractive outcomes.  
With regard to endophthalmitis, we found that relative effects were estimated imprecisely and with low certainty, so that relative estimates were not reliable. Nonetheless, we found a very low risk of endophthalmitis in both ISBCS (1/14,076 participants) and DSBCS (55/556,246 participants) groups. Based on descriptive evidence and partially weak statistical evidence we found no evidence of an increased risk of endophthalmitis with ISBCS. Regarding refractive outcomes, we found moderate‐certainty (RCTs) and low‐certainty (NRSs) evidence there was no difference in the percentage of eyes that did not achieve refraction within 1.0 dioptre of target one to three months after surgery (RCTs: risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.26; NRSs: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.75). Similarly, postoperative complications did not differ between groups (RCTs: RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.40; NRSs: 1.04, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.29), although the certainty of this evidence was very low for both RCTs and NRSs. Furthermore, we found low‐certainty (RCTs) to very low‐certainty (NRSs) evidence that total costs per participant were lower for ISBCS compared to DSBCS, although results of individual studies could not be pooled. Only one study reported on cost‐effectiveness. This study found that ISBCS is cost‐effective compared to DSBCS, but did not measure quality‐adjusted life years using preferred methods and calculated costs erroneously. Finally, regarding secondary outcomes, we found limited evidence on BCDVA (data of two RCTs could not be pooled, although both studies individually found no difference between groups (very low‐certainty evidence)). Regarding PROMs, we found moderate‐certainty evidence (RCTs only) that there was no difference between groups one to three months after surgery (standardised mean difference −0.08, 95% CI −0.19 to 0.03). 
Authors' conclusions
Current evidence supports there are probably no clinically important differences in outcomes between ISBCS and DSBCS, but with lower costs for ISBCS. However, the amount of evidence is limited, and the certainty of the evidence was graded moderate to very low. In addition, there is a need for well‐designed cost‐effectiveness studies. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Cataract Surgery on Both Eyes – Same Day or Different Days?

## Plain Title

Comparing cataract surgery done on both eyes the same day versus on different days

## Rationale

**What is a cataract and why does it matter?**

A cataract is when the lens inside your eye becomes cloudy. This makes it hard to see clearly. Most people get cataracts in both eyes as they get older. Cataracts can make daily tasks difficult. They affect your quality of life.

**How is cataract surgery usually done?**

Most people have surgery on each eye on different days. This is called DSBCS. Doctors operate on one eye first. Then they wait days or weeks. Then they operate on the other eye.

**What is the new approach being studied?**

Some doctors now do surgery on both eyes the same day. This is called ISBCS. Each eye still gets its own separate surgery. But both surgeries happen on the same day.

**Why study this?**

ISBCS might have benefits. You would need fewer trips to the hospital. Your vision could get better faster. It might cost less money for the health system.

But doctors worry about risks. If something goes wrong, both eyes could be affected. The most serious risk is an infection called endophthalmitis. This infection can cause blindness.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if ISBCS is safe. They wanted to compare it to DSBCS. They also wanted to know about costs. And they wanted to know how well patients could see after surgery.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was not one single study. Researchers looked at 14 different studies. These studies were done in many countries. The countries included Canada, Finland, Iran, Korea, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the USA.

**What types of studies were included?**

The researchers included different types of studies:
- 2 studies where patients were randomly assigned to groups
- 7 studies that compared groups without random assignment
- 6 studies that looked at costs

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 276,260 people total. About 7,400 had ISBCS. About 269,000 had DSBCS. All patients had cataracts in both eyes due to aging.

**What did researchers measure?**

They looked at:
- Serious infections in the eye
- How well the new lens worked
- How clearly patients could see
- What patients said about their vision
- How much the surgery cost

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**About serious eye infections:**

Eye infections after surgery were very rare. Only 1 person out of 14,076 got an infection with ISBCS. Only 55 people out of 556,246 got an infection with DSBCS. The researchers found no proof that ISBCS causes more infections. But the numbers were too small to be completely sure.

**About how well the new lens worked:**

Doctors aim for a specific lens strength. This helps you see clearly without glasses. Both methods worked equally well. About the same number of people in each group got the lens strength they needed.

**About other problems after surgery:**

Other problems were rare. Both methods had similar rates of problems. The quality of this evidence was limited.

**About how clearly patients could see:**

Two studies measured this. Both found no difference between the two methods. Patients could see equally well with either method.

**About what patients said:**

Patients in both groups were equally happy with their vision. They reported similar results 1 to 3 months after surgery.

**About costs:**

ISBCS cost less than DSBCS. This makes sense because patients make fewer hospital visits. However, only one study looked at whether ISBCS provides good value for money. That study had some problems with how it was done.

**What do these results mean?**

ISBCS appears to be as safe as DSBCS. It works just as well. It costs less. However, the evidence is limited. More high-quality studies are needed. Especially studies about costs and value for money.

**What did the investigators conclude?**

The researchers concluded that ISBCS probably works as well as DSBCS. It appears safe. It costs less. But doctors need more evidence before they can be completely certain. Better studies about cost and effectiveness are needed.",10.1002-14651858.CD013270,"Surgery on both eyes on the same day or on different days: which works better to treat cataract in both eyes? 
Key messages 
‐ Current evidence supports there may be no important difference between surgery on both eyes on the same day (ISBCS) and surgery on different days (DSBCS) for the following clinical outcomes: eye (ocular) infection (endophthalmitis, a severe, sight‐threatening but rare complication), spectacle correction after surgery (refraction), complications, vision with spectacle correction (if needed), and patient‐reported outcomes (PROMs; questionnaires on vision). 
‐ Current evidence supports the costs for ISBCS are lower compared to DSBCS, but evidence on the balance between the costs and how well it works (cost‐effectiveness) was lacking. 
‐ Overall, the amount and quality of the evidence was limited.
What is cataract and how is it treated? 
Age‐related cataract is a natural ageing process of the lens of the eye, in which the lens becomes cloudy and vision decreases. The only way to treat cataract is by surgery. During surgery, the clouded lens is removed and replaced by an artificial lens, implanted in the eye. Currently, most people undergo cataract surgery on both eyes on different days, with a period of days, weeks, or even months between surgeries, called delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). However, it is also possible to have cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day, called immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). 
Potential advantages to ISBCS include fewer visits to the hospital, faster visual recovery, and lower healthcare costs. However, there are also potential disadvantages, such as developing complications in both eyes. Also, in ISBCS, outcomes of the first eye cannot be used when performing second‐eye surgery, which may result in worse refractive outcomes (increased spectacle dependence). 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day is as safe, effective, and cost‐effective as having surgery on both eyes on different days. 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that looked at outcomes of ISBCS compared to DSBCS. We also searched for studies that looked at the balance between costs and outcomes for ISBCS compared to DSBCS (cost‐effectiveness). We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 14 studies that involved 276,260 people (7384 who had ISBCS and 268,876 who had DSBCS). The studies were conducted in Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, (South) Korea, Spain (Canary Islands), Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Most studies lasted for around three months. 
Main results  
‐ Endophthalmitis: the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may make little to no difference in the occurrence of endophthalmitis in one eye (up to six weeks after surgery). None of the studies reported endophthalmitis in both eyes, but this event is most likely too rare to be detected by these studies. 
‐ Refractive outcomes: there is probably little to no difference in refractive outcomes at one to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS. 
‐ Other complications: there may be little to no difference in other complications up to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ Costs: the economic studies in this review reported lower costs for ISBCS compared to DSBCS. One study reported that ISBCS is cost‐effective compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ Best‐corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA; vision with spectacle correction if needed): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may have little to no effect on BCDVA at one to three months after surgery, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ PROMs (measured in questionnaires): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) probably makes little to no difference in PROMs at one to three months after surgery. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Overall, we had moderate to very little confidence in the evidence (endophthalmitis: little confidence, refractive outcomes: little to moderate confidence, complications: not confident, costs: little to no confidence, BCDVA: not confident, and PROMs: moderate confidence).  
Our confidence is limited because:
‐ the evidence on endophthalmitis was based on few cases of endophthalmitis;
‐ the studies assessed complications in different ways;
‐ there were not enough studies to be certain about refractive outcomes and complications;
‐ studies on costs reported costs for only one hospital and included different funding sources; 
‐ the studies assessed BCDVA in different ways and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results; 
‐ there were concerns regarding the possibility that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were getting, and not all studies provided data about everything that we were interested in (most outcomes).

The evidence is up‐to‐date to 11 May 2021.

263,10.1002-14651858.CD009030.pub2-abstract.txt,"Splints and other non‐surgical methods for treating common injuries of the middle joints of the fingers 
Injury to the ligaments of the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal joint) of a finger may occur as a result of the finger being forced backwards. This is known as a hyperextension injury. Characteristically, this occurs in sporting accidents, such as where a football strikes an outstretched hand. These injuries are common and typically affect people of working age.

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Ways to Treat Injured Middle Finger Joints Without Surgery

## Rationale

**What is this injury?**
The middle joint of each finger can be injured when the finger bends too far backward. Doctors call this middle joint the proximal interphalangeal joint. This type of injury happens when the finger is forced back the wrong way.

**How does this injury happen?**
This injury often happens during sports. For example, a ball might hit an open hand hard. The force pushes the finger backward and hurts the joint.

**Who gets this injury?**
These injuries are common. They usually happen to people of working age. The injury can make it hard to use the hand. This can affect daily tasks and work.

**How are these injuries usually treated?**
Most people do not need surgery for this injury. Doctors usually treat the injury with:
- A splint to support the finger
- Taping the hurt finger to the finger next to it
- Advice about exercises

People can often use their hand during healing. But the injury may limit what they can do.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors wanted to know the best way to treat these injuries. They wanted to find out which treatment helps patients the most. The goal was to look at all the research studies done on this topic. This would help doctors choose the best treatment for their patients.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review study. The researchers looked for all good quality studies on this topic. They searched for studies that tested different treatments. They only included studies that were randomized controlled trials. This means patients were put into treatment groups by chance.

**What did the researchers find?**
The researchers found three small studies. These three studies included 366 patients total. All three studies were more than 15 years old.

**What treatments did the studies compare?**
The three studies looked at different approaches:
- One study compared letting the finger move freely versus keeping it still
- One study compared protected movement versus keeping the finger still
- Protected movement means using a removable support plus doing exercises
- One study compared keeping the finger still for one week versus three weeks

**What did the researchers measure?**
The researchers looked at several things:
- How well the finger worked after treatment
- Whether patients could return to work
- How much pain patients had
- How much the joint could move

**How long did the studies follow patients?**
The studies checked on patients for six months after treatment.

## Results

**What were the main results?**
The three studies did not find big differences between the treatments. At six months, the different treatments gave similar results for:
- Poor outcomes
- Pain levels
- How much the joint could move

**What was missing from the studies?**
None of the studies asked patients how they felt about their finger function. This is an important measure that was not included.

**What problems did the studies have?**
The researchers found that all three studies had problems. The studies were at risk of bias. This means the results might not be fully reliable.

**What did the researchers conclude?**
The researchers concluded that there is not enough good evidence. Doctors do not have strong proof about:
- Whether the finger needs to be kept still
- How much support the finger needs
- How long the finger should be kept still

**What does this mean for patients?**
More and better research is needed. Doctors need better information to choose the best treatment. Right now, there is not enough evidence to say which treatment works best for these finger injuries.

**Why is this important?**
These injuries are common and affect working people. Finding the best treatment could help patients:
- Return to work faster
- Have less pain
- Use their hands better

Better studies are needed to answer these important questions.",10.1002-14651858.CD009030,"Splints and other non‐surgical methods for treating common injuries of the middle joints of the fingers 
Injury to the ligaments of the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal joint) of a finger may occur as a result of the finger being forced backwards. This is known as a hyperextension injury. Characteristically, this occurs in sporting accidents, such as where a football strikes an outstretched hand. These injuries are common and typically affect people of working age. Usually, these patients are treated without surgery using a combination of support (splinting/strapping to the adjacent finger) and exercise advice.

Respiratory viruses are the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and hospitalisation in infants and young children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main infectious agent in this population. Palivizumab is administered intramuscularly every month during five months in the first RSV season to prevent serious RSV LRTI in children. Given its high cost, it is essential to know if palivizumab continues to be effective in preventing severe RSV disease in children. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of palivizumab for preventing severe RSV infection in children.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, three other databases and two trials registers to 14 October 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We searched Embase to October 2020, as we did not have access to this database for 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐RCTs, comparing palivizumab given at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a month (maximum five doses) with placebo, no intervention or standard care in children 0 to 24 months of age from both genders, regardless of RSV infection history.  
Data collection and analysis
We used Cochrane’s Screen4Me workflow to help assess the search results. Two review authors screened studies for selection, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. The primary outcomes were hospitalisation due to RSV infection, all‐cause mortality and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were hospitalisation due to respiratory‐related illness, length of hospital stay, RSV infection, number of wheezing days, days of supplemental oxygen, intensive care unit length of stay and mechanical ventilation days. 
Main results
We included five studies with  a total of 3343 participants. All studies were parallel RCTs, assessing the effects of 15 mg/kg of palivizumab every month up to five months compared to placebo or no intervention in an outpatient setting, although one study also included hospitalised infants. Most of the included studies were conducted in children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities like bronchopulmonary dysplasia and congenital heart disease. The risk of bias of outcomes across all studies was similar and predominately low.  
Palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection at two years' follow‐up (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.64; 5 studies, 3343 participants; high certainty evidence). Based on 98 hospitalisations per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 (29 to 62) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in mortality at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.15; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 (10 to 27) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in adverse events at 150 days' follow‐up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.39; 3 studies, 2831 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Based on 84 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 91 (71 to 117) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory‐related illness at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.97; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Palivizumab may result in a large reduction in RSV infection at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55; 3 studies, 554 participants; low certainty evidence). Based on 195 cases of RSV infection per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 64 (39 to 107) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days at one year's follow‐up (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.44; 1 study, 429 participants; high certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence suggests that prophylaxis with palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection and results in little to no difference in mortality or adverse events. Moreover, palivizumab results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory‐related illness and may result in a large reduction in RSV infections. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days. These results may be applicable to children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities. 
Further research is needed to establish the effect of palivizumab on children with other comorbidities known as risk factors for severe RSV disease (e.g. immune deficiencies) and other social determinants of the disease, including children living in low‐ and middle‐income countries, tropical regions, children lacking breastfeeding, living in poverty, or members of families in overcrowded situations.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Does Palivizumab Prevent Serious Breathing Problems from RSV in Children?

## Plain Title

Does a medicine called palivizumab help prevent serious lung infections from RSV virus in young children?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Breathing viruses cause lung infections in babies and young children. These infections can make children very sick. A virus called RSV is the most common cause. RSV makes it hard for children to breathe. Many children need to go to the hospital because of RSV.

**What is palivizumab?**

Palivizumab is a medicine that may help prevent serious RSV infections. Doctors give it as a shot once a month. Children get up to five shots during RSV season. This is usually during winter months when RSV spreads most.

**Why was this study needed?**

Palivizumab costs a lot of money. Doctors need to know if it really works. This study looked at whether palivizumab helps keep children out of the hospital. The researchers wanted to know if the medicine is safe. They also wanted to know if it stops RSV infections.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at five different studies. These studies included 3,343 children total. The children were newborns up to 2 years old. Most children in the studies had health problems. These problems made them more likely to get very sick from RSV. Some children had lung disease. Others had heart disease.

**What did the studies compare?**

Half the children got palivizumab shots. The other half got fake shots or no shots. Neither group knew which treatment they received. Doctors gave the medicine once a month for up to five months. They watched the children for up to two years.

**Where did the studies happen?**

Most children got their shots at doctor's offices. One study also included children already in the hospital.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The study found that palivizumab works well to prevent hospital stays from RSV.

**Hospital stays from RSV:**
Without palivizumab, 98 out of 1,000 children went to the hospital for RSV. With palivizumab, only 43 out of 1,000 children went to the hospital. This means palivizumab cut hospital stays in half.

**Deaths:**
The medicine probably does not change how many children die. About 23 out of 1,000 children died without palivizumab. About 16 out of 1,000 children died with palivizumab. This difference is small.

**Side effects:**
Palivizumab probably does not cause more side effects. About 84 out of 1,000 children had side effects without the medicine. About 91 out of 1,000 children had side effects with the medicine. These numbers are very close.

**Other breathing problems:**
Palivizumab slightly reduced hospital stays for all breathing problems. It also reduced RSV infections by a lot. Children who got palivizumab had fewer days of wheezing.

**What do these results mean?**

Palivizumab helps prevent serious RSV infections in high-risk children. It keeps many children out of the hospital. The medicine appears safe. It does not cause more side effects than fake shots.

**Who do these results help?**

These results apply most to children at high risk for RSV. This includes children with lung disease or heart disease.

**What is still unknown?**

More research is needed for other groups of children. This includes children with weak immune systems. It also includes children in poor countries. Researchers need to study children in warm climates. They need to study children who live in crowded homes or who are not breastfed.

**Conclusion:**

Palivizumab works to prevent serious RSV infections in high-risk children. It cuts hospital stays in half. The medicine is safe. Doctors can use it to protect children most likely to get very sick from RSV.",10.1002-14651858.CD013757,"Palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus infection prevention in children
Review question 
What are the effects (benefits and harms) of palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children? 
Background 
RSV is the main cause of acute respiratory infections in children, mainly during the first year of life, accounting for 33.1 million infections a year with an estimated 90.6% of these episodes occurring in low‐ and middle‐income countries. These infections may present with a runny nose, fever, cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, or difficulty feeding. They may result in hospitalisation, admission to an intensive care unit, and even death, in particular amongst infants aged less than two months, with an estimated hospitalisation rate of 1970 per 100,000 population and 59,600 deaths annually worldwide in children younger than five years old. They may also lead to long‐term complications such as recurrent wheezing and chronic lung problems.  
Palivizumab, sold under the brand name Synagis, is a drug administered with an intramuscular injection every month up to five doses to prevent serious infections in children at high risk for severe disease. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 14 October 2021.
Study characteristics 
We included five studies with 3343 participants. All studies included a small number of participants, including children with a high risk of adverse outcomes if infected with RSV due to underlying health issues, such as premature birth or heart or pulmonary problems.    
Study funding sources 
Most studies did not specify their funding sources. One study was funded by Abbott Laboratories and by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development.  
Key results 
Palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection by 56%; based on 98 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in mortality, and little to no difference in adverse events; based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants and 84 adverse events per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 deaths per 1000 participants and 81  adverse events per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory illness by 22% but may result in little to no difference in length of hospital stay. It may reduce RSV infection rate by 67% at two years’ follow‐up. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days by 61% but may result in little to no difference in days using oxygen, length of stay in the intensive care unit, or mechanical ventilation days.  
Certainty of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the evidence was moderate to high.

Antibiotics have been considered to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) due to their antimicrobial properties against intestinal bacteria linked to inflammation. However, there are concerns about their efficacy and safety. 
Objectives
To determine whether antibiotic therapy is safe and effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in people with UC. 
Search methods
We searched five electronic databases on 10 December 2021 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic therapy to placebo or an active comparator. 
Selection criteria
We considered people with UC of all ages, treated with antibiotics of any type, dose, and route of administration for inclusion. Induction studies required a minimum duration of two weeks for inclusion. Maintenance studies required a minimum duration of three months to be considered for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome for induction studies was failure to achieve remission and for maintenance studies was relapse, as defined by the primary studies. 
Main results
We included 12 RCTs (847 participants). One maintenance of remission study used sole antibiotic therapy compared with 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA). All other trials used concurrent medications or standard care regimens and antibiotics as an adjunct therapy or compared antibiotics with other adjunct therapies to examine the effect on induction of remission. 
There is high certainty evidence that antibiotics (154/304 participants) compared to placebo (175/304 participants) result in no difference in failure to achieve clinical remission (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.06). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids, steroids plus 5‐ASA, or steroids plus 5‐ASA plus probiotics were used as additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (102/168 participants) compared to placebo (121/175 participants) may result in no difference in failure to achieve clinical response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.22). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids or steroids plus 5‐ASA were used as additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (6/342 participants) compared to placebo (5/349 participants) may result in no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.71). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids were additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (3/342 participants) compared to placebo (1/349 participants) may result in no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 2.06, 95% CI 0.27 to 15.72). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids or steroids plus 5‐ASA were additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics in combination with probiotics compared to no treatment or placebo for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.19), serious adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.08), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.08). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to 5‐ASA for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.14). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to probiotics for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.94). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to 5‐ASA for failure to maintain clinical remission (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.06). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to no treatment for failure to achieve clinical remission in a mixed population of people with active and inactive disease (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
For all other outcomes, no effects could be estimated due to a lack of data.
Authors' conclusions
There is high certainty evidence that there is no difference between antibiotics and placebo in the proportion of people who achieve clinical remission at the end of the intervention period. However, there is evidence that there may be a greater proportion of people who achieve clinical remission and probably a greater proportion who achieve clinical response with antibiotics when compared with placebo at 12 months. There may be no difference in serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events between antibiotics and placebo. 
No clear conclusions can be drawn for any other comparisons.
A clear direction for future research appears to be comparisons of antibiotics and placebo (in addition to standard therapies) with longer‐term measurement of outcomes. Additionally. As there were single studies of other head‐to‐head comparisons, there may be scope for future studies in this area. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Antibiotics for Treating Ulcerative Colitis

## Plain Title

Do antibiotics help people with ulcerative colitis get better or stay well?

## Rationale

**What is ulcerative colitis?**

Ulcerative colitis is a long-term disease that causes swelling and sores in the gut. People with this condition often have belly pain, diarrhea, and bleeding. These symptoms can make daily life very hard.

**Why did researchers do this study?**

Doctors think that certain germs in the gut may cause or worsen the swelling in ulcerative colitis. Antibiotics are drugs that kill germs. Researchers wanted to know if antibiotics could help people with ulcerative colitis feel better. They also wanted to know if antibiotics were safe to use.

**Why is this study needed?**

Many people with ulcerative colitis need better treatment options. If antibiotics work well and are safe, they could be a new way to help these patients. However, doctors were not sure if antibiotics really helped or if they caused harm.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 12 studies that tested antibiotics in people with ulcerative colitis. These studies included 847 people in total.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included people of all ages who had ulcerative colitis. Some people had active disease with symptoms. Others had their disease under control.

**What did the studies compare?**

Most studies gave some people antibiotics plus their regular medicines. Other people got fake pills (called placebo) plus their regular medicines. Regular medicines included steroids and other drugs used to treat ulcerative colitis.

A few studies compared antibiotics to other treatments. These included probiotics (helpful germs) or a drug called 5-ASA.

**How long did the studies last?**

Studies testing if antibiotics help people get better lasted at least 2 weeks. Studies testing if antibiotics help people stay well lasted at least 3 months.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**Getting better from active disease:**

Researchers found strong evidence that antibiotics do not help more people get better compared to fake pills. About half of people got better in both groups. This was true whether people took steroids, 5-ASA, or probiotics along with the antibiotics.

Antibiotics may not help more people have less severe symptoms compared to fake pills. The evidence for this finding was less certain.

**Long-term results:**

Some evidence suggests antibiotics might help more people get better when measured at 12 months. However, more research is needed to be sure.

**Safety:**

Antibiotics may not cause more serious side effects than fake pills. Very few people had serious problems in either group (about 6 people out of 342 taking antibiotics and 5 people out of 349 taking fake pills).

Antibiotics may not cause more people to stop treatment due to side effects. Very few people stopped in either group.

**Other comparisons:**

The researchers could not draw clear conclusions when comparing antibiotics to probiotics or 5-ASA. The evidence was too uncertain.

**What do these results mean?**

The main finding is clear: antibiotics do not help more people with ulcerative colitis get better in the short term. They also do not seem to cause more harm than fake pills.

**What happens next?**

More studies are needed. Future studies should:
- Follow people for longer periods of time
- Test antibiotics along with standard treatments
- Compare different types of antibiotics

**Important note:**

People with ulcerative colitis should talk to their doctor before starting or stopping any treatment. This summary is for information only.",10.1002-14651858.CD013743,"The use of antibiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis
What was the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aimed to determine whether antibiotics are useful and safe for people with ulcerative colitis (UC) in achieving or maintaining remission. 
Key messages 
We found that antibiotics, when added to standard therapies, are similar to placebo in how often they fail to achieve remission or disease improvement for people with UC, measured up to three months from taking them. 
We found that antibiotics when compared to placebo may be useful in achieving remission or some improvement of UC symptoms, measured at 12 months from taking them. 
In terms of safety, the evidence is of low certainty, but antibiotics may be as safe as placebo. 
We have confidence in the findings up to three months, but have less confidence in the evidence at 12 months due to low numbers of study participants. 
What is ulcerative colitis? 
UC is a chronic (long term) inflammatory disease that affects the large bowel. The most common symptoms include bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and a sudden almost uncontrollable urge to pass stool. Some people have other symptoms including sore joints, mouth sores, and inflammation in their eyes. When someone is experiencing symptoms of UC, they are said to have 'active' disease. When symptoms improve with treatment, the disease is said to be responding to therapy. When symptoms stop, the disease is said to be in 'remission'. People with UC in remission are often given therapy with medicines to try and prolong (maintain) their remission or response to therapy. 
What did the review study? 
This review studied the use of antibiotics in the treatment of UC. Eleven studies considered antibiotics as a therapy for achieving remission and one study as therapy for maintaining remission. 
Antibiotics could theoretically be helpful as they might be able to fight harmful bacteria in the gut that are thought to be a partial cause for the presence of UC symptoms. 
Currently, most doctors do not recommend the use of antibiotics unless the patient has an infection. 
What were the main results of the review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing antibiotics with another treatment or dummy treatment. We found 12 RCTs including 847 participants. The trials looked at people of all ages; using different types and doses of antibiotics; and at antibiotics taken as tablets, injections, or any other way. The main results from our review are as follows. 
1. Antibiotics, when added to standard therapies, are no different from placebo in failing to achieve remission or improve disease symptoms for people with UC when measured up to three months from taking them. 
2. Antibiotics probably fail less than placebo in achieving remission or some improvement of UC symptoms measured at 12 months from taking them. 
3. In terms of safety, antibiotics may be similar to placebo, but the evidence is of low certainty. 
4. We are uncertain about how antibiotics compare to other treatments because there is not enough good evidence to make a judgement. 
Conclusion 
There is no difference between antibiotics and placebo when added to standard therapies to achieve remission or improvement of symptoms in the short term. However, they may help to lessen the number of people who do not achieve remission, and they probably lead to fewer numbers of people who have not achieved improvement of symptoms at 12 months. 
No conclusions can be drawn on other treatments or safety due to lack of evidence, even though there may be a possibility that antibiotics are as safe as placebo. Further research would be needed to clarify the usefulness of antibiotics in the treatment of UC; however, such studies should focus on longer‐term outcomes given the findings of this review.

The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) replication in early stages of infection. Currently, evidence on ivermectin for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 treatment is conflicting. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo, or any other proven intervention for people with COVID‐19 receiving treatment as inpatients or outpatients, and for prevention of an infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 (postexposure prophylaxis). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science (Emerging Citation Index and Science Citation Index), WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and HTA database weekly to identify completed and ongoing trials without language restrictions to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Co‐interventions had to be the same in both study arms.  
For this review update, we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity: only RCTs prospectively registered in a trial registry according to WHO guidelines for clinical trial registration were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed RCTs for bias, using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for outcomes in the following settings and populations: 1) to treat inpatients with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19, 2) to treat outpatients with mild COVID‐19 (outcomes: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, (serious) adverse events, quality of life, and viral clearance), and 3) to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (outcomes: SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, development of COVID‐19 symptoms, admission to hospital, mortality, adverse events and quality of life). 
Main results
We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review version; six were not prospectively registered and one was non‐randomized. This updated review includes 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo. No trial investigated ivermectin for prevention of infection or compared ivermectin to an intervention with proven efficacy. Five trials treated participants with moderate COVID‐19 (inpatient settings); six treated mild COVID‐19 (outpatient settings). Eight trials were double‐blind and placebo‐controlled, and three were open‐label. We assessed around 50% of the trial results as low risk of bias. 
We identified 31 ongoing trials. In addition, there are 28 potentially eligible trials without publication of results, or with disparities in the reporting of the methods and results, held in ‘awaiting classification’ until the trial authors clarify questions upon request. 
Ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 in inpatient settings with moderate‐to‐severe disease 
We are uncertain whether ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo reduces or increases all‐cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 2.51; 3 trials, 230 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); or clinical worsening, assessed by participants with new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death at day 28 (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.04; 2 trials, 118 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); or serious adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.89; 2 trials, 197 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may have little or no effect on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants discharged alive at day 28 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 trial, 73 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.79; 3 trials, 228 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at 7 days (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.58; 3 trials, 231 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No trial investigated quality of life at any time point. 
Ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease 
Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo probably has little or no effect on all‐cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25; 6 trials, 2860 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and little or no effect on quality of life, measured with the PROMIS Global‐10 scale (physical component mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.98 to 0.98; and mental component MD 0.00, 95% CI ‐1.08 to 1.08; 1358 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect on clinical worsening, assessed by admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.02; 2 trials, 590 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants with all initial symptoms resolved up to 14 days (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36; 2 trials, 478 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on serious adverse events (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.62 to 8.31; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at day 7 compared to placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; 2 trials, 331 participants; low‐certainty evidence). None of the trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta‐analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
For outpatients, there is currently low‐ to high‐certainty evidence that ivermectin has no beneficial effect for people with COVID‐19. Based on the very low‐certainty evidence for inpatients, we are still uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or clinical worsening or increases serious adverse events, while there is low‐certainty evidence that it has no beneficial effect regarding clinical improvement, viral clearance and adverse events. No evidence is available on ivermectin to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In this update, certainty of evidence increased through higher quality trials including more participants. According to this review's living approach, we will continually update our search. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Does Ivermectin Help Treat or Prevent COVID-19?

## Plain Title

Does the drug ivermectin help treat or prevent COVID-19?

## Rationale

### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. This virus can make people very sick. Some people have mild symptoms like fever and cough. Others get very sick and need to stay in the hospital. Some people may die from COVID-19.

### What is ivermectin?

Ivermectin is a drug that doctors use to treat infections caused by parasites. Parasites are tiny living things that can make people sick. Lab tests showed that ivermectin might stop viruses from making copies of themselves. This made scientists think it might help stop the COVID-19 virus too.

### Why was this study needed?

Many studies have looked at ivermectin for COVID-19. But these studies showed different results. Some said ivermectin might help. Others said it did not help. Doctors needed to know if ivermectin really works for COVID-19. They also needed to know if it is safe.

This study looked at all the good quality research on ivermectin. The goal was to find out if ivermectin helps treat or prevent COVID-19.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

The researchers looked for all studies that tested ivermectin for COVID-19. They only included studies that were well designed. These are called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, some people got ivermectin plus regular care. Other people got regular care alone or regular care plus a fake pill. The fake pill is called a placebo.

The researchers were very careful about which studies to include. They only used studies that were registered before they started. This helps make sure the studies were done properly.

### Who was in these studies?

The researchers found 11 good quality studies. These studies included 3,409 people total.

Some studies looked at people in the hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19. Other studies looked at people not in the hospital with mild COVID-19 or no symptoms.

The studies included both men and women. They included adults of different ages.

### How long did the studies last?

Most studies followed people for about 28 days. This is about 4 weeks.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?

The researchers looked at two main groups of people.

**For people in the hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19:**

The researchers are not sure if ivermectin helps or not. The evidence was very uncertain. They could not tell if ivermectin:
- Reduces deaths
- Stops people from getting worse
- Helps people get better faster
- Causes serious side effects

Not enough good quality studies were done on hospital patients.

**For people not in the hospital with mild COVID-19:**

The evidence was better for this group. The researchers found that ivermectin:
- Probably does not reduce deaths
- Does not improve quality of life
- Probably does not stop people from going to the hospital
- Probably does not help symptoms go away faster
- Probably does not cause more side effects

In simple terms, ivermectin did not help people with mild COVID-19 get better.

### What about preventing COVID-19?

The researchers found no studies that tested if ivermectin prevents COVID-19 infection.

### What do these results mean?

For people with mild COVID-19 who are not in the hospital, ivermectin does not help. It does not make people get better faster. It does not prevent death. It does not improve how people feel.

For people in the hospital with more severe COVID-19, we still do not know if ivermectin helps. More research is needed.

### What happens next?

The researchers will keep looking for new studies. They will update their findings as new information becomes available. Right now, based on the best available evidence, ivermectin does not appear to be a helpful treatment for COVID-19.",10.1002-14651858.CD015017,"Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID‐19
Is ivermectin effective for COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
We found no evidence to support the use of ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 or preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The evidence base improved slightly in this update, but is still limited. 
Evaluation of ivermectin is continuing in 31 ongoing trials, and we will update this review again when their results become available.  
What is ivermectin? 
Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals, and scabies in humans. It is inexpensive and is widely used in regions of the world where parasitic infestations are common. It has few unwanted effects.  
Medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID‐19.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID‐19, or is useful in prevention of the infection. We included trials comparing the medicine to placebo (dummy treatment), usual care, or treatments for COVID‐19 that are known to work to some extent, such as dexamethasone. We excluded trials comparing ivermectin to other medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness against COVID‐19 is uncertain. 
We evaluated the effects of ivermectin in infected people on:
– people dying;– whether people's COVID‐19 got better or worse;– quality of life;– serious and non‐serious unwanted effects;– viral clearance. 
For prevention, we sought the effect on preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease. 
What did we do?  
We searched for randomized controlled trials that investigated ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID‐19. People treated in hospital or as outpatients had to have laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19. 
In this update, we also investigated the trustworthiness of the trials and only included them if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria. 
We compared and summarized the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review as these trials did not fulfil the expected ethical and scientific criteria. Together with four new trials, we included 11 trials with 3409 participants that investigated ivermectin combined with any usual care compared to the same usual care or placebo. 
For treatment, there were five trials of people in hospital with moderate COVID‐19 and six trials of outpatients with mild COVID‐19. The trials used different doses of ivermectin and different durations of treatment.  
No trial investigated ivermectin to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.
We also found 31 ongoing trials, and an additional 28 trials still requiring clarification from the authors or not yet published. 
Main results  
Treating people in hospital with COVID‐19 
We do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment: 
– leads to more or fewer deaths (3 trials, 230 people); – worsens or improves patients' condition, assessed by need for ventilation or death (2 trials, 118 people);– increases or reduces serious unwanted events (2 trials, 197 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: 
– improving patients' condition, assessed by discharge from hospital (1 trial, 73 people);– non‐serious unwanted events (3 trials, 228 participants).  
Seven days after treatment, ivermectin may make little or no difference to reduction of negative COVID‐19 tests (3 trials, 231 participants) compared with placebo or usual care. 
Treating outpatients with COVID‐19 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, probably makes little or no difference to people dying (6 trials, 2860 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, makes little or no difference to quality of life (1 trial, 1358 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: 
– worsening patients' condition, assessed by admission to hospital or death (2 trials, 590 people);– serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 people); – non‐serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 participants); – improving people's COVID‐19 symptoms in the 14 days after treatment (2 trials, 478 people);– number of people with negative COVID‐19 tests 7 days after treatment (2 trials, 331 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review version, because we could look at more participants included in high‐quality trials. Although we are quite certain regarding our results on risk of people dying and quality of life, the confidence in the evidence is still low for many other outpatient and inpatient outcomes because there were only few events measured. The methods differed between trials, and they did not report everything we were interested in, such as relevant outcomes. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The systematic literature search is up to date to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022.

267,10.1002-14651858.CD013224.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Chordoma is a rare primary bone tumour with a high propensity for local recurrence. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment, but complete resection is often morbid due to tumour location. Similarly, the dose of radiotherapy (RT) that surrounding healthy organs can tolerate is frequently below that required to provide effective tumour control. Therefore, clinicians have investigated different radiation delivery techniques, often in combination with surgery, aimed to improve the therapeutic ratio. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and toxicity of proton and photon adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in people with biopsy‐confirmed chordoma. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2021, Issue 4); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to April 2021); Embase Ovid (1980 to April 2021) and online registers of clinical trials, and abstracts of scientific meetings up until April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included adults with pathologically confirmed primary chordoma, who were irradiated with curative intent, with protons or photons in the form of fractionated RT, SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery), SBRT (stereotactic body radiotherapy), or IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy). We limited analysis to studies that included outcomes of participants treated with both protons and photons. 
Data collection and analysis
The primary outcomes were local control, mortality, recurrence, and treatment‐related toxicity. We followed current standard Cochrane methodological procedures for data extraction, management, and analysis. We used the ROBINS‐I tool to assess risk of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included six observational studies with 187 adult participants. We judged all studies to be at high risk of bias. Four studies were included in meta‐analysis. 
We are uncertain if proton compared to photon therapy worsens or has no effect on local control (hazard ratio (HR) 5.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 43.43; 2 observational studies, 39 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Median survival time ranged between 45.5 months and 66 months. We are uncertain if proton compared to photon therapy reduces or has no effect on mortality (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.57; 4 observational studies, 65 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Median recurrence‐free survival ranged between 3 and 10 years. We are uncertain whether proton compared to photon therapy reduces or has no effect on recurrence (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.17; 4 observational studies, 94 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
One study assessed treatment‐related toxicity and reported that four participants on proton therapy developed radiation‐induced necrosis in the temporal bone, radiation‐induced damage to the brainstem, and chronic mastoiditis; one participant on photon therapy developed hearing loss, worsening of the seventh cranial nerve paresis, and ulcerative keratitis (risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% CI 0.17 to 9.86; 1 observational study, 33 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There is no evidence that protons led to reduced toxicity. 
There is very low‐certainty evidence to show an advantage for proton therapy in comparison to photon therapy with respect to local control, mortality, recurrence, and treatment related toxicity. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a lack of published evidence to confirm a clinical difference in effect with either proton or photon therapy for the treatment of chordoma. As radiation techniques evolve, multi‐institutional data should be collected prospectively and published, to help identify persons that would most benefit from the available radiation treatment techniques. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Types of Radiation Treatment for a Rare Bone Cancer Called Chordoma

## What Was This Study About?

Chordoma is a rare type of bone cancer. It often grows back in the same place after treatment. This makes it hard to treat.

Doctors usually remove chordoma with surgery. But the tumor often grows near important body parts like the brain or spine. This makes surgery risky and hard to do completely.

Doctors also use radiation to treat chordoma. Radiation uses energy beams to kill cancer cells. But the amount of radiation needed to kill the tumor can also harm nearby healthy organs.

Researchers wanted to know if one type of radiation works better than another. They compared two types:
- Proton therapy (uses proton particles)
- Photon therapy (uses X-rays)

Both types aim to kill cancer cells. Doctors hoped proton therapy might work better and cause less harm to healthy tissue.

This study was needed because doctors want to find the safest and most effective treatment for chordoma.

## How Was This Study Designed?

This was a review study. Researchers looked at data from other studies that were already done.

They searched medical databases for studies published up to April 2021. They looked for studies that compared proton therapy to photon therapy in adults with chordoma.

They found six studies with 187 adult patients total. All patients had chordoma confirmed by tissue testing. All received radiation treatment meant to cure their cancer.

The researchers combined data from four of these studies. They looked at how well each treatment worked and what side effects occurred.

The researchers checked the quality of each study. They found all six studies had problems that could affect the results. This made the evidence less reliable.

## What Were the Main Results?

The researchers could not tell if one treatment worked better than the other. The evidence was too weak to draw clear conclusions.

**Cancer Control:**
The researchers looked at whether the cancer stayed under control. They could not tell if proton or photon therapy worked better. The results were unclear.

**Survival:**
Patients lived between 45 and 66 months on average. The researchers could not tell if one treatment helped people live longer than the other.

**Cancer Coming Back:**
Cancer came back sometime between 3 and 10 years after treatment. The researchers could not tell if one treatment better prevented cancer from returning.

**Side Effects:**
One study looked at harmful effects from treatment. In the proton group, four patients had problems. These included bone damage, brain damage, and ear infection. In the photon group, one patient had problems. These included hearing loss, nerve damage, and eye problems.

The researchers could not tell if proton therapy caused fewer side effects than photon therapy.

**Overall Conclusions:**
The evidence was very weak. The researchers could not prove that proton therapy works better than photon therapy for chordoma. They also could not prove that proton therapy causes fewer side effects.

**What This Means:**
More research is needed. Future studies should collect information in a careful, planned way. This would help doctors know which treatment works best for which patients.

Right now, there is not enough evidence to say one radiation treatment is clearly better than the other for chordoma.",10.1002-14651858.CD013224,"Proton radiation therapy versus conventional radiation treatment (i.e. photon radiation) for the treatment of chordoma 
What is the issue?Chordoma is a rare tumour that can grow at any location in the spine. Because some of the locations are difficult to reach, some of the tumour may be left behind, even after aggressive surgery. When this happens, radiation to the postoperative area can help reduce the chance of the tumour coming back. Given the closeness to the spinal cord and other important organs, special radiation techniques are required to maximise tumour control, while minimising harm to normal tissues in the body. 
Why is this review important?At the time of this review, there is a lack of evidence to confirm a benefit with proton therapy compared to conventional photon radiation treatment. However, it is important to note that this review found a number of delivery techniques for both proton and photon therapy. As evidence comparing the latest techniques for proton and photon therapy emerges, we will update this review. 
The aim of the review:The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether proton therapy is more effective than photon therapy for improving local control, and reducing mortality, recurrence, and treatment‐related toxicity. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. 
What are the main findings?We included six studies that enrolled 187 adults with chordoma, four of which we included in a meta‐analysis. We are uncertain whether proton radiation therapy compared to conventional photon radiation treatment improves local control, because our confidence in the evidence was very low (2 observational studies, 39 participants). We are uncertain whether proton therapy compared to photon therapy reduces mortality (4 observational studies, 65 participants), recurrence (4 observational studies, 94 participants), or treatment‐related toxicity (1 observational study, 33 participants). 
Quality of the Evidence:We found very low‐certainty evidence for all outcomes due to high risk of bias in all the included observational studies, very small sample sizes, and varying ranges in the duration of participants' follow‐up period between studies. 
Authors' conclusions:From the currently available evidence, we do not know if proton therapy, used for adults with chordoma, is associated with clinically appreciable benefits and acceptable harms. 
The existing research on this question is solely of non‐randomised design, and is underpowered, with substantial imprecision. Any estimates of effect based on the existing insufficient evidence is very uncertain and is likely to change with future research.

Review Question 
What are the risks and benefits of eating food early, versus delaying food for at least 24 hours after abdominal gynaecologic surgery? 
Background 
Physicians often delay giving food and drink to women after abdominal gynaecologic surgery (uterine fibroids, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, uterine and ovarian cancer) until bowel function recommences (typically 24 hours after surgery). This is to reduce the risk of complications such as vomiting, gastrointestinal disruptions and wound rupturing or leakage. However, it has been suggested that some women may recover more quickly if food is introduced earlier. We reviewed evidence from randomised controlled trials of early and delayed feeding after abdominal gynaecologic surgery. 
Study Characteristics 
We assessed evidence on the following outcomes:
1. Nausea, vomiting, cramping abdominal pain, bloating, abdominal distension, wound complication, deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia. 
2. Time to first: bowel sound, gas, stool, start of regular diet.
3. Length of hospital stay
Early feeding was defined as having fluids or food within 24 hours of surgery. Delayed feeding was defined as having fluids or food 24 hours after surgery, and only if there are bowel sounds, passage of gas or stool, and a feeling of hunger. 
The evidence is current to April 2014
Key Results 
We included five published studies of 631 women, mainly with gynaecologic cancer.
Recovery of bowel function was faster in those with early feeding. There was no difference in rates of nausea or vomiting, abdominal distension, need for a postoperative nasogastric tube or time to first bowel movement, but early feeding was associated with a shorter time to bowel sounds and onset of gas. The early feeding group resumed a solid diet 1½ days sooner than those having delayed feeding and the hospital stay was one day shorter. Also, the early feeding group were more satisfied with the feeding schedule, although only one study reported this. 
Early feeding appeared safe, without increased postoperative complications and with fewer infectious complications overall. 
Quality of the Evidence 
Most of the evidence was moderate quality. The main limitation was lack of blinding, which could influence the findings for subjective outcomes such as self‐reported symptoms, hospital stay, patients' satisfaction and quality of life. 
Conclusions 
The evidence suggests that eating and drinking on the first day after abdominal gynaecologic surgery is safe and could reduce the length of hospital stay. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Early Eating After Surgery for Women's Reproductive Health Problems

## Plain Title
Is it safe for women to eat and drink soon after belly surgery for problems with their uterus or ovaries?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some women need surgery on their belly to treat problems with their uterus or ovaries. These problems include growths called fibroids, a painful condition called endometriosis, cysts on the ovaries, or cancer of the uterus or ovaries.

**What usually happens after this surgery?**

Doctors often tell women not to eat or drink for at least 24 hours after surgery. They wait until the bowels start working again. Doctors do this because they worry that eating too soon might cause problems. These problems could include throwing up, stomach issues, or wounds that break open.

**Why was this study needed?**

Some doctors think women might get better faster if they eat and drink sooner after surgery. But no one was sure if this was safe. Researchers wanted to find out if early eating helps women recover better. They also wanted to know if early eating causes any problems.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to compare two groups of women. One group ate and drank within the first day after surgery. The other group waited at least 24 hours before eating or drinking.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at five different studies. These studies included 631 women total. Most of these women had cancer of the uterus or ovaries.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included women who had belly surgery for problems with their reproductive organs. The women were divided into two groups:
- Early eating group: These women had food or drinks within 24 hours after surgery
- Delayed eating group: These women waited at least 24 hours. They could only eat after their bowels started working again

**What did researchers measure?**

Researchers looked at many things, including:
- Problems like nausea, throwing up, belly pain, and wound issues
- When the bowels started working again
- How long women stayed in the hospital
- How happy women were with their eating schedule

The information in this review includes studies done through April 2014.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The bowels started working faster in women who ate early. Women who ate early had bowel sounds and passed gas sooner than women who waited.

Women who ate early could eat solid food 1½ days sooner. They also went home from the hospital one day earlier.

**Were there any problems with early eating?**

Early eating was safe. Women who ate early did not have more problems than women who waited. In fact, women who ate early had fewer infections overall.

Both groups had similar rates of:
- Nausea and throwing up
- Belly swelling
- Needing a tube through the nose to the stomach
- Time until first bowel movement

One study asked women about their feelings. Women who ate early were happier with their eating schedule.

**What do these results mean?**

The evidence shows that eating and drinking on the first day after belly surgery is safe. Early eating may help women:
- Leave the hospital sooner
- Start eating normal food faster
- Feel more satisfied

Early eating does not cause more problems. It may actually help prevent some infections.

**How good was the evidence?**

Most of the evidence was of moderate quality. The main issue was that women and doctors knew which group they were in. This could affect how people reported symptoms like pain or nausea. It could also affect decisions about when to send women home.

**What is the conclusion?**

Women can safely eat and drink on the first day after belly surgery for reproductive health problems. Early eating may help women recover faster and go home sooner.",10.1002-14651858.CD004508,"Early versus delayed feeding for reducing complications after gynaecologic surgery

1. Nausea, vomiting, cramping abdominal pain, bloating, abdominal distension, wound complication, deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia. 
2. Time to first: bowel sound, gas, stool, start of regular diet.
3. Length of hospital stay
Early feeding was defined as having fluids or food within 24 hours of surgery. Delayed feeding was defined as having fluids or food 24 hours after surgery, and only if there are bowel sounds, passage of gas or stool, and a feeling of hunger. 
The evidence is current to April 2014
Key Results 
We included five published studies of 631 women, mainly with gynaecologic cancer.
Recovery of bowel function was faster in those with early feeding. There was no difference in rates of nausea or vomiting, abdominal distension, need for a postoperative nasogastric tube or time to first bowel movement, but early feeding was associated with a shorter time to bowel sounds and onset of gas. The early feeding group resumed a solid diet 1½ days sooner than those having delayed feeding and the hospital stay was one day shorter. Also, the early feeding group were more satisfied with the feeding schedule, although only one study reported this. 
Early feeding appeared safe, without increased postoperative complications and with fewer infectious complications overall. 
Quality of the Evidence 
Most of the evidence was moderate quality. The main limitation was lack of blinding, which could influence the findings for subjective outcomes such as self‐reported symptoms, hospital stay, patients' satisfaction and quality of life. 
Conclusions 
The evidence suggests that eating and drinking on the first day after abdominal gynaecologic surgery is safe and could reduce the length of hospital stay.

Each year, more than four million abdominal surgeries are performed in the US and over 250,000 in England. Acute respiratory failure, a common complication that can affect 30% to 50% of people after upper abdominal surgery, can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Noninvasive ventilation has been associated with lower rates of tracheal intubation in adults with acute respiratory failure, thus reducing the incidence of complications and mortality. This review compared the effectiveness and safety of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) versus standard oxygen therapy in the treatment of acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), that is, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel NPPV, in reducing mortality and the rate of tracheal intubation in adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery, compared to standard therapy (oxygen therapy), and to assess changes in arterial blood gas levels, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, gastric insufflation, and anastomotic leakage. 
Search methods
The date of the last search was 12 May 2015. We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1966 to May 2015), EMBASE (Ovid SP, 1974 to May 2015); the physiotherapy evidence database (PEDro) (1999 to May 2015); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL, EBSCOhost, 1982 to May 2015), and LILACS (BIREME, 1986 to May 2015). We reviewed reference lists of included studies and contacted experts. We also searched grey literature sources. We checked databases of ongoing trials such as www.controlled‐trials.com/ and www.trialscentral.org/. We did not apply language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials involving adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery who were treated with CPAP or bilevel NPPV with, or without, drug therapy as standard medical care, compared to adults treated with oxygen therapy with, or without, standard medical care. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected and abstracted data from eligible studies using a standardized form. We evaluated study quality by assessing allocation concealment; random sequence generation; incomplete outcome data; blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors; selective reporting; and adherence to the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) principle. 
Main results
We included two trials involving 269 participants. The participants were mostly men (67%); the mean age was 65 years. The trials were conducted in China and Italy (one was a multicentre trial). Both trials included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. We judged both trials at high risk of bias. Compared to oxygen therapy, CPAP or bilevel NPPV may reduce the rate of tracheal intubation (risk ratio (RR) 0.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.83; low quality evidence) with a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 11. There was very low quality evidence that the intervention may also reduce ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD) ‐1.84 days; 95% CI ‐3.53 to ‐0.15). We found no differences for mortality (low quality evidence) and hospital length of stay. There was insufficient evidence to be certain that CPAP or NPPV had an effect on anastomotic leakage, pneumonia‐related complications, and sepsis or infections. Findings from one trial of 60 participants suggested that bilevel NPPV, compared to oxygen therapy, may improve blood gas levels and blood pH one hour after the intervention (partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2): MD 22.5 mm Hg; 95% CI 17.19 to 27.81; pH: MD 0.06; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11; partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PCO2) levels (MD ‐9.8 mm Hg; 95% CI ‐14.07 to ‐5.53). The trials included in this systematic review did not present data on the following outcomes that we intended to assess: gastric insufflation, fistulae, pneumothorax, bleeding, skin breakdown, eye irritation, sinus congestion, oronasal drying, and patient‐ventilator asynchrony. 
Authors' conclusions
The findings of this review indicate that CPAP or bilevel NPPV is an effective and safe intervention for the treatment of adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. However, based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, the quality of the evidence was low or very low. More good quality studies are needed to confirm these findings. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using Breathing Support Machines After Belly Surgery

## Plain Title
Can breathing support machines help people who have trouble breathing after upper belly surgery?

## Rationale

### What is the health problem?
Every year, doctors perform more than 4 million belly surgeries in the United States. After surgery on the upper belly, many people have trouble breathing. This breathing problem happens in 3 to 5 out of every 10 people who have this type of surgery. When people cannot breathe well after surgery, they can become very sick. Some people may even die from this problem.

### What treatment did researchers study?
Doctors often give extra oxygen through a mask or nose tube to help people breathe better. But researchers wanted to test a different treatment. They studied special breathing machines called CPAP and bilevel NPPV. These machines gently push air into the lungs through a face mask. The air pressure helps keep the lungs open. This makes breathing easier.

### Why was this study needed?
When people have severe breathing problems, doctors sometimes need to put a tube down their throat. This is called intubation. The tube connects to a breathing machine. But this tube can cause problems like infections. Researchers wanted to know if the gentler breathing support machines could help people avoid needing the throat tube. If these machines work, fewer people would get sick or die after surgery.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
Researchers looked for all studies that tested breathing support machines in adults after upper belly surgery. They searched medical databases and found 2 studies. These studies included 269 people total.

### Who was in the studies?
Most people in the studies were men (67 out of every 100 people). The average age was 65 years old. All people in the studies had trouble breathing after upper belly surgery. The studies took place in China and Italy.

### What did researchers compare?
One group of people used the breathing support machines (CPAP or bilevel NPPV). The other group received regular oxygen therapy through a mask or nose tube. Researchers watched both groups to see who got better.

## Results

### What did the study find?

**Breathing tubes:** The breathing support machines helped people avoid needing a breathing tube down their throat. Out of every 11 people who used the machines, 1 person avoided needing the throat tube. This is good news because throat tubes can cause problems.

**Time in intensive care:** People who used the breathing support machines spent less time in the intensive care unit. They left almost 2 days earlier than people who got regular oxygen.

**Deaths:** The study found no clear difference in deaths between the two groups.

**Hospital stays:** Both groups spent about the same amount of time in the hospital overall.

**Breathing measurements:** One study measured oxygen levels in the blood. People who used the breathing support machines had better oxygen levels one hour after starting treatment. Their blood also had better acid levels.

**Other problems:** The studies did not find clear differences in other complications like infections or leaking from surgical cuts.

### What do these results mean?
The breathing support machines appear to be safe and helpful for people with breathing problems after upper belly surgery. These machines may help people avoid needing a breathing tube down their throat. They may also help people leave intensive care sooner.

### Important notes
The researchers said the quality of evidence was low. This means we cannot be completely sure about the results. Only 2 studies with 269 people were included. More and better studies are needed. Future studies should include more people and use better research methods. This would help doctors know for certain if these breathing machines truly help patients.",10.1002-14651858.CD009134,"Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure following upper abdominal surgery 
Review question 
The goal of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel NPPV) compared with oxygen therapy alone in adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. 
Background 
Acute respiratory failure , where fluid builds up in the lungs stopping oxygen from crossing into the blood, is a relatively common complication after abdominal surgery and can increase the risk of dying (mortality). 
NPPV is a type of treatment that helps to improve breathing without having to insert a tube inside a person's windpipe (tracheal intubation). This intervention is effective in several illnesses. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the treatment of adults with acute respiratory failure following abdominal surgery. The trials compared NPPV with usual care(oxygen therapy through a face mask). We included two trials involving 269 participants.The participants were mostly men (67%) and on average 65 years of age. One trial was conducted in several intensive care units (ICU). Both trials included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. The evidence is current to May 2015. 
Key results 
This review examined mortality, rate of tracheal intubation, length of stay in the ICU, length of hospital stay, complications after NPPV, and changes in the levels of gases within the blood (arterial blood gases). 
Compared with oxygen therapy, NPPV decreased the rate of tracheal intubation. Out of every 1000 adults who developed acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery, 181 adults treated with oxygen therapy would need to be intubated compared with 54 adults treated with NPPV. 
When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV tended to reduce mortality. However, since the number of participants included in the two trials was small, more studies are needed. 
The use of NPPV also reduced the length of stay in the ICU by almost two days when compared to oxygen therapy. However, the mean length of stay in the hospital was similar in the two groups. 
When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV improved blood gas levels one hour after the intervention. 
There was insufficient evidence to be certain that CPAP or NPPV had an effect on anastomotic (e.g. where two pieces of intestine are joined together) leakage, pneumonia related complications and sepsis (blood poisoning) or infections. However, adults treated with NPPV had lower rates these complications than adults treated with oxygen. 
Quality of the evidence 
There was low quality evidence for hospital mortality, low quality of evidence for rate of tracheal intubation, and very low quality of evidence for ICU length of stay. 
Authors' conclusions 
The findings of this review showed that NPPV is an effective and safe treatment for adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. However, due to the low quality of the evidence, more good quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with women's quality of life, regardless of the absolute amount of bleeding. It is a very common condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 2 to 5 of every 10 women. Diverse treatments, either medical (hormonal or non‐hormonal) or surgical, are currently available for HMB, with different effectiveness, acceptability, costs and side effects. The best treatment will depend on the woman's age, her intention to become pregnant, the presence of other symptoms, and her personal views and preferences. 
Objectives
To identify, systematically assess and summarise all evidence from studies included in Cochrane Reviews on treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), using reviews with comparable participants and outcomes; and to present a ranking of the first‐ and second‐line treatments for HMB. 
Methods
We searched for published Cochrane Reviews of HMB interventions in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The primary outcomes were menstrual bleeding and satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, adverse events and the requirement of further treatment. Two review authors independently selected the systematic reviews, extracted data and assessed quality, resolving disagreements by discussion. We assessed review quality using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool and evaluated the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods. We grouped the interventions into first‐ and second‐line treatments, considering participant characteristics (desire for future pregnancy, failure of previous treatment, candidacy for surgery). First‐line treatments included medical interventions, and second‐line treatments included both the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) and surgical treatments; thus the LNG‐IUS is included in both groups. We developed different networks for first‐ and second‐line treatments. We performed network meta‐analyses of all outcomes, except for quality of life, where we performed pairwise meta‐analyses. We reported the mean rank, the network estimates for mean difference (MD) or odds ratio (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and the certainty of evidence (moderate, low or very low certainty). 
We also analysed different endometrial ablation and resection techniques separately from the main network: transcervical endometrial resection (TCRE) with or without rollerball, other resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA), microwave non‐resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA), hydrothermal ablation NREA, bipolar NREA, balloon NREA and other NREA. 
Main results
We included nine systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Library up to July 2021. We updated the reviews that were over two years old. In July 2020, we started the overview with no new reviews about the topic. The included medical interventions were: non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid), combined oral contraceptives (COC), combined vaginal ring (CVR), long‐cycle and luteal oral progestogens, LNG‐IUS, ethamsylate and danazol (included to provide indirect evidence), which were compared to placebo. Surgical interventions were: open (abdominal), minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic) and unspecified (or surgeon's choice of route of) hysterectomy, REA, NREA, unspecified endometrial ablation (EA) and LNG‐IUS. We grouped the interventions as follows. 
First‐line treatments 
Evidence from 26 studies with 1770 participants suggests that LNG‐IUS results in a large reduction of menstrual blood loss (MBL; mean rank 2.4, MD −105.71 mL/cycle, 95% CI −201.10 to −10.33; low certainty evidence); antifibrinolytics probably reduce MBL (mean rank 3.7, MD −80.32 mL/cycle, 95% CI −127.67 to −32.98; moderate certainty evidence); long‐cycle progestogen reduces MBL (mean rank 4.1, MD −76.93 mL/cycle, 95% CI −153.82 to −0.05; low certainty evidence), and NSAIDs slightly reduce MBL (mean rank 6.4, MD −40.67 mL/cycle, −84.61 to 3.27; low certainty evidence; reference comparator mean rank 8.9). We are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions and the sensitivity analysis for reduction of MBL, as the evidence was rated as very low certainty. 
We are uncertain of the true effect of any intervention (very low certainty evidence) on the perception of improvement and satisfaction. 
Second‐line treatments 
Bleeding reduction is related to the type of hysterectomy (total or supracervical/subtotal), not the route, so we combined all routes of hysterectomy for bleeding outcomes. We assessed the reduction of MBL without imputed data (11 trials, 1790 participants) and with imputed data (15 trials, 2241 participants). Evidence without imputed data suggests that hysterectomy (mean rank 1.2, OR 25.71, 95% CI 1.50 to 439.96; low certainty evidence) and REA (mean rank 2.8, OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.29 to 5.66; low certainty evidence) result in a large reduction of MBL, and NREA probably results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 2.0, OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.53 to 7.23; moderate certainty evidence). Evidence with imputed data suggests hysterectomy results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 1.0, OR 14.31, 95% CI 2.99 to 68.56; low certainty evidence), and NREA probably results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 2.2, OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.29 to 6.05; moderate certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the true effect for REA (very low certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effect on amenorrhoea (very low certainty evidence). 
Evidence from 27 trials with 4284 participants suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy results in a large increase in satisfaction (mean rank 1.3, OR 7.96, 95% CI 3.33 to 19.03; low certainty evidence), and NREA also increases satisfaction (mean rank 3.6, OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.33; low certainty evidence), but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions (very low certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence suggests LNG‐IUS is the best first‐line treatment for reducing menstrual blood loss (MBL); antifibrinolytics are probably the second best, and long‐cycle progestogens are likely the third best. We cannot make conclusions about the effect of first‐line treatments on perception of improvement and satisfaction, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. For second‐line treatments, evidence suggests hysterectomy is the best treatment for reducing bleeding, followed by REA and NREA. We are uncertain of the effect on amenorrhoea, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. Minimally invasive hysterectomy may result in a large increase in satisfaction, and NREA also increases satisfaction, but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining second‐line interventions, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Treatments for Heavy Menstrual Bleeding

## Plain Title
Which treatments work best for women with heavy menstrual periods?

## Rationale

### What is heavy menstrual bleeding?

Heavy menstrual bleeding means having very heavy periods. This happens when a woman loses too much blood during her monthly cycle. Heavy periods can make daily life very hard. They can stop women from doing normal tasks. About 2 to 5 out of every 10 women have this problem.

### Why was this study needed?

Many different treatments exist for heavy periods. Some are medicines. Some are surgeries. Each treatment works differently. Each has different side effects and costs. Doctors and patients need to know which treatments work best.

The best treatment depends on several things. These include the woman's age. They include whether she wants to have children. They include what she prefers.

### What did researchers want to learn?

Researchers wanted to find all the studies about treating heavy periods. They wanted to compare all the treatments. They wanted to rank them from best to worst. This would help doctors and patients choose the right treatment.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at many studies that were already done. They searched for all high-quality reviews about heavy period treatments. They found 9 reviews. These reviews included many smaller studies.

### What treatments did they compare?

Researchers divided treatments into two groups:

**First-line treatments** (tried first, usually medicines):
- Pain medicines called NSAIDs
- Medicines that help blood clot (tranexamic acid)
- Birth control pills
- Birth control vaginal rings
- Hormone pills called progestogens
- A hormone device placed in the womb (LNG-IUS)

**Second-line treatments** (tried when medicines don't work):
- Surgery to remove the womb (hysterectomy)
- Surgery to remove the womb lining (endometrial ablation)
- The hormone device (LNG-IUS)

### Who was in these studies?

The studies included women of child-bearing age. All had heavy menstrual bleeding. Some wanted to have children in the future. Some did not. The studies included 1,770 women for first-line treatments. They included 4,284 women for second-line treatments.

## Results

### What did the study find about first-line treatments?

The hormone device (LNG-IUS) worked best. It greatly reduced blood loss during periods.

Medicines that help blood clot worked second best. They reduced blood loss by a large amount.

Long-cycle hormone pills worked third best. They also reduced blood loss.

Pain medicines (NSAIDs) helped a little. They reduced blood loss by a small amount.

Researchers could not tell how satisfied women were with these treatments. The information was not clear enough.

### What did the study find about second-line treatments?

Surgery to remove the womb (hysterectomy) worked best. It greatly reduced bleeding.

Surgery to remove the womb lining worked well too. Both types of this surgery reduced bleeding a lot.

Women were most satisfied with hysterectomy done through small cuts. Surgery to remove the womb lining also made women satisfied.

### Why does this matter?

This study helps doctors and patients choose treatments. For women who want to try medicine first, the hormone device works best. For women who need surgery, removing the womb works best.

Women can talk with their doctors about these results. They can choose what works best for their life and goals.

### What are the main conclusions?

For first-line treatments, the hormone device placed in the womb reduces bleeding the most. Medicines that help blood clot are probably second best. Long-cycle hormone pills are likely third best.

For second-line treatments, surgery to remove the womb reduces bleeding the most. Surgery to remove just the womb lining also works very well.

More research is needed to understand how satisfied women are with different treatments.",10.1002-14651858.CD013180,"Which is the best treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding?
Key results 
Evidence suggests that the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) is the best first‐line option for reducing menstrual bleeding, while antifibrinolytics are probably the second best, and long‐cycle progestogens are the third best. Because of some limitations in the evidence, we are not sure what the true effect of these first‐line treatments is for the perception of improvement and satisfaction. 
For second‐line treatments, evidence suggests any type of hysterectomy is the best treatment for reducing bleeding, even though this is a major surgery, and resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA) and non‐resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA) are second and third best. We are uncertain of the true effect of the second‐line treatments on amenorrhoea (absence of menstrual blood loss). Evidence suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy results in a large increase in satisfaction, and NREA increases satisfaction, but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions. 
What is heavy menstrual bleeding? 
Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with the quality of life of people who menstruate. It is very common and can affect 20% to 50% of people who menstruate during their reproductive years. There are different treatments available, each with their own pros and cons. The best treatment depends on the person's age, whether they have or want to have children, their personal preferences, and their medical history, among other things. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to get an overview of all the published evidence on different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. We were most interested in finding out if the treatments were effective for reducing menstrual bleeding and for improving women's satisfaction. We also wanted to know how the treatment affected quality of life, what side effects it caused, and whether women required further treatment. 
What did we do? 
This study is an overview of reviews, which means we looked for published studies that synthesised the results of other studies on different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. Then we tried to give a broad overview of all that evidence. We analysed the certainty of the evidence based on factors like study size and methodological rigour. We categorised the treatments based on patient characteristics, including the desire (intention) for future pregnancy, failure of previous treatment or having been referred for surgery. First‐line treatment included medical interventions and second‐line treatment included the LNG‐IUS plus surgical interventions; thus, the LNG‐IUS was included in both first‐ and second‐line treatments. We used network meta‐analysis, a statistical method that compares all the interventions at the same time, to find out which treatments produced the best results for patients. 
What did we find? 
We found nine reviews with 104 studies, involving a total of 11,881 participants. Altogether, the data we analysed came from 85 trials and 9950 participants. The medical interventions included were: non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid), combined oral contraceptives (COC), combined vaginal ring (CVR), long‐cycle and luteal oral progestogens, the LNG‐IUS, ethamsylate and danazol (included only to provide indirect evidence). These were compared to placebo (sham treatment). The surgical interventions included were: open (abdominal), minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic) and unspecified (or surgeon's choice of) route of hysterectomy, REA, NREA and unspecified endometrial ablation (EA). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in some evidence is moderate, but for most of it, our confidence is low to very low. The main reasons were because the studies were often not blinded, which means the participants knew which treatment they were receiving, and that could have changed their perception; the direct and indirect evidence was not similar enough to compare in the network; and the range of the results was too wide. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The last search for reviews was in July 2021.

Hip fractures are a major healthcare problem, presenting a huge challenge and burden to patients, healthcare systems and society. The increased proportion of older adults in the world population means that the absolute number of hip fractures is rising rapidly across the globe. The majority of hip fractures are treated surgically. This review evaluates evidence for types of internal fixation implants used in joint‐preserving surgery for intracapsular hip fractures. 
Objectives
To determine the relative effects (benefits and harms) of different implants for the internal fixation of intracapsular hip fractures in older adults. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Epistemonikos, Proquest Dissertations and Theses, and National Technical Information Service in July 2020. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, reference lists of retrieved articles and conducted backward‐citation searches. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing implants used for internal fixation of fragility intracapsular proximal femoral fractures in older adults. Types of implants were smooth pins (these include pins with fold‐out hooks), screws, or fixed angle plates. We excluded studies in which all or most fractures were caused by specific pathologies other than osteoporosis or were the result of a high energy trauma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. One review author extracted data and assessed risk of bias which was checked by a second review author. We collected data for seven outcomes: activities of daily living (ADL), delirium, functional status, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), mobility, mortality (reported within four months of surgery as early mortality, and at 12 months since surgery), and unplanned return to theatre for treating a complication resulting directly or indirectly from the primary procedure (such as deep infection or non‐union). We assessed the certainty of the evidence for these outcomes using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 38 studies (32 RCTs, six quasi‐RCTs) with 8585 participants with 8590 intracapsular fractures. The mean ages of participants in the studies ranged from 60 to 84 years; 73% were women, and 38% of fractures were undisplaced. 
We report here the findings of the four main comparisons, which were between different categories of implants. 
We downgraded the certainty of the outcomes for imprecision (when data were available from insufficient numbers of participants or the confidence interval (CI) was wide), study limitations (e.g. high or unclear risks of bias), and inconsistency (when we noted substantial levels of statistical heterogeneity). 
Smooth pins versus fixed angle plate (four studies, 1313 participants) 
We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two implant types in independent mobility with no more than one walking stick (1 study, 112 participants), early mortality (1 study, 383 participants), mortality at 12 months (2 studies, 661 participants), and unplanned return to theatre (3 studies, 736 participants). No studies reported on ADL, delirium, functional status, or HRQoL. 
Screws versus fixed angle plates (11 studies, 2471 participants) 
We found low‐certainty evidence of no clinically important differences between the two implant types in functional status using WOMAC (MD ‐3.18, 95% CI ‐6.35 to ‐0.01; 2 studies, 498 participants; range of scores from 0 to 96, lower values indicate better function), and HRQoL using EQ‐5D (MD 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.06; 2 studies, 521 participants; range ‐0.654 (worst), 0 (dead), 1 (best)). We also found low‐certainty evidence showing little or no difference between the two implant types in mortality at 12 months (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.31; 7 studies, 1690 participants), and unplanned return to theatre (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.26; 11 studies, 2321 participants). We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two implant types in independent mobility (1 study, 70 participants), and early mortality (3 studies, 467 participants). No studies reported on ADL or delirium. 
Screws versus smooth pins (seven studies, 1119 participants) 
We found low‐certainty evidence of no or little difference between the two implant types in mortality at 12 months (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.35; 6 studies, 1005 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two implant types in early mortality (3 studies, 584 participants) and unplanned return to theatre (5 studies, 862 participants). No studies reported on ADL, delirium, functional status, HRQoL, or mobility. 
Screws or smooth pins versus fixed angle plates (15 studies, 3784 participants) 
In this comparison, we combined data from the first two comparison groups. We found low‐certainty evidence of no or little difference between the two groups of implants in mortality at 12 months (RR 1.04, 95% CI.083 to 1.31; 7 studies, 1690 participants) and unplanned return to theatre (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18; 14 studies, 3057 participants). We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two groups of implants in independent mobility (2 studies, 182 participants), and early mortality (4 studies, 850 participants). We found no additional evidence to support the findings for functional status or HRQoL as reported in 'Screws versus fixed angle plates'. No studies reported ADL or delirium. 
Authors' conclusions
There is low‐certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference between screws and fixed angle plates in functional status, HRQoL, mortality at 12 months, or unplanned return to theatre; and between screws and pins in mortality at 12 months. The limited and very low‐certainty evidence for the outcomes for which data were available for the smooth pins versus fixed angle plates comparison, as well as the other outcomes for which data were available for the screws and fixed angle plates, and screws and pins comparisons means we have very little confidence in the estimates of effect for these outcomes. Additional RCTs would increase the certainty of the evidence. We encourage such studies to report outcomes consistent with the core outcome set for hip fracture, including long‐term quality of life indicators such as ADL and mobility. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Metal Implants for Hip Fracture Surgery

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Types of Metal Implants Used to Fix Broken Hips in Older Adults

## Rationale

### What is a hip fracture and why does it matter?
A hip fracture is a break in the upper part of the thigh bone. This is a serious injury that happens often in older adults. Hip fractures cause major problems for patients and their families. They also cost health care systems a lot of money.

More older adults are living around the world today. This means more people are breaking their hips each year. Most people with hip fractures need surgery to fix the broken bone.

### What was the purpose of this study?
Doctors use different types of metal implants to fix broken hips. These implants hold the broken bone pieces together so they can heal. The main types of implants are:
- Smooth pins (thin metal rods, some with hooks)
- Screws (like pins but with threads)
- Fixed angle plates (flat metal pieces with screws)

Researchers wanted to find out which type of implant works best. They looked at whether different implants helped patients recover better. They also checked which implants caused fewer problems.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors need to know which implant is safest and works best. This helps them choose the right treatment for each patient. Better implants can help patients heal faster and return to their normal lives.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review study. Researchers looked at 38 earlier studies done by other scientists. These studies included 8,585 patients with hip fractures.

### Who was in these studies?
- Patients were between 60 and 84 years old on average
- About 3 out of 4 patients were women
- About 2 out of 5 patients had less severe breaks

### What did researchers compare?
Researchers compared four main groups of implants:
1. Smooth pins compared to fixed angle plates
2. Screws compared to fixed angle plates
3. Screws compared to smooth pins
4. Screws or smooth pins combined, compared to fixed angle plates

### What did researchers measure?
They looked at several important outcomes:
- How well patients could do daily tasks
- Whether patients became confused after surgery
- How well patients could move around
- Patient quality of life
- How many patients died within 4 months or 12 months
- How many patients needed another surgery to fix problems

## Results

### What did the study find?

The researchers found that different implants worked about the same. There were no major differences between the types of implants for most outcomes.

**Comparing screws to fixed angle plates:**
- Patients could do daily tasks about the same with either implant
- Quality of life was similar with both implants
- About the same number of patients died within 12 months
- About the same number of patients needed another surgery

**Comparing screws to smooth pins:**
- About the same number of patients died within 12 months with either implant

**Comparing smooth pins to fixed angle plates:**
- Results were similar for death rates and need for more surgery

### What does this mean?
The evidence suggests that these different implants may work about equally well. However, the researchers noted that the quality of evidence was low or very low. This means they cannot be completely certain about these findings.

### What is still needed?
More high-quality studies are needed. Future studies should measure things that matter most to patients, such as:
- Ability to do daily tasks on their own
- Ability to walk and move around
- Long-term quality of life

### Conclusions
Based on current evidence, there may be little difference between screws, pins, and plates for fixing hip fractures. However, more research is needed to be more certain. Better studies would help doctors choose the best implant for their patients.",10.1002-14651858.CD013409,"Metal implants used to fix broken bones in the hip joint in older adults
This review assessed evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs, on the relative benefits and harms of different metal implants used to treat one type of hip fracture in older adults (aged 60 years or over). 
Background 
A hip fracture is a break at the top of the leg bone. We included people with a break just below the ball and socket joint. These types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. They often happen after a fall from a standing or sitting position. A common way of mending this break is to fix the broken parts of bone with metal implants. During an operation, the surgeon may insert a smooth pin or screw through the two parts of broken bone. A smooth pin is not threaded like a screw but may have extra features such as a fold‐out hook. Alternatively, the surgeon may use a 'fixed angle plate' which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone and is attached to the bone with screws or pins. 
Search date 
We searched for RCTs (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), and quasi‐RCTs (in which people are put into groups by a method which is not randomised, such as date of birth or hospital record number), published up to 6 July 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We included 38 studies, involving 8585 adults with 8590 hip fractures. The average age of study participants ranged from 60 to 84 years; 73% were women, which is usual for people who have this type of hip fracture. 
Key results 
Smooth pins compared with fixed angle plates (four studies, 1313 participants): we are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in improving a person's ability to walk independently (with no more than one walking stick), in the number of people who die early (within four months of surgery) or up to 12 months after surgery, and in how many people need additional surgery (e.g. because of deep infection around the implant). 
Screws compared with fixed angle plates (11 studies, 2471 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in hip function (ability to use the hip), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), death at 12 months, and additional surgery. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in independent walking, and early deaths. 
Screws compared to smooth pins (seven studies, 1119 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in deaths at 12 months. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in early deaths and additional surgery. 
Screws or pins compared with fixed angle plates (15 studies, 3784 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in deaths at 12 months, or additional surgery. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between implants in independent walking and early death. We found no additional evidence for hip function or HRQoL. 
No studies in the review reported activities of daily living or delirium.
Certainty of the evidence 
Although there were some large studies, most of the evidence for each outcome came from only a few participants. Many older studies were not well reported. It was not possible to hide from the surgeons what type of fixing was used, which might affect a surgeon's decision on whether someone needed additional surgery. Sometimes, we found differences between the findings of individual studies that we could not explain. 
For these reasons, we assessed the evidence for the outcomes as either low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence. This means we had limited confidence or very little confidence in the results. 
Conclusions 
There may be little or no difference between screws and fixed angle plates in hip function, HRQoL, deaths at 12 months, and additional surgery, and between screws and pins in deaths at 12 months. But we are uncertain of the effects for other outcomes, including those for smooth pins versus fixed angle plates, because the evidence was very low‐certainty. More well‐designed RCTs on metal implants will be helpful.

Review question 
We investigated whether oral homeopathic medicinal products are effective and safe to prevent or treat acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children compared with an inactive (placebo) treatment or other medicines. 
Background 
Most respiratory infections resolve without treatment, but sometimes symptoms persist after the initial infection has gone. Treatment is therefore aimed at relieving symptoms. Respiratory infections are commonly caused by viruses, especially colds and flu, though some lung and ear infections are caused by bacteria. It may be difficult to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections, and they may coexist. Antibiotics are often prescribed for respiratory infections even though they are ineffective against viruses. 
Children have on average three to six respiratory tract infections annually. Although most are mild and treatable, they sometimes require hospital treatment, and very rarely result in death. 
Homeopathy may treat respiratory infections with few side effects, but its effectiveness and safety has not been well researched. 
We assessed evidence from randomised controlled trials (studies that allocate people by chance to receive treatment), which is the best way to assess the safety and efficacy of medical treatments. 
Search date 
Our evidence is current to 27 November 2017.
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies involving 1562 children that compared oral homeopathic treatment to either placebo or standard treatment to prevent or treat respiratory infections in children. All studies investigated upper respiratory tract (from the nose to the windpipe (trachea)) infections, but one combined reporting of upper and lower respiratory tract (from the windpipe to the lungs and pleura (membranes covering the lungs)) infections, so the numbers of children with upper or lower infections is unknown. 
Study funding sources 
Three studies received funding from homeopathy manufacturers; one reported support from a non‐government organisation; two received government support; one was cosponsored by a university; and one did not report funding support. 
Key results 
Studies investigated a range of interventions for various illnesses and populations using different outcome measures, so only a small number could be combined for analysis. All moderate‐quality studies (low risk of bias) showed little or no beneficial effects for homeopathic medicinal products, whether individualised by a trained homeopath or a standard, non‐individualised commercially available therapy. Where results could be combined, there was probably little or no difference in benefit on short‐ or long‐term cure, or in prevention of ARTI. 
Two low‐quality studies (unclear or high risk of bias) showed some benefit of homeopathic medicinal products for a limited number of outcomes. One study showed a reduction in disease severity for the homeopathy group at some time points. The other study showed a reduction in number of respiratory infections over the following year in the treatment groups, although more than a quarter of participants were not accounted for in the results. There was no difference between homeopathy and placebo groups for parents' time off work, antibiotic use, or adverse effects. Consequently, there is no convincing evidence homeopathic medicinal products are effective in treating ARTIs in children. We are unsure about safety because data on adverse events were poorly reported. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated evidence as moderate or low quality for most outcomes. Three outcomes provided very low‐quality evidence because study populations and results differed significantly among studies; there were significant limitations in study design and reporting; and sample sizes were small. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title
Do Homeopathic Medicines Work to Prevent or Treat Colds and Flu in Children?

## Rationale

**What are respiratory tract infections?**

Respiratory tract infections are illnesses that affect breathing. They include colds, flu, and ear or lung infections. Most are caused by viruses. Some are caused by bacteria. Children get these infections 3 to 6 times each year on average.

**Why are these infections a problem?**

Most of these infections go away on their own. But sometimes symptoms last longer. Children may feel sick for many days. Some children need to go to the hospital. Very rarely, children can die from these infections.

Doctors often give antibiotics for these infections. But antibiotics do not work against viruses. They only work against bacteria.

**What is homeopathy?**

Homeopathy is a type of medicine. Some people believe it can treat infections. It may cause few side effects. But researchers have not studied it well enough.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if homeopathic medicines work. They wanted to know if these medicines are safe for children. They looked at studies that tested homeopathic medicines against fake pills (placebos) or other treatments.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This was a review of other studies. Researchers looked at 8 studies. These studies included 1,562 children total.

**What did the studies test?**

The studies tested homeopathic medicines taken by mouth. Some tested if the medicines could prevent infections. Others tested if they could treat infections.

**Who was in the studies?**

All studies included children with respiratory infections. Most infections were in the upper respiratory tract. This includes the nose, throat, and windpipe. One study included both upper and lower tract infections. Lower tract infections affect the lungs.

**What did researchers compare?**

Some studies compared homeopathic medicines to fake pills. Other studies compared them to standard treatments. Some medicines were chosen by trained homeopaths for each child. Other medicines were standard products bought in stores.

**When was this research done?**

Researchers searched for studies up to November 27, 2017.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The studies tested many different treatments. They looked at different illnesses. They measured results in different ways. This made it hard to combine the results.

**Studies with better quality:**

Most studies with good quality showed homeopathic medicines did not work better than fake pills. This was true for both types of homeopathic treatment. It did not matter if a trained homeopath chose the medicine. It did not matter if families used store-bought products.

The medicines did not help cure infections faster. They did not prevent new infections. They worked about the same as fake pills.

**Studies with lower quality:**

Two studies with lower quality showed some benefit. But these studies had problems. One study showed the illness was less severe at some times. The other study showed fewer infections over the next year. But more than 1 out of 4 children in that study were not counted in the results.

**Other findings:**

Parents took the same amount of time off work in both groups. Children used the same amount of antibiotics in both groups. Side effects were about the same in both groups.

**What do the results mean?**

There is no strong proof that homeopathic medicines work for respiratory infections in children. Researchers are not sure if these medicines are safe. The studies did not report side effects well enough.

**Quality of the evidence:**

Most evidence was moderate or low quality. Some evidence was very low quality. This was because studies were very different from each other. Some studies were not designed well. Some studies included only a small number of children.

**Conclusion:**

Based on current evidence, homeopathic medicines probably do not help prevent or treat respiratory infections in children. More research with better quality is needed to know for sure if these medicines are safe and effective.",10.1002-14651858.CD005974,"Are oral homeopathic medicinal products effective and safe to prevent and treat acute respiratory tract infections in children?

273,10.1002-14651858.CD013280.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Breast cancer will affect one in eight women during their lifetime. The opportunity to restore the removed tissue and cosmetic appearance is provided by reconstructive breast surgery following skin‐sparing mastectomy (SSM). Mastectomy skin flap necrosis (MSFN) is a common complication following SSM breast reconstruction. This postoperative complication can be prevented by intraoperative assessment of mastectomy skin flap viability and intervention when tissue perfusion is compromised. Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography is presumed to be a better predictor of MSFN compared to clinical evaluation alone. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of indocyanine green fluorescence angiography (ICGA) for preventing mastectomy skin flap necrosis in women undergoing immediate breast reconstruction following skin‐sparing mastectomy. 
To summarise the different ICGA protocols available for assessment of mastectomy skin flap perfusion in women undergoing immediate breast reconstructions following skin‐sparing mastectomy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 3, 2019), MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Clinicaltrials.gov in April 2019. In addition, we searched reference lists of published studies. 
Selection criteria
We included studies that compared the use of ICGA to clinical evaluation to assess mastectomy skin vascularisation and recruited women undergoing immediate autologous or prosthetic reconstructive surgery following SSM for confirmed breast malignancy or high risk of developing breast cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included nonrandomised studies and extracted data on postoperative outcomes, including postoperative MSFN, reoperation, autologous flap necrosis, dehiscence, infection, haematoma and seroma, and patient‐related outcomes. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach and we constructed two 'Summary of finding's tables: one for the comparison of ICGA to clinical evaluation on a per patient basis and one on a per breast basis. 
Main results
Nine nonrandomised cohort studies met the inclusion criteria and involved a total of 1589 women with 2199 breast reconstructions. We included seven retrospective and two prospective cohort studies. Six studies reported the number of MSFN on a per breast basis for a total of 1435 breasts and three studies reported the number of MSFN on a per patient basis for a total of 573 women. Five studies reported the number of other complications on a per breast basis for a total of 1370 breasts and four studies reported the number on a per patient basis for a total of 613 patients. Therefore, we decided to pool data separately. 
Risk of bias for each included nonrandomised study was assessed using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. There was serious concern with risk of bias due to the nonrandomised study design of all included studies and the low comparability of cohorts in most studies. The quality of the evidence was found to be very low, after downgrading the quality of evidence twice for imprecision based on the small sample sizes and low number of events in the included studies. 
Postoperative complications on a per patient basis 
We are uncertain about the effect of ICGA on MSFN (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.56; three studies, 573 participants: very low quality of evidence), infection rates (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.40; four studies, 613 participants: very low quality of evidence), haematoma rates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.53; two studies, 459 participants: very low quality of evidence) and seroma rates (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.41 to 6.80; two studies, 408 participants: very low quality of evidence) compared to the clinical group. We found evidence that ICGA may reduce reoperation rates (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.72; four studies, 613 participants: very low quality of evidence). One study considered dehiscence as an outcome. In this single study, dehiscence was observed in 2.2% of participants (4/184) in the ICGA group compared to 0.5% of participants (1/184) in the clinical group (P = 0.372). The RR was 4.00 (95% CI 0.45 to 35.45; one study; 368 participants; very low quality of evidence). 
Postoperative complications on a per breast basis 
We found evidence that ICGA may reduce MSFN (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.82; six studies, 1435 breasts: very low quality of evidence), may reduce reoperation rates (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.92; five studies, 1370 breasts: very low quality of evidence) and may reduce infection rates (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97; five studies, 1370 breasts: very low quality of evidence) compared to the clinical group. We are uncertain about the effect of ICGA on haematoma rates (RR 1.53, CI 95% 0.47 to 4.95; four studies, 1042 breasts: very low quality of evidence) and seroma rates (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.35; two studies, 528 breasts: very low quality of evidence). 
None of the studies reported patient‐related outcomes.
ICGA protocols: eight studies used the SPY System and one study used the Photodynamic Eye imaging system (PDE) to assess MSFN. ICGA protocols in the included studies were not extensively described in most studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Although mastectomy skin flap perfusion is performed more frequently using ICGA as a helpful tool, there is a lack of high‐quality evidence in the context of randomised controlled trials. The quality of evidence in this review is very low, since only nonrandomised cohort studies have been included. With the results from this review, no conclusions can be drawn about what method of assessment is best to use during breast reconstructive surgery. High‐quality randomised controlled studies that compare the use of ICGA to assess MSFN compared to clinical evaluation are needed. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Using a Special Camera to Check Blood Flow During Breast Reconstruction Surgery

## Plain Title
Can a special camera help prevent skin problems after breast reconstruction surgery?

## Rationale

**What is breast cancer and breast reconstruction?**

One in eight women will get breast cancer in their life. When doctors remove a breast because of cancer, they can rebuild it with surgery. This is called breast reconstruction. Doctors try to save as much skin as possible during this surgery.

**What is the problem?**

Sometimes the skin does not get enough blood flow after surgery. When this happens, the skin can die. Doctors call this skin flap necrosis. This is a common problem after breast reconstruction surgery. It can cause serious issues for patients.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors usually check the skin by looking at it during surgery. But they wanted to know if a special camera could work better. This camera uses a green dye and special light to show blood flow in the skin. The dye is called indocyanine green. The camera can show which areas of skin are not getting enough blood. If doctors see a problem, they can fix it right away during surgery.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if using this special camera works better than just looking at the skin. They hoped the camera could help prevent skin problems after surgery.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Researchers looked at nine different studies that other doctors had done. They combined the results from all these studies.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included 1,589 women. These women had 2,199 breast reconstruction surgeries. Some women had surgery on both breasts. All women had breast cancer or were at high risk of getting breast cancer.

**What did the studies compare?**

Some women had their skin checked with the special camera during surgery. Other women had their skin checked by doctors just looking at it. Then researchers compared what happened to both groups after surgery.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies followed women after their surgery. Different studies followed women for different amounts of time.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found that the quality of all nine studies was very low. This means we cannot be sure about the results. The studies were not designed in the best way. The groups of women were often very different from each other.

**Main findings about skin problems:**

When counting each breast separately, the camera may help reduce skin death. About 6 out of 10 breasts had less skin death with the camera compared to just looking. But we are not certain about this result.

When counting each woman separately, we are not sure if the camera helps prevent skin death.

**Main findings about other problems:**

When counting each breast separately:
- The camera may reduce the need for more surgery
- The camera may reduce infections
- We are not sure about other problems like bleeding or fluid buildup

When counting each woman separately:
- The camera may reduce the need for more surgery
- We are not sure about other problems

**What about patient experiences?**

None of the studies asked women about their experiences or quality of life.

**What cameras did doctors use?**

Most studies used a camera system called SPY. One study used a different system called PDE.

**What do these results mean?**

More doctors are using this special camera during surgery. But we do not have good proof that it works better than just looking at the skin. The studies done so far are not high quality. We need better studies to know for sure if the camera helps.

**What is needed next?**

Researchers need to do better studies. These studies should randomly assign women to get the camera or not. This would give us better answers about whether the camera really helps prevent skin problems after breast reconstruction surgery.",10.1002-14651858.CD013280,"Indocyanine green angiography versus clinical evaluation in preventing postoperative complications following breast reconstruction after mastectomy 
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out whether the use of a new imaging technique, called indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), during reconstructive breast surgery can reduce necrosis (cell death) of the overlying breast skin and other complications such as infections, following reconstructive breast surgery after mastectomy.  We included women who had undergone skin‐sparing mastectomy (that is, where the whole breast including nipple is removed, sparing the overlying breast skin) for breast cancer or women who were at high risk of developing breast cancer (because of faulty genes). We collected and analysed all relevant studies to provide a review that will inform doctors and patients on ICGA use in reconstructive breast surgery.  Key messages The use of ICGA during reconstructive breast surgery seems to reduce the chance of reoperations when compared to clinical evaluation only. We are uncertain about the effect of ICGA on reducing the chance of necrosis of the overlying breast skin and other post‐surgery complications when compared to clinical evaluation only. The quality of studies used for this review is very low, meaning that we are not confident of the results. We need high‐quality studies that have randomised women to a group of ICGA assessment or clinical evaluation alone to have a more definitive answer.  What was studied in the review? Around 40% of women with breast cancer need to undergo mastectomy (removal of the whole breast). A skin‐sparing mastectomy is a common operation in which the overlying breast skin is preserved. After skin‐sparing mastectomy, women have the option to undergo reconstructive breast surgery. This operation carries some risks and complications, including an operation to correct complications (reoperation), spontaneous reopening of the surgical wound (dehiscence), infection, blood pooling outside of a blood vessel (haematoma) and a pocket filled with blood plasma underneath the skin (seroma).  Preserving the blood supply of the overlying breast skin during skin‐sparing mastectomy is crucial. When the blood supply is poor, skin will not survive, and surgeons need to intervene to prevent postoperative complications. Usually, the surgeon will assess tissue colour, the time taken for colour to return to the skin after pressure is applied (capillary refill), temperature, skin’s elasticity, and bleeding of the skin.  ICGA is a new imaging technique that assesses the blood supply to the tissue. It can assess blood flow in the overlying breast skin better than clinical judgement alone. We collected studies that compared the use of ICGA to clinical evaluation by a surgeon during immediate reconstructive breast surgery after skin‐sparing mastectomy. In these studies, women underwent immediate reconstructive surgery with their own tissue from another area of the woman’s body or with a breast implant.  What are the main results of this review? We found nine studies that compared the number of postoperative complications in women who had ICGA assessment of their breast skin versus clinical evaluation. Six studies were performed in the USA, two in Denmark and one in Japan. There were a total 1589 women with 2199 breast reconstructions. Studies reported the number of complications on a per patient basis or on a per breast basis. We present information based on both types of data.  The main results on a per patient analysis were that: ‐ICGA may reduce reoperation rates, and ‐we are uncertain as to whether ICGA has an effect on necrosis of the overlying skin of the breast, infection, haematoma and seroma rates. 
The main results on a per breast basis were that: ‐ICGA may reduce necrosis of the overlying skin of the breast, reoperation and infection rates, and ‐we are uncertain as to whether ICGA has an effect on haematoma and seroma rates.  The evidence contributing to this review topic is considered to be very low quality. Since randomised controlled trials are found to be one of the most powerful methods in clinical research, it is a major downside that these studies are missing. We emphasise the need for randomised controlled trials to further investigate the use of ICGA in reconstructive breast surgery.  How up‐to‐date is this review? Studies published up to April 2019 have been used for this review.

Vaccines are effective in preventing severe COVID‐19, a disease for which few treatments are available and which can lead to disability or death. Widespread vaccination against COVID‐19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. In addition, new and vaccine‐resistant mutations of SARS‐CoV‐2 may be less likely to develop if the spread of COVID‐19 is limited. Different vaccines are now widely available in many settings. However, vaccine hesitancy is a serious threat to the goal of nationwide vaccination in many countries and poses a substantial threat to population health. This scoping review maps interventions aimed at increasing COVID‐19 vaccine uptake and decreasing COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy.  
Objectives
To scope the existing research landscape on interventions to enhance the willingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID‐19, increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy, and to map the evidence according to addressed populations and intervention categories.   
Search methods
We searched Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index), WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, PsycINFO, and CINAHL to 11 October 2021.  
Selection criteria
We included studies that assess the impact of interventions implemented to enhance the willingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID‐19, increase vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised studies of intervention (NRSIs), observational studies and case studies with more than 100 participants. Furthermore, we included systematic reviews and meta‐analyses. We did not limit the scope of the review to a specific population or to specific outcomes assessed. We excluded interventions addressing hesitancy towards vaccines for diseases other than COVID‐19. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were analysed according to a protocol uploaded to the Open Science Framework. We used an interactive scoping map to visualise the results of our scoping review. We mapped the identified interventions according to pre‐specified intervention categories, that were adapted to better fit the evidence. The intervention categories were: communication interventions, policy interventions, educational interventions, incentives (both financial and non‐financial), interventions to improve access, and multidimensional interventions. The study outcomes were also included in the mapping. Furthermore, we mapped the country in which the study was conducted, the addressed population, and whether the design was randomised‐controlled or not.  
Main results
We included 96 studies in the scoping review, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. We did not identify any relevant systematic reviews. For an overview, please see the interactive scoping map (https://tinyurl.com/2p9jmx24).   
Studies with published results 
Of the 61 studies with published results, 46 studies were RCTs and 15 NRSIs. The interventions investigated in the studies were heterogeneous with most studies testing communication strategies to enhance COVID‐19 vaccine uptake. Most studies assessed the willingness to get vaccinated as an outcome. The majority of studies were conducted in English‐speaking high‐income countries. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. Populations that were addressed were diverse. For example, studies targeted healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, at‐risk patients, or the general population.  
Ongoing studies 
Of the 35 ongoing studies, 29 studies are RCTs and six NRSIs. Educational and communication interventions were the most used types of interventions. The majority of ongoing studies plan to assess vaccine uptake as an outcome. Again, the majority of studies are being conducted in English‐speaking high‐income countries. In contrast to the studies with published results, most ongoing studies will not be conducted online. Addressed populations range from minority populations in the USA to healthcare workers or students. Eleven ongoing studies have estimated completion dates in 2022.   
Authors' conclusions
We were able to identify and map a variety of heterogeneous interventions for increasing COVID‐19 vaccine uptake or decreasing vaccine hesitancy. Our results demonstrate that this is an active field of research with 61 published studies and 35 studies still ongoing. This review gives a comprehensive overview of interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake and can be the foundation for subsequent systematic reviews on the effectiveness of interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake.  
A research gap was shown for studies conducted in low and middle‐income countries and studies investigating policy interventions and improved access, as well as for interventions addressing children and adolescents. As COVID‐19 vaccines become more widely available, these populations and interventions should not be neglected in research. 
","# Plain Language Summary

## Plain Title

A Review of Ways to Help More People Get COVID-19 Vaccines

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**

COVID-19 is a serious disease that can cause disability or death. Vaccines help prevent severe COVID-19. When many people get vaccinated, it protects others who cannot get the vaccine yet. It also helps stop new forms of the virus from developing.

**What is the challenge?**

Many people can now get COVID-19 vaccines. But some people are unsure about getting vaccinated. This is called ""vaccine hesitancy."" When many people refuse vaccines, it puts everyone's health at risk. This is a big problem in many countries.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to find all the different ways people have tried to help more people get COVID-19 vaccines. They wanted to see what methods were being tested. This would help them understand what works and what needs more research.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a scoping review. This means researchers looked at many other studies. They did not do tests on people themselves. Instead, they collected information from other research projects.

The researchers searched for studies until October 2021. They looked in many medical databases. They wanted to find studies about ways to increase COVID-19 vaccination.

**What studies did they include?**

They included different types of studies. Some studies tested one method against another. Other studies just watched what happened when people tried something new. They only included studies with more than 100 people.

**What did they look for?**

The researchers organized the studies into groups:
- Communication methods (how to talk to people about vaccines)
- Policy methods (rules and laws)
- Education methods (teaching people about vaccines)
- Rewards (money or other prizes)
- Making vaccines easier to get
- Methods that used several approaches together

They also noted which countries did the studies. They tracked what types of people were included. They recorded what results each study measured.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers found 96 studies total. Of these, 61 studies had finished and published results. Another 35 studies were still ongoing.

**Studies with results:**

Most studies tested communication strategies. These studies looked at different ways to talk to people about vaccines. Many studies measured whether people said they would get vaccinated. Most studies were done in English-speaking wealthy countries. Many studies were done online.

The studies looked at many different groups of people:
- Healthcare workers
- Ethnic minorities in the United States
- Students
- Soldiers
- People with health problems
- The general public

**Ongoing studies:**

Most ongoing studies also focus on education and communication. These studies plan to measure actual vaccine uptake. This means they will count how many people actually get vaccinated. Most of these studies will not be done online. Many will finish in 2022.

**What does this mean?**

The researchers found many different ways people are trying to increase vaccination. This is an active area of research. The review gives a complete picture of current efforts.

**What is missing?**

The researchers found some gaps. Not many studies were done in poorer countries. Few studies looked at policy changes or making vaccines easier to get. Not many studies focused on children and teenagers.

**What are the conclusions?**

This review maps out all the different approaches being tested. It can help other researchers plan future studies. It shows what methods need more research. As vaccines become available everywhere, researchers should study all populations and all types of methods. This will help ensure everyone who needs a vaccine can get one.",10.1002-14651858.CD015270,"Interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake 
Background 
Vaccines are effective in preventing death or severe illness from COVID‐19, a disease for which few treatments are available. Widespread vaccination against COVID‐19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. However, many people do not want to get vaccinated against COVID‐19. This can put them at increased risk of severe disease and death. 
What was our aim? 
We wanted to find out which interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake have been or are currently evaluated.  
Methods 
We searched medical databases and trial registries until the 11 of October 2021. We included all studies investigating interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake. We excluded studies looking at other vaccines, for example, measles. We included all forms of studies as long as they had more than 100 participants.  
Once we found the studies, we categorised the interventions into the following groups: communication interventions, policy interventions, interventions to improve access, educational interventions, incentives, and multidimensional interventions. We summarised the results in an interactive scoping map. Furthermore, we mapped the study outcomes, the country in which the study was conducted, the study population, and the study design. 
Results 
We included 96 studies in evidence mapping, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. The interventions tested in these studies are very diverse. Many studies used communication strategies to convince people to get vaccinated against COVID‐19.  Interventions that included information on vaccination or a mixture of different strategies were also often used.  
A majority of studies were conducted in English‐speaking countries of the global north, for example, the USA. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. The populations addressed varied across the studies. For example, studies addressed healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, villagers, at‐risk patients, or the general population.  
For an overview, please see the interactive scoping map (https://tinyurl.com/2p9jmx24).   
Conclusion 
We identified a large number of studies that investigate how COVID‐19 vaccine uptake might be increased. However, more studies are needed focusing on lower‐middle‐income countries and on children. Future research should compare the effectiveness of different interventions to improve COVID‐19 vaccine uptake.

275,10.1002-14651858.CD013512.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Keratoconus is the most common corneal dystrophy. It can cause loss of uncorrected and best‐corrected visual acuity through ectasia (thinning) of the central or paracentral cornea, irregular corneal scarring, or corneal perforation. Disease onset usually occurs in the second to fourth decade of life, periods of peak educational attainment or career development. The condition is lifelong and sight‐threatening. 
Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) using ultraviolet A (UVA) light applied to the cornea is the only treatment that has been shown to slow progression of disease. The original, more widely known technique involves application of UVA light to de‐epithelialized cornea, to which a photosensitizer (riboflavin) is added topically throughout the irradiation process. 
Transepithelial CXL is a recently advocated alternative to the standard CXL procedure, in that the epithelium is kept intact during CXL. Retention of the epithelium offers the putative advantages of faster healing, less patient discomfort, faster visual rehabilitation, and less risk of corneal haze. 
Objectives
To assess the short‐ and long‐term effectiveness and safety of transepithelial CXL compared with epithelium‐off CXL for progressive keratoconus. 
Search methods
To identify potentially eligible studies, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not impose any date or language restrictions. We last searched the electronic databases on 15 January 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which transepithelial CXL had been compared with epithelium‐off CXL in participants with progressive keratoconus. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology.
Main results
We included 13 studies with 661 eyes of 567 participants enrolled; 13 to 119 participants were enrolled per study. Seven studies were conducted in Europe, three in the Middle East, and one each in India, Russia, and Turkey. Seven studies were parallel‐group RCTs, one study was an RCT with a paired‐eyes design, and five studies were RCTs in which both eyes of some or all participants were assigned to the same intervention. 
Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL with epithelium‐off CXL in participants with progressive keratoconus. There was no evidence of an important difference between intervention groups in maximum keratometry (denoted 'maximum K' or 'Kmax'; also known as steepest keratometry measurement) at 12 months or later (mean difference (MD) 0.99 diopters (D), 95% CI −0.11 to 2.09; 5 studies; 177 eyes; I2 = 41%; very low certainty evidence). Few studies described other outcomes of interest. The evidence is very uncertain that epithelium‐off CXL may have a small (data from two studies were not pooled due to considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 92%)) or no effect on stabilization of progressive keratoconus compared with transepithelial CXL; comparison of the estimated proportions of eyes with decreases or increases of 2 or more diopters in maximum K at 12 months from one study with 61 eyes was RR 0.32 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.12) and RR (non‐event) 0.86 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.00), respectively (very low certainty). We did not estimate an overall effect on corrected‐distance visual acuity (CDVA) because substantial heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 70%). No study evaluated CDVA gain or loss of 10 or more letters on a logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) chart. Transepithelial CXL may result in little to no difference in CDVA at 12 months or beyond. Four studies reported that either no adverse events or no serious adverse events had been observed. Another study noted no change in endothelial cell count after either procedure. Moderate certainty evidence from 4 studies (221 eyes) found that epithelium‐off CXL resulted in a slight increase in corneal haze or scarring when compared to transepithelial CXL (RR (non‐event) 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14). 
Three studies, one of which had three arms, compared outcomes among participants assigned to transepithelial CXL using iontophoresis versus those assigned to epithelium‐off CXL. No conclusive evidence was found for either keratometry or visual acuity outcomes at 12 months or later after surgery. Low certainty evidence suggests that transepithelial CXL using iontophoresis results in no difference in logMAR CDVA (MD 0.00 letter, 95% CI −0.04 to 0.04; 2 studies; 51 eyes). Only one study examined gain or loss of 10 or more logMAR letters. In terms of adverse events, one case of subepithelial infiltrate was reported after transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis, whereas two cases of faint corneal scars and four cases of permanent haze were observed after epithelium‐off CXL. Vogt's striae were found in one eye after each intervention. The certainty of the evidence was low or very low for the outcomes in this comparison due to imprecision of estimates for all outcomes and risk of bias in the studies from which data have been reported. 
Authors' conclusions
Because of lack of precision, frequent indeterminate risk of bias due to inadequate reporting, and inconsistency in outcomes measured and reported among studies in this systematic review, it remains unknown whether transepithelial CXL, or any other approach, may confer an advantage over epithelium‐off CXL for patients with progressive keratoconus with respect to further progression of keratoconus, visual acuity outcomes, and patient‐reported outcomes (PROs). Arrest of the progression of keratoconus should be the primary outcome of interest in future trials of CXL, particularly when comparing the effectiveness of different approaches to CXL. Furthermore, methods of assessing and defining progressive keratoconus should be standardized. Trials with longer follow‐up are required in order to assure that outcomes are measured after corneal wound‐healing and stabilization of keratoconus. In addition, perioperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care should be standardized to permit meaningful comparisons of CXL methods. Methods to increase penetration of riboflavin through intact epithelium as well as delivery of increased dose of UVA may be needed to improve outcomes. PROs should be measured and reported. The visual significance of adverse outcomes, such as corneal haze, should be assessed and correlated with other outcomes, including PROs.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Ways to Treat Keratoconus

## Plain Title

Comparing two methods of corneal crosslinking treatment for people with keratoconus, a condition that causes the eye's clear front surface to thin and bulge

## Rationale

**What is keratoconus?**

Keratoconus is a common eye condition. The clear front part of the eye (called the cornea) becomes thin and bulges outward. This changes the cornea's shape. The condition usually starts when people are in their 20s or 30s. This is when many people are in school or starting their careers.

**What problems does keratoconus cause?**

Keratoconus makes it hard to see clearly. Even with glasses or contact lenses, vision may be blurry. The cornea can develop scars. In severe cases, the cornea can tear or develop a hole. The condition lasts a lifetime. It can threaten a person's sight.

**What is the current treatment?**

Corneal crosslinking (called CXL) is the only treatment that can slow down keratoconus. Doctors use a special light and a vitamin called riboflavin. The light and vitamin work together to make the cornea stronger.

**Why was this study needed?**

There are two main ways to do CXL. The standard method removes the thin outer layer of the cornea (called the epithelium). Then doctors apply the treatment. A newer method keeps this outer layer intact during treatment. This is called transepithelial CXL.

Keeping the outer layer might help patients heal faster. It might cause less pain. It might help vision recover more quickly. It might lower the risk of corneal clouding.

Researchers wanted to know which method works better and is safer.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 13 studies. These studies included 661 eyes from 567 people. Each study had between 13 and 119 people.

The studies took place in different countries. Seven were in Europe. Three were in the Middle East. One each was in India, Russia, and Turkey.

Most studies compared the two CXL methods in people with worsening keratoconus. Some studies treated both eyes of the same person. Others treated only one eye per person.

**Who was in the studies?**

All participants had keratoconus that was getting worse. The studies included both men and women. Ages varied but most were young to middle-aged adults.

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies followed patients for at least 12 months. Some studies followed patients longer.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not tell which method works better. Both methods seemed to work about the same.

**Cornea steepness:** After 12 months, both methods showed similar results. The cornea's steepness (measured in diopters) was about the same with both methods.

**Vision:** Both methods seemed to give similar vision results. Researchers could not combine all the study results because they were too different from each other.

**Safety:** Most studies found both methods were safe. A few problems were reported:
- The standard method (removing the outer layer) caused slightly more corneal clouding or scarring than the newer method.
- One study using a special technique (called iontophoresis) found a few cases of scars and permanent haze with the standard method.
- Overall, serious problems were rare with both methods.

**What are the limitations?**

The studies had several problems:
- Many studies were small.
- Studies measured different things in different ways.
- Some studies did not clearly explain their methods.
- Follow-up time may not have been long enough.

**What do the results mean?**

Researchers cannot say for certain which method is better. More research is needed. Future studies should:
- Use the same ways to measure if keratoconus is getting worse.
- Follow patients for longer periods.
- Ask patients about their experience and quality of life.
- Use standard methods for patient care before, during, and after treatment.

Both CXL methods appear safe. Both may help slow keratoconus. But doctors and patients need more information to choose the best method.",10.1002-14651858.CD013512,"What surgical procedure works best to slow the progression of keratoconus (an eye disease)? 
Why is this question important?Keratoconus is a disease that affects the thin, clear outer layer of the eye, known as the cornea. Normally, the cornea is dome‐shaped. In people with keratoconus, the cornea slowly thins, and a cone‐shaped bulge develops in the center of the cornea. The disease usually begins between the ages of teens and 40, and persists throughout life. It causes blurry or distorted vision that may not be improved by wearing glasses and may result in perforation of the cornea and other visual problems. 
Treatments such as glasses and contact lenses can be used to improve the vision of people with keratoconus. However, these do not slow the progression of the disease. The only treatment known to slow disease progression is ‘corneal collagen crosslinking’ (CXL). 
CXL is a surgical procedure that aims to strengthen the cornea and prevent further thinning. It involves shining ultraviolet A (invisible) light rays onto eyes that have been treated with eye drops containing riboflavin (a vitamin). When the light rays meet the riboflavin, new links form between the fibers that make up the cornea. 
There are two types of CXL. One type requires the removal of the cells on surface of the cornea, to make it easier for the riboflavin to reach the cornea. This procedure is called ‘epithelium‐off CXL’. The other type does not require the removal of these cells. This procedure is called ‘transepithelial CXL’. Surgeons who carry out this procedure can use chemicals to help riboflavin penetrate the cells on the surface of the cornea. They can also deliver riboflavin to the cornea using a small electrical current (iontophoresis). 
Epithelium‐off CXL is the more commonly used procedure. However, transepithelial CXL could have advantages, such as faster healing and less patient discomfort. We reviewed the evidence to find out which of these two procedures is more beneficial and less risky for people with keratoconus. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched the medical literature for studies that compared epithelium‐off CXL against transepithelial CXL. Then we compared the results and summarized the evidence from all the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find?We found 13 studies with a total of 567 people. The studies took place in Europe, the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The shortest studies lasted six months, and the longest study lasted more than three years. Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis against epithelium‐off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis against epithelium‐off CXL. 
Transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis compared to epithelium‐off CXL 
We do not know if one procedure is better than the other for preventing progression of keratoconus or visual loss because too few robust studies have compared the effects of these two CXL methods. 
Evidence from four studies suggests that corneal hazing (clouding of the cornea) or scarring are probably more common with epithelium‐off CXL. 
Transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis compared to epithelium‐off CXL 
Evidence from two studies suggests that there may be little to no difference between the two procedures in changes to vision clarity. We do not know if one procedure is better than the other to prevent progression of keratoconus because two few robust studies have compared the two methods. 
The evidence does not suggest that one procedure leads to more unwanted events than the other. However, our confidence in this evidence is low, because it is based on three studies that did not use robust methods. 
What does this mean?Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if epithelium‐off CXL or transepithelial CXL is better for slowing keratoconus progression. 
Adverse events such as corneal hazing or scarring are probably more common with epithelium‐off CXL than with transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis. 
We need more and larger studies to strengthen the evidence. These should compare the benefits and the risks of different CXL procedures. Studies should aim to follow patients for more than 12 months, so that long‐term effects can be compared as it can take at least that much time for corneal tissue to heal from any procedure.

Recruiting participants to trials can be extremely difficult. Identifying strategies that improve trial recruitment would benefit both trialists and health research. 
Objectives
To quantify the effects of strategies for improving recruitment of participants to randomised trials. A secondary objective is to assess the evidence for the effect of the research setting (e.g. primary care versus secondary care) on recruitment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Methodology Review Group Specialised Register (CMR) in the Cochrane Library (July 2012, searched 11 February 2015); MEDLINE and MEDLINE In Process (OVID) (1946 to 10 February 2015); Embase (OVID) (1996 to 2015 Week 06); Science Citation Index & Social Science Citation Index (ISI) (2009 to 11 February 2015) and ERIC (EBSCO) (2009 to 11 February 2015). 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials of methods to increase recruitment to randomised trials. This includes non‐healthcare studies and studies recruiting to hypothetical trials. We excluded studies aiming to increase response rates to questionnaires or trial retention and those evaluating incentives and disincentives for clinicians to recruit participants. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on: the method evaluated; country in which the study was carried out; nature of the population; nature of the study setting; nature of the study to be recruited into; randomisation or quasi‐randomisation method; and numbers and proportions in each intervention group. We used a risk difference to estimate the absolute improvement and the 95% confidence interval (CI) to describe the effect in individual trials. We assessed heterogeneity between trial results. We used GRADE to judge the certainty we had in the evidence coming from each comparison. 
Main results
We identified 68 eligible trials (24 new to this update) with more than 74,000 participants. There were 63 studies involving interventions aimed directly at trial participants, while five evaluated interventions aimed at people recruiting participants. All studies were in health care. 
We found 72 comparisons, but just three are supported by high‐certainty evidence according to GRADE. 
1. Open trials rather than blinded, placebo trials. The absolute improvement was 10% (95% CI 7% to 13%). 
2. Telephone reminders to people who do not respond to a postal invitation. The absolute improvement was 6% (95% CI 3% to 9%). This result applies to trials that have low underlying recruitment. We are less certain for trials that start out with moderately good recruitment (i.e. over 10%). 
3. Using a particular, bespoke, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets. This method involved spending a lot of time working with the target population for recruitment to decide on the content, format and appearance of the participant information leaflet. This made little or no difference to recruitment: absolute improvement was 1% (95% CI −1% to 3%). 
We had moderate‐certainty evidence for eight other comparisons; our confidence was reduced for most of these because the results came from a single study. Three of the methods were changes to trial management, three were changes to how potential participants received information, one was aimed at recruiters, and the last was a test of financial incentives. All of these comparisons would benefit from other researchers replicating the evaluation. There were no evaluations in paediatric trials. 
We had much less confidence in the other 61 comparisons because the studies had design flaws, were single studies, had very uncertain results or were hypothetical (mock) trials rather than real ones. 
Authors' conclusions
The literature on interventions to improve recruitment to trials has plenty of variety but little depth. Only 3 of 72 comparisons are supported by high‐certainty evidence according to GRADE: having an open trial and using telephone reminders to non‐responders to postal interventions both increase recruitment; a specialised way of developing participant information leaflets had little or no effect. The methodology research community should improve the evidence base by replicating evaluations of existing strategies, rather than developing and testing new ones.

## Plain Title
Testing Different Ways to Get More People to Join Medical Research Studies

## Rationale

**What is the problem?**
Medical research studies need people to join them. These people are called participants. But getting enough people to join studies is very hard. This is a big problem for researchers.

**Why does this matter?**
When studies cannot find enough people to join, they may not finish. Or they may take much longer. This means we learn less about new treatments. Patients who could benefit may have to wait longer for better care.

**What did researchers want to find out?**
The researchers wanted to know: What methods work best to get more people to join medical studies? They looked at many different ways that had been tested. They wanted to see which ones really helped.

**Why is this important?**
If we know what works, researchers can use these methods. Then more studies can finish on time. This helps us learn about new treatments faster. It helps patients get better care sooner.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers do this study?**
The researchers looked for all studies that tested ways to get more people to join medical research. They searched many databases. These are like large libraries of medical studies. They looked at studies from 1946 to 2015.

**What did they look for?**
They only included certain types of studies. The studies had to test real methods. The studies had to compare one method against another method or against doing nothing special.

**What did they find?**
They found 68 studies. These studies included more than 74,000 people in total. Most studies (63 out of 68) tested methods aimed at the people who might join. Five studies tested methods aimed at the people doing the recruiting.

**What types of methods were tested?**
Many different methods were tested. Some changed how information was given to people. Some changed how people were contacted. Some changed how the study itself was set up. In total, 72 different comparisons were made.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**
The researchers found that most methods have not been tested enough. Out of 72 different methods tested, only 3 had strong proof that they work or do not work.

**What methods have strong proof?**

*Method 1: Open studies work better than blind studies*
In open studies, everyone knows what treatment they get. In blind studies, people do not know. Open studies got 10 more people out of every 100 to join. This was compared to blind studies.

*Method 2: Phone calls help*
When people do not respond to a letter, calling them on the phone helps. Phone calls got 6 more people out of every 100 to join. This works best when very few people are joining at first.

*Method 3: Special way of making information sheets*
One special method for making information sheets was tested. This method took a lot of time. It worked closely with the type of people the study wanted to recruit. But this method did not help get more people to join. It made almost no difference.

**What other methods might work?**
Eight other methods showed some promise. But each needs more testing. These included:
- Changes to how studies are run
- Changes to how information is given
- Methods aimed at the people doing the recruiting
- Offering money to participants

**What did not have good proof?**
The other 61 methods tested did not have good proof. Some were only tested once. Some had unclear results. Some were not tested in real studies.

**What does this mean?**
We need more research. Researchers should test the same methods again. This is better than always testing new methods. When methods are tested many times, we can be more sure they work.

**Important note**
No methods were tested in studies with children. This is a gap that needs to be filled.

**Final conclusion**
We now know a few things that work to get more people to join studies. But we need to know much more. Future research should focus on testing methods multiple times. This will give us stronger proof about what really works.",10.1002-14651858.MR000013,"What improves trial recruitment?
Key messages 
We had high‐certainty evidence for three methods to improve recruitment, two of which are effective: 
1. Telling people what they are receiving in the trial rather than not telling them improves recruitment. 
2. Phoning people who do not respond to a postal invitation is also effective (although we are not certain this works as well in all trials). 
3. Using a tailored, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets makes little or no difference to recruitment. 
Of the 72 strategies tested, only 7 involved more than one study. We need more studies to understand whether they work or not. 
Our question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of things trial teams do to try and improve recruitment to their trials. We found 68 studies involving more than 74,000 people. 
Background 
Finding participants for trials can be difficult, and trial teams try many things to improve recruitment. It is important to know whether these actually work. Our review looked for studies that examined this question using chance to allocate people to different recruitment strategies because this is the fairest way of seeing if one approach is better than another. 
Key results 
We found 68 studies including 72 comparisons. We have high certainty in what we found for only three of these. 
1. Telling people what they are receiving in the trial rather than not telling them improves recruitment. Our best estimate is that if 100 people were told what they were receiving in a randomised trial, and 100 people were not, 10 more would take part n the group who knew. There is some uncertainty though: it could be as few as 7 more per hundred, or as many as 13 more. 
2. Phoning people who do not respond to a postal invitation to take part is also effective. Our best estimate is that if investigators called 100 people who did not respond to a postal invitation, and did not call 100 others, 6 more would take part in the trial among the group who received a call. However, this number could be as few as 3 more per hundred, or as many as 9 more. 
3. Using a tailored, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets did not make much difference. The researchers who tested this method spent a lot of time working with people like those to be recruited to decide what should be in the participant information leaflet and what it should look like. Our best estimate is that if 100 people got the new leaflet, 1 more would take part in the trial compared to 100 who got the old leaflet. However, there is some uncertainty, and it could be 1 fewer (i.e. worse than the old leaflet) per hundred, or as many as 3 more. 
We had moderate certainty in what we found for eight other comparisons; our confidence was reduced for most of these because the method had been tested in only one study. We had much less confidence in the other 61 comparisons because the studies had design flaws, were the only studies to look at a particular method, had a very uncertain result or were mock trials rather than real ones. 
Study characteristics 
The 68 included studies covered a very wide range of disease areas, including antenatal care, cancer, home safety, hypertension, podiatry, smoking cessation and surgery. Primary, secondary and community care were included. The size of the studies ranged from 15 to 14,467 participants. Studies came from 12 countries; there was also one multinational study involving 19 countries. The USA and UK dominated with 25 and 22 studies, respectively. The next largest contribution came from Australia with eight studies. 
The small print 
Our search updated our 2010 review and is current to February 2015. We also identified six studies published after 2015 outside the search. The review includes 24 mock trials where the researchers asked people about whether they would take part in an imaginary trial. We have not presented or discussed their results because it is hard to see how the findings relate to real trial decisions.

Bottom line 
The available evidence suggests that a course of acupuncture consisting of at least six treatment sessions can be a valuable option for people with migraine. 
Background 
Individuals with migraine have repeated attacks of severe headache, usually just on one side and often with vomiting. Acupuncture is a therapy in which thin needles are inserted into the skin at particular points. It originated in China, and is now used in many countries to treat people with migraine. We evaluated whether acupuncture reduces the number of episodes of migraine. We looked at the number of people in whom the number of migraine days per month was reduced by half or more than half. 
Key results 
For this update, we reviewed 22 trials with 4985 people, published up to January 2016. We omitted five trials from the original review because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months. We included five new trials in this update. 
In four trials, acupuncture added to usual care or treatment of migraine on onset only (usually with pain‐killers) resulted in 41 in 100 people having the frequency of headaches at least halved, compared to 17 of 100 people given usual care only. 
In 15 trials, acupuncture was compared with 'fake' acupuncture, where needles are inserted at incorrect points or do not penetrate the skin. The frequency of headaches halved in 50 of 100 people receiving true acupuncture, compared with 41 of 100 people receiving 'fake' acupuncture. The results were dominated by three good quality large trials (with about 1200 people) showing that the effect of true acupuncture was still present after six months. There were no differences in the number of side effects of real and 'fake' acupuncture, or the numbers dropping out because of side effects. 
In five trials, acupuncture was compared to a drug proven to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, but only three trials provided useful information. At three months, headache frequency halved in 57 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 46 of 100 people taking the drug. After six months, headache frequency halved in 59 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 54 of 100 people taking the drug. People receiving acupuncture reported side effects less often than people receiving drugs, and were less likely to drop out of the trial. 
Our findings about the number of days with migraine per month can be summarized as follows. If people have six days with migraine per month on average before starting treatment, this would be reduced to five days in people receiving only usual care, to four days in those receiving fake acupuncture or a prophylactic drug, and to three and a half days in those receiving true acupuncture.

","# Plain Language Summary: Acupuncture for Preventing Migraine Attacks

## Plain Title
Does Acupuncture Help Prevent Migraine Headaches?

## Rationale

**What is migraine?**
Migraine causes very bad headaches that come back again and again. The pain is usually on just one side of the head. Many people also feel sick and throw up during a migraine attack. These attacks can make it hard to work, spend time with family, or do daily tasks.

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors want to find safe ways to help people have fewer migraine attacks. Acupuncture is a treatment where thin needles are placed into the skin at certain points on the body. It started in China many years ago. Today, doctors in many countries use acupuncture to treat migraine.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to know if acupuncture could reduce how often people get migraines. They looked at how many people had their migraine days cut in half or more after getting acupuncture treatment.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at 22 different studies. These studies included 4,985 people total. The studies were done up to January 2016.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included adults who had migraine attacks for at least 12 months.

**What did researchers compare?**
The researchers looked at three main comparisons:
- Acupuncture plus usual care compared to usual care alone
- Real acupuncture compared to fake acupuncture
- Acupuncture compared to migraine prevention drugs

**What is fake acupuncture?**
In fake acupuncture, needles are put in the wrong places on the body. Or the needles do not go through the skin. This helps researchers know if real acupuncture works better.

**How long did treatment last?**
People received at least six acupuncture sessions. Researchers checked results after three months and six months.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**Acupuncture plus usual care:**
Out of 100 people getting acupuncture plus usual care, 41 people had their migraine days cut in half. Out of 100 people getting only usual care, 17 people had their migraine days cut in half.

**Real acupuncture compared to fake acupuncture:**
Out of 100 people getting real acupuncture, 50 people had their migraine days cut in half. Out of 100 people getting fake acupuncture, 41 people had their migraine days cut in half. Three large, good quality studies showed that real acupuncture still worked after six months.

**Acupuncture compared to drugs:**
After three months, out of 100 people getting acupuncture, 57 people had their migraine days cut in half. Out of 100 people taking drugs, 46 people had their migraine days cut in half.

After six months, out of 100 people getting acupuncture, 59 people had their migraine days cut in half. Out of 100 people taking drugs, 54 people had their migraine days cut in half.

**Side effects:**
People getting acupuncture had fewer side effects than people taking drugs. Fewer people stopped treatment because of side effects with acupuncture.

**What does this mean for migraine days?**
Imagine someone has six days with migraine each month before treatment:
- With usual care only: five days with migraine
- With fake acupuncture or drugs: four days with migraine
- With real acupuncture: three and a half days with migraine

**What did researchers conclude?**
Acupuncture with at least six treatment sessions can be a good choice for people with migraine. It helps reduce how often migraines happen. It works as well as or better than drugs. It causes fewer side effects than drugs.

**Quality of the evidence:**
The quality of the evidence was moderate overall. This means we can be fairly confident in these results.",10.1002-14651858.CD001218,"Acupuncture for preventing migraine attacks

278,10.1002-14651858.CD013240.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Endometriosis is known to have an impact on fertility and it is common for women affected by endometriosis to require fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), to improve the chance of pregnancy. It has been postulated that long‐term gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy prior to IVF or ICSI can improve pregnancy outcomes. This systematic review supersedes the previous Cochrane Review on this topic (Sallam 2006). 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of long‐term gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy (minimum 3 months) versus no pretreatment or other pretreatment modalities, such as long‐term continuous combined oral contraception (COC) or surgical therapy of endometrioma, before standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women with endometriosis. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases from their inception to 8 January 2019: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL via the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Studies ONLINE (CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We searched trial registries to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We also searched DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), Web of Knowledge, OpenGrey, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), PubMed, Google and reference lists from relevant papers for any other relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving women with surgically diagnosed endometriosis that compared use of any type of GnRH agonist for at least three months before an IVF/ICSI protocol to no pretreatment or other pretreatment modalities, specifically use of long‐term continuous COC (minimum of 6 weeks) or surgical excision of endometrioma within six months prior to standard IVF/ICSI. The primary outcomes were live birth rate and complication rate per woman randomised. 
Data collection and analysis
Two independent review authors assessed studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third review author was consulted, if required. We contacted the study authors, as required. We analysed dichotomous outcomes using Mantel‐Haenszel risk ratios (RRs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and a fixed‐effect model. For small numbers of events, we used a Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI instead. We analysed continuous outcomes using the mean difference (MD) between groups and presented with 95% CIs. We studied heterogeneity of the studies via the I2 statistic. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. 
Main results
We included eight parallel‐design RCTs, involving a total of 640 participants. We did not assess any of the studies as being at low risk of bias across all domains, with the main limitation being lack of blinding. Using GRADE methodology, the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to low quality. 
Long‐term GnRH agonist therapy versus no pretreatment 
We are uncertain whether long‐term GnRH agonist therapy affects the live birth rate (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.87; 1 RCT, n = 147; I2 not calculable; very low‐quality evidence) or the overall complication rate (Peto OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.37; to 4.14; 3 RCTs, n = 318; I2 = 73%; very low‐quality evidence) compared to standard IVF/ICSI. Further, we are uncertain whether this intervention affects the clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.41; 6 RCTs, n = 552, I2 = 66%; very low‐quality evidence), multiple pregnancy rate (Peto OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.56; 2 RCTs, n = 208, I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence), miscarriage rate (Peto OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.00; 2 RCTs, n = 208; I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence), mean number of oocytes (MD 0.72, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.38; 4 RCTs, n = 385; I2 = 81%; very low‐quality evidence) or mean number of embryos (MD ‐0.76, 95% CI ‐1.33 to ‐0.19; 2 RCTs, n = 267; I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). 
Long‐term GnRH agonist therapy versus long‐term continuous COC 
No studies reported on this comparison.
Long‐term GnRH agonist therapy versus surgical therapy of endometrioma 
No studies reported on this comparison.
Authors' conclusions
This review raises important questions regarding the merit of long‐term GnRH agonist therapy compared to no pretreatment prior to standard IVF/ICSI in women with endometriosis. Contrary to previous findings, we are uncertain as to whether long‐term GnRH agonist therapy impacts on the live birth rate or indeed the complication rate compared to standard IVF/ICSI. Further, we are uncertain whether this intervention impacts on the clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, mean number of oocytes and mean number of embryos. In light of the paucity and very low quality of existing data, particularly for the primary outcomes examined, further high‐quality trials are required to definitively determine the impact of long‐term GnRH agonist therapy on IVF/ICSI outcomes, not only compared to no pretreatment, but also compared to other proposed alternatives to endometriosis management.

Does Long-Term Hormone Treatment Before IVF Help Women with Endometriosis Get Pregnant?

## Rationale

**What is endometriosis and why does it matter?**

Endometriosis is a health problem in women. Tissue that normally lines the inside of the womb grows outside the womb. This can cause pain and make it hard to get pregnant.

**Why is this a problem for patients?**

Many women with endometriosis have trouble getting pregnant naturally. They often need help from fertility treatments. Two common treatments are IVF and ICSI. IVF stands for in vitro fertilization. ICSI stands for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Both help create a pregnancy in a lab setting.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Doctors thought that giving women a special hormone drug before IVF might help. This drug is called a GnRH agonist. It changes hormone levels in the body. Researchers wanted to know if taking this drug for at least 3 months before IVF would help more women have babies.

**Why do this study?**

Women with endometriosis need better ways to get pregnant. If this hormone treatment works, it could help many women have babies. Doctors needed to know if this treatment really helps or not.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Researchers looked at 8 different studies done by other scientists. They combined the results from all these studies. This type of review helps show what really works.

**Who was in these studies?**

All studies included women who had endometriosis. Doctors had confirmed their endometriosis through surgery. A total of 640 women took part across all 8 studies. All women were trying to get pregnant using IVF or ICSI.

**What did the studies compare?**

The studies compared two groups of women:
- One group took GnRH agonist hormone drugs for at least 3 months before IVF
- The other group went straight to IVF without this treatment

**How long did the studies last?**

Women took the hormone treatment for at least 3 months. Then they went through IVF treatment. Researchers followed them to see if they got pregnant and had babies.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers could not be sure if the hormone treatment helped or not. The quality of the studies was very low. This means the results may not be reliable.

**Main findings:**

The studies looked at whether women had live births. They also looked at problems or side effects. The hormone treatment might have made live births less likely in one study. But the researchers say they cannot be certain about this finding.

The studies also looked at other outcomes:
- Whether women got pregnant
- Whether women had twins or triplets
- Whether women had miscarriages
- How many eggs doctors collected
- How many embryos formed

For all these outcomes, researchers could not be sure if the hormone treatment made a difference.

**What does this mean?**

The old belief was that this hormone treatment helped women with endometriosis get pregnant. But this review shows we cannot be sure about that. The studies were not good enough quality. There were not enough women in the studies.

**What do doctors need to do next?**

Doctors need to do better studies. These studies need more women. They need better methods. Only then can we know if this hormone treatment really helps women with endometriosis have babies.

**Important note:**

No studies compared the hormone treatment to other options. These options include birth control pills or surgery. More research is needed on these comparisons too.

**Bottom line:**

We do not know if long-term hormone treatment before IVF helps women with endometriosis. Better studies are needed to answer this question.",10.1002-14651858.CD013240,"Long‐term pituitary down‐regulation before in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for women with endometriosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the efficacy and safety of treating women with known endometriosis (a disease characterised by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the cavity of the womb) with gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist medication for a period of three to six months prior to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We aimed to compare this intervention to no treatment prior to IVF/ICSI, pretreatment with long‐term continuous combined oral contraception (COC) or surgical treatment to remove endometriomas (cysts forming in the ovaries as a consequence of endometriosis). 
Background 
Many women affected by endometriosis suffer with infertility and may, as a result, seek IVF/ICSI treatment. IVF/ICSI is known to be less successful in women with endometriosis and a variety of interventions prior to IVF/ICSI have been proposed to try and improve outcomes. These include long‐term GnRH agonist therapy, long‐term continuous COC therapy or surgery to remove endometriomas. 
Study characteristics 
We found eight randomised controlled trials comparing long‐term GnRH agonist therapy with no pretreatment including a total of 640 women with endometriosis prior to IVF/ICSI. The evidence is current to January 2019. 
Key results 
Compared to no pretreatment, we are uncertain whether long‐term GnRH agonist therapy prior to IVF/ICSI in women with endometriosis affects the live birth rate. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth rate is assumed to be 36% with no pretreatment, the chance following long‐term GnRH agonist therapy would be between 9% and 31%. We are also uncertain whether this intervention affects complication rate, clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, mean number of oocytes and mean number of embryos. No studies compared long‐term GnRH agonist therapy to long‐term continuous COC therapy or surgery to remove endometriomas. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low quality. The main limitations in the evidence were lack of blinding (the process where the women participating in the trial, as well as the research staff, are not aware of the intervention used), inconsistency (differences between different studies) and imprecision (random error and small size of each study).

Some observational studies also suggest that antioxidant supplements may prolong life, whereas other observational studies demonstrate neutral or harmful effects.

The present systematic review included 78 randomised clinical trials. In total, 296,707 participants were randomised to antioxidant supplements (beta‐carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium) versus placebo or no intervention. Twenty‐six trials included 215,900 healthy participants.

When all of the trials were combined, antioxidants may or may not have increased mortality depending on which statistical combination method was employed; the analysis that is typically used when similarity is present demonstrated that antioxidant use did slightly increase mortality (that is, the patients consuming the antioxidants were 1.03 times as likely to die as were the controls). When analyses were done to identify factors that were associated with this finding, the two factors identified were better methodology to prevent bias from being a factor in the trial (trials with ‘low risk of bias’) and the use of vitamin A. In fact, when the trials with low risks of bias were considered separately, the increased mortality was even more pronounced (1.04 times as likely to die as were the controls). The potential damage from vitamin A disappeared when only the low risks of bias trials were considered. The increased risk of mortality was associated with beta‐carotene and possibly vitamin E and vitamin A, but was not associated with the use of vitamin C or selenium. The current evidence does not support the use of antioxidant supplements in the general population or in patients with various diseases.

## Plain Title
Do Antioxidant Vitamin Pills Help People Live Longer?

## Rationale

**What are antioxidants?**
Antioxidants are substances found in some vitamins and minerals. They help protect cells in the body from damage. Some people take antioxidant pills as supplements. Common antioxidant supplements include vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and selenium.

**Why did researchers study antioxidants?**
Some studies in animals suggested that antioxidant pills might help people live longer. Some studies in people also showed possible benefits. However, other studies showed no benefits or even harm. An earlier review from 2008 found that antioxidant pills might actually increase the risk of death. Researchers needed to update this review with new information.

**What did researchers want to learn?**
Researchers wanted to find out if taking antioxidant pills helps people live longer. They also wanted to know if these pills are safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a systematic review. Researchers looked at 78 different studies that had already been done. They combined the results to see the overall effect.

**Who was in these studies?**
A total of 296,707 people took part in these studies. Some people took antioxidant pills. Other people took placebo pills or no pills at all. A placebo is a pill with no active medicine in it.

The studies included two main groups:
- 26 studies had 215,900 healthy people
- 52 studies had 80,807 people with various health problems

The health problems included stomach and gut diseases, heart diseases, brain diseases, eye diseases, skin diseases, joint diseases, kidney diseases, and hormone diseases.

**What did people take?**
People took one or more of these antioxidants:
- Beta-carotene
- Vitamin A
- Vitamin C
- Vitamin E
- Selenium

## Results

**What happened in these studies?**
Out of 183,749 people who took antioxidant pills, 21,484 people died. That is about 12 out of every 100 people.

Out of 112,958 people who took placebo or no pills, 11,479 people died. That is about 10 out of every 100 people.

**What did the results show?**
When researchers combined all the studies, they found that antioxidant pills may slightly increase the risk of death. People taking antioxidants were 1.03 times as likely to die compared to people not taking them.

The results were stronger in studies that were done very carefully. In these high-quality studies, people taking antioxidants were 1.04 times as likely to die.

**Which antioxidants caused problems?**
The increased risk of death was linked to:
- Beta-carotene
- Possibly vitamin E
- Possibly vitamin A

Vitamin C and selenium did not increase the risk of death.

**What do these results mean?**
The evidence does not support taking antioxidant pills. This applies to both healthy people and people with diseases.

Taking antioxidant pills does not help people live longer. In fact, some antioxidant pills may slightly increase the risk of death.

**What should people do?**
Based on this research, people should not take antioxidant supplements expecting to live longer or stay healthier. It is better to get vitamins and minerals from eating healthy foods rather than from pills.

People who are already taking antioxidant supplements should talk to their doctor before stopping them.",10.1002-14651858.CD007176,"Antioxidant supplements for prevention of mortality in healthy participants and patients with various diseases 
Previous research on animal and physiological models suggests that antioxidant supplements have beneficial effects that may prolong life. Some observational studies also suggest that antioxidant supplements may prolong life, whereas other observational studies demonstrate neutral or harmful effects. Our Cochrane review from 2008 demonstrated that antioxidant supplements seem to increase mortality. This review is now updated. 
The present systematic review included 78 randomised clinical trials. In total, 296,707 participants were randomised to antioxidant supplements (beta‐carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium) versus placebo or no intervention. Twenty‐six trials included 215,900 healthy participants. Fifty‐two trials included 80,807 participants with various diseases in a stable phase (including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurological, ocular, dermatological, rheumatoid, renal, endocrinological, or unspecified diseases). A total of 21,484 of 183,749 participants (11.7%) randomised to antioxidant supplements and 11,479 of 112,958 participants (10.2%) randomised to placebo or no intervention died.

Physicians often prescribe opioids for pain in the acute care setting. Nausea and vomiting are well‐described adverse events, occurring in over one‐third of patients. Prophylactic antiemetics may be one option to reduce opioid‐associated nausea and vomiting. However, these medications also have their own adverse effects, so it is important to understand their efficacy and safety prior to routine use. This is a review of randomized controlled trials comparing prophylactic antiemetics versus placebo or standard care for preventing opioid‐associated nausea and vomiting. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of prophylactic antiemetics for nausea and vomiting in adults (aged 16 years or older) receiving intravenous opioids in the acute care setting. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID) from inception to January 2022, and Google Scholar (17 January 2022). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and screened reference lists. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials of prophylactic antiemetics versus placebo or standard care in adults prior to receiving an intravenous opioid. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (MG, JNC) independently determined the eligibility of each study according to the inclusion criteria. Two review authors (MG, GDP) then independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and determined the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were the occurrence of nausea, vomiting, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included nausea severity, number of vomiting episodes, and number of participants requiring antiemetic rescue therapy. We presented outcomes as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data (e.g. presence of vomiting, presence of nausea, number of participants requiring rescue medication, adverse events) and mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference for continuous data (e.g. number of vomiting episodes, nausea severity) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We included three studies involving 527 participants (187 women and 340 men) with a mean age of 42 years.  All studies used intravenous metoclopramide (10 mg) as the intervention and a placebo for the comparator. No studies assessed any other antiemetic or compared the intervention to standard care. 
Compared to placebo, metoclopramide did not reduce vomiting (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.26 to 5.32; low‐certainty evidence) or nausea (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.15 to 2.03; low‐certainty evidence) and there was no difference in adverse events (RR 2.34, 95% CI 0.47 to 11.61; low‐certainty evidence).  No data were available regarding the number of vomiting episodes. Metoclopramide did reduce the severity of nausea compared with placebo (MD −0.49, 95% CI −0.75 to −0.23; low‐certainty evidence) but did not reduce the need for rescue medication (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.17 to 20.16; low‐certainty evidence).  
Two studies were at unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation, one for blinding of outcome assessors, one for incomplete outcome data, and two for selective reporting. The studies were at low risk of bias for all remaining components. 
Authors' conclusions
There was no evidence that prophylactic metoclopramide affected the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for rescue medication when provided prior to intravenous opioids in the acute care setting. There was a clinically insignificant difference in nausea severity when comparing prophylactic metoclopramide with placebo. Overall, the evidence was of low certainty. Future research could better delineate the effects of prophylactic antiemetics on specific populations, and new studies are needed to evaluate the use of other prophylactic antiemetic agents, for which there were no data. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Preventing Nausea and Vomiting from Pain Medicines Given Through an IV

## Plain Title

Does giving anti-nausea medicine before strong pain medicine prevent nausea and vomiting in adults?

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Doctors often give strong pain medicines called opioids through an IV (a tube in the vein). These medicines work well for pain. But they cause nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and vomiting (throwing up) in more than 1 out of 3 patients. This is a common problem that makes patients feel worse.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if giving anti-nausea medicine before the pain medicine could stop nausea and vomiting from happening. They thought giving this medicine early might prevent these problems.

**Why was this study needed?**

Anti-nausea medicines can help, but they also have their own side effects. Doctors need to know if these medicines really work and are safe before giving them to all patients. This study looked at all the research done on this topic to find the answer.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review study. Researchers looked at all past studies on this topic. They searched medical databases from the beginning of records through January 2022.

**Who was in the studies?**

The researchers found 3 studies with 527 adults. There were 187 women and 340 men. The average age was 42 years old. All patients were getting pain medicine through an IV in a hospital or emergency room.

**What medicine was tested?**

All 3 studies tested the same anti-nausea medicine called metoclopramide. Patients got 10 mg through an IV. Some patients got the real medicine. Other patients got a placebo (a fake medicine with no active drug). No studies looked at other anti-nausea medicines.

**How long were patients in the studies?**

The studies followed patients during their time in the acute care setting (emergency room or hospital).

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The anti-nausea medicine did not work well. Here is what researchers found:

- **Vomiting:** The medicine did not reduce vomiting compared to placebo.

- **Nausea:** The medicine did not reduce how many people felt nauseous.

- **Side effects:** There was no difference in side effects between the medicine and placebo.

- **Nausea severity:** The medicine did reduce how bad the nausea felt by a small amount. But this difference was so small it probably did not matter to patients.

- **Rescue medicine:** The medicine did not reduce how many people needed extra anti-nausea medicine later.

**How sure are we about these results?**

The researchers rated the quality of evidence as low. This means we cannot be very sure about the results. The studies had some problems with how they were done.

**What do these results mean?**

Giving metoclopramide before IV pain medicine does not prevent nausea or vomiting. It does not reduce side effects. It does not reduce the need for more medicine later. The small reduction in nausea severity was too small to help patients in a meaningful way.

**What happens next?**

More research is needed. Future studies should:
- Test other anti-nausea medicines
- Look at different groups of patients
- Use better study methods

Right now, doctors should not routinely give metoclopramide to all patients before IV pain medicine. There is not enough proof that it helps.",10.1002-14651858.CD013860,"Prophylactic antiemetics for adults receiving intravenous opioids in the acute care setting 
Key messages 
Metoclopramide did not reduce the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for rescue medication when provided prior to intravenous opioids in the emergency department.  
In terms of the severity of nausea, metoclopramide did not help patients any more than placebo (sham treatment). 
What is opioid‐induced emesis? 
Physicians often give patients opioids for pain in emergency departments, but over a third experience the side effects of nausea and vomiting (emesis). Some experts have suggested that taking antiemetics before receiving the opioid (that is, as a prophylactic) could prevent these symptoms from occurring. However, these medications have their own side effects, so it is important to understand whether they are effective and safe before routinely using them. 
What did we want to find out? 
This review looks at whether taking antiemetics (medications to treat or prevent nausea and vomiting) before receiving an intravenous opioid reduces the risk of experiencing nausea and vomiting as side effects. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies involving adults (aged 16 years or older) who received prophylactic antiemetics compared with either placebo or standard care before receiving an intravenous opioid. 
What did we find? 
We found three studies with a total of 527 patients. All the studies used metoclopramide as the antiemetic. Compared with placebo, metoclopramide did not reduce the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for an antiemetic later on. There was also no difference in side effects between those who received antiemetics and those who did not. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The studies investigated only one medication (metoclopramide) and did not report all the information we were interested in. The intervention probably makes little or no difference in terms of experiencing nausea or vomiting. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
This evidence is up to date to 17 January 2022.

## Plain Title
Can Patients Track Their Own Health After Gynecological Cancer Treatment Instead of Regular Hospital Visits?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
Cancer is one of the main causes of death around the world. Gynecological cancer affects a woman's reproductive organs.

**What happens after treatment?**
After cancer treatment ends, women usually go to the hospital many times for check-ups. Doctors look to see if the cancer has come back. These visits can make patients feel worried. They also cost a lot of money. Doctors and patients have asked if there might be a better way to do follow-up care.

**What is the new approach being studied?**
Most times when cancer comes back, patients notice symptoms themselves. This means patients might be able to track their own health at home. They could report how they feel using questionnaires or forms. These are called patient-reported outcome measures, or PROMs for short. PROMs let patients tell doctors about their health and how they feel without coming to the hospital.

**Why study this approach?**
Using PROMs instead of hospital visits might help patients feel less anxious. It might also save money for the healthcare system. But right now, we do not know if PROMs work as well as regular hospital visits. We need to find out if women live just as long and feel just as good using PROMs. We also need to know if patients are happy with this approach.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
The researchers looked for studies that tested PROMs. They wanted to find studies that compared PROMs to regular hospital follow-up visits. They searched medical databases for high-quality studies. These studies needed to randomly assign women to either use PROMs or have regular hospital visits.

**Who would be in these studies?**
The studies would include women who finished treatment for gynecological cancer. The women could be any age. They would need to be healthy enough to track their own symptoms.

**How long would the studies last?**
The length of time would depend on each individual study.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**
The researchers found no studies that met their requirements. This means there are currently no good studies comparing PROMs to regular hospital visits for women after gynecological cancer treatment.

**What does this mean?**
We still do not know if PROMs work as well as hospital visits. We do not know if women using PROMs live as long. We do not know if they feel as good. We do not know if they are happy with this type of care.

**What is needed next?**
Good studies are needed to answer these questions. These studies need to be large enough to give clear answers. They need to be done carefully to give trustworthy results. Until these studies are done, we cannot say whether PROMs are better, worse, or the same as regular hospital visits.

**Why is this important?**
This review shows a gap in our knowledge. Women and doctors need to know the best way to provide follow-up care after cancer treatment. Future studies could help find better ways to care for women after gynecological cancer. These studies could help reduce patient worry and healthcare costs while keeping women safe and healthy.",10.1002-14651858.CD010299,"Benefits of patient‐reported measures of health and well‐being versus traditional follow‐up after treatment of gynaecological cancer

Arthroscopic knee surgery remains a common treatment for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, including for degenerative meniscal tears, despite guidelines strongly recommending against its use. This Cochrane Review is an update of a non‐Cochrane systematic review published in 2017. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of arthroscopic surgery, including debridement, partial menisectomy or both, compared with placebo surgery or non‐surgical treatment in people with degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis, degenerative meniscal tears, or both). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers up to 16 April 2021, unrestricted by language. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or trials using quasi‐randomised methods of participant allocation, comparing arthroscopic surgery with placebo surgery or non‐surgical interventions (e.g. exercise, injections, non‐arthroscopic lavage/irrigation, drug therapy, and supplements and complementary therapies) in people with symptomatic degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis or degenerative meniscal tears or both). Major outcomes were pain, function, participant‐reported treatment success, knee‐specific quality of life, serious adverse events, total adverse events and knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of evidence using GRADE. The primary comparison was arthroscopic surgery compared to placebo surgery for outcomes that measured benefits of surgery, but we combined data from all control groups to assess harms and knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy). 
Main results
Sixteen trials (2105 participants) met our inclusion criteria. The average age of participants ranged from 46 to 65 years, and 56% of participants were women. Four trials (380 participants) compared arthroscopic surgery to placebo surgery. For the remaining trials, arthroscopic surgery was compared to exercise (eight trials, 1371 participants), a single intra‐articular glucocorticoid injection (one trial, 120 participants), non‐arthroscopic lavage (one trial, 34 participants), non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (one trial, 80 participants) and weekly hyaluronic acid injections for five weeks (one trial, 120 participants). The majority of trials without a placebo control were susceptible to bias: in particular, selection (56%), performance (75%), detection (75%), attrition (44%) and selective reporting (75%) biases. The placebo‐controlled trials were less susceptible to bias and none were at risk of performance or detection bias. Here we limit reporting to the main comparison, arthroscopic surgery versus placebo surgery. 
High‐certainty evidence indicates arthroscopic surgery leads to little or no difference in pain or function at three months after surgery, moderate‐certainty evidence indicates there is probably little or no improvement in knee‐specific quality of life three months after surgery, and low‐certainty evidence indicates arthroscopic surgery may lead to little or no difference in participant‐reported success at up to five years, compared with placebo surgery. 
Mean post‐operative pain in the placebo group was 40.1 points on a 0 to 100 scale (where lower score indicates less pain) compared to 35.5 points in the arthroscopic surgery group, a difference of 4.6 points better (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 better to 9 better; I2 = 0%; 4 trials, 309 participants). Mean post‐operative function in the placebo group was 75.9 points on a 0 to 100 rating scale (where higher score indicates better function) compared to 76 points in the arthroscopic surgery group, a difference of 0.1 points better (95% CI 3.2 worse to 3.4 better; I2 = 0%; 3 trials, 302 participants). 
Mean post‐operative knee‐specific health‐related quality of life in the placebo group was 69.7 points on a 0 to 100 rating scale (where higher score indicates better quality of life) compared with 75.3 points in the arthroscopic surgery group, a difference of 5.6 points better (95% CI 0.36 better to 10.68 better; I2 = 0%; 2 trials, 188 participants). We downgraded this evidence to moderate certainty as the 95% confidence interval does not rule in or rule out a clinically important change. 
After surgery, 74 out of 100 people reported treatment success with placebo and 82 out of 100 people reported treatment success with arthroscopic surgery at up to five years (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.86; I2 = 53%; 3 trials, 189 participants). We downgraded this evidence to low certainty due to serious indirectness (diversity in definition and timing of outcome measurement) and serious imprecision (small number of events). 
We are less certain if the risk of serious or total adverse events increased with arthroscopic surgery compared to placebo or non‐surgical interventions. Serious adverse events were reported in 6 out of 100 people in the control groups and 8 out of 100 people in the arthroscopy groups from eight trials (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.83; I2 = 47%; 8 trials, 1206 participants). Fifteen out of 100 people reported adverse events with control interventions, and 17 out of 100 people with surgery at up to five years (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.70; I2 = 48%; 9 trials, 1326 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low, downgraded twice due to serious imprecision (small number of events) and possible reporting bias (incomplete reporting of outcome across studies). Serious adverse events included death, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis and deep infection. 
Subsequent knee surgery (replacement or high tibial osteotomy) was reported in 2 out of 100 people in the control groups and 4 out of 100 people in the arthroscopy surgery groups at up to five years in four trials (RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.94 to 7.34; I2 = 11%; 4 trials, 864 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low, downgraded twice due to the small number of events. 
Authors' conclusions
Arthroscopic surgery provides little or no clinically important benefit in pain or function, probably does not provide clinically important benefits in knee‐specific quality of life, and may not improve treatment success compared with a placebo procedure. It may lead to little or no difference, or a slight increase, in serious and total adverse events compared to control, but the evidence is of low certainty. Whether or not arthroscopic surgery results in slightly more subsequent knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy) compared to control remains unresolved. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Knee Surgery for Arthritis and Torn Cartilage

## Plain Title

Does knee surgery help people with knee arthritis or torn cartilage?

## Rationale

**What is knee arthritis and what are torn meniscus tears?**

Knee arthritis is a condition where the knee joint wears down over time. This causes pain and makes it hard to move. A meniscus is a piece of cartilage in the knee that acts like a cushion. As people age, this cartilage can tear or wear out. Both of these problems can make knees hurt and limit what people can do.

**What is arthroscopic knee surgery?**

Doctors often do a type of surgery called arthroscopy to treat these knee problems. They make small cuts in the knee. Then they put a tiny camera inside to see the joint. They clean out damaged tissue or remove torn pieces of cartilage. Many doctors still do this surgery even though medical guidelines say they should not.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to know if this surgery really helps people. They looked at many studies to see if the surgery works better than fake surgery or other treatments. This review updates an earlier review from 2017.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 16 studies that included 2,105 people. They only included studies where people were put into groups by chance. This makes the results more reliable.

**Who was in these studies?**

People in the studies were between 46 and 65 years old on average. About half were women. All had knee pain from arthritis or torn cartilage.

**What did researchers compare?**

Some studies compared real surgery to fake surgery. In fake surgery, doctors made small cuts but did not actually fix anything inside the knee. Other studies compared real surgery to other treatments like exercise, shots in the knee, or pain medicine.

**How long did the studies last?**

Studies followed people for different amounts of time. Some checked results at 3 months. Others followed people for up to 5 years.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The main findings compared real surgery to fake surgery.

**Pain:** Three months after surgery, people who had real surgery had pain scores of about 36 out of 100. People who had fake surgery had pain scores of about 40 out of 100. Lower scores mean less pain. The difference was very small. This means real surgery did not help pain much more than fake surgery.

**Daily activities:** Three months after surgery, both groups could do daily activities about the same. Real surgery did not help people move better than fake surgery.

**Quality of life:** People who had real surgery felt slightly better about their knee health than people who had fake surgery. But the difference was small and may not matter to most people.

**Treatment success:** About 74 out of 100 people felt better after fake surgery. About 82 out of 100 people felt better after real surgery. This small difference may have happened by chance.

**Side effects:** About 6 out of 100 people had serious problems with other treatments. About 8 out of 100 people had serious problems with surgery. These included blood clots, heart attacks, and infections. The difference was small. But researchers are not sure if surgery causes more problems because the studies were small.

**More surgery later:** About 2 out of 100 people in the control groups needed knee replacement later. About 4 out of 100 people who had arthroscopy needed knee replacement later. Researchers are not sure if the first surgery led to more surgeries later.

**What do these results mean?**

Arthroscopic knee surgery does not help pain or movement much more than fake surgery. It probably does not improve quality of life in important ways. It may not help people feel better overall. The surgery might cause slightly more side effects, but researchers need more information to be sure.

**Conclusions**

This surgery does not provide important benefits for people with knee arthritis or worn cartilage. People should talk with their doctors about other treatment options like exercise or pain medicine.",10.1002-14651858.CD014328,"Arthroscopic surgery for degenerative knee disease
Background 
Degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis in the knee which affects the joint lining and menisci) is the most common cause of knee pain, swelling and stiffness in the knee joint which leads to difficulty in walking. The cartilage in the knee joint is damaged, resulting in friction in the joint surfaces and formation of new bone in severe cases. Arthroscopic knee surgery removes damaged cartilage and loose tissue and smooths the knee joint surfaces. 
Study characteristics 
We included 16 randomised trials (2105 participants) published up to 16 April 2021. Trials were conducted in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Pakistan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Netherlands and USA. 
Overall, 56% of participants were women. The average age of participants ranged from 46 to 65 years and the average duration of symptoms ranged from 1.6 months to 4.4 years. Of the nine trials reporting their funding source, none received funding from industry. The other seven trials did not report any funding source. 
We limit reporting to the main comparison, arthroscopic surgery versus placebo (dummy or sham) surgery. 
Key results 
Compared with placebo surgery, arthroscopic surgery had little benefit:
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improvement in pain was 4.6 points better (0.02 better to 9 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative pain as 35.5 points.
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative pain as 40.1 points.
Knee function (higher scores mean better function) 
Improvement in knee function was 0.1 points better (3.2 worse to 3.4 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative knee function as 76.0 points. 
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative knee function as 75.9 points. 
Knee‐specific quality of life (higher scores mean better quality of life) 
Improvement in knee‐specific quality of life was 5.6 points better (0.4 better to 10.7 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative quality of life as 75.3 points. 
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative quality of life as 69.7 points. 
Treatment success (rated by participants) 
8% more people rated their treatment a success (25% fewer to 63% more), or 8 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 82 out of 100 people reported treatment success with arthroscopic surgery.
• 74 out of 100 people reported treatment success with placebo surgery.
Serious adverse events 
2% more people (2% fewer to 10% more) had serious adverse events, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 8 out of 100 people reported serious adverse events with arthroscopic surgery.
• 6 out of 100 people reported serious adverse events with placebo surgery.
Total adverse events 
2% more people (3% fewer to 11% more), had adverse events, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 17 out of 100 people reported adverse events with arthroscopic surgery.
• 15 out of 100 people reported adverse events with placebo surgery.
Subsequent knee surgery 
2% more people (0.1% fewer to 9% more), had subsequent knee surgery, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years. 
• 4 out of 100 people had knee replacement or osteotomy (knee surgery that reshapes bone) with arthroscopic surgery. 
• 2 out of 100 people had knee replacement or osteotomy with placebo surgery.
Certainty of the evidence 
We are confident that knee arthroscopy does not provide any clinically important benefits in terms of pain and function. We are moderately confident that knee arthroscopy probably does not provide any clinically important benefits in knee‐specific quality of life over a placebo procedure. Knee arthroscopy may not increase participant‐reported success compared with placebo. We have little confidence in the evidence because of differences across trials in reporting success and the small number of events. We are less certain of the risk of serious and total adverse events in arthroscopy versus placebo surgery: the evidence was uncertain because of the small number of events and incomplete reporting of study information. 
Adverse events associated with surgery include total knee replacement, osteotomy, repeat arthroscopy, arthroscopy in opposite knee, cutaneous nerve lesion (damage to nerves in the skin), deep or superficial infection, general knee pain, swelling, instability, stiffness or decreased range of motion in the affected or opposite knee, haemarthrosis (bleeding into the knee joint), death, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), hypoxaemia (decreased oxygen in the blood), deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the deep veins), tendonitis (inflammation of tendons), pain from fall or other trauma, rupture of a Baker's cyst (a fluid‐filled sac behind the knee), and back or hip or foot pain. 
Arthroscopic surgery may or may not lead to slightly more subsequent knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy) than the placebo procedure.

Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure injuries, pressure sores and bed sores) are localised injuries to the skin or underlying soft tissue, or both, caused by unrelieved pressure, shear or friction. Specific kinds of beds, overlays and mattresses are widely used with the aim of preventing and treating pressure ulcers. 
Objectives
To summarise evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assess the effects of beds, overlays and mattresses on reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers and on increasing pressure ulcer healing in any setting and population. 
To assess the relative effects of different types of beds, overlays and mattresses for reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers and increasing pressure ulcer healing in any setting and population. 
To cumulatively rank the different treatment options of beds, overlays and mattresses in order of their effectiveness in pressure ulcer prevention and treatment. 
Methods
In July 2020, we searched the Cochrane Library. Cochrane Reviews reporting the effectiveness of beds, mattresses or overlays for preventing or treating pressure ulcers were eligible for inclusion in this overview. Two review authors independently screened search results and undertook data extraction and risk of bias assessment using the ROBIS tool. We summarised the reported evidence in an overview of reviews. Where possible, we included the randomised controlled trials from each included review in network meta‐analyses. We assessed the relative effectiveness of beds, overlays and mattresses for preventing or treating pressure ulcers and their probabilities of being, comparably, the most effective treatment. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We include six Cochrane Reviews in this overview of reviews, all at low or unclear risk of bias. 
Pressure ulcer prevention: four reviews (of 68 studies with 18,174 participants) report direct evidence for 27 pairwise comparisons between 12 types of support surface on the following outcomes: pressure ulcer incidence, time to pressure ulcer incidence, patient comfort response, adverse event rates, health‐related quality of life, and cost‐effectiveness. Here we focus on outcomes with some evidence at a minimum of low certainty. 
(1) Pressure ulcer incidence: our overview includes direct evidence for 27 comparisons that mostly (19/27) have very low‐certainty evidence concerning reduction of pressure ulcer risk. We included 40 studies (12,517 participants; 1298 participants with new ulcers) in a network meta‐analysis involving 13 types of intervention. Data informing the network are sparse and this, together with the high risk of bias in most studies informing the network, means most network contrasts (64/78) yield evidence of very low certainty. There is low‐certainty evidence that, compared with foam surfaces (reference treatment), reactive air surfaces (e.g. static air overlays) (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.75), alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (e.g. alternating pressure air mattresses, large‐celled ripple mattresses) (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.93), and reactive gel surfaces (e.g. gel pads used on operating tables) (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.01) may reduce pressure ulcer incidence. The ranking of treatments in terms of effectiveness is also of very low certainty for all interventions. It is unclear which treatment is best for preventing ulceration. 
(2) Time to pressure ulcer incidence: four reviews had direct evidence on this outcome for seven comparisons. We included 10 studies (7211 participants; 699 participants with new ulcers) evaluating six interventions in a network meta‐analysis. Again, data from most network contrasts (13/15) are of very low certainty. There is low‐certainty evidence that, compared with foam surfaces (reference treatment), reactive air surfaces may reduce the hazard of developing new pressure ulcers (hazard ratio (HR) 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.05). The ranking of all support surfaces for preventing pressure ulcers in terms of time to healing is uncertain. 
(3) Cost‐effectiveness: this overview includes direct evidence for three comparisons. For preventing pressure ulcers, alternating pressure air surfaces are probably more cost‐effective than foam surfaces (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Pressure ulcer treatment: two reviews (of 12 studies with 972 participants) report direct evidence for five comparisons on: complete pressure ulcer healing, time to complete pressure ulcer healing, patient comfort response, adverse event rates, and cost‐effectiveness. Here we focus on outcomes with some evidence at a minimum of low certainty. 
(1) Complete pressure ulcer healing: our overview includes direct evidence for five comparisons. There is uncertainty about the relative effects of beds, overlays and mattresses on ulcer healing. The corresponding network meta‐analysis (with four studies, 397 participants) had only three direct contrasts and a total of six network contrasts. Again, most network contrasts (5/6) have very low‐certainty evidence. There was low‐certainty evidence that more people with pressure ulcers may heal completely using reactive air surfaces than using foam surfaces (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.80). We are uncertain which surfaces have the highest probability of being the most effective (all very low‐certainty evidence). 
(2) Time to complete pressure ulcer healing: this overview includes direct evidence for one comparison: people using reactive air surfaces may be more likely to have healed pressure ulcers compared with those using foam surfaces in long‐term care settings (HR 2.66, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.17; low‐certainty evidence). 
(3) Cost‐effectiveness: this overview includes direct evidence for one comparison: compared with foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces may cost an extra 26 US dollars for every ulcer‐free day in the first year of use in long‐term care settings (low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Compared with foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk and may increase complete ulcer healing. Compared with foam surfaces, alternating pressure air surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk and are probably more cost‐effective in preventing pressure ulcers. Compared with foam surfaces, reactive gel surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk, particularly for people in operating rooms and long‐term care settings. There are uncertainties for the relative effectiveness of other support surfaces for preventing and treating pressure ulcers, and their efficacy ranking. 
More high‐quality research is required; for example, for the comparison of reactive air surfaces with alternating pressure air surfaces. Future studies should consider time‐to‐event outcomes and be designed to minimise any risk of bias. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Special Beds, Mattresses, and Pads to Prevent and Heal Pressure Sores

## Plain Title

Do special beds, mattresses, and pads help prevent or heal pressure sores?

## Rationale

**What are pressure sores?**

Pressure sores are also called pressure ulcers, pressure injuries, or bed sores. They are wounds on the skin or deeper tissues. They happen when constant pressure, rubbing, or sliding damages the skin. People who stay in bed or sit for long times are at risk.

**Why is this a problem?**

Pressure sores cause pain and discomfort. They can become serious wounds. They are hard to heal. They affect quality of life for many patients.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors and nurses use special beds, mattresses, and pads to help prevent pressure sores. They also use them to help existing sores heal. Many different types exist. These include foam mattresses, air-filled surfaces, and gel pads. We need to know which ones work best.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to find out which special surfaces work best. They wanted to compare different types. They looked at preventing new pressure sores. They also looked at healing existing sores. They wanted to rank the surfaces from most helpful to least helpful.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was an overview of reviews. Researchers looked at six existing Cochrane Reviews. These reviews had already studied beds, mattresses, and pads. The reviews included 80 studies total. These studies had over 19,000 people combined.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included people at risk for pressure sores. They also included people who already had pressure sores. People were in hospitals, nursing homes, and operating rooms. The studies included adults of different ages and health conditions.

**What did researchers compare?**

Researchers compared 12 different types of surfaces for prevention. They compared 4 types for treatment. The main comparison was against standard foam surfaces. Other surfaces included:
- Reactive air surfaces (air-filled pads that respond to body weight)
- Alternating pressure air surfaces (air mattresses that inflate and deflate in patterns)
- Gel surfaces (gel pads)

**How long did studies last?**

Different studies lasted different amounts of time. Some tracked people for weeks. Others tracked people for months.

## Results

**What were the main results for preventing pressure sores?**

Researchers found that some surfaces may work better than foam:

- Reactive air surfaces may reduce the chance of getting pressure sores by about half.
- Alternating pressure air surfaces may reduce the chance by about one-third.
- Gel surfaces may reduce the chance by about half.

For cost, alternating pressure air surfaces probably save money compared to foam surfaces.

However, the quality of evidence was often low. This means we cannot be completely certain about these results. Researchers could not clearly say which surface is best overall.

**What were the main results for healing pressure sores?**

For people who already have pressure sores:

- Reactive air surfaces may help more sores heal completely compared to foam surfaces.
- Reactive air surfaces may help sores heal faster than foam surfaces.
- Reactive air surfaces may cost an extra 26 dollars for each day without a sore in the first year.

Again, the quality of evidence was often low. More research is needed.

**Why is this study important?**

This study brings together much of what we know about special surfaces. It helps doctors and nurses choose better options for patients. It shows that some surfaces may work better than standard foam.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

Special air surfaces and gel surfaces may help prevent pressure sores better than foam. Air surfaces may also help heal existing sores better. Alternating pressure air surfaces may save money when preventing sores.

However, many questions remain. We need better studies to be more certain. Future research should compare air surfaces with each other. Studies should follow patients over time. They should be designed more carefully to give clearer answers.

**What does this mean for patients?**

If you are at risk for pressure sores, ask your care team about special surfaces. Air-filled or gel surfaces may help more than regular foam. If you have a pressure sore, air surfaces may help it heal. Your care team can help choose the best option for you.",10.1002-14651858.CD013761,"What are the benefits and risks of beds, mattresses and overlays for preventing and treating pressure ulcers? 
The overview presents a lot of data from randomised controlled trials and contains an advanced analysis called 'network meta‐analysis'. The analysis allows comparisons of all types of support surfaces for preventing or treating pressure ulcers. This interactive tool may help with navigation of the datahttps://stopthepressure.shinyapps.io/Cochrane_support_surface_reviews/. 
Key messages 
Static air mattresses or overlays, alternating pressure air mattresses or overlays, and gel pads used on operating tables may be better than foam mattresses for preventing pressure ulcers. 
Compared with foam mattresses, alternating pressure air mattresses or overlays probably result in health benefits that outweigh their costs in preventing pressure ulcers. 
Static air mattresses or overlays may be better than foam mattresses for ulcer healing, but may cost more. 
It is unclear what the best treatment is for either preventing or treating pressure ulcers; what the effects of these treatment options are on people’s comfort and quality of life; and whether or not there are any unwanted effects. 
What are pressure ulcers? 
Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores or bed sores) are wounds to the skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure or rubbing. People who have mobility problems or who lie in bed for long periods are at risk of developing pressure ulcers. 
What did we want to find out? 
There are many types of beds, mattresses and overlays specifically designed for people with pressure ulcers. These can be made from a range of materials (such as foam, air cells and gel pads) and are divided into two groups: 
‐ reactive (static) surfaces that apply a constant pressure to the skin; and
‐ active (alternating pressure) surfaces that regularly redistribute the pressure under the body. 
We wanted to find out if different types of reactive and active surfaces:
‐ prevent pressure ulcers;
‐ help ulcers to heal;
‐ are comfortable and improve people’s quality of life;
‐ have health benefits that outweigh their costs; and
‐ have any unwanted effects.
We also wanted to find out what the best treatment options are for either preventing or healing pressure ulcers. 
What did we do? 
We searched for Cochrane Reviews that summarised the results of all available carefully designed studies (controlled trials) evaluating different beds, mattresses and overlays in preventing and treating pressure ulcers. A Cochrane Review provides a high level of evidence on the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. We summarised the results of these reviews in a single document (called an overview of reviews). 
We also collected studies included in these reviews and compared all available treatments at the same time in a single analysis (called network meta‐analysis). We then summarised these results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
Effects in preventing pressure ulcers  
We found four reviews on the use of beds, mattresses and overlays for preventing pressure ulcers. From these, we included 40 studies (12,517 people) in a network meta‐analysis evaluating reduction of pressure ulcer risk. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that static (reactive) air overlays, alternating pressure air mattresses, and (reactive) gel pads used on operating tables may reduce pressure ulcer risk compared with foam mattresses. 
We also included 10 studies (7211 people) in a network meta‐analysis evaluating the time taken for new ulcers to develop. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that reactive air surfaces may reduce the chances of developing new ulcers compared with foam surfaces. 
Effects in treating pressure ulcers  
We found two reviews on pressure ulcer healing. From these, we included four studies (397 people) in a network meta‐analysis. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that more people with ulcers may heal completely using reactive air surfaces than foam surfaces. 
The overview evidence suggests that, if the time needed to completely heal an ulcer is looked at, reactive air surfaces may improve the chances of pressure ulcers healing when compared with foam mattresses. 
However, it is unclear which treatment is best for either preventing or treating pressure ulcers. 
Other effects in preventing and treating pressure ulcers  
The overview evidence suggests that:
‐ compared with foam mattresses, alternating pressure air surfaces probably result in health benefits that outweigh their costs in preventing pressure ulcers; 
‐ reactive air‐filled surfaces may cost more than foam mattresses in healing ulcers; and 
‐ the other benefits and risks of these beds, mattresses and mattress overlays are unclear. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Although the reviews we found used reliable methods, most of the studies in them were small and used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence in this overview is current to July 2020.

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer‐related death in the world, however lung cancer screening has not been implemented in most countries at a population level. A previous Cochrane Review found limited evidence for the effectiveness of lung cancer screening with chest radiography (CXR) or sputum cytology in reducing lung cancer‐related mortality, however there has been increasing evidence supporting screening with low‐dose computed tomography (LDCT).  
Objectives
To determine whether screening for lung cancer using LDCT of the chest reduces lung cancer‐related mortality and to evaluate the possible harms of LDCT screening. 
Search methods
We performed the search in collaboration with the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group and included the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library, current issue), MEDLINE (accessed via PubMed) and Embase in our search. We also searched the clinical trial registries to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We did not impose any restriction on language of publication. The search was performed up to 31 July 2021.  
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lung cancer screening using LDCT and reporting mortality or harm outcomes.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors were involved in independently assessing trials for eligibility, extraction of trial data and characteristics, and assessing risk of bias of the included trials using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Primary outcomes were lung cancer‐related mortality and harms of screening. We performed a meta‐analysis, where appropriate, for all outcomes using a random‐effects model. We only included trials in the analysis of mortality outcomes if they had at least 5 years of follow‐up. We reported risk ratios (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used the I2 statistic to investigate heterogeneity.  
Main results
We included 11 trials in this review with a total of 94,445 participants. Trials were conducted in Europe and the USA in people aged 40 years or older, with most trials having an entry requirement of ≥ 20 pack‐year smoking history (e.g. 1 pack of cigarettes/day for 20 years or 2 packs/day for 10 years etc.). One trial included male participants only. Eight trials were phase three RCTs, with two feasibility RCTs and one pilot RCT. Seven of the included trials had no screening as a comparison, and four trials had CXR screening as a comparator. Screening frequency included annual, biennial and incrementing intervals. The duration of screening ranged from 1 year to 10 years. Mortality follow‐up was from 5 years to approximately 12 years.  
None of the included trials were at low risk of bias across all domains. The certainty of evidence was moderate to low across different outcomes, as assessed by GRADE. 
In the meta‐analysis of trials assessing lung cancer‐related mortality, we included eight trials (91,122 participants), and there was a reduction in mortality of 21% with LDCT screening compared to control groups of no screening or CXR screening (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87; 8 trials, 91,122 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were probably no differences in subgroups for analyses by control type, sex, geographical region, and nodule management algorithm. Females appeared to have a larger lung cancer‐related mortality benefit compared to males with LDCT screening. There was also a reduction in all‐cause mortality (including lung cancer‐related) of 5% (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.99; 8 trials, 91,107 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Invasive tests occurred more frequently in the LDCT group (RR 2.60, 95% CI 2.41 to 2.80; 3 trials, 60,003 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, analysis of 60‐day postoperative mortality was not significant between groups (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.94; 2 trials, 409 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
False‐positive results and recall rates were higher with LDCT screening compared to screening with CXR, however there was low‐certainty evidence in the meta‐analyses due to heterogeneity and risk of bias concerns. Estimated overdiagnosis with LDCT screening was 18%, however the 95% CI was 0 to 36% (risk difference (RD) 0.18, 95% CI ‐0.00 to 0.36; 5 trials, 28,656 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Four trials compared different aspects of health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) using various measures. Anxiety was pooled from three trials, with participants in LDCT screening reporting lower anxiety scores than in the control group (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.43, 95% CI ‐0.59 to ‐0.27; 3 trials, 8153 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
There were insufficient data to comment on the impact of LDCT screening on smoking behaviour.  
Authors' conclusions
The current evidence supports a reduction in lung cancer‐related mortality with the use of LDCT for lung cancer screening in high‐risk populations (those over the age of 40 with a significant smoking exposure). However, there are limited data on harms and further trials are required to determine participant selection and optimal frequency and duration of screening, with potential for significant overdiagnosis of lung cancer. Trials are ongoing for lung cancer screening in non‐smokers.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Lung Cancer Screening Using Low-Dose CT Scans

## Plain Title

Can low-dose CT scans help find lung cancer early and save lives?

## Rationale

**What is lung cancer and why is it important?**

Lung cancer kills more people than any other type of cancer in the world. Finding lung cancer early can help save lives. However, most countries do not screen people for lung cancer.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if a special type of scan could help find lung cancer early. This scan is called a low-dose CT scan, or LDCT. It uses less radiation than a regular CT scan. The researchers wanted to see if LDCT could help fewer people die from lung cancer.

**Why was this study needed?**

Earlier studies looked at chest X-rays and sputum tests (checking mucus from the lungs). These tests did not work well for finding lung cancer early. Newer research suggested that LDCT scans might work better. This study brought together all the research on LDCT to see if it really helps.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This review looked at 11 different studies. These studies included 94,445 people total. The studies took place in Europe and the United States.

**Who was in these studies?**

The people in these studies were:
- Age 40 or older
- Most had smoked heavily (at least 1 pack per day for 20 years)
- One study included only men
- Other studies included both men and women

**What did the studies compare?**

Some studies compared LDCT scans to no screening at all. Other studies compared LDCT scans to regular chest X-rays.

**How often were people screened?**

People got scans at different times:
- Some got scans every year
- Some got scans every two years
- Some got scans at different time periods

**How long did the studies last?**

The screening part lasted 1 to 10 years. Researchers then followed people for 5 to 12 years to see what happened.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The study found important benefits from LDCT screening:

**Fewer deaths from lung cancer:** People who got LDCT scans were 21% less likely to die from lung cancer. This means that out of every 100 people who might die from lung cancer, LDCT screening could save 21 lives.

**Fewer deaths overall:** People who got LDCT scans were 5% less likely to die from any cause. This includes deaths from lung cancer and other causes.

**Women may benefit more:** Women seemed to get more benefit from LDCT screening than men.

**What were the downsides?**

LDCT screening also had some problems:

**More invasive tests:** People who got LDCT scans were more likely to need follow-up tests. These tests can be uncomfortable or risky.

**False alarms:** LDCT scans sometimes showed something that looked like cancer but was not. This happened more often with LDCT than with chest X-rays.

**Finding cancers that may not cause harm:** About 18 out of 100 cancers found by LDCT might never have caused problems. This is called overdiagnosis. Finding these cancers can lead to unnecessary treatment.

**Quality of life:** Three studies looked at anxiety levels. People who got LDCT scans actually felt less anxious than people who did not get screened.

**What do these results mean?**

LDCT screening can save lives in people at high risk for lung cancer. High risk means being over 40 years old and having smoked heavily. However, LDCT screening can also cause harm through false alarms and finding cancers that may not need treatment.

More research is needed to answer these questions:
- Who should get screened?
- How often should people get screened?
- How long should screening continue?
- Does LDCT work for people who never smoked?",10.1002-14651858.CD013829,"Impact of computed tomography (CT) on lung cancer screening
Background 
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer‐related death worldwide. Lung cancer survival is significantly dependent on when a person is diagnosed with the disease. It is essential to detect the disease as early as possible by radiography (chest x‐ray) or by computed tomography (CT) scan, which is a more detailed type of radiography where multiple images of the lung are taken. The aim of this review was to gather information on the use of CT scan to detect lung cancer earlier and to find out if early detection of lung cancer reduces death from lung cancer. We also evaluated potential harms that can occur from using CT to screen for lung cancer, such as additional investigations and their related complications.

The evidence is current to 31 July 2021. We included 11 trials, with a total of 94,445 participants. The trials came from the USA and Europe. The earliest trial started in 1991, and the most recent started in 2011. The participants were adults over the age of 40. The frequency of screening with CT ranged from yearly to more than 2.5 years. 
Key findings 
Eight of the trials (91,122 participants) were included in the main outcome analysis of lung cancer‐related mortality. In people over 40 years with significant smoking exposure, CT screening reduced deaths from lung cancer by 21%, with 226 people needing to undergo screening to prevent one death from lung cancer. We also found that deaths from any cause (including lung cancer) were less with CT screening. However, the effect was much lower (only 5% reduction in risk). Lung cancer was detected more frequently in the group of people who had CT screening compared with no screening. However, CT scans can induce false‐positive scans (a test that is positive or indeterminate for lung cancer, when the person does not actually have lung cancer). We found that false‐positive results were more common among people who were screened with CT than chest x‐ray. Because of that, those that underwent CT screening had more tests to investigate both cancer and non‐cancer‐related diseases. Screening also implies a risk of detecting lung cancers that may have never progressed to cause harm to the person (this is referred to as overdiagnosis). The risk of lung cancer overdiagnosis with CT screening was estimated to be 18%. 
The trials were too different or did not provide enough information to look at the impact of screening on stopping smoking or quality of life. There was some evidence to suggest there were no long‐term psychological harms from screening, with some people in the CT screening group feeling less anxious compared to the control groups who were not offered screening. 
Certainty of evidence 
The overall certainty of evidence was moderate when it came to outcomes regarding death, with moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence for other outcomes. The certainty rating for outcomes reflects the authors' confidence and certainty in the outcome being correct.

Relapse (the re‐emergence of depressive symptoms after some level of improvement but preceding recovery) and recurrence (onset of a new depressive episode after recovery) are common in depression, lead to worse outcomes and quality of life for patients and exert a high economic cost on society. Outcomes can be predicted by using multivariable prognostic models, which use information about several predictors to produce an individualised risk estimate. The ability to accurately predict relapse or recurrence while patients are well (in remission) would allow the identification of high‐risk individuals and may improve overall treatment outcomes for patients by enabling more efficient allocation of interventions to prevent relapse and recurrence. 
Objectives
To summarise the predictive performance of prognostic models developed to predict the risk of relapse, recurrence, sustained remission or recovery in adults with major depressive disorder who meet criteria for remission or recovery. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (current issue); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 onwards); Ovid Embase (1980 onwards); Ovid PsycINFO (1806 onwards); and Web of Science (1900 onwards) up to May 2020. We also searched sources of grey literature, screened the reference lists of included studies and performed a forward citation search. There were no restrictions applied to the searches by date, language or publication status . 
Selection criteria
We included development and external validation (testing model performance in data separate from the development data) studies of any multivariable prognostic models (including two or more predictors) to predict relapse, recurrence, sustained remission, or recovery in adults (aged 18 years and over) with remitted depression, in any clinical setting. We included all study designs and accepted all definitions of relapse, recurrence and other related outcomes. We did not specify a comparator prognostic model. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references; extracted data (using a template based on the CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS)); and assessed risks of bias of included studies (using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST)). We referred any disagreements to a third independent review author. Where we found sufficient (10 or more) external validation studies of an individual model, we planned to perform a meta‐analysis of its predictive performance, specifically with respect to its calibration (how well the predicted probabilities match the observed proportions of individuals that experience the outcome) and discrimination (the ability of the model to differentiate between those with and without the outcome). Recommendations could not be qualified using the GRADE system, as guidance is not yet available for prognostic model reviews. 
Main results
We identified 11 eligible prognostic model studies (10 unique prognostic models). Seven were model development studies; three were model development and external validation studies; and one was an external validation‐only study. Multiple estimates of performance measures were not available for any of the models and, meta‐analysis was therefore not possible. Ten out of the 11 included studies were assessed as being at high overall risk of bias. Common weaknesses included insufficient sample size, inappropriate handling of missing data and lack of information about discrimination and calibration. One paper (Klein 2018) was at low overall risk of bias and presented a prognostic model including the following predictors: number of previous depressive episodes, residual depressive symptoms and severity of the last depressive episode. The external predictive performance of this model was poor (C‐statistic 0.59; calibration slope 0.56; confidence intervals not reported). None of the identified studies examined the clinical utility (net benefit) of the developed model. 
Authors' conclusions
Of the 10 prognostic models identified (across 11 studies), only four underwent external validation. Most of the studies (n = 10) were assessed as being at high overall risk of bias, and the one study that was at low risk of bias presented a model with poor predictive performance. There is a need for improved prognostic research in this clinical area, with future studies conforming to current best practice recommendations for prognostic model development/validation and reporting findings in line with the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement.

## Plain Title
Can We Predict Which People with Depression Will Get Depressed Again After They Feel Better?

## Rationale

**What is depression and why does it matter?**

Depression is a common mental health problem. It makes people feel very sad and affects their daily life. Many people with depression get better with treatment. However, depression often comes back after people start to feel well again.

When depression returns, we call this ""relapse"" or ""recurrence."" Relapse means symptoms come back before someone is fully better. Recurrence means a new episode of depression starts after someone has fully recovered.

**Why is this a problem?**

When depression comes back, it causes many problems. People feel worse and have a lower quality of life. It also costs a lot of money for healthcare and society.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to know if they could predict who will get depressed again. They looked for tools called ""prediction models."" These tools use information about a person to estimate their risk. For example, a model might use age, past episodes, and other factors.

**Why is this important?**

If doctors could predict who will get depressed again, they could help those people more. High-risk people could get extra treatment or support. This might stop depression from coming back.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers do this study?**

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at many past studies. They searched medical databases for studies published up to May 2020.

**What did they look for?**

They looked for studies that created or tested prediction models. These models had to predict depression coming back in adults who were feeling better.

**Who was included?**

The studies included adults aged 18 years and older. All had depression before but were now in remission. This means their symptoms had improved or gone away.

**What did researchers check?**

Two researchers looked at each study carefully. They checked how well the studies were done. They looked for problems that might make results less trustworthy. They used special tools to check quality.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

Researchers found 11 studies. These studies created 10 different prediction models.

Most studies had serious problems. Ten out of 11 studies had a high risk of being wrong or biased. Common problems included:
- Not enough people in the study
- Poor handling of missing information
- Not enough testing of how well the models worked

**Did any models work well?**

Only one study was done well and had low risk of bias. This study created a model using three pieces of information:
- How many times someone had depression before
- How many symptoms remained after treatment
- How severe the last depression episode was

However, even this model did not work very well. It was not good at predicting who would get depressed again.

Only four models were tested in new groups of people. This type of testing is important to see if models really work.

None of the studies checked if using these models would actually help patients in real life.

**What do these results mean?**

Right now, we do not have good tools to predict who will get depressed again after feeling better. The models that exist are either poorly made or do not work well enough.

**What should happen next?**

Researchers need to do better studies in this area. Future studies should:
- Include more people
- Follow best practices for creating prediction models
- Test models in new groups of people
- Report results clearly and completely
- Check if models actually help patients

**Conclusion**

We cannot yet accurately predict which people will get depressed again after they feel better. More high-quality research is needed to create useful prediction tools. Better tools could help doctors identify high-risk patients and prevent depression from coming back.",10.1002-14651858.CD013491,"Predicting relapse or recurrence of depression
What is the aim of this review? 
Relapse and recurrence (becoming unwell again after making an improvement) are common in depression and lead to increased disability and decreased quality of life for patients. Relapse is a re‐emergence of the initial episode of depression after some initial improvement, whereas recurrence is the onset of a new episode of depression after recovery. Outcomes, such as relapse and recurrence, can sometimes be predicted while people are well, using information available at the time. A mathematical calculation can be performed to assess an individual person's risk; this calculation is known as a 'prognostic model' or a prediction tool. In most health services, including the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, resources such as doctors and therapists need to be used in the best way possible, for the people who will gain the most benefit from them. If accurate prediction tools are available, the information can be used to identify the most 'high risk' patients and make sure they receive additional support to try to prevent a relapse or a recurrence. 
The aim of this review was to identify studies that have attempted to develop a prediction tool for relapse or recurrence of depression in adults. We were interested in studies that had attempted to make this prediction while patients were well. We also included tools that predicted the chance of patients staying well. If we had found multiple studies that tested the same prediction tool, we planned to combine these to work out a better summary of how well that tool worked. 
Key messages 
We identified 10 prediction tools (over 11 studies) for relapse or recurrence. These were either not proven to be good at predicting relapse/recurrence, or the studies had problems with how they were carried out, meaning that none of the prediction tools were at a stage where they could be used in the real world. Further work is needed to improve prediction of relapse or recurrence of depression. 
What was studied in the review? 
We collected and analysed the results of 11 relevant studies. We were interested in several things: how researchers had defined relapse and recurrence (for example, whether they had used clinical interviews or self‐report questionnaires to diagnose depressive symptoms); what information was gathered to help make predictions; the techniques used by the researchers to help develop the tools; and how well the tools predicted. We were also interested in whether the tools were tested in a separate group of participants, which is essential to ensure that the model can predict accurately in patients in the real world. 
Finally, we assessed the studies to determine how confident we could be in the results, given the approaches taken by researchers (this is called 'risk of bias') and how relevant the studies were to our review (this is called 'applicability'). 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 11 studies. Ten of these developed different models and one study tested one of the models developed in a previous study. It was not possible to combine results for any particular tool. 
Ten of the 11 studies were rated at high risk of bias. This means that we cannot be confident in the results that were presented, due to some issues with the way the studies were conducted. The most common issue was that there were not enough participants included in the studies. Other common problems involved the statistical approaches used by the researchers. 
One study was at low overall risk of bias, which means that we can be more confident in trusting the results. However, this tool did not make accurate predictions about relapse or recurrence. 
We found no studies that could be used in clinical practice; further work is needed to develop tools for predicting relapse or recurrence of depression. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
The literature search for this review was completed in May 2020.

Review question 
Should adult patients with bilateral (two‐sided) hearing loss be fitted with one or two hearing aids? 
Background 
Hearing loss can be present from birth or can come on in later life. The latter is called 'acquired' hearing loss and is common. Its incidence increases markedly with age. In most people, 'age‐related' hearing loss is due to the loss of cells in the inner ear (so called 'sensorineural hearing loss') and affects both ears to the same degree. Hearing loss categorised as mild, moderate or severe is primarily managed with hearing aids. People with bilateral hearing loss may be offered one aid, fitted to one specific ear, or two aids fitted to both ears. There is uncertainty about the relative benefits to patients of these different strategies. 
Study characteristics 
We included four studies with a total of 209 patients, ranging in age from 23 to 85 and with more men than women. All the studies allowed the use of hearing aids for a total period of at least eight weeks before questions were asked about their preference for one or two aids. In all the studies the patients had bilateral hearing loss but there was considerable variation in what type of hearing loss they suffered from and how bad their hearing was. 
Three of the studies were published before the mid‐1990s and the fourth study was published in 2011. Therefore, only the most recent study used 'modern' hearing aids similar to those that are widely available in high‐income countries. Of the four studies, two were conducted in the UK in National Health Service (NHS – public sector) patients. One of these looked at patients from primary care whose hearing loss had been picked up by a screening programme. The other looked at patients whose primary care practitioner thought they might benefit from hearing aids so had referred them to the local ENT department to get them. The other two studies were conducted in the United States: one study recruited only people on active military duty, or who had served in the military and had hearing loss due to being exposed to loud noises. About half of the people in the other study were ex‐military. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Only one of the outcomes we thought was most important ‐ patient preference ‐ was reported in all studies. The percentage of patients who preferred two hearing aids to one varied between studies: this was 54% (51 out of 94), 39% (22 out of 56), 55% (16 out of 29) and 77% (23 out of 30), respectively. We did not combine the numbers from these four studies because it would not have been right to do so. We graded the quality of evidence for this outcome as very low on a scale that goes high – medium – low – very low. There was no information in the four studies on the other outcomes we were interested in. 
Conclusions 
This review identified only four studies comparing the use of one hearing aid with two. The studies were small and included people of widely varying ages. There was also considerable variation in the types of their deafness and in how deaf they were. 
For the most part, the types of hearing aid evaluated would now be regarded, in high‐income countries, as 'old technology', with only one study looking at 'modern' digital aids. However, we do not know if this is relevant or not. This review did not look at the differences between other 'old' and 'new' types of hearing aid. 
We could not combine the numbers from the four studies. Overall, this fact and the very low quality of the evidence leads us to conclude that we do not know if patients have a preference for one aid or two. Similarly, we do not know if a patient's quality of life is better with one or two aids. 
","# Plain Language Summary: One Hearing Aid Versus Two Hearing Aids for Adults with Hearing Loss in Both Ears

## Plain Title
Comparing One Hearing Aid to Two Hearing Aids for Adults Who Have Hearing Loss in Both Ears

## Rationale

### What is hearing loss and why does it matter?
Many adults lose their hearing as they get older. This is called age-related hearing loss. It happens when tiny cells inside the ear stop working. Most of the time, this affects both ears equally.

Hearing loss makes daily life harder. People may struggle to talk with family and friends. They may have trouble at work or in social settings. This can make people feel alone or left out.

### Why was this study needed?
Doctors can help people with hearing loss by giving them hearing aids. These are small devices that make sounds louder. But doctors are not sure what works best. Should they give one hearing aid for one ear? Or should they give two hearing aids for both ears?

This study looked at past research to find out. The goal was to see if patients prefer one aid or two. The researchers also wanted to know if two aids help people hear better than one aid.

### Why might two hearing aids work better?
Two hearing aids might help people hear from both sides. This could make it easier to know where sounds come from. It might also help people hear better when there is background noise.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?
This was a review of other studies. Researchers looked at four different studies done in the past. They combined the findings to see what they could learn.

### Who was in these studies?
The four studies included 209 adults total. These people were between 23 and 85 years old. Most were men. All had hearing loss in both ears.

The hearing loss was different for different people. Some had mild hearing loss. Others had more severe hearing loss.

### Where were the studies done?
Two studies were done in the United Kingdom. These used patients from the public health system. Two studies were done in the United States. Many people in the US studies had been in the military.

### How long did the studies last?
All studies let people use hearing aids for at least eight weeks. This gave people time to get used to the aids. Then researchers asked which option they liked better.

### What type of hearing aids were used?
Three studies used older types of hearing aids. These studies were done before the mid-1990s. Only one study from 2011 used modern digital hearing aids. These are the type most people use today in wealthy countries.

## Results

### What did the researchers find?
The main finding was about patient preference. This means which option patients liked better.

The results were different across the four studies:
- In the first study, 51 out of 94 people preferred two aids
- In the second study, 22 out of 56 people preferred two aids
- In the third study, 16 out of 29 people preferred two aids
- In the fourth study, 23 out of 30 people preferred two aids

The researchers could not combine these numbers. The studies were too different from each other.

### What about other important questions?
The studies did not look at other important things. They did not measure quality of life. They did not check if people could hear better with two aids. They did not report if there were any problems with using two aids.

### What is the quality of this evidence?
The researchers rated the quality of evidence as very low. This is the lowest rating possible. It means we cannot be sure about the findings.

### Why was the evidence quality so low?
There were several problems:
- Only four small studies were found
- The studies included very different types of people
- People had different levels of hearing loss
- Most studies used old hearing aid technology
- The results varied a lot between studies

### What do these results mean for patients?
Based on this review, we do not know if one aid or two aids is better. We cannot say which option patients prefer. We do not know which option gives better quality of life.

More research is needed. Future studies should use modern hearing aids. They should include more people. They should measure more outcomes that matter to patients.

### Conclusions from the researchers
The evidence is not strong enough to guide treatment choices. Doctors and patients must decide together. They should consider individual needs and preferences. More high-quality research is needed to answer this important question.",10.1002-14651858.CD012665,"Bilateral (two) versus unilateral (one) hearing aid(s) for bilateral hearing impairment in adults

Peripheral joint osteoarthritis is a major cause of pain and functional limitation. Few treatments are safe and effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of acupuncture for treating peripheral joint osteoarthritis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE, and EMBASE (both through December 2007), and scanned reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing needle acupuncture with a sham, another active treatment, or a waiting list control group in people with osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, or hand. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated standardized mean differences using the differences in improvements between groups. 
Main results
Sixteen trials involving 3498 people were included. Twelve of the RCTs included only people with OA of the knee, 3 only OA of the hip, and 1 a mix of people with OA of the hip and/or knee. In comparison with a sham control, acupuncture showed statistically significant, short‐term improvements in osteoarthritis pain (standardized mean difference ‐0.28, 95% confidence interval ‐0.45 to ‐0.11; 0.9 point greater improvement than sham on 20 point scale; absolute percent change 4.59%; relative percent change 10.32%; 9 trials; 1835 participants) and function (‐0.28, ‐0.46 to ‐0.09; 2.7 point greater improvement on 68 point scale; absolute percent change 3.97%; relative percent change 8.63%); however, these pooled short‐term benefits did not meet our predefined thresholds for clinical relevance (i.e. 1.3 points for pain; 3.57 points for function) and there was substantial statistical heterogeneity. Additionally, restriction to sham‐controlled trials using shams judged most likely to adequately blind participants to treatment assignment (which were also the same shams judged most likely to have physiological activity), reduced heterogeneity and resulted in pooled short‐term benefits of acupuncture that were smaller and non‐significant. In comparison with sham acupuncture at the six‐month follow‐up, acupuncture showed borderline statistically significant, clinically irrelevant improvements in osteoarthritis pain (‐0.10, ‐0.21 to 0.01; 0.4 point greater improvement than sham on 20 point scale; absolute percent change 1.81%; relative percent change 4.06%; 4 trials;1399 participants) and function (‐0.11, ‐0.22 to 0.00; 1.2 point greater improvement than sham on 68 point scale; absolute percent change 1.79%; relative percent change 3.89%). In a secondary analysis versus a waiting list control, acupuncture was associated with statistically significant, clinically relevant short‐term improvements in osteoarthritis pain (‐0.96, ‐1.19 to ‐0.72; 14.5 point greater improvement than sham on 100 point scale; absolute percent change 14.5%; relative percent change 29.14%; 4 trials; 884 participants) and function (‐0.89, ‐1.18 to ‐0.60; 13.0 point greater improvement than sham on 100 point scale; absolute percent change 13.0%; relative percent change 25.21%). In the head‐on comparisons of acupuncture with the 'supervised osteoarthritis education' and the 'physician consultation' control groups, acupuncture was associated with clinically relevant short‐ and long‐term improvements in pain and function. In the head on comparisons of acupuncture with 'home exercises/advice leaflet' and 'supervised exercise', acupuncture was associated with similar treatment effects as the controls. Acupuncture as an adjuvant to an exercise based physiotherapy program did not result in any greater improvements than the exercise program alone. Information on safety was reported in only 8 trials and even in these trials there was limited reporting and heterogeneous methods. 
Authors' conclusions
Sham‐controlled trials show statistically significant benefits; however, these benefits are small, do not meet our pre‐defined thresholds for clinical relevance, and are probably due at least partially to placebo effects from incomplete blinding. Waiting list‐controlled trials of acupuncture for peripheral joint osteoarthritis suggest statistically significant and clinically relevant benefits, much of which may be due to expectation or placebo effects. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Acupuncture for Joint Pain from Osteoarthritis

## Plain Title
Does Acupuncture Help Treat Pain and Movement Problems in People with Osteoarthritis of the Knee, Hip, or Hand?

## Rationale

**What is osteoarthritis?**
Osteoarthritis is a common joint disease. It causes pain and makes it hard to move. Many people with this disease have trouble doing daily tasks. The joints most often affected are the knees, hips, and hands.

**Why was this study needed?**
Very few treatments for osteoarthritis work well and are safe. Doctors and patients need better options. Acupuncture is a treatment where thin needles are placed in the skin. Some people believe it can help reduce pain. However, researchers were not sure if acupuncture really works for osteoarthritis pain.

**What did researchers want to find out?**
Researchers wanted to know if acupuncture helps people with osteoarthritis. They wanted to see if it reduces pain. They also wanted to know if it helps people move better.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
This was a review of many studies. Researchers looked at 16 different studies. These studies included 3,498 people total.

**Who was in these studies?**
Most studies included people with knee osteoarthritis. Some studies had people with hip osteoarthritis. One study had people with hip or knee osteoarthritis. All people in the studies had joint pain.

**What did researchers compare?**
Researchers compared acupuncture to different things:
- Fake acupuncture (called sham acupuncture)
- Waiting lists (no treatment right away)
- Other treatments like exercise or education

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies measured results at different times. Some looked at short-term results. Others checked results six months later.

## Results

**What did the studies find about acupuncture versus fake acupuncture?**

In the short term, acupuncture showed small improvements. People had slightly less pain. They could move a bit better. However, these improvements were very small. The researchers did not think the improvements were big enough to really matter to patients.

After six months, acupuncture showed even smaller benefits. These benefits were so small they were not meaningful.

**An important finding about fake acupuncture:**
Some fake acupuncture treatments were better than others. The best fake treatments looked very real to patients. When researchers looked only at studies with the best fake treatments, acupuncture did not work better than fake acupuncture.

**What did studies find when comparing acupuncture to no treatment?**

When people got acupuncture instead of waiting for treatment, results were different. These people had much less pain. They could move much better. These improvements were large enough to matter.

**Why might this be?**
Researchers think much of this benefit comes from the placebo effect. This means people feel better because they expect to feel better. Getting any treatment can make people feel better than getting no treatment at all.

**What about comparing acupuncture to other treatments?**

Acupuncture worked about the same as exercise programs. It worked better than just talking to a doctor. It did not add extra benefit when combined with exercise.

**Was acupuncture safe?**

Only 8 studies reported safety information. Even these studies did not give complete details. More research is needed on safety.

**What do these results mean?**

The researchers concluded that acupuncture shows small benefits in studies. However, these benefits are probably not real treatment effects. Instead, they likely come from the placebo effect. This happens when people cannot tell if they got real or fake acupuncture.

When people know they are getting acupuncture (versus being on a waiting list), they feel much better. But this is probably because they expect to feel better, not because acupuncture truly works.

**Bottom line:**
This study suggests acupuncture may not work better than fake acupuncture for osteoarthritis. Any benefits people feel may come from their expectations rather than the acupuncture itself.",10.1002-14651858.CD001977,"Acupuncture for osteoarthritis
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of acupuncture on osteoarthritis. 
The review shows that in people with osteoarthritis, 
‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 8 weeks. 
‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 26 weeks. 
We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects of acupuncture treatment include minor bruising and bleeding at the site of needle insertion. 
What is osteoarthritis and what is acupuncture? 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as your knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try and repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen and make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect your physical function or ability to use your knee. 
According to the philosophy of traditional acupuncture, energy circulates in 'meridians' located throughout the body.  Pain or ill health happens when something occurs to cause this meridian energy circulation to be blocked. The way to restore health is to stimulate the appropriate combination of acupuncture points in the body by inserting very thin needles.  Sometimes in painful conditions, electrical stimulation along with the needles is also used.  According to acupuncture theory, one way you can tell that acupuncture is relieving pain is that you may feel numbness or tingling, called de qi, where the needle is inserted. 
Best estimate of what happens to people with osteoarthritis who have acupuncture: 
Pain after 8 weeks: 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 4 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. 
‐People who received acupuncture had a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.  (5% absolute improvement). 
Pain after 26 weeks: 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly more than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly less than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. 
‐People who received acupuncture had under a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.  (2% absolute improvement).  
Physical function after 8 weeks : 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 8 points on a scale of 0 to 68. 
‐People who received acupuncture had about a 3 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐68.  (4% absolute improvement)  
Physical function after 26 weeks : 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 10 points on a scale of 0 to 68. 
‐People who received acupuncture had about a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐68.  (2% absolute improvement)

Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility tests are expected to reduce the time to clinically important results of a blood culture. This might enable clinicians to better target therapy to a person's needs, and thereby, improve health outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay), and reduce unnecessary prescribing of broad‐spectrum antibiotics; thereby reducing antimicrobial resistance rates. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of rapid susceptibility testing versus standard susceptibility testing for bloodstream infections (BSIs). 
Search methods
To identify studies with selected outcomes, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, and two trials registries, between 1987 and October 2020. We used 'bloodstream infection' and 'antimicrobial susceptibility tests' as search terms. We had no language or publication status limitations. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (with a time‐to‐result of ≤ 8 hours) versus conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in people with a BSI caused by any bacteria, as identified by a positive blood culture. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references, full‐text reports of potentially relevant studies, extracted data from the studies, and assessed risk of bias. Any disagreement was discussed and resolved with a third review author. For mortality, a dichotomous outcome, we extracted the number of events in each arm, and presented a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare rapid susceptibility testing to conventional methods. We used Review Manager 5.4 to meta‐analyse the data. For other outcomes, which are time‐to‐event outcomes (time‐to‐discharge from hospital, time‐to‐first appropriate antibiotic change), we conducted qualitative narrative synthesis, due to heterogeneity of outcome measures.  
Main results
We included six trials, with 1638 participants. For rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.46; 6 RCTs, 1638 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, for rapid genotypic or molecular antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.49; 4 RCTs, 1074 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For phenotypic rapid susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups  (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.35; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
In qualitative analysis, rapid susceptibility testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐discharge (4 RCTs, 1165 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In qualitative analysis, rapid genotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (3 RCTs, 929 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, rapid phenotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may improve time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (RR ‐17.29, CI ‐45.05 to 10.47; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
Authors' conclusions
The theoretical benefits of rapid susceptibility testing have not been demonstrated to directly improve mortality, time‐to‐discharge, or time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic in these randomized studies. Future large prospective studies should be designed to focus on the most clinically meaningful outcomes, and aim to optimize blood culture pathways.

Fast Tests for Blood Infections: Do They Help Patients More Than Standard Tests?

## Rationale

**What is a bloodstream infection?**
A bloodstream infection happens when germs get into the blood. This is a serious problem that can make people very sick. Doctors need to find out which germ is causing the infection. They also need to know which medicines will kill that germ.

**How do doctors test for these infections?**
When doctors think someone has a blood infection, they take a blood sample. They send it to a lab to grow the germs. Then they test which medicines work against those germs. This is called susceptibility testing. Standard tests take a long time to give results, often one to two days.

**Why was this study needed?**
Researchers wanted to know if faster tests could help patients. Fast tests give results in 8 hours or less. Doctors hoped faster results would help them:
- Choose the right medicine sooner
- Help patients get better faster
- Reduce deaths
- Send patients home from the hospital sooner
- Use fewer strong medicines when not needed

Using the right amount of strong medicines is important. Too much use of these medicines can make germs harder to kill over time.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**
Researchers looked at six studies done between 1987 and 2020. These studies compared two groups of patients:
- One group got fast susceptibility tests (results in 8 hours or less)
- One group got standard susceptibility tests

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included 1,638 people total. All of them had bloodstream infections caused by bacteria. The studies included adults and children of any age. Both men and women were included.

**What types of fast tests were used?**
Two main types of fast tests were studied:
- Genetic tests: These look at the germ's genes to predict which medicines will work
- Phenotypic tests: These directly test if medicines can kill the germs, but do it faster than standard tests

**How long did the studies last?**
The studies followed patients during their hospital stay and recorded key health outcomes.

## Results

**What did the researchers find about deaths?**
Fast tests did not reduce the number of deaths compared to standard tests. About the same number of people died in both groups. This was true for both types of fast tests (genetic and phenotypic).

**What about time in the hospital?**
Fast tests did not help patients leave the hospital sooner. The time patients spent in the hospital was about the same in both groups.

**Did fast tests help doctors choose the right medicine sooner?**
The results were mixed:
- Genetic fast tests did not help doctors change to the right medicine faster
- Phenotypic fast tests might have helped a little, but the evidence was weak

**What do these results mean?**
The hoped-for benefits of fast tests were not clearly shown in these studies. Even though fast tests give results sooner, this did not directly help patients in measurable ways.

**What do the researchers conclude?**
More research is needed. Future studies should:
- Include more patients
- Focus on outcomes that matter most to patients
- Look at the whole process of treating blood infections, not just the tests

**Quality of the evidence**
The researchers rated the quality of evidence as low. This means we cannot be very certain about the findings. More high-quality studies are needed.",10.1002-14651858.CD013235,"Tests for identifying the most suitable antibiotics for a bacterial blood infection: are rapid tests better than standard tests? 
What is the aim of this Cochrane Review? 
People with blood infections need urgent treatment with antibiotics. Identifying the bacteria causing the infection helps ensure the right antibiotic is given. Rapid susceptibility tests are a technology to do this quickly, and aim to improve care. We sought to evaluate whether their use reduce deaths or shortens the illness. 
Key messages 
Rapid susceptibility tests to identify an appropriate antibiotic quickly for people with blood sepsis may make little to no difference to: 
· how many people die within 30 days of diagnosis of blood sepsis;
· how long people stay in hospital; 
· whether given a suitable antibiotic. 
Larger studies will help determine if using rapid susceptibility tests improves these outcomes. 
What was studied in this review? 
Susceptibility tests are done in a laboratory, and measure whether bacteria can grow when exposed to a variety of antibiotics, to assure that the antibiotics given are active against the organism causing the infection. The standard approach is to culture the blood samples, but this takes up to 36 hours to obtain a result. Rapid tests to identify bacteria causing blood infections, and their susceptibilities to antibiotics, provide results in eight hours or less. These rapid susceptibility tests include: 
· tests that look at the direct effect of antibiotics on bacteria (called phenotypic tests); and 
· tests that look for particular genes in the bacteria to see if they are susceptible, or resistant, to an antibiotic (called genotypic tests). 
What are the main results of this review? 
We found six studies that involved 1638 adults with blood infections. All studies took place in specialized medical centres in high‐income countries in Europe, the USA, and East Asia. 
Compared with standard tests, rapid susceptibility tests may make little to no difference to 
· how many people died within 30 days (evidence from six studies in 1638 people);
· how long people stayed in hospital (4 studies in 1165 people); or
· how long it took for people to be given the right antibiotic to treat the infection (5 studies in 1493 people). 
Phenotypic rapid susceptibility tests may reduce the time it takes to receive the right antibiotic; but this is uncertain (evidence from 2 studies in 564 people). 
Genotypic rapid susceptibility tests may make little or no difference to the time it takes to receive the right antibiotic (evidence from 4 studies in 1074 people). 
Our confidence in the results is limited because:
· the numbers of deaths reported in the studies were too low to show an important difference; 
· the tests used and the results from the studies varied widely;
· the studies did not include enough participants to enable firm conclusions.
Further research is likely to change these results.
How up to date is this review? 
We included evidence published up to 21 October 2020.

289,10.1002-14651858.CD013440.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Primary malignant brain tumours can have an unpredictable course, but high‐grade gliomas typically have a relentlessly progressive disease trajectory. They can cause profound symptom burden, affecting physical, neurocognitive, and social functioning from an early stage in the illness. This can significantly impact on role function and on the experiences and needs of informal caregivers. Access to specialist palliative and supportive care early in the disease trajectory, for those with high‐grade tumours in particular, has the potential to improve patients' and caregivers' quality of life. However, provision of palliative and supportive care for people with primary brain tumours ‐ and their informal caregivers ‐ is historically ill‐defined and ad hoc, and the benefits of early palliative interventions have not been confirmed. It is therefore important to define the role and effectiveness of early referral to specialist palliative care services and/or the effectiveness of other interventions focused on palliating disease impact on people and their informal caregivers. This would help guide improvement to service provision, by defining those interventions which are effective across a range of domains, and developing an evidence‐based model of integrated supportive and palliative care for this population. 
Objectives
To assess the evidence base for early palliative care interventions, including referral to specialist palliative care services compared to usual care, for improving outcomes in adults diagnosed with a primary brain tumour and their carers. 
Search methods
We conducted searches of electronic databases, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO (last searched 16 November 2021). We conducted searches to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative search terms. In addition to this, we searched for any currently recruiting trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and in the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal, and undertook citation tracking via Scopus. We also handsearched reference lists of potentially eligible systematic review articles to identify any other relevant studies, contacted experts in the field and searched key authors via Web of Science and searched SIGLE (System of Information on Grey Literature in Europe). 
Selection criteria
We included studies looking at early referral to specialist palliative care services ‐ or early targeted palliative interventions by other healthcare professionals ‐ for improving quality of life, symptom control, psychological outcomes, or overall survival as a primary or secondary outcome measure. Studies included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised studies (NRS), as well as qualitative and mixed‐methods studies where both qualitative and quantitative data were included. Participants were adults with a confirmed radiological and/or histological diagnosis of a primary malignant brain tumour, and/or informal adult carers (either at individual or family level) of people with a primary malignant brain tumour. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodological procedures for data extraction, management, and analysis. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for symptom control, i.e. cognitive function. 
Main results
We identified 9748 references from the searches, with 8337 remaining after duplicates were removed. After full‐text review, we included one trial. There were no studies of early specialist palliative care interventions or of early, co‐ordinated generalist palliative care approaches. 
The included randomised trial addressed a single symptom area, focusing on early cognitive rehabilitation, administered within two weeks of surgery in a mixed brain tumour population, of whom approximately half had a high‐grade glioma. The intervention was administered individually as therapist‐led computerised exercises over 16 one‐hour sessions, four times/week for four weeks. Sessions addressed several cognitive domains including time orientation, spatial orientation, visual attention, logical reasoning, memory, and executive function. 
There were no between‐group differences in outcome for tests of logical‐executive function, but differences were observed in the domains of visual attention and verbal memory. Risk of bias was assessed and stated as high for performance bias and attrition bias but for selective reporting it was unclear whether all outcomes were reported. We considered the certainty of the evidence, as assessed by GRADE, to be very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently there is a lack of research focusing on the introduction of early palliative interventions specifically for people with primary brain tumours, either as co‐ordinated specialist palliative care approaches or interventions focusing on a specific aspect of palliation. Future research should address the methodological shortcomings described in early palliative intervention studies in other cancers and chronic conditions. In particular, the specific population under investigation, the timing and the setting of the intervention should be clearly described and the standardised palliative care‐specific components of the intervention should be defined in detail.

## Plain Title
Early Palliative Care for Adults with Brain Tumors: A Review of Available Studies

## Rationale

**What are brain tumors and why are they a burden?**

Brain tumors are growths in the brain. Some brain tumors are cancer. High-grade gliomas are a type of brain cancer that grows fast. These tumors can cause many problems for patients. They can affect how people move, think, and interact with others. These problems can start early in the illness. Patients may have trouble doing daily tasks. Family members who care for these patients also face many challenges.

**Why was this study needed?**

Palliative care is special care that helps people feel better. It treats pain and other symptoms. It also helps with emotional and social needs. Getting palliative care early might help patients and their family caregivers have better quality of life. However, doctors do not have clear guidelines about when to start this care. The care given to brain tumor patients has not been well organized. Researchers wanted to find out if early palliative care really helps. This information would help doctors know the best way to care for brain tumor patients and their families.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to see if early palliative care helps adults with brain tumors. They also wanted to know if it helps family caregivers. They looked for studies that tested early palliative care compared to usual care.

## Trial Design

**How did researchers look for answers?**

This was not a new study with patients. Instead, researchers searched for all existing studies on this topic. They looked in many medical databases. They searched until November 2021. They looked for studies that tested early palliative care for brain tumor patients. They wanted studies that measured quality of life, symptom control, emotional health, or survival.

**What types of studies did they look for?**

They looked for studies with adult patients. These patients had brain tumors confirmed by scans or tissue tests. They also looked for studies that included adult family caregivers. The studies could use different research methods.

## Results

**What did researchers find?**

Researchers found 9,748 articles to review. After removing duplicates and reviewing carefully, they found only one study that fit their criteria. This study did not test early palliative care as a whole. Instead, it tested one specific treatment: cognitive rehabilitation.

**What was the one study about?**

The study looked at brain exercises to help thinking skills. Patients started these exercises within two weeks after brain surgery. About half of the patients had fast-growing brain cancer. A therapist worked with each patient one-on-one. Patients did computer exercises for one hour, four times each week, for four weeks. This was 16 sessions total. The exercises worked on memory, attention, reasoning, and other thinking skills.

**What were the results of that study?**

The brain exercises helped some thinking skills but not others. Patients who did the exercises showed improvement in visual attention and verbal memory. They did not show improvement in logical thinking or planning skills. However, the study had some problems with how it was done. Some patients dropped out. This made the results less reliable.

**What do these findings mean?**

There is not enough research on early palliative care for brain tumor patients. Researchers found no studies testing complete palliative care programs started early. They found only one small study on brain exercises. More research is needed. Future studies should clearly describe what palliative care includes. They should explain when care starts and where it happens. They should describe the patients being studied in detail.

**Conclusion**

Doctors do not yet have good evidence about whether early palliative care helps brain tumor patients and their families. More high-quality research is urgently needed to answer this important question.",10.1002-14651858.CD013440,"Improving the outcome of people with primary brain tumours and their carers using early palliative interventions 
Why this question is important 
Brain tumours can have a significant impact on people and their carers. Brain tumours can impair people's physical, neurocognitive, and social functioning, which can affect the whole family, particularly informal caregivers, who often receive inadequate support. There is evidence in other cancers that providing access to palliative support in the early stages of a person's illness can help to improve their, and their caregivers', quality of life. However, it has not been confirmed that this is the case for people with brain tumours. 
Objectives 
We aimed to assess studies that included early palliative care interventions, including referral to specialist palliative care services compared to usual care, for improving outcomes in adults diagnosed with a primary brain tumour and their carers. 
How we searched for evidence 
We searched electronic medical literature databases for studies that included a range of different types of medical trials, both published and ongoing. We handsearched the reference lists of key papers and searched for key authors of research in the area. We included adults confirmed with a primary brain tumour and informal caregivers such as relatives. 
What we found 
We could not find any trials examining the impact of specialist palliative care teams on outcomes for patients or their carers. We included one trial which focused on a single symptom area – that of cognition – in a patient group of whom about half had a high‐grade tumour. The trial randomised patients between a group receiving a structured cognitive rehabilitation intervention and a group receiving usual rehabilitation care of medications and physiotherapy. Cognitive rehabilitation consisted of supervised computer‐based exercises, lasting 45 minutes at a time, four times a week, over a four‐week period. There was no important difference between the two groups apart from some improvement in visual attention and verbal memory in those who received the cognitive rehabilitation intervention. However, we assessed the certainty of the evidence as being very low, and we could find no evidence in this or other studies on any other aspect of palliative care. 
What this means 
Not enough research has been undertaken on early palliative care interventions which support people with primary brain tumours, and their caregivers. Research is needed which examines co‐ordinated approaches to overall palliative care provision, and interventions which focus on specific aspects of palliation in this population.

People with neuromuscular disorders may have a weak, ineffective cough predisposing them to respiratory complications. Cough augmentation techniques aim to improve cough effectiveness and mucous clearance, reduce the frequency and duration of respiratory infections requiring hospital admission, and improve quality of life. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders. 
Search methods
On 13 April 2020, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and randomised cross‐over trials. 
Selection criteria
We included trials of cough augmentation techniques compared to no treatment, alternative techniques, or combinations thereof, in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were the number and duration of unscheduled hospitalisations for acute respiratory exacerbations. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
The review included 11 studies involving 287 adults and children, aged three to 73 years. Inadequately reported cross‐over studies and the limited additional information provided by authors severely restricted the number of analyses that could be performed. 
Studies compared manually assisted cough, mechanical insufflation, manual and mechanical breathstacking, mechanical insufflation‐exsufflation, glossopharyngeal breathing, and combination techniques to unassisted cough and alternative or sham interventions. None of the included studies reported on the primary outcomes of this review (number and duration of unscheduled hospital admissions) or listed 'adverse events' as primary or secondary outcome measures. 
The evidence suggests that a range of cough augmentation techniques may increase peak cough flow compared to unassisted cough (199 participants, 8 RCTs), but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little to no difference in peak cough flow outcomes between alternative cough augmentation techniques (216 participants, 9 RCTs). 
There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of interventions on measures of gaseous exchange, pulmonary function, quality of life, general function, or participant preference and satisfaction. 
Authors' conclusions
We are very uncertain about the safety and efficacy of cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders and further studies are needed. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Techniques to Help People with Muscle and Nerve Diseases Cough Better

## What Was This Study About?

People with muscle and nerve diseases often have weak muscles. This includes the muscles used for coughing. A weak cough makes it hard to clear mucus from the lungs. This can lead to lung infections that may require a hospital stay.

Researchers wanted to find out if special techniques to help people cough work well and are safe. These techniques include:
- Having someone push on the chest or belly to help with coughing
- Using machines that blow air into the lungs
- Using machines that both blow air in and pull air out
- Special breathing exercises

The researchers thought these techniques might help people cough more strongly. This could help clear mucus better and prevent lung infections. The study was needed because doctors wanted to know which techniques work best and if they are safe to use.

## How Was This Study Designed?

The researchers looked at 11 different studies. These studies included 287 people with muscle and nerve diseases. The people in the studies were between 3 and 73 years old. Both children and adults were included.

The studies compared different cough-helping techniques. Some people used machines or got help from others to cough. Other people coughed on their own without help. The researchers measured how strong the coughs were.

Each person's time in the original studies varied. The researchers combined the results from all these studies to see what they could learn.

## What Were the Main Results?

The researchers wanted to know two main things:
- How many times people went to the hospital for lung problems
- How long they stayed in the hospital

Unfortunately, none of the 11 studies measured these important outcomes. The studies also did not track if the techniques caused any harm or side effects.

The studies did measure how strong people's coughs were. The results suggest that cough-helping techniques might make coughs stronger than coughing without help. However, the researchers are very unsure about this finding. The quality of the evidence was very low.

When comparing different cough-helping techniques to each other, there was little difference. No technique seemed clearly better than another.

The studies did not provide enough information about:
- How well people's lungs worked
- How much oxygen was in their blood
- Quality of life
- Daily activities
- Which techniques people liked best

## What Does This Mean?

The researchers cannot say for certain if cough-helping techniques work well or are safe. The studies had problems that made it hard to trust the results. Many studies were small. They did not measure the most important outcomes. The researchers could not combine the results properly.

More and better studies are needed. Future studies should:
- Include more people
- Measure hospital visits and stays
- Track side effects carefully
- Follow people for longer periods
- Ask people about their quality of life

Until better studies are done, doctors and patients cannot be sure which cough-helping techniques work best. Families and doctors should talk together about the options. They should consider what might work best for each person.

**Word count: 523 words**",10.1002-14651858.CD013170,"The safety and effectiveness of techniques to assist coughing in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of techniques used to assist coughing in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders (cough augmentation techniques). 
Background 
People with neuromuscular disorders (nerve‐related conditions that affect the muscles) may have difficulty coughing and clearing mucous from the airways, placing them at risk of choking, recurrent chest infections, and ongoing lung disease. Cough augmentation techniques, such as manually assisted cough, bagging (using a self‐inflating bag commonly used for resuscitation), mechanical Cough Assist (a device that clears secretions by applying a positive pressure to the airway, then rapidly shifting to a negative pressure), 'frog' breathing (a method of breathing to help a person take in a bigger volume of air), and breathstacking (the person takes a number of sequential breaths in, stacking one breath on top of the other without breathing out in between breaths) aim to improve cough effectiveness, with the eventual aim of reducing the number or severity (or both) of chest infections, and improving the ability of people to perform daily activities (functional ability) and quality of life. 
Methods 
We carried out a wide database search for studies of cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders. We selected studies that assigned people to the treatment(s) or treatment order by chance, as this study type provides the best evidence. 
Results and quality of the evidence 
We found 11 studies with 287 people and several cough augmentation techniques. One study measured the long‐term effects of treatment, but was only published as an abstract without enough information to accurately analyse the study findings. Many included studies had problems with how they were performed, how their findings were reported, or both, which made it difficult to fully interpret their results. None of the studies reported on the outcomes we thought were the most important for making decisions about the effectiveness and safety of cough augmentation techniques. For example, the studies did not report on the number or duration of unscheduled hospital admissions for chest infections, survival, functional ability, or quality of life. The safety of cough augmentation techniques could not be determined. Some studies suggested that cough augmentation techniques may be better than an unassisted cough, but the results are very uncertain. There was not enough evidence to show that any one technique was better than another in improving cough effort. 
Conclusions and recommendation 
The findings of this review provided insufficient information to make decisions about when and how to use cough augmentation techniques in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders. There is currently very low certainty evidence for or against the safety and effectiveness of cough augmentation techniques in people with chronic neuromuscular diseases and more studies are needed. 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 13 April 2020.

Disease recurrence and progression remain major challenges in the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Blue light‐enhanced transurethral resection of bladder cancer (TURBT) is an approach to improve staging and achieve a complete resection of NMIBC. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of blue light‐enhanced TURBT compared to white light‐based TURBT in the treatment of NMIBC. 
Search methods
We searched several medical literature databases, including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase, as well as trial registers, including ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We performed a comprehensive search with no restrictions on language of publication or publication status until March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials using blue light versus white light TURBT. Included participants had a high level of suspicion based on imaging or ‘visible diagnosis’ for primary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder or recurrent urothelial carcinoma of the bladder upon cytoscopy. We excluded studies in which blue light was used in a surveillance setting.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Our primary outcomes were time to disease recurrence, time to disease progression, and serious surgical complications. Secondary outcomes were time to death from bladder cancer, any adverse events, and non‐serious complications. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 16 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 4325 participants in the review. The studies compared blue light versus white light TURBT for treatment of NMIBC.  
Primary outcomes 
Blue light TURBT may reduce the risk of disease recurrence over time (hazard ratio (HR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.81; low‐certainty evidence) depending on baseline risk. For participants with low‐, intermediate‐, and high‐risk NMIBC, this corresponded to 48 (66 fewer to 27 fewer), 109 (152 fewer to 59 fewer), and 147 (211 fewer to 76 fewer) fewer recurrences per 1000 participants when compared to white light TURBT, respectively.  
Blue light TURBT may also reduce the risk of disease progression over time (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.84; low‐certainty evidence) depending on baseline risk. For participants with low‐, intermediate‐, and high‐risk NMIBC, this corresponded to 1 (1 fewer to 0 fewer), 17 (25 fewer to 8 fewer), and 56 (81 fewer to 25 fewer) fewer progressions per 1000 participants when compared to white light TURBT, respectively. 
Blue light TURBT may have little or no effect on serious surgical complications (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.14; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponded to 10 fewer (19 fewer to 25 more) surgical complications per 1000 participants with blue light TURBT.  
Secondary outcomes 
Blue light TURBT may have little or no effect on the risk of death from bladder cancer over time (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.61; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponded to 22 deaths per 1000 participants with white light TURBT and 10 fewer (17 fewer to 13 more) deaths per 1000 participants with blue light TURBT.   
We are very uncertain how blue light TURBT affects the outcome adverse events of any grade (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33; low‐certainty evidence).  
No analysis was possible for the outcome non‐serious surgical complications, as it was not reported by any of the included studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Blue light‐enhanced TURBT for the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer compared to white light‐based TURBT may reduce the risk of disease recurrence and disease progression over time depending on baseline risk. There may be little or no effect on serious surgical complications. The certainty of evidence for our findings was low, meaning that future studies are likely change to the reported estimates of effect. Frequent issues that led to downgrading of the certainty of the evidence were study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision.  
","# Plain Language Summary: Blue Light Surgery for Early Bladder Cancer

## Plain Title

Using Blue Light During Surgery to Remove Early Bladder Cancer

## Rationale

**What is bladder cancer and why is it a problem?**

Bladder cancer starts in the bladder, the organ that holds urine. Early bladder cancer grows only in the inner lining of the bladder. Doctors call this non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, or NMIBC.

NMIBC is a big problem for patients. The cancer often comes back after treatment. Sometimes it also gets worse and spreads deeper into the bladder wall.

**What is the usual treatment?**

Doctors remove bladder tumors through surgery. They use a thin tube with a camera and cutting tools. This tube goes through the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). The surgery is called TURBT. Doctors normally use white light to see the tumors during surgery.

**Why was this study needed?**

Sometimes white light makes it hard to see all the cancer. Small tumors can be missed. When tumors are left behind, the cancer comes back.

Blue light may help doctors see tumors better. A special dye is put in the bladder before surgery. Cancer cells absorb this dye. When blue light shines on them, the cancer cells glow pink or red. Normal tissue looks blue.

**What did researchers want to learn?**

Researchers wanted to know if blue light surgery works better than white light surgery. They wanted to see if blue light helps stop cancer from coming back or getting worse.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a review of many studies. Researchers looked at 16 different studies. These studies included 4,325 people in total.

**Who was in the studies?**

All patients had early bladder cancer (NMIBC). Some had cancer for the first time. Others had cancer that came back. Doctors suspected cancer based on scans or what they saw during a bladder exam.

**What did the studies compare?**

Half the patients had surgery using blue light. The other half had surgery using white light. Researchers then compared the results between the two groups.

**How long did the studies last?**

The review looked at studies done up to March 2021. Each study followed patients for different lengths of time to see if cancer came back.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

**Cancer coming back:** Blue light surgery may reduce the chance of cancer coming back. The results varied based on how serious the cancer was:
- For low-risk cancer: 48 fewer people out of 1,000 had cancer return
- For medium-risk cancer: 109 fewer people out of 1,000 had cancer return
- For high-risk cancer: 147 fewer people out of 1,000 had cancer return

**Cancer getting worse:** Blue light surgery may also reduce the chance of cancer spreading deeper:
- For low-risk cancer: 1 fewer person out of 1,000 had cancer spread
- For medium-risk cancer: 17 fewer people out of 1,000 had cancer spread
- For high-risk cancer: 56 fewer people out of 1,000 had cancer spread

**Safety:** Blue light surgery may cause about the same number of serious problems as white light surgery. Out of 1,000 people, there were 10 fewer serious problems with blue light. But this difference was very small.

**Deaths from cancer:** Blue light surgery may have little effect on deaths from bladder cancer. The difference was too small to be certain.

**Side effects:** Researchers were not sure if blue light caused more or fewer side effects overall.

**What do these results mean?**

Blue light surgery may help patients by finding more cancer during surgery. This may stop cancer from coming back or getting worse. The surgery appears to be safe.

However, the quality of the evidence was low. This means future studies might show different results. More research is needed to be more certain about these findings.

**Why is this important?**

This study shows that blue light surgery is a promising option for treating early bladder cancer. It may help patients stay cancer-free longer.",10.1002-14651858.CD013776,"Blue light‐enhanced versus white light resection in the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer 
Review question 
How does a resection (surgical removal) of bladder cancer supported with a special visualization method (blue light) compare to a standard resection with white light in people in whom a tumor of the inner bladder wall is suspected? 
Background 
In people suspected of having bladder cancer, suspicious tissue is cut from the inner bladder wall using a special instrument inserted through the urethra into the bladder. However, it is sometimes difficult to tell what is normal bladder versus what is cancer. In order to see the tumor better and remove it completely, a substance, or 'contrast agent,' is put into the bladder through a catheter. During surgery, a special light is used that is meant to make the cancerous area light up blue.  
Study characteristics 
We only included randomized controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) for inclusion in the review, as this type of clinical study is considered to be of the highest quality producing the most reliable results. We included people who were very likely to have had bladder cancer because if had been seen on an imaging study (like a computed tomography (CT) scan) or when looking into the bladder. We included studies of people with newly suspected tumors and those who had been treated for bladder cancer before and there was concern it had come back.  
Key results 
We included 16 studies addressing our review question. Overall, blue light‐enhanced resection of bladder cancer may reduce the risk of disease recurrence over time compared to white light resection (low‐certainty evidence) and may reduce the risk of disease progression over time (low‐certainty evidence). However, whether this effect is big enough to be meaningful to people with bladder cancer depends on whether they belong to the low, intermediate and high risk group for disease recurrence or progression.   
We also found that blue light may have little or no effect on the occurrence of serious surgical complications (low‐certainty evidence) or the risk of death from bladder cancer over time (low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain as to whether blue light TURBT reduces the incidence of unwanted side effects, as the certainty of the evidence was assessed as low. We do not know how non‐serious surgical complications are affected as no data were reported for this outcome. 
Quality of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence was low, meaning that future research would likely change our results.

292,10.1002-14651858.CD011345.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Fertility problems are very common, as subfertility affects about 10% to 15% of couples trying to conceive. There are many factors that may impact a couple's ability to conceive and one of these may be incorrect timing of intercourse. Conception is only possible from approximately five days before up to several hours after ovulation. Therefore, to be effective, intercourse must take place during this fertile period. 'Timed intercourse' is the practice of prospectively identifying ovulation and, thus, the fertile period to increase the likelihood of conception. Whilst timed intercourse may increase conception rates and reduce unnecessary intervention and costs, there may be associated adverse aspects including time consumption and stress. Ovulation prediction methods used for timing intercourse include urinary hormone measurement (luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen), tracking basal body temperatures, cervical mucus investigation, calendar charting and ultrasonography. This review considered the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the use of timed intercourse on positive pregnancy outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and risks of ovulation prediction methods for timing intercourse on conception in couples trying to conceive. 
Search methods
We searched the following sources to identify relevant randomised controlled trials, the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, LILACS, Web of Knowledge, the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Register Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Furthermore, we manually searched the references of relevant articles. The search was not restricted by language or publication status. The last search was on 5 August 2014. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction or comparing different methods of ovulation prediction for timing intercourse against each other in couples trying to conceive. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The primary review outcomes were cumulative live birth and adverse events (such as quality of life, depression and stress). Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, pregnancy (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) and time to conception. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods. 
Main results
We included five RCTs (2840 women or couples) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction. Unfortunately one large study (n = 1453) reporting live birth and pregnancy had not published outcome data by randomised group and therefore could not be analysed. Consequently, four RCTs (n = 1387) were included in the meta‐analysis. The evidence was of low to very low quality. Main limitations for downgrading the evidence included imprecision, lack of reporting clinically relevant outcomes and the high risk of publication bias. 
One study reported live birth, but the sample size was too small to draw any relevant conclusions on the effect of timed intercourse (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.41, 1 RCT, n = 17, very low quality). One study reported stress as an adverse event. There was no evidence of a difference in levels of stress (mean difference 1.98, 95 CI% ‐0.87 to 4.83, 1 RCT, n = 77, low level evidence). No other studies reported adverse events. Two studies reported clinical pregnancy. There was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.12, 2 RCTs, n = 177, I2 = 0%, low level evidence). This suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 16%, the chance of success following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%.Four studies reported pregnancy rate (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy). Timed intercourse was associated with higher pregnancy rates compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction in couples trying to conceive (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.71, 4 RCTs, n = 1387, I2 = 0%, very low level evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. Subgroup analysis by duration of subfertility showed no difference in effect between couples trying to conceive for < 12 months versus couples trying for ≥ 12 months. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. 
Authors' conclusions
There are insufficient data available to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of timed intercourse for the outcomes of live birth, adverse events and clinical pregnancy. Timed intercourse may improve pregnancy rates (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction. The quality of this evidence is low to very low and therefore findings should be regarded with caution. There is a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished 8 years after recruitment finished. Further research is required, reporting clinically relevant outcomes (live birth, clinical pregnancy rates and adverse effects), to determine if timed intercourse is safe and effective in couples trying to conceive. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Timing Sex to Improve Chances of Getting Pregnant

## Plain Title
Does timing sex around ovulation help couples get pregnant?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**
About 10 to 15 out of every 100 couples have trouble getting pregnant. This is called subfertility. Many things can make it hard for a couple to have a baby.

**What causes the problem?**
One reason couples may not get pregnant is timing. A woman can only get pregnant during a short time each month. This time is called the fertile period. It starts about 5 days before the egg is released (called ovulation) and ends a few hours after. If a couple has sex outside this time, pregnancy cannot happen.

**What is timed intercourse?**
Timed intercourse means figuring out when ovulation will happen. Then the couple has sex during the fertile period. This may help them get pregnant faster.

**How do couples predict ovulation?**
There are several ways to predict ovulation:
- Testing urine for certain hormones
- Taking body temperature each morning
- Checking cervical mucus (fluid from the cervix)
- Using a calendar to track cycles
- Using ultrasound scans

**Why was this study needed?**
Doctors wanted to know if timing sex really helps couples get pregnant. They also wanted to know if it causes problems like stress or worry. Timing sex might help couples avoid costly medical treatments. But it might also take extra time and cause stress.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**
Researchers looked for studies that tested timed intercourse. They searched medical databases and study records. They found 5 studies with 2,840 women or couples.

**Who was in the studies?**
The studies included couples who were trying to get pregnant. Some couples had been trying for less than 12 months. Other couples had been trying for 12 months or longer.

**What did the studies compare?**
The studies compared two groups:
- Couples who timed sex using ovulation prediction
- Couples who had sex without tracking ovulation

**How long were people in the studies?**
The studies followed couples for different lengths of time. Most studies tracked couples until they got pregnant or for several months.

## Results

**What were the main results?**

The researchers could not draw strong conclusions from these studies. Here is what they found:

**Live births:** Only 1 small study (17 women) looked at live births. The study was too small to tell if timed intercourse helps.

**Stress and quality of life:** Only 1 study looked at stress levels. It found no difference in stress between the two groups. No other studies looked at side effects or problems.

**Clinical pregnancy:** Two studies looked at confirmed pregnancies. They found no clear difference between groups. If 16 out of 100 couples get pregnant without timing sex, then 9 to 33 out of 100 might get pregnant with timed intercourse.

**Any pregnancy:** Four studies looked at any type of pregnancy report. Timed intercourse may increase pregnancy rates. If 13 out of 100 couples get pregnant without timing sex, then 14 to 23 out of 100 might get pregnant with timed intercourse.

**Time to get pregnant:** One study looked at how long it took to get pregnant. It found no difference between groups.

**Important problems with the studies:**
- One large study with 1,453 women never published its results. This study started 8 years ago.
- The studies were small and had quality problems.
- Most studies did not look at live births or side effects.
- The evidence quality was low to very low.

**What do the results mean?**
Timed intercourse might help couples get pregnant. But the evidence is weak. Researchers need better studies to know if timing sex really works and if it is safe.

**What is needed next?**
Future studies should look at:
- Live birth rates (the most important outcome)
- Confirmed pregnancy rates
- Side effects like stress and relationship problems
- Whether timing sex is worth the extra effort

**Conclusions:**
There is not enough good evidence to say if timing sex helps couples have babies. More research is needed before doctors can recommend this approach.",10.1002-14651858.CD011345,"Timed intercourse for couples with subfertility
Review question 
Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the effect of timed intercourse versus spontaneous intercourse in couples trying to conceive. 
Background 
Many couples find it difficult to achieve a pregnancy and have concerns about their fertility. Each cycle, a woman is fertile from approximately five days before ovulation until several hours after ovulation, due to limited survival times of the sperm and egg. Therefore, prospectively identifying this fertile period of a woman's menstrual cycle, to guide timing of intercourse, may improve conception rates. This may reduce unnecessary medical treatment and costs of advanced infertility treatment, but could also cause adverse events such as stress. The fertile period can be identified by different methods including urinary fertility monitoring, calendar charting, observing changes in cervical mucous and basal body temperatures or follicular maturation on ultrasound. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and risks of timed intercourse on pregnancy outcomes in couples trying to conceive. 
Study characteristics 
We found five randomised controlled trials comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction, in a total of 2840 women or couples trying to conceive. The evidence was current to August 2014. 
Key results 
One large included study (1453 women) has not published usable results and could therefore not be analysed. One study reported live birth rates and found no evidence of a difference; however, the study was too small to have any clinical value. Only one study reported levels of stress and showed no evidence of a difference between timed intercourse with urinary fertility monitoring and intercourse without urinary fertility monitoring. No other adverse events were reported. Only two studies reported clinical pregnancy rates, and showed no evidence of a difference in pregnancy rates in couples with subfertility. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was assumed to be 16%, the chance of a clinical pregnancy following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%. However, if including self‐reported pregnancies (not confirmed by ultrasound), pregnancy rates were higher after timed intercourse. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. 
No difference in effect was found between couples trying to conceive for less than 12 months versus 12 months or more. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low for all outcomes. The main limitations of the evidence were imprecision, poor reporting of clinically relevant outcomes and a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished. Therefore, the findings should be regarded with caution.

293,10.1002-14651858.CD013792.pub2-abstract.txt,"Background
Miscarriage, defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks’ gestation, is common with approximately 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime, and 15% to 20% of pregnancies ending in a miscarriage. Progesterone has an important role in maintaining a pregnancy, and supplementation with different progestogens in early pregnancy has been attempted to rescue a pregnancy in women with early pregnancy bleeding (threatened miscarriage), and to prevent miscarriages in asymptomatic women who have a history of three or more previous miscarriages (recurrent miscarriage). 
Objectives
To estimate the relative effectiveness and safety profiles for the different progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage, and provide rankings of the available treatments according to their effectiveness, safety, and side‐effect profile. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to 15 December 2020: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE(R), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness or safety of progestogen treatment for the prevention of miscarriage. Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Randomised trials published only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information could be retrieved. We excluded quasi‐ and non‐randomised trials. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We performed pairwise meta‐analyses and indirect comparisons, where possible, to determine the relative effects of all available treatments, but due to the limited number of included studies only direct or indirect comparisons were possible. We estimated the relative effects for the primary outcome of live birth and the secondary outcomes including miscarriage (< 24 weeks of gestation), preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, congenital abnormalities, and adverse drug events. Relative effects for all outcomes are reported separately by the type of miscarriage (threatened and recurrent miscarriage). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
Our meta‐analysis included seven randomised trials involving 5,682 women, and all provided data for meta‐analysis. All trials were conducted in hospital settings. Across seven trials (14 treatment arms), the following treatments were used: three arms (21%) used vaginal micronized progesterone; three arms (21%) used dydrogesterone; one arm (7%) used oral micronized progesterone; one arm (7%) used 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone, and six arms (43%) used placebo. 
Women with threatened miscarriage  
Based on the relative effects from the pairwise meta‐analysis, vaginal micronized progesterone (two trials, 4090 women, risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.07, high‐certainty evidence), and dydrogesterone (one trial, 406 women, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.07, moderate‐certainty evidence) probably make little or no difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo for women with threatened miscarriage. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with threatened miscarriage. 
The pre‐specified subgroup analysis by number of previous miscarriages is only possible for vaginal micronized progesterone in women with threatened miscarriage. In women with no previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, there is probably little or no improvement in the live birth rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04, high‐certainty evidence) when treated with vaginal micronized progesterone compared to placebo. However, for women with one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, vaginal micronized progesterone increases the live birth rate compared to placebo (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15, high‐certainty evidence). 
Women with recurrent miscarriage  
Based on the results from one trial (826 women) vaginal micronized progesterone (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.15, high‐certainty evidence) probably makes little or no difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage. The evidence for dydrogesterone compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage is of very low‐certainty evidence, therefore the effects remain unclear. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage. 
Additional outcomes  
All progestogen treatments have a wide range of effects on the other pre‐specified outcomes (miscarriage (< 24 weeks of gestation), preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy) in comparison to placebo for both threatened and recurrent miscarriage. Moderate‐ and low‐certainty evidence with a wide range of effects suggests that there is probably no difference in congenital abnormalities and adverse drug events with vaginal micronized progesterone for threatened (congenital abnormalities RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.46, moderate‐certainty evidence; adverse drug events RR 1.07 95% CI 0.81 to 1.39, moderate‐certainty evidence) or recurrent miscarriage (congenital abnormalities 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.85, low‐certainty evidence; adverse drug events RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.29, moderate‐certainty evidence) compared with placebo. There are limited data and very low‐certainty evidence on congenital abnormalities and adverse drug events for the other progestogens. 
Authors' conclusions
The overall available evidence suggests that progestogens probably make little or no difference to live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. However, vaginal micronized progesterone may increase the live birth rate for women with a history of one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, with likely no difference in adverse events. There is still uncertainty over the effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Progesterone Treatments for Preventing Miscarriage

## Plain Title

Do progesterone-like medications help prevent miscarriage in women with bleeding in early pregnancy or a history of repeated miscarriages?

## Rationale

**What is miscarriage and why is it important?**

Miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before 24 weeks. This is very common. About 1 in 4 women will have a miscarriage in their lifetime. About 15 to 20 out of every 100 pregnancies end in miscarriage.

**What is progesterone?**

Progesterone is a natural hormone that helps keep a pregnancy healthy. Some women have low levels of this hormone. Doctors thought that giving extra progesterone might help prevent miscarriage.

**Why was this study needed?**

Researchers wanted to test if progesterone-like drugs (called progestogens) could help two groups of women:
- Women who have bleeding in early pregnancy (called threatened miscarriage)
- Women who have had three or more miscarriages before (called recurrent miscarriage)

The study looked at different types of progesterone treatments. It compared how well they work and if they are safe.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at seven studies that included 5,682 women total. All studies took place in hospitals.

**Who was in the studies?**

The studies included pregnant women in two groups:
- Women with bleeding in early pregnancy
- Women with a history of repeated miscarriages

**What treatments were tested?**

The studies tested different progesterone-like drugs:
- Vaginal micronized progesterone (inserted into the vagina)
- Dydrogesterone (taken by mouth)
- Oral micronized progesterone (taken by mouth)
- 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone (given by injection)
- Placebo (a dummy treatment with no active drug)

**How long did the studies last?**

The studies followed women through their pregnancies. They tracked whether women had live births.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

**For women with bleeding in early pregnancy:**

Most progesterone treatments made little or no difference to live birth rates. However, one important finding stood out:

- Women who had one or more previous miscarriages AND bleeding in their current pregnancy did benefit from vaginal progesterone
- For every 100 women in this group, about 8 more had live births when using vaginal progesterone
- Women with no previous miscarriages did not benefit from vaginal progesterone

Dydrogesterone probably made little or no difference to live birth rates.

**For women with repeated miscarriages:**

Vaginal progesterone probably made little or no difference to live birth rates. The results for other treatments were unclear.

**Were the treatments safe?**

The treatments appeared safe. There was probably no difference in:
- Birth defects in babies
- Side effects for mothers

The side effects that did occur were generally mild.

**What does this mean?**

Overall, progesterone treatments do not help most women prevent miscarriage. But there is one exception:

Vaginal progesterone may help women who have both:
1. A history of one or more previous miscarriages, AND
2. Bleeding in their current pregnancy

For this specific group of women, vaginal progesterone increased live births. The treatment appeared safe with no increase in birth defects or serious side effects.

**What is still unknown?**

More research is needed to understand:
- How well other types of progesterone work
- The best dose and timing of treatment
- Long-term safety for mothers and babies

**Conclusion:**

Doctors should consider vaginal progesterone for women with previous miscarriages who have bleeding in early pregnancy. For other women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage, progesterone treatments probably do not help.",10.1002-14651858.CD013792,"Are progestogen treatments effective in preventing miscarriage?
We set out to find out which progestogen treatment is most effective, safe, and has fewer side‐effects for preventing miscarriage in women with threatened and with recurrent miscarriage, using evidence from randomised controlled trials. We looked at the number of women who went on to have a live birth, or miscarriage. 
What is the issue? 
Miscarriage is the most common cause of early pregnancy loss in the first 24 weeks and one of the most common complications in early pregnancy. An estimated 15% to 20% of pregnancies will end in a miscarriage, with 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. Women can be at risk of a miscarriage if they experience early pregnancy bleeding, or if they have a history of previous miscarriages. 
Why is this important? 
Progesterone is an important pregnancy hormone that helps to maintain a pregnancy. A variety of different progesterone‐like treatments (known as progestogens) have been used to treat women with early pregnancy bleeding. They are also used to prevent miscarriage in women with a history of previous miscarriages. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness, safety, and side‐effects of the available progestogens for preventing miscarriage in these different groups of women. We wanted to find out which, if any, of the treatments is the most effective and safest. We collected and analysed all the relevant studies to answer this question. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in December 2020 and identified seven studies involving 5,682 women. All women were managed in hospitals. Women were diagnosed with early pregnancy bleeding (known as threatened miscarriage), or had a history of three or more previous miscarriages (known as recurrent miscarriage). Four different progestogen treatments were used: vaginal micronized progesterone, oral dydrogesterone, oral micronized progesterone and 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone injected into muscle. In six of the studies the treatments were compared to inactive placebo. 
Three studies involved 4496 women with threatened miscarriage, some of whom had previously experienced a miscarriage. Overall, vaginal micronized progesterone (high‐quality evidence) and oral dydrogesterone (moderate‐quality evidence) made little difference to the number of women who went on to have a live birth when compared with placebo. We further studied the women who had experienced a previous miscarriage, were now presenting with a threatened miscarriage, and were given vaginal micronized progesterone or placebo. For women with one or more previous miscarriages, vaginal micronized progesterone increased the live birth rate compared to placebo (high‐quality evidence). Those women who had no previous miscarriages, but were now presenting with early pregnancy bleeding showed no improvement in live birth rate (high‐certainty evidence). 
For women with recurrent miscarriage, we based our findings on one study involving 826 women. Overall, vaginal micronized progesterone made little difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo. The evidence for dydrogesterone compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage is of very low‐certainty evidence, therefore the effects remain unclear. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage. 
From the available data, there are likely no differences in adverse events associated with vaginal micronized progesterone. There was no difference in birth defects and side effects with vaginal micronized progesterone when compared with placebo. There was not enough information about safety and birth defects for us to analyse for all the other treatments. 
What does this mean? 
The overall available evidence suggests that progestogens probably make little or no difference to live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. Vaginal micronized progesterone may increase the live birth rate for women who are experiencing early pregnancy bleeding and have a history of one or more previous miscarriages, with likely no difference in adverse events. There is still uncertainty over the effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage.

Human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a severe disease affecting people in the poorest parts of Africa. It is usually fatal without treatment. Conventional treatments require days of intravenous infusion, but a recently developed drug, fexinidazole, can be given orally. Another oral drug candidate, acoziborole, is undergoing clinical development and will be considered in subsequent editions.   
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of currently used drugs for treating second‐stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense trypanosomiasis (gambiense human African trypanosomiasis, g‐HAT). 
Search methods
On 14 May 2021, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database, BIOSIS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also searched reference lists of included studies, contacted researchers working in the field, and contacted relevant organizations. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials that included adults and children with second‐stage g‐HAT, treated with anti‐trypanosomal drugs currently in use. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias; a third review author acted as an arbitrator if needed. The included trial only reported dichotomous outcomes, which we presented as risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).   
Main results
We included one trial comparing fexinidazole to nifurtimox combined with eflornithine (NECT). This trial was conducted between October 2012 and November 2016 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic, and included 394 participants. The study reported on efficacy and safety, with up to 24 months' follow‐up.  We judged the study to be at low risk of bias in all domains except blinding;  as the route of administration and dosing regimens differed between treatment groups,  participants and personnel were not blinded, resulting in a high risk of performance bias.   
Mortality with fexinidazole may be higher at 24 months compared to NECT. There were 9/264 deaths in the fexinidazole group and 2/130 deaths in the NECT group (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.49 to 10.11; 394 participants; low‐certainty evidence). None of the deaths were related to treatment. 
Fexinidazole likely results in an increase in the number of people relapsing during follow‐up, with 14 participants in the fexinidazole group (14/264) and none in the NECT group (0/130) relapsing at 24 months (RD 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.08; 394 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
 We are uncertain whether there is any difference between the drugs regarding the incidence of serious adverse events at 24 months. (31/264 with fexinidazole and 13/130 with NECT group at 24 months). Adverse events were common with both drugs (247/264 with fexinidazole versus 121/130 with NECT), with no difference between groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; 394 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Authors' conclusions
Oral treatment with fexinidazole is much easier to administer than conventional treatment, but deaths and relapse appear to be more common. However, the advantages or an oral option are considerable, in terms of convenience, avoiding hospitalisation and multiple intravenous infusions, thus increasing adherence. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Oral Medicine to Standard Treatment for Sleeping Sickness

## Plain Title
A study comparing an oral pill to standard treatment for people with sleeping sickness in Africa

## Rationale

**What is sleeping sickness?**

Sleeping sickness is a very serious disease. It affects people in the poorest parts of Africa. Without treatment, people with this disease usually die.

**What are the current treatments?**

The standard treatment is called NECT. Doctors give NECT through a needle into the vein. This takes many days. Patients must stay in the hospital. This is hard for patients and their families.

**What is the new treatment?**

Scientists made a new medicine called fexinidazole. People can swallow this medicine as a pill. They do not need to stay in the hospital. They do not need needles in their veins.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors needed to know if the new pill works as well as the standard treatment. They also needed to know if the pill is safe. This study compared the two treatments.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was a research study. Scientists put people into two groups by chance. One group got the new pill. The other group got the standard treatment.

**Who was in the study?**

The study included 394 people. All had sleeping sickness. They lived in two African countries. The countries were the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic.

**How long did the study last?**

The study ran from October 2012 to November 2016. Doctors watched the patients for up to 24 months. This is 2 years.

## Results

**What did the study find?**

The study looked at three main things. These were deaths, disease coming back, and side effects.

**Deaths:**

More people died in the pill group than in the standard treatment group. In the pill group, 9 out of 264 people died. In the standard treatment group, 2 out of 130 people died. None of these deaths were caused by the medicine itself.

**Disease coming back:**

The disease came back more often in people who took the pill. In the pill group, 14 out of 264 people got sick again. In the standard treatment group, no one got sick again. This means the pill may not work as well at keeping the disease away.

**Side effects:**

Both treatments caused side effects. Almost all people in both groups had some side effects. In the pill group, 247 out of 264 people had side effects. In the standard treatment group, 121 out of 130 people had side effects. The number of serious side effects was similar in both groups.

**What do these results mean?**

The pill is much easier to give than the standard treatment. People can take it at home. They do not need to stay in the hospital. They do not need needles in their veins for many days.

However, the pill may not work as well. More people died or got sick again with the pill. But the pill has big benefits. It is easier for patients to take. It is easier for doctors to give. More people may finish their treatment with the pill.

**What did the researchers conclude?**

The oral pill makes treatment much simpler. This is very important for patients and families. The pill helps people avoid long hospital stays. It helps them avoid many needle treatments. This may help more people complete their treatment. But doctors should know that the disease may come back more often with the pill.",10.1002-14651858.CD015374,"Medicines for second‐stage human African trypanosomiasis
What is the aim of this review? 
Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (g‐HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a severe disease transmitted through the bite of infected tsetse flies found in rural parts of sub‐Saharan Africa. Sleeping sickness has two clinical stages. This review only examines treating the second‐stage, where people develop symptoms caused by invasion of the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in changes in the nervous system. Death is inevitable without treatment. Drugs for treatment are few, often require intravenous infusion every day over several weeks, and have serious side effects. In this review we aimed to compare the effects of current drugs for gambiense sleeping sickness and we examined nifurtimox‐eflornithine combination (NECT) with a new drug, fexinidazole, that can be taken orally. 
Key messages 
Whilst fexinidazole cures some people, deaths from any cause and treatment failure rates are higher than with conventional treatment. Adverse events were common in both groups. Fexinidazole is more practical to give, and means less time in hospital for intravenous treatment infusion. 
What was studied in this review? 
We looked at the evidence about the benefits and harms of current drugs used in people with second stage g‐HAT. We searched for randomized trials, which provide robust evidence about the various treatments. We aimed to determine whether any drug provides a definite advantage over the other, measured in terms of clinical outcomes and in relation to the severity of adverse effects. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We only identified one suitable trial, which included 394 people and was conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. The trial showed that deaths from any cause at 24 months may be higher with fexinidazole compared with NECT. Nine of the 264 people who took fexinidazole died, compared with two of the 130 people who took NECT. Fexinidazole probably increases the number of people who relapse during two years. Fourteen people in the fexinidazole group relapsed, and none in the NECT group. Adverse events were very common in both groups over the two years, and there is not likely to be much difference between the two drugs (247/264 in the fexinidazole group and 121/130 in the NECT group). We do not know about the effect of fexinidazole on serious adverse events, as the evidence is very uncertain. There were 31/264 serious adverse events in the fexinidazole group and 13/130 in the NECT group at 24 months.  
How up to date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 14 May 2021.

18F‐florbetapir uptake by brain tissue measured by positron emission tomography (PET) is accepted by regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agencies (EMA) for assessing amyloid load in people with dementia. Its added value is mainly demonstrated by excluding Alzheimer's pathology in an established dementia diagnosis. However, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA‐AA) revised the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease and confidence in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease may be increased when using amyloid biomarkers tests like 18F‐florbetapir. These tests, added to the MCI core clinical criteria, might increase the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of a testing strategy. However, the DTA of 18F‐florbetapir to predict the progression from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia (ADD) or other dementias has not yet been systematically evaluated. 
Objectives
To determine the DTA of the 18F‐florbetapir PET scan for detecting people with MCI at time of performing the test who will clinically progress to ADD, other forms of dementia (non‐ADD), or any form of dementia at follow‐up. 
Search methods
This review is current to May 2017. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), BIOSIS Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection, including the Science Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science) and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/). We also searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia & Cognitive Improvement Group’s specialised register of dementia studies (http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois/). We checked the reference lists of any relevant studies and systematic reviews, and performed citation tracking using the Science Citation Index to identify any additional relevant studies. No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches. 
Selection criteria
We included studies that had prospectively defined cohorts with any accepted definition of MCI at time of performing the test and the use of 18F‐florbetapir scan to evaluate the DTA of the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia. In addition, we only selected studies that applied a reference standard for Alzheimer’s dementia diagnosis, for example, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS‐ADRDA) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders‐IV (DSM‐IV) criteria. 
Data collection and analysis
We screened all titles and abstracts identified in electronic‐database searches. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data to create two‐by‐two tables, showing the binary test results cross‐classified with the binary reference standard. We used these data to calculate sensitivities, specificities, and their 95% confidence intervals. Two independent assessors performed quality assessment using the QUADAS‐2 tool plus some additional items to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. 
Main results
We included three studies, two of which evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, and one evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. 
Progression from MCI to ADD was evaluated in 448 participants. The studies reported data on 401 participants with 1.6 years of follow‐up and in 47 participants with three years of follow‐up. Sixty‐one (15.2%) participants converted at 1.6 years follow‐up; nine (19.1%) participants converted at three years of follow‐up. 
Progression from MCI to any form of dementia was evaluated in five participants with 1.5 years of follow‐up, with three (60%) participants converting to any form of dementia. 
There were concerns regarding applicability in the reference standard in all three studies. Regarding the domain of flow and timing, two studies were considered at high risk of bias. 
MCI to ADD;
Progression from MCI to ADD in those with a follow‐up between two to less than four years had a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 30 to 93) and a specificity of 71% (95% CI 54 to 85) by visual assessment (n = 47, 1 study). 
Progression from MCI to ADD in those with a follow‐up between one to less than two years had a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 78 to 95) and a specificity of 58% (95% CI 53 to 64) by visual assessment, and a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI 76 to 94) and a specificity of 51% (95% CI 45 to 56) by quantitative assessment by the standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR)(n = 401, 1 study). 
MCI to any form of dementia;
Progression from MCI to any form of dementia in those with a follow‐up between one to less than two years had a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 9 to 99) and a specificity of 50% (95% CI 1 to 99) by visual assessment (n = 5, 1 study). 
MCI to any other forms of dementia (non‐ADD);
There was no information regarding the progression from MCI to any other form of dementia (non‐ADD). 
Authors' conclusions
Although sensitivity was good in one included study, considering the poor specificity and the limited data available in the literature, we cannot recommend routine use of 18F‐florbetapir PET in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD. 
Because of the poor sensitivity and specificity, limited number of included participants, and the limited data available in the literature, we cannot recommend its routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. 
Because of the high financial costs of 18F‐florbetapir, clearly demonstrating the DTA and standardising the process of this modality are important prior to its wider use. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Testing a Brain Scan to Predict Memory Problems Getting Worse

## Plain Title

Can a Special Brain Scan Predict if People with Mild Memory Problems Will Develop Dementia?

## Rationale

**What is the condition?**

Some people have mild memory problems called MCI (mild cognitive impairment). People with MCI have more memory issues than normal for their age, but they can still do their daily tasks. However, some people with MCI will get worse over time and develop dementia. Dementia is a serious condition where memory and thinking problems become so bad that people cannot care for themselves. The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease.

**Why was this study needed?**

Doctors want to know which people with mild memory problems will develop dementia. This would help them plan better care and treatment. A special brain scan called 18F-florbetapir PET can show a protein buildup in the brain. This protein buildup is linked to Alzheimer's disease. Medical agencies have approved this scan to help diagnose dementia in people who already have it. But researchers wanted to know if this scan could predict who will develop dementia in the future.

**What did researchers want to find out?**

Researchers wanted to see if the 18F-florbetapir brain scan could correctly predict which people with mild memory problems would develop Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia later on.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This was not a single study. Instead, researchers looked at all published studies on this topic. They searched medical databases up to May 2017. They looked for studies that:
- Included people diagnosed with mild memory problems
- Used the 18F-florbetapir brain scan
- Followed people over time to see who developed dementia

**Who was included?**

The researchers found three studies that met their requirements. These studies included:
- 448 people with mild memory problems
- Most people were followed for about 1.5 to 2 years
- Some people were followed for 3 years

**What happened in these studies?**

People with mild memory problems got the brain scan. Doctors then watched them over time. They checked to see who developed Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The results were mixed and not very strong:

**For predicting Alzheimer's disease after 1 to 2 years:**
- The scan found 89 out of 100 people who would develop Alzheimer's (good at finding disease)
- But the scan also said 42 out of 100 healthy people would get sick when they did not (not good at ruling out disease)

**For predicting Alzheimer's disease after 2 to 4 years:**
- The scan found 67 out of 100 people who would develop Alzheimer's
- The scan correctly identified 71 out of 100 people who would not get sick

**For predicting any type of dementia:**
- Only 5 people were studied
- Results were not reliable due to the very small number

**What are the main conclusions?**

The researchers concluded that this brain scan should not be used routinely in regular medical care. Here's why:
- The scan was not accurate enough at predicting who would develop dementia
- There were not enough studies or people included
- The scan is very expensive

**What does this mean for patients?**

Right now, this brain scan is not recommended to predict if mild memory problems will get worse. More research is needed. The scan needs to be more accurate before doctors use it widely. The cost of the scan is also very high. Researchers need to do more studies with more people before this scan can be used to predict dementia.",10.1002-14651858.CD012216,"18F‐florbetapir PET scan for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment 
Review question: In people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), does using a 18F PET scan with florbetapir predict the progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) and other dementias? 
Background 
Due to global ageing, the number of people with dementia is expected to increase dramatically in the next few decades. Diagnosing dementia at an early stage is desirable, but there is no widespread agreement on the best approach. A range of simple pen and paper tests used by healthcare professionals can assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. Whether or not using special PET scans that detect amyloid —one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease— improves our ability to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia remains unclear. Since these tests are expensive, it is important that they provide additional benefits. 
Aim 
We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the 18F‐florbetapir PET scan in identifying those people with MCI who clinically progress to ADD, other types of dementia, or any form of dementia over a period of time. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to May 2017. We found three studies including 453 participants with MCI. Two studies evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD and one study evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. 
Regarding the two studies that evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, one study had 401 participants with a follow‐up of 1.6 years and the mean age was 72 years. The other study had 47 participants with a follow‐up of three years, and the mean age was 72 years. 
The other study that looked at any form of dementia included 5 participants over 90 years old. 
Two of the studies were funded by the test manufacturer.
Quality of the evidence 
The main limitation of this review was that our findings were based on only three studies, with insufficient detail on how the people were selected, whether the information from the scan was assessed separately from the final diagnosis. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias due to potential conflicts of interest detected. 
Key findings 
In this review, we found the following results based on the three studies.
At a follow‐up of 1.6 years, using visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 89% of the participants who progressed to ADD but only 58% of the participants who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 15% of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 of 15 people to have a positive result and the other 2 participants to be falsely negative. Also 49 people who will not develop ADD would have a negative result, but 36 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). 
In the study that followed up people for three years and used visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 67% of people who progressed to ADD and 71% who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 19 of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 people to have a positive result of the scan and 6 people to have a falsely negative result. In addition, 58 of 81 participants who will not progress to ADD would have a negative result, but 23 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). The small number of participants evaluated at three years lowered our confidence on these estimates of accuracy. 
Regarding progression to any form of dementia, the extremely small number of participants meant that we were unable to provide meaningful estimates of accuracy. 
We conclude that 18F‐florbetapir PET scans cannot be recommended for routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or any form of dementia based on the currently available data. More studies are needed to demonstrate its usefulness.

296,10.1002-14651858.CD006171.pub4-abstract.txt,"Prenatal education for congenital toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis infection is caused by a parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Eating or handling raw or insufficiently‐cooked meat, not washing hands thoroughly after gardening, handling contaminated soil or water, or contact with cats' faeces can cause infection. Usually it is asymptomatic and self‐limiting. Primary prevention involves educating the general public, filtering water and improving farm hygiene to reduce animal infection. 
If pregnant women have not previously been exposed to the parasite and develop antibodies while pregnant, the infection can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus (congenital toxoplasmosis). This is rare but potentially has serious consequences such as malformation, mental retardation, deafness and blindness of the infected infant, intrauterine death or stillbirth. The probability of infection is greater during the third trimester but the risk of the fetus developing major clinical signs is greater early in pregnancy. Pregnant women are often unaware of risk factors for congenital toxoplasmosis. Offering prenatal education could mean that women adopt simple behavioral measures to avoid toxoplasmosis. 
This review included two randomized controlled trials (involving 5455 women). Data could not be combined because each trial measured effectiveness in different ways. One study was from Canada and involved 432 women randomly assigned to a 10‐minute presentation during a prenatal class about toxoplasmosis prevention or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 285 completed the post‐test questionnaire in the third trimester. Only 5% of the intervention women recalled having obtained information on toxoplasmosis prevention during prenatal classes. However, the authors concluded that prenatal education can effectively change pregnant women's behavior as it increased pet, personal and food hygiene. The other trial conducted in France involved 5023 pregnant women with no evidence of toxoplasmosis infection (seronegative) who were randomly assigned to receive a brochure and an audiotape containing information for toxoplasmosis prevention, or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 2790 completed both pre‐test and post‐test questionnaire on behavior (44.5% loss to follow‐up), whereas 3949 women were tested for blood antibodies (22.4% loss to follow‐up). Women's behavior did not change after the intervention. Similarly, the seroconversion rate did not differ between groups (13 out of 2591 women seroconverted in the intervention and four out of 1358 in the control group). 
Both trials were judged as having low methodological quality as assessed by the GRADE approach. This limits our confidence in the results. Evidence supporting prenatal education to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis is therefore limited.

## Plain Title
Teaching Pregnant Women How to Prevent Toxoplasmosis Infection

## Rationale

Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a tiny parasite called Toxoplasma gondii. People can get this infection from eating raw or undercooked meat. They can also get it from touching soil while gardening and not washing their hands. Contact with cat poop can spread it too.

Most people who get toxoplasmosis do not feel sick. The infection usually goes away on its own. However, pregnant women who have never had this infection before can pass it to their unborn baby. This is called congenital toxoplasmosis.

When a baby gets infected before birth, serious problems can happen. The baby might have birth defects. Some babies develop hearing loss or blindness. Others may have learning problems. In the worst cases, the baby can die before birth.

The infection spreads to the baby more easily late in pregnancy. But the baby has worse problems if infected early in pregnancy. Many pregnant women do not know about these risks. They do not know how to protect themselves.

Researchers wanted to test if teaching pregnant women about toxoplasmosis would help. They thought that simple lessons could help women change their daily habits. These changes could protect their babies from infection.

## Trial Design

This review looked at two studies. Both studies tested if education could prevent toxoplasmosis in pregnancy.

The first study took place in Canada. It included 432 pregnant women. Some women watched a 10-minute talk about preventing toxoplasmosis. This happened during their regular pregnancy class. Other women just had their usual pregnancy class. Researchers asked the women questions later in pregnancy. Only 285 women answered these questions.

The second study took place in France. It included 5,023 pregnant women. All these women had never had toxoplasmosis before. Some women got a booklet and an audio tape. These materials explained how to prevent toxoplasmosis. Other women just had their usual pregnancy care. Researchers asked women about their habits. They also tested the women's blood. Blood tests showed if women got infected during pregnancy. Only 2,790 women answered all the questions. Only 3,949 women completed the blood tests.

Both studies had many women drop out. This means many women did not finish the study.

## Results

The two studies had different results.

In the Canadian study, most women did not remember the lesson. Only 5 out of 100 women recalled learning about toxoplasmosis. But the researchers said the lesson still helped. Women who got the lesson were more careful. They washed their hands more often. They handled food more safely. They were more careful around pets.

In the French study, the booklet and tape did not help. Women who got these materials did not change their habits. The infection rates were the same in both groups. In the group that got materials, 13 out of 2,591 women got infected. In the regular care group, 4 out of 1,358 women got infected.

Both studies had problems with how they were done. Many women dropped out before the end. This makes the results less reliable. We cannot be sure the findings are correct.

The researchers concluded that we do not have good proof yet. We cannot say for sure if teaching pregnant women prevents toxoplasmosis. More and better studies are needed. These studies should keep better track of all the women who join. They should measure results in the same way.

Right now, doctors cannot be certain that education programs will protect babies from toxoplasmosis.",10.1002-14651858.CD006171,"Prenatal education for congenital toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis infection is caused by a parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Eating or handling raw or insufficiently‐cooked meat, not washing hands thoroughly after gardening, handling contaminated soil or water, or contact with cats' faeces can cause infection. Usually it is asymptomatic and self‐limiting. Primary prevention involves educating the general public, filtering water and improving farm hygiene to reduce animal infection. 
If pregnant women have not previously been exposed to the parasite and develop antibodies while pregnant, the infection can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus (congenital toxoplasmosis). This is rare but potentially has serious consequences such as malformation, mental retardation, deafness and blindness of the infected infant, intrauterine death or stillbirth. The probability of infection is greater during the third trimester but the risk of the fetus developing major clinical signs is greater early in pregnancy. Pregnant women are often unaware of risk factors for congenital toxoplasmosis. Offering prenatal education could mean that women adopt simple behavioral measures to avoid toxoplasmosis. 
This review included two randomized controlled trials (involving 5455 women). Data could not be combined because each trial measured effectiveness in different ways. One study was from Canada and involved 432 women randomly assigned to a 10‐minute presentation during a prenatal class about toxoplasmosis prevention or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 285 completed the post‐test questionnaire in the third trimester. Only 5% of the intervention women recalled having obtained information on toxoplasmosis prevention during prenatal classes. However, the authors concluded that prenatal education can effectively change pregnant women's behavior as it increased pet, personal and food hygiene. The other trial conducted in France involved 5023 pregnant women with no evidence of toxoplasmosis infection (seronegative) who were randomly assigned to receive a brochure and an audiotape containing information for toxoplasmosis prevention, or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 2790 completed both pre‐test and post‐test questionnaire on behavior (44.5% loss to follow‐up), whereas 3949 women were tested for blood antibodies (22.4% loss to follow‐up). Women's behavior did not change after the intervention. Similarly, the seroconversion rate did not differ between groups (13 out of 2591 women seroconverted in the intervention and four out of 1358 in the control group). 
Both trials were judged as having low methodological quality as assessed by the GRADE approach. This limits our confidence in the results. Evidence supporting prenatal education to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis is therefore limited.

Most of our understanding of hospital‐acquired pneumonia in children is derived from adult studies. To our knowledge, no systematic review with meta‐analysis has assessed the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens in neonates and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia. 
Objectives
To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in neonates and children. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trial registers to February 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials comparing one antibiotic regimen with any other antibiotic regimen for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in neonates and children. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality and serious adverse events; our secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, pneumonia‐related mortality, non‐serious adverse events, and treatment failure. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow‐up. 
Main results
We included four randomised clinical trials (84 participants). We assessed all trials as having high risk of bias. 
We did not conduct any meta‐analyses, as the included trials did not compare similar antibiotic regimens. 
Each of the four trials assessed a different comparison, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Only one trial reported our primary outcomes of all‐cause mortality and serious adverse events. Three trials reported our secondary outcome of treatment failure. Two trials primarily included community‐acquired pneumonia and hospitalised children with bacterial infections, hence the children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia constituted subgroups of the total sample sizes. 
Where outcomes were reported, the certainty of the evidence was very low for each of the comparisons. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
None of the included trials assessed health‐related quality of life, pneumonia‐related mortality, or non‐serious adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions
The relative beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the very low certainty of the available evidence. The current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. Randomised clinical trials assessing different antibiotic regimens for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in children and neonates are warranted. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Antibiotics for Pneumonia Caught in the Hospital by Children and Newborns

## Rationale

**What is the health problem?**

Some children get pneumonia while they are in the hospital. This is called hospital-acquired pneumonia. It is one of the most common infections that children catch in hospitals around the world. Pneumonia is a lung infection that can make children very sick.

**What did we want to find out?**

Most of what doctors know about this type of pneumonia comes from studies in adults, not children. We wanted to find out which antibiotics work best for treating hospital-acquired pneumonia in children and newborns. We also wanted to know if some antibiotics cause more harm than others.

**Why is this study needed?**

Doctors need to know the best way to treat children who get pneumonia in the hospital. Different antibiotics might work better or cause fewer side effects. This information helps doctors choose the right medicine for sick children.

## Trial Design

**How did we search for studies?**

We looked for studies that tested different antibiotics in children and newborns with hospital-acquired pneumonia. We searched medical databases and contacted researchers. We looked for studies up to February 2021.

**What types of studies did we include?**

We only included studies where researchers randomly gave children one antibiotic or another antibiotic. This type of study gives the most reliable results.

**Who was in the studies?**

We found four studies with 84 children and newborns total. These children had pneumonia that they caught while in the hospital.

**What did the studies compare?**

Each study compared two different antibiotics:
- Study 1: cefepime versus ceftazidime
- Study 2: linezolid versus vancomycin
- Study 3: meropenem versus cefotaxime
- Study 4: ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin

## Results

**What did we find?**

We found very few studies on this topic. The four studies we found had problems with how they were done. This made the results less trustworthy.

Each study compared different antibiotics. Because of this, we could not combine the results from different studies.

Only one study reported deaths or serious side effects. Three studies reported whether the treatment worked or failed. Two studies mostly included children with other types of pneumonia, not just hospital-acquired pneumonia.

**What are the main conclusions?**

We cannot tell which antibiotic works best for children with hospital-acquired pneumonia. The evidence quality was very low. This means we have very little confidence in the results.

We do not have enough information to say that any one antibiotic is better than another for treating this condition in children and newborns.

**What is needed next?**

More studies are needed. These studies should:
- Include more children with hospital-acquired pneumonia
- Be designed and conducted carefully
- Compare antibiotics that doctors commonly use
- Measure important outcomes like deaths and side effects

**Why does this matter?**

Right now, doctors do not have good evidence to guide their choice of antibiotics for children with hospital-acquired pneumonia. Better studies would help doctors make better treatment decisions. This could help sick children get well faster and have fewer side effects from their medicine.

Until better studies are done, doctors must use their best judgment when choosing antibiotics for these children.",10.1002-14651858.CD013864,"Antibiotics for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in newborns and children
Review question 
Which antibiotic regimen is safer and more effective in treating neonates (newborns) and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia? 
Background 
Hospital‐acquired pneumonia is an inflammation of the tissue of one or both lungs caused by an infection that occurs during a hospital stay (i.e. 48 hours or more after hospital admission). It is one of the most common hospital‐acquired infections in children worldwide, and is associated with a high death rate. Most of our understanding of hospital‐acquired pneumonia in children is drawn from adult studies. To our knowledge this is the first review with meta‐analysis that assesses the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens in newborns and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to February 2021.
Study characteristics 
We included four trials randomising 84 children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia to different antibiotic regimens. Three trials were multicentre trials from the USA, Latin America, Europe, and South Africa. The South African trial included one site in Malaysia. Each of the four included trials compared different antibiotic regimens, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Study funding sources 
Three trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Pharmacia Corp, and Basilea Pharmaceutica International Ltd.), indicating a possible risk of bias related to a vested interest risk. 
Key results 
Each of the four included trials compared different antibiotic regimens, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Only one trial reported our primary outcomes of death from all causes and serious adverse events (major complications). Three trials reported our secondary outcome of treatment failure. Two trials primarily included community‐acquired pneumonia and hospitalised children with bacterial infections, hence the children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia constituted only subgroups of the total study populations. 
Where outcomes were reported, the certainty of the evidence was very low for each of the comparisons. We were unable to draw any meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
None of the included trials assessed health‐related quality of life, pneumonia‐related death, or non‐serious adverse events (minor complications). 
Conclusions 
The available evidence does not suggest that one antibiotic regimen is safer and more effective than another in treating newborns and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia. Further research is needed. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of evidence is very low. All four included trials had high risk of bias (i.e. the studies were designed in such a way that the results may have been skewed). In addition, the included trials involved few participants, which is likely to have led to inaccurate results.

Trial monitoring is an important component of good clinical practice to ensure the safety and rights of study participants, confidentiality of personal information, and quality of data. However, the effectiveness of various existing monitoring approaches is unclear. Information to guide the choice of monitoring methods in clinical intervention studies may help trialists, support units, and monitors to effectively adjust their approaches to current knowledge and evidence. 
Objectives
To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of different monitoring strategies (including risk‐based strategies and others) for clinical intervention studies examined in prospective comparative studies of monitoring interventions. 
Search methods
We systematically searched CENTRAL, PubMed, and Embase via Elsevier for relevant published literature up to March 2021. We searched the online 'Studies within A Trial' (SWAT) repository, grey literature, and trial registries for ongoing or unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized or non‐randomized prospective, empirical evaluation studies of different monitoring strategies in one or more clinical intervention studies. We applied no restrictions for language or date of publication. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on the evaluated monitoring methods, countries involved, study population, study setting, randomization method, and numbers and proportions in each intervention group. Our primary outcome was critical and major monitoring findings in prospective intervention studies. Monitoring findings were classified according to different error domains (e.g. major eligibility violations) and the primary outcome measure was a composite of these domains. Secondary outcomes were individual error domains, participant recruitment and follow‐up, and resource use. If we identified more than one study for a comparison and outcome definitions were similar across identified studies, we quantitatively summarized effects in a meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model. Otherwise, we qualitatively summarized the results of eligible studies stratified by different comparisons of monitoring strategies. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for different groups of comparisons. 
Main results
We identified eight eligible studies, which we grouped into five comparisons.
1. Risk‐based versus extensive on‐site monitoring: based on two large studies, we found moderate certainty of evidence for the combined primary outcome of major or critical findings that risk‐based monitoring is not inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring. Although the risk ratio was close to 'no difference' (1.03 with a 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.81 to 1.33, below 1.0 in favor of the risk‐based strategy), the high imprecision in one study and the small number of eligible studies resulted in a wide CI of the summary estimate. Low certainty of evidence suggested that monitoring strategies with extensive on‐site monitoring were associated with considerably higher resource use and costs (up to a factor of 3.4). Data on recruitment or retention of trial participants were not available. 
2. Central monitoring with triggered on‐site visits versus regular on‐site visits: combining the results of two eligible studies yielded low certainty of evidence with a risk ratio of 1.83 (95% CI 0.51 to 6.55) in favor of triggered monitoring intervention. Data on recruitment, retention, and resource use were not available. 
3. Central statistical monitoring and local monitoring performed by site staff with annual on‐site visits versus central statistical monitoring and local monitoring only: based on one study, there was moderate certainty of evidence that a small number of major and critical findings were missed with the central monitoring approach without on‐site visits: 3.8% of participants in the group without on‐site visits and 6.4% in the group with on‐site visits had a major or critical monitoring finding (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.7; P = 0.03). The absolute number of monitoring findings was very low, probably because defined major and critical findings were very study specific and central monitoring was present in both intervention groups. Very low certainty of evidence did not suggest a relevant effect on participant retention, and very low‐quality evidence indicated an extra cost for on‐site visits of USD 2,035,392. There were no data on recruitment. 
4. Traditional 100% source data verification (SDV) versus targeted or remote SDV: the two studies assessing targeted and remote SDV reported findings only related to source documents. Compared to the final database obtained using the full SDV monitoring process, only a small proportion of remaining errors on overall data were identified using the targeted SDV process in the MONITORING study (absolute difference 1.47%, 95% CI 1.41% to 1.53%). Targeted SDV was effective in the verification of source documents but increased the workload on data management. The other included study was a pilot study which compared traditional on‐site SDV versus remote SDV and found little difference in monitoring findings and the ability to locate data values despite marked differences in remote access in two clinical trial networks. There were no data on recruitment or retention. 
5. Systematic on‐site initiation visit versus on‐site initiation visit upon request: very low certainty of evidence suggested no difference in retention and recruitment between the two approaches. There were no data on critical and major findings or on resource use. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence base is limited in terms of quantity and quality. Ideally, for each of the five identified comparisons, more prospective, comparative monitoring studies nested in clinical trials and measuring effects on all outcomes specified in this review are necessary to draw more reliable conclusions. However, the results suggesting risk‐based, targeted, and mainly central monitoring as an efficient strategy are promising. The development of reliable triggers for on‐site visits is ongoing; different triggers might be used in different settings. More evidence on risk indicators that identify sites with problems or the prognostic value of triggers is needed to further optimize central monitoring strategies. In particular, approaches with an initial assessment of trial‐specific risks that need to be closely monitored centrally during trial conduct with triggered on‐site visits should be evaluated in future research.

## Plain Title
Comparing Different Ways to Check on Clinical Trials to Keep Patients Safe and Data Accurate

## Rationale

### What is trial monitoring and why does it matter?

When researchers test new treatments in clinical trials, they need to check that everything is done correctly. This checking process is called ""monitoring."" Monitoring helps make sure that:
- Patients in the study are safe
- Patient information stays private
- The study data is correct and trustworthy

### Why was this study needed?

There are many different ways to monitor clinical trials. Some methods involve people visiting study sites in person to check records. Other methods use computers to look for problems from a distance. Researchers wanted to know which monitoring methods work best. This information could help future studies choose the right monitoring approach. The goal was to find methods that keep patients safe while not wasting time and money.

### What did researchers want to learn?

Researchers wanted to compare different monitoring methods. They wanted to see which methods were best at finding important problems. They also wanted to know which methods cost less money and used fewer resources.

## Trial Design

### How was this study designed?

This was not a single study with patients. Instead, researchers looked at other studies that had already been done. They searched medical databases and registries up to March 2021. They looked for studies that compared different monitoring methods.

The researchers found eight studies that met their needs. These studies tested monitoring methods in real clinical trials. The studies compared five main types of monitoring approaches:
1. Risk-based monitoring versus extensive on-site monitoring
2. Central monitoring with triggered visits versus regular on-site visits
3. Central monitoring with annual visits versus central monitoring only
4. Traditional full checking versus targeted or remote checking
5. Systematic site visits versus visits only when requested

The researchers grouped similar studies together. When possible, they combined the results to get stronger answers. They rated how confident they could be in each finding.

## Results

### What were the main results?

**Risk-based versus extensive on-site monitoring:** Two large studies showed that risk-based monitoring works about as well as extensive on-site monitoring for finding major problems. Risk-based monitoring focuses checking efforts where problems are most likely. This approach used much less money and resources—up to 3 times less costly than extensive on-site monitoring.

**Central monitoring with triggered visits:** When computers watch for problems and trigger visits only when needed, this approach may work as well as regular scheduled visits. However, only two small studies tested this, so researchers need more information.

**Central monitoring with and without annual visits:** One study found that adding annual on-site visits caught slightly more major problems than central monitoring alone. About 6 out of 100 participants had major findings with visits, compared to 4 out of 100 without visits. However, the annual visits cost over 2 million dollars extra.

**Traditional versus targeted checking:** Targeted checking of specific data points missed only a small amount of errors compared to checking everything. This approach saved time and effort.

**Systematic versus on-request site visits:** One small study found no clear difference between these approaches.

### What do these results mean?

The evidence suggests that risk-based and central monitoring methods can work well. These methods focus resources where they are most needed. They appear to find important problems while costing less money.

However, researchers noted important limitations. Only a few studies have tested these methods. More research is needed to be certain about which approaches work best.

### What are the main conclusions?

More studies are needed to compare monitoring methods. However, current evidence supports using risk-based and central monitoring approaches. These methods appear efficient and effective. Future research should focus on finding the best ways to identify which study sites need extra attention. This will help make monitoring even more effective while protecting patient safety and data quality.",10.1002-14651858.MR000051,"New monitoring strategies for clinical trials
Our question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of new monitoring strategies on monitoring findings, participant recruitment, participant follow‐up, and resource use in clinical trials. We also summarized the different components of tested strategies and qualitative evidence from process evaluations. 
Background 
Monitoring a clinical trial is important to ensure the safety of participants and the reliability of results. New methods have been developed for monitoring practices but further assessments of these new methods are needed to see if they do improve effectiveness without being inferior to established methods in terms of patient rights and safety, and quality assurance of trial results. We reviewed studies that examined this question within clinical trials, i.e. studies comparing different monitoring strategies used in clinical trials. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies which covered a variety of monitoring strategies in a wide range of clinical trials, including national and large international trials. They included primary (general), secondary (specialized), and tertiary (highly specialized) health care. The size of the studies ranged from 32 to 4371 participants at one to 196 sites. 
Key results 
We identified five comparisons. The first comparison of risk‐based monitoring versus extensive on‐site monitoring found no evidence that the risk‐based approach is inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring in terms of the proportion of participants with a critical or major monitoring finding not identified by the corresponding method, while resource use was three‐ to five‐fold higher with extensive on‐site monitoring. For the second comparison of central statistical monitoring with triggered on‐site visits versus regular (untriggered) on‐site visits, we found some evidence that central statistical monitoring can identify sites in need of support by an on‐site monitoring intervention. In the third comparison, the evaluation of adding an on‐site visit to local and central monitoring revealed a high percentage of participants with major or critical monitoring findings in the on‐site visit group, but low numbers of absolute monitoring findings in both groups. This means that without on‐site visits, some monitoring findings will be missed, but none of the missed findings had any serious impact on patient safety or the validity of the trial's results. In the fourth comparison, two studies assessed new source data verification processes, which are used to check that data recorded within the trial Case Report Form (CRF) match the primary source data (e.g. medical records), and reported little difference to full source data verification processes for the targeted as well as for the remote approach. In the fifth comparison, one study showed no difference in participant recruitment and participant follow‐up between a monitoring approach with systematic initiation visits versus an approach with initiation visits upon request by study sites. 
Certainty of evidence 
We are moderately certain that risk‐based monitoring is not inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring with respect to critical and major monitoring findings in clinical trials. For the remaining body of evidence, there is low or very low certainty in results due to imprecision, small number of studies, or high risk of bias. Ideally, for each of the five identified comparisons, more high‐quality monitoring studies that measure effects on all outcomes specified in this review are necessary to draw more reliable conclusions.

Multiple myeloma is a bone marrow‐based hematological malignancy accounting for approximately two per cent of cancers. First‐line treatment for transplant‐ineligible individuals consists of multiple drug combinations of bortezomib (V), lenalidomide (R), or thalidomide (T). However, access to these medicines is restricted in many countries worldwide. 
Objectives
To assess and compare the effectiveness and safety of multiple drug combinations of V, R, and T for adults with newly diagnosed transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma and to inform an application for the inclusion of these medicines into the World Health Organization's (WHO) list of essential medicines. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL and MEDLINE, conference proceedings and study registries on 14 February 2019 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing multiple drug combinations of V, R and T for adults with newly diagnosed transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing combination therapies of V, R, and T, plus melphalan and prednisone (MP) or dexamethasone (D) for first‐line treatment of adults with transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma. We excluded trials including adults with relapsed or refractory disease, trials comparing drug therapies to other types of therapy and trials including second‐generation novel agents. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included trials. As effect measures we used hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) and risk ratios (RRs) for adverse events. An HR or RR < 1 indicates an advantage for the intervention compared to the main comparator MP. Where available, we extracted quality of life (QoL) data (scores of standardised questionnaires). Results quoted are from network meta‐analysis (NMA) unless stated. 
Main results
We included 25 studies (148 references) comprising 11,403 participants and 21 treatment regimens. Treatments were differentiated between restricted treatment duration (treatment with a pre‐specified amount of cycles) and continuous therapy (treatment administered until disease progression, the person becomes intolerant to the drug, or treatment given for a prolonged period). Continuous therapies are indicated with a ""c"". Risk of bias was generally high across studies due to the open‐label study design. 
Overall survival (OS) 
Evidence suggests that treatment with RD (HR 0.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.99), median OS 55.2 months (35.2 to 87.0)); TMP (HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.97), median OS: 46.4 months (35.9 to 60.0)); and VRDc (HR 0.49 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.92), median OS 71.0 months (37.8 to 133.8)) probably increases survival compared to median reported OS of 34.8 months with MP (moderate certainty). Treatment with VMP may result in a large increase in OS, compared to MP (HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.45 to 1.07), median OS 49.7 months (32.5 to 77.3)), low certainty). 
Progression‐free survival (PFS) 
Treatment withRD (HR 0.65 (95% CI0.44 to 0.96), median PFS: 24.9 months (16.9 to 36.8)); TMP (HR 0.63 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.78), median PFS:25.7 months (20.8 to 32.4)); VMP (HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.90), median PFS: 28.9 months (18.0 to 46.3)); and VRDc (HR 0.34 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.58), median PFS: 47.6 months (27.9 to 81.0)) may result in a large increase in PFS (low certainty) compared to MP (median reported PFS: 16.2 months). 
Adverse events 
The risk of polyneuropathies may be lower with RD compared to treatment with MP (RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.99), risk for RD: 0.5% (0.1 to 1.8), mean reported risk for MP: 0.9% (10 of 1074 patients affected), low certainty). However, the CIs are also compatible with no difference or an increase in neuropathies. Treatment with TMP (RR 4.44 (95% CI1.77 to 11.11), risk: 4.0% (1.6 to 10.0)) and VMP (RR 88.22 (95% CI 5.36 to 1451.11), risk: 79.4% (4.8 to 1306.0)) probably results in a large increase in polyneuropathies compared to MP (moderate certainty). No study reported the amount of participants with grade ≥ 3 polyneuropathies for treatment with VRDc. 
VMP probably increases the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) compared to MP (RR 1.28 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.54), risk for VMP: 46.2% (38.3 to 55.6), mean risk for MP: 36.1% (177 of 490 patients affected), moderate certainty). RD, TMP, and VRDc were not connected to MP in the network and the risk of SAEs could not be compared. 
Treatment with RD (RR 4.18 (95% CI 2.13 to 8.20), NMA‐risk: 38.5% (19.6 to 75.4)); and TMP (RR 4.10 (95% CI 2.40 to 7.01), risk: 37.7% (22.1 to 64.5)) results in a large increase of withdrawals from the trial due to adverse events (high certainty) compared to MP (mean reported risk: 9.2% (77 of 837 patients withdrew)). The risk is probably slightly increased with VMP (RR 1.06 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.81), risk: 9.75% (5.8 to 16.7), moderate certainty), while it is much increased with VRDc (RR 8.92 (95% CI 3.82 to 20.84), risk: 82.1% (35.1 to 191.7), high certainty) compared to MP. 
Quality of life 
QoL was reported in four studies for seven different treatment regimens (MP, MPc, RD, RMP, RMPc, TMP, TMPc) and was measured with four different tools. Assessment and reporting differed between studies and could not be meta‐analysed. However, all studies reported an improvement of QoL after initiation of anti‐myeloma treatment for all assessed treatment regimens. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on our four pre‐selected comparisons of interest, continuous treatment with VRD had the largest survival benefit compared with MP, while RD and TMP also probably considerably increase survival. However, treatment combinations of V, R, and T also substantially increase the incidence of AEs, and lead to a higher risk of treatment discontinuation. Their effectiveness and safety profiles may best be analysed in further randomised head‐to‐head trials. Further trials should focus on consistent reporting of safety outcomes and should use a standardised instrument to evaluate QoL to ensure comparability of treatment‐combinations. 
","# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Drug Treatments for People with Multiple Myeloma Who Cannot Have a Stem Cell Transplant

## Plain Title

Comparing different drug combinations to treat people newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who cannot have a stem cell transplant.

## Rationale

**What is multiple myeloma?**

Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer. It starts in the bone marrow, which is the soft tissue inside bones that makes blood cells. This cancer affects about 2 out of every 100 people who get cancer.

**What problems does it cause?**

Multiple myeloma can make people very sick. It can cause pain, weak bones, and other health problems. People with this disease need treatment to help them live longer and feel better.

**What treatments are available?**

Doctors use different drugs to treat multiple myeloma. Three important drugs are:
- Bortezomib (we call it ""V"")
- Lenalidomide (we call it ""R"")
- Thalidomide (we call it ""T"")

Doctors often mix these drugs with other medicines. Two common medicines used in combinations are melphalan and prednisone (we call this ""MP"").

**Why was this study needed?**

Many countries do not have easy access to these drugs. The World Health Organization keeps a list of essential medicines. This study was done to help decide if these drugs should be on that list. Researchers wanted to find out which drug combinations work best and are safest for people who cannot have a stem cell transplant.

## Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

Researchers looked at 25 different studies. These studies included 11,403 people with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. All of these people could not have a stem cell transplant.

The studies tested 21 different treatment combinations. Some treatments were given for a set number of cycles. Other treatments were given continuously until the disease got worse or the person could not tolerate the drug anymore.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included adults with multiple myeloma who had just been diagnosed. They had not received treatment before. They could not have a stem cell transplant because of their age or other health problems.

**How long did the studies last?**

The length of time varied between studies. People stayed in the studies until researchers could measure how well the treatments worked.

## Results

**What did the researchers find?**

The researchers compared different drug combinations to see which ones helped people live longer and stay healthier.

**Living longer (overall survival):**

Some drug combinations helped people live longer than MP alone:
- RD: People lived about 55 months (about 4.5 years)
- TMP: People lived about 46 months (about 4 years)
- VRDc (given continuously): People lived about 71 months (about 6 years)
- VMP: People lived about 50 months (about 4 years)
- MP alone: People lived about 35 months (about 3 years)

**Time before disease got worse (progression-free survival):**

These combinations helped keep the disease under control longer:
- RD: About 25 months
- TMP: About 26 months
- VMP: About 29 months
- VRDc: About 48 months (about 4 years)
- MP alone: About 16 months

**Side effects:**

All treatments caused side effects. Some were more serious than others.

Nerve damage (polyneuropathies):
- RD may cause less nerve damage than MP
- TMP and VMP caused much more nerve damage than MP

Serious side effects:
- VMP caused more serious side effects than MP
- About 46 out of 100 people on VMP had serious side effects
- About 36 out of 100 people on MP had serious side effects

Stopping treatment due to side effects:
- More people stopped RD, TMP, and VRDc because of side effects
- About 38 out of 100 people on RD stopped treatment
- About 38 out of 100 people on TMP stopped treatment
- About 82 out of 100 people on VRDc stopped treatment
- About 9 out of 100 people on MP stopped treatment

**Quality of life:**

Four studies looked at quality of life. They used different tools to measure it. All studies found that people felt better after starting treatment, no matter which combination they received.

**What do these results mean?**

VRDc given continuously helped people live the longest. RD and TMP also helped people live longer than MP alone. However, these combinations also caused more side effects. Many people had to stop treatment because of these side effects.

**Conclusions:**

The drug combinations V, R, and T can help people with multiple myeloma live longer. But they also cause more side effects than older treatments. Doctors need to balance the benefits with the risks for each person. More studies are needed to directly compare these treatments to each other.",10.1002-14651858.CD013487,"Multiple drug combinations of bortezomib, lenalidomide and thalidomide for initial treatment of adults with transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma 
Background 
Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer. It accounts for approximately 2% of all cancers and is still considered incurable. For people with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), who are unsuitable for a procedure where damaged blood cells are replaced with healthy ones (stem‐cell transplant), treatment is usually a multiple drug combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide, or thalidomide, plus melphalan and prednisolone (MP) or dexamethasone (D). Multiple drug combinations are approved for initial anti‐myeloma therapy, however, access to these medicines is restricted in many countries worldwide. 
Aim of the review 
To compare the benefits and harms of selected anti‐myeloma drugs (bortezomib (V), lenalidomide (R), thalidomide (T)) for transplant‐unsuitable NDMM. 
Study characteristics 
We searched selected medical databases and trial registries until 14th February 2019. We included studies comparing multiple drug combinations of V, R, and T for the treatment of people with NDMM who were unsuitable for a stem‐cell transplant. We differentiated between fixed treatment duration and continuous therapy. Fixed therapy is a pre‐specified number of cycles, while a continuous therapy is given until the disease gets worse, the person finds the drug hard to tolerate, or when the treatment is given for a prolonged period. Continuous therapies are indicated with a ""c"". 
Key results 
We identified 25 studies involving 11,403 transplant‐unsuitable adults with NDMM, and comparing 21 different treatment regimens. 
Survival 
People who had the standard treatment, MP, lived for an average of 35 months. People treated with RD, TMP, and VRDc probably live for much longer (moderate certainty). Treatment with VMP may also lead to much longer survival, compared to MP (low certainty). People treated with RD lived for an additional 20.4 months; with TMP an additional 11.6 months; with VRDc an additional 36.2 months, and with VMP an additional 14.9 months. 
Harms 
On average, 0.9% (9 out of 1000) of people treated with MP experienced peripheral nerve damage (polyneuropathies).The evidence was inconclusive whether treatment with RD decreases the risk of developing a polyneuropathy, compared to MP. The estimated risk of polyneuropathies with RD was 0.5%. Treatment with TMP and VMP probably increases the risk of experiencing polyneuropathies compared to MP (moderate certainty). The estimated risk with TMP was 4.0%, and with VMP 79.4%. No VRDc treatment study reported the number of participants with severe polyneuropathies. 
On average, 36.1% (361 out of 1000) of people on MP‐treatment experienced at least one serious adverse event (SAE). VMP probably increases the proportion of participants with SAEs compared to MP to 46.2% (moderate certainty). 
On average, 9.2% (92 out of 1000) of people treated with MP stop the treatment because of adverse events (AEs). Treatment with RD, TMP, and VRDc leads to a much higher proportion of people stopping treatment because of AEs than MP (high certainty). The risk of stopping treatment with RD is 38.5%; with TMP 37.7%, with VRDc 82.1%. Treatment with VMP probably increases the risk of stopping treatment because of AEs compared to MP (9.75%, moderate certainty). 
Quality of life 
Quality of life (QoL) was reported in four studies for seven different treatments and was measured with four different tools. Assessment and reporting differed between studies and could not be meta‐analysed. However, all studies reported an improvement in QoL after anti‐myeloma treatment was started for all assessed treatments. 
Conclusions 
VRDc showed the highest overall survival benefits, compared to MP. RD and TMP also improved OS compared to MP. However, these combinations of drugs also led to more adverse events compared to MP, and led to more people stopping treatment. More trials are needed that look carefully at both harms and QoL.
