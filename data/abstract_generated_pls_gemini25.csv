10.1002-14651858.CD014257.pub2,"Background
Functional constipation is defined as chronic constipation with no identifiable underlying cause. It is a significant cause of morbidity in children, accounting for up to 25% of visits to paediatric gastroenterologists. Probiotic preparations may sufficiently alter the gut microbiome and promote normal gut physiology in a way that helps relieve functional constipation. Several studies have sought to address this hypothesis, as well as the role of probiotics in other functional gut disorders. Therefore, it is important to have a focused review to assess the evidence to date. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the management of chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children. 
Search methods
On 28 June 2021, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, WHO ICTR, and ClinicalTrials.gov, with no language, date, publication status, or document type limitations. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed probiotic preparations (including synbiotics) compared to placebo, no treatment or any other interventional preparation in people aged between 0 and 18 years old with a diagnosis of functional constipation according to consensus criteria (such as Rome IV). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 14 studies (1127 randomised participants): 12 studies assessed probiotics in the treatment of functional constipation, whilst two studies investigated synbiotic preparations. 
Three studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to the frequency of defecation at study end, but we did not pool them as there was very significant unexplained heterogeneity. Four studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to treatment success. There may be no difference in global improvement/treatment success (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.26; 313 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Five studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to withdrawals due to adverse events, with the pooled effect suggesting there may be no difference (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.95; 357 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
The pooled estimate from three studies that compared probiotics plus an osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone found there may be no difference in frequency of defecation (MD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.57 to 0.56; 268 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Two studies compared probiotics plus an osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone in relation to global improvement/treatment success, and found there may be no difference between the treatments (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.15; 139 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Three studies compared probiotics plus osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone in relation to withdrawals due to adverse events, but it is unclear if there is a difference between them (RR 2.86, 95% CI 0.12 to 68.35; 268 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Two studies compared probiotics versus magnesium oxide. It is unclear if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD 0.28, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 1.14; 36 participants), treatment success (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.57; 36 participants) or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.04; 77 participants). The certainty of the evidence is very low for these outcomes. 
One study assessed the role of a synbiotic preparation in comparison to placebo. There may be higher treatment success in favour of synbiotics compared to placebo (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.47; 155 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. 
One study assessed a synbiotic plus paraffin compared to paraffin alone. It is uncertain if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD 0.74, 95% CI ‐0.96, 2.44; 66 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), or treatment success (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.17; 66 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. 
One study compared a synbiotic preparation to paraffin. It is uncertain if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD ‐1.53, 95% CI ‐3.00, ‐0.06; 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or in treatment success (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.65, 1.13; 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. 
All secondary outcomes were either not reported or reported in a way that did not allow for analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether probiotics are efficacious in successfully treating chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children or changing the frequency of defecation, or whether there is a difference in withdrawals due to adverse events when compared with placebo. There is limited evidence from one study to suggest a synbiotic preparation may be more likely than placebo to lead to treatment success, with no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. 
There is insufficient evidence to draw efficacy or safety conclusions about the use of probiotics in combination with or in comparison to any of the other interventions reported. The majority of the studies that presented data on serious adverse events reported that no events occurred. Two studies did not report this outcome. 
Future studies are needed to confirm efficacy, but the research community requires guidance on the best context for probiotics in such studies, considering where they should be best considered in a potential treatment hierarchy and should align with core outcome sets to support future interpretation of findings. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Do Probiotics Help Kids with Constipation?

### Rationale

Many children have long-term constipation. This means they have trouble going to the bathroom often. Doctors call this ""functional constipation."" It means there is no clear reason for it. This problem can make kids feel bad. It can also cause many visits to children's stomach doctors.

Some people think special good germs, called probiotics, might help. These germs live in our gut. They may help the gut work better. This could help kids with constipation. We wanted to look at all the studies about probiotics for kids with this problem. We wanted to see if they really help.

### Trial Design

We looked at many research studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This is a good way to test if a treatment works. We looked for studies that tested probiotics. We also looked for studies that tested ""synbiotics."" Synbiotics are probiotics with added food for the good germs.

These studies looked at children from birth up to 18 years old. All these kids had functional constipation. The studies compared probiotics or synbiotics to other things. These included a sugar pill (placebo), no treatment, or other medicines. We looked for studies that measured how often kids went to the bathroom. We also looked at how well the treatment worked overall. We also checked for any bad effects. We searched many databases for these studies up to June 2021.

### Results

We found 14 studies to include. These studies had a total of 1127 children. Most studies looked at probiotics. Two studies looked at synbiotics.

Some studies compared probiotics to a sugar pill. We found it was not clear if probiotics helped kids go to the bathroom more often. It was also not clear if probiotics made kids feel better overall. The studies also showed that probiotics likely did not cause more bad effects than a sugar pill.

Other studies looked at probiotics plus a common laxative. A laxative is a medicine that helps you go to the bathroom. These studies compared that to just the laxative alone. Again, it was not clear if adding probiotics helped kids go to the bathroom more. It was also not clear if it helped them feel better. We are also unsure if there were more bad effects with probiotics.

Two studies compared probiotics to another medicine called magnesium oxide. It was not clear if probiotics were better for going to the bathroom. It was also not clear if they made kids feel better or caused fewer bad effects.

One study looked at a synbiotic. This study found that the synbiotic might help kids feel better more often than a sugar pill. This study also said there were no bad effects. Other studies looked at synbiotics with other medicines. It was not clear if synbiotics made a difference in how often kids went to the bathroom. It was also not clear if they made kids feel better.

Overall, it's hard to say if probiotics work for kids with constipation. We need more studies to be sure. There is a small hint that synbiotics might help some kids. Most studies said there were no serious bad effects. More research is needed to find the best way to use probiotics for children's constipation.","Probiotics for treatment of chronic constipation in children
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether probiotics can be used to treat chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children (aged 0 to 18 years). 
We analysed data from 14 studies to answer this question.
Key messages 
We were unable to draw conclusions when comparing probiotics to placebo for frequency of defecation in children treated for chronic constipation without a physical explanation. There may be no difference in treatment success between the two groups. 
There may not be a difference in frequency of defecation or treatment success when comparing probiotics and laxatives to using laxatives alone. 
We were unable to draw conclusions when comparing probiotics to magnesium oxide for frequency of defecation or treatment success. 
There may be a higher frequency of defecation in children treated with synbiotic preparations compared to placebo. 
There may not be a difference in participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse events when comparing probiotic preparations to placebo. 
We were unable to draw conclusions on the safety of any of the other comparisons due to the low number of people who withdrew from the studies. 
What was studied in the review? 
Children often suffer from constipation for long periods of time, and when there is no underlying physical cause that can be found we call it 'functional constipation'. 
It has been suggested that probiotic and synbiotic preparations might help improve symptoms in these children. Probiotics are preparations that contain living bacteria that have been proposed to be beneficial to the digestive system. Synbiotics also include food substances that support the growth of these bacteria. 
There is currently no consensus about whether this is the case, or how these preparations are best used. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing any probiotic or synbiotic treatment with any other treatment (such as dummy/placebo treatments) in children with chronic constipation without a physical explanation. We found 14 trials including a total of 1127 participants who were aged under 18. We made the following conclusions.• There may be no difference in treatment success when comparing probiotics to placebo.• We were unable to draw conclusions on whether there is a difference in the frequency of defecation.• There may be no difference in treatment success when comparing probiotics and laxatives to laxatives alone.• We were unable to draw conclusions on frequency of defecation or treatment success when comparing probiotics to magnesium oxide.• Synbiotics may be better than placebo in improving the frequency of defection.• There may be no difference in how many people withdrew from the trials because of side effects when comparing probiotics to placebo, or probiotics and laxative to laxative alone.• We have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies only included a small number of children, and due to lack of detail on some of the methods used. 
All analyses were limited due to differences in the specific probiotics or the treatments they were compared with, low numbers of children included in the studies and, most importantly, the use of a range of different measures of success. This meant that combining studies was difficult, so the overall ability of this review to answer its core questions was limited. 
What next? 
Future studies are needed to find out how helpful probiotics are for childhood constipation. Researchers need to agree whether probiotics should be a first option therapy, an add‐on to other therapies, a second option after other therapies have failed, or a combination of all the above. 
Future research should measure the same items (known as a core outcome set) to ensure these results can support future reviews. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review is current to June 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD003459.pub4,"Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease
Although corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid‐induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies. 
","## Plain Title
Study on a Drug for Crohn's Disease

## Rationale
Crohn's disease makes the gut swell. This can cause much pain. It makes life hard for patients. Doctors often give strong drugs called steroids. Steroids help at first. But many patients get sick again. They need more steroids. Too many steroids cause bad problems.

This study looked at a drug called methotrexate. This drug calms the body's defense system. It may help people with Crohn's disease. The study wanted to see if methotrexate could help. It aimed to help patients feel better. It also aimed to help them stop using steroids.

## Trial Design
This study looked at other studies. It gathered facts from seven past trials. These trials had 495 people in total. The people in these studies had Crohn's disease. Their disease was still active. Other drugs had not worked well for them.

One main study looked at methotrexate. Patients got a shot of methotrexate. They got 25 mg each week. This went on for 16 weeks. The goal was to see if they got better. It also looked if they could stop steroids.

Other studies looked at methotrexate pills. They used a lower dose. Patients took 12.5 to 15 mg each week. Some got a fake pill. Some got other drugs. These studies were small.

Some studies looked at methotrexate with another drug. This drug is called infliximab. They checked if adding methotrexate helped more.

## Results
One large study showed good results. Methotrexate shots helped patients feel better. It helped them stop taking steroids. This means fewer bad problems from steroids. Patients with Crohn's disease could live better lives.

This study used 25 mg of methotrexate weekly. Patients got a shot. This went on for 16 weeks. It helped them get better. It also helped them stop steroids. This is a big help. It means fewer side effects from steroids.

Methotrexate can have side effects. These include feeling sick to your stomach. You might throw up. You might have tummy pain. Diarrhea and skin rash can also happen. Headaches are also possible. But no serious problems were seen in this study.

Lower doses of methotrexate pills did not work as well. This was based on smaller studies. More study is needed for methotrexate pills.

Adding methotrexate to infliximab did not seem to help more. This was in small studies. More research is needed for this.

The study showed methotrexate shots can help. It helps people with active Crohn's disease. It helps them feel better. It also lowers steroid use. This is good news for many patients.","Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease

Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. In a previous Cochrane Review we found that supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone compared to no vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and low birthweight and may increase the risk of preterm births if it is combined with calcium. However the effects of different vitamin D regimens are not yet clear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety of different regimens of vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins, minerals or nutrients during pregnancy, specifically doses of 601 international units per day (IU/d) or more versus 600 IU/d or less; and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (12 July 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (dose, frequency, duration, and time of commencement of supplementation during pregnancy), alone or in combination with other nutrients on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. We only included trials that compared 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. We did not include in the analysis groups that received no vitamin D, as that comparison is assessed in another Cochrane Review. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently: i) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria; ii) extracted data from included studies, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Our primary maternal outcomes were: pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and any adverse effects; our primary infant outcomes were preterm birth and low birthweight. Data were checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
In this review, we included data from 30 trials involving 7289 women. We excluded 11 trials, identified 16 ongoing/unpublished trials and two trials are awaiting classification. Overall risk of bias for the trials was mixed. 
Comparison 1. 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient (19 trials; 5214 participants) 
Supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.42); 5 trials; 1553 participants,low‐certainty evidence), may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86; 5 trials; 1846 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), may make little or no difference to the risk of preterm birth (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.69; 4 trials; 2294 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference to the risk of low birthweight (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 4 trials; 1550 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. 
Comparison 2. 4000 IU or more versus 3999 IU or less of vitamin D alone (15 trials; 4763 participants) 
Supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of: pre‐eclampsia (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.22; 4 trials, 1903 participants, low‐certainty evidence); gestational diabetes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.42; 5 trials, 2276 participants; low‐certainty evidence); preterm birth (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.12; 6 trials, 2948 participants, low‐certainty evidence); and low birthweight (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.70; 2 trials; 1099 participants; low‐certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. 
Adverse events (such as hypercalcaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypercalciuria, and hypovitaminosis D) were reported differently in most trials; however, in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. 
Authors' conclusions
Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, preterm birth and low birthweight. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. In general, the GRADE was considered low certainty for most of the primary outcomes due to serious risk of bias and imprecision of results. With respect to safety, it appears that vitamin D supplementation is a safe intervention during pregnancy, although the parameters used to determine this were either not reported or not consistent between trials. Future trials should be consistent in their reports of adverse events. There are 16 ongoing trials that when published, will increase the body of knowledge. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title
Vitamin D for Pregnant Women: How Much is Best?

### Rationale
During pregnancy, some women do not have enough vitamin D. This is called vitamin D deficiency. This can lead to serious health problems for both mom and baby. These problems include:

*   **Pre-eclampsia:** This is high blood pressure during pregnancy. It can harm the mother and baby.
*   **Gestational diabetes:** This is high blood sugar that starts during pregnancy.
*   **Preterm birth:** This is when a baby is born too early.
*   **Low birthweight:** This is when a baby weighs too little at birth.

We know that taking vitamin D may help reduce some of these risks. But we are not sure what amount of vitamin D is best. We also want to know if certain amounts are safe. This study looked at different amounts of vitamin D. It compared them to see what worked best and was safest.

### Trial Design
This study was a large review of many other studies. It gathered information from 30 studies. These studies included 7,289 pregnant women. All women in these studies took some amount of vitamin D. Some women also took calcium or other vitamins.

We looked at two main things:
1.  Did taking more than 600 units of vitamin D each day make a difference?
2.  Did taking more than 3,999 units of vitamin D each day make a difference?

We wanted to see how these amounts affected pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. We also looked for any bad side effects. The studies lasted for the full term of the pregnancy.

### Results
We found some important things:

**Taking more than 600 units of vitamin D each day:**
*   It may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes. This is a good benefit for moms.
*   It did not seem to change the risk of pre-eclampsia.
*   It did not seem to change the risk of preterm birth.
*   It did not seem to change the risk of low birthweight.

**Taking more than 3,999 units of vitamin D each day:**
*   It did not seem to change the risk of pre-eclampsia.
*   It did not seem to change the risk of gestational diabetes.
*   It did not seem to change the risk of preterm birth.
*   It did not seem to change the risk of low birthweight.

Overall, vitamin D seems safe for pregnant women. There were few or no bad side effects reported. When side effects did happen, they were similar in all groups.

**What we learned:**
Taking more vitamin D than what is usually suggested may lower the risk of gestational diabetes. But it did not seem to help with other problems like pre-eclampsia or early birth. Even taking high amounts of vitamin D did not seem to cause more problems. More studies are ongoing. They will give us more clear answers in the future.","Regimens of vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy
What is the issue? 
This review evaluated if there are beneficial effects of supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation (200 international units/day (IU/d) to 600 IU/d) on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes and to evaluate if there are negative health effects when using more than the current upper limit recommendation (4000 IU/d). 
Why is this important? 
Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy compared to no supplementation appears to decrease the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight and may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage. However, it is not clear if doses greater than the currently recommended level are needed to observe these health benefits, and if giving more than the upper limit is related to adverse events. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review included trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (doses, frequencies, duration, and times of commencement) to compare the effects of 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less, of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. 
What evidence did we find? 
Evidence from 19 trials involving 5214 women suggest that supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes but may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. 
Evidence from 15 trials involving 4763 women suggests that supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. 
Adverse events were reported differently in most trials; in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. 
What does this mean? 
Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference in the risk of the other outcomes. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. Vitamin D supplementation appears to be safe.

Hypoglycaemia is a common occurrence in people with diabetes but can also result from an imbalance in glucose homeostasis in the absence of diabetes. The best enteral route for glucose administration for suspected hypoglycaemia in a first aid situation is unknown. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of first aid glucose administration by any route appropriate for use by first‐aid providers (buccal, sublingual, oral, rectal) for symptomatic hypoglycaemia. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL as well as grey literature (records identified in the WHO ICTRP Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov and the EU Clinical Trials Register) up to July 2018. We searched reference lists of included studies retrieved by the above searches. 
Selection criteria
We included studies involving adults and children with documented or suspected hypoglycaemia as well as healthy volunteers, in which glucose was administered by any enteral route appropriate for use by first‐aid providers. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, extracted data and evaluated trials for overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess the risk of bias in the randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and the 'risk of bias In non‐randomised studies of interventions' (ROBINS‐I) tool, in addition to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions recommendations on cross‐over studies, for the non‐RCTs. We reported continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs. All data on glucose concentrations were converted to mg/dL. We contacted authors of included studies to obtain missing data. 
Main results
From 6394 references, we included four studies evaluating 77 participants, including two RCTs, studying children and adults with hypoglycaemia, respectively, and two non‐RCTs with healthy volunteers. The studies included three different routes of glucose administration (sublingual, buccal and a combination of oral and buccal administration). All studies had a high risk of bias in one or more 'Risk of bias' domain. 
Glucose administration by the sublingual route, in the form of table sugar under the tongue, resulted in a higher blood glucose concentration after 20 minutes compared with the oral route in the very specific setting of children with hypoglycaemia and symptoms of concomitant malaria or respiratory tract infection (MD 17 mg/dL, 95% CI 4.4 to 29.6; P = 0.008; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Resolution of hypoglycaemia at 80 minutes may favour sublingual administration (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.54; P = 0.006; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but no substantial difference could be demonstrated at 20 minutes (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.74; P = 0.16; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A decrease in the time to resolution of hypoglycaemia was found in favour of sublingual administration (MD ‐51.5 min, 95% CI ‐58 to ‐45; P < 0.001; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported in either group. No data were available for resolution of symptoms and time to resolution of symptoms, and treatment delay. 
Glucose administered by the buccal route in one study resulted in a lower plasma glucose concentration after 20 minutes compared with oral administration (MD ‐14.4 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐17.5 to ‐11.4 for an imputed within‐participants correlation coefficient of 0.9; P < 0.001; 1 trial; 16 participants; very low‐quality evidence). In another study there were fewer participants with increased blood glucose at 20 minutes favouring oral glucose (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.98; P = 0.05; 1 study; 7 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No data were available for resolution of symptoms and time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia and time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. 
For the combined oral and buccal mucosal route (in the form of a dextrose gel) the MD was ‐15.3 mg/dL, 95%CI ‐33.6 to 3; P = 0.09; 1 study; 18 participants; very low‐quality evidence . No improvement was identified for either route in the resolution of symptoms at 20 minutes or less following glucose administration (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.14; P = 0.08; 1 study; 18 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No data were available for time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia and time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. 
Authors' conclusions
When providing first aid to individuals with hypoglycaemia, oral glucose administration results in a higher blood glucose concentrations after 20 minutes when compared with buccal administration of glucose. A difference in plasma glucose concentration could not be demonstrated, when administering a dextrose gel, defined as “a combined oral and buccal mucosal route” compared to oral administration of a glucose tablet or solution. In the specific population of children with concomitant malaria and respiratory illness, sublingual sugar results in a higher blood glucose concentration after 20 minutes when compared with oral administration.These results need to be interpreted cautiously because our confidence in the body of evidence is very low due to the low number of participants and studies as well as methodological deficiencies in the included studies.

## Plain Title: How to give sugar when blood sugar is too low

### Rationale

Sometimes, people's blood sugar drops too low. This is called hypoglycemia. It happens a lot in people with diabetes. But it can also happen to others.

When blood sugar is too low, it can make people feel unwell. They might feel shaky, confused, or dizzy. It is a big problem for these patients.

This study looked at how best to give sugar quickly. We wanted to find the fastest way to raise blood sugar. This is for when someone needs first aid. We looked at different ways to give sugar. We wanted to see which way works best.

### Trial Design

This study gathered information from other studies. We looked at how these studies were set up. We checked what they found. We searched many places for these studies. We looked until July 2018.

We included studies with kids and adults. These people had blood sugar that was too low. We also looked at studies with healthy people. The sugar was given by first aid helpers. This means sugar was given by mouth, under the tongue, in the cheek, or by the bottom.

Two people checked all the studies. They made sure the studies were good. They looked for any problems with how the studies were done. They also looked at the safety of the evidence.

### Results

We found four studies to review. They looked at 77 people in total. Two studies looked at kids and adults with low blood sugar. Two studies looked at healthy people.

The studies looked at three ways to give sugar. These were under the tongue, in the cheek, or a mix of in the mouth and in the cheek.

All the studies had some problems with how they were done. This means we need to be careful with the results.

One study looked at giving sugar under the tongue. This was like table sugar. It raised blood sugar more after 20 minutes. This was in kids who also had malaria or a chest cold. Their blood sugar went up by 17 mg/dL more.

Giving sugar under the tongue also helped faster. It took less time for their low blood sugar to get better. There were no bad effects reported.

Another study looked at giving sugar in the cheek. This did not raise blood sugar as much. It raised it less than giving sugar by mouth. Their blood sugar went down by 14.4 mg/dL less.

In this study, fewer people had higher blood sugar after 20 minutes. This means giving sugar by mouth was better. We did not have data on how symptoms got better.

One study looked at a gel. This gel was given in the mouth and in the cheek. It did not show a clear difference. It was compared to taking a sugar pill or drink. It did not help symptoms get better faster.

Overall, giving sugar by mouth was better than in the cheek. It raised blood sugar more after 20 minutes. The sugar gel did not show a clear benefit. But, for kids with other sicknesses, sugar under the tongue worked best. It raised blood sugar more and faster.

These results are still very early. We need more studies to be sure. There were not many people in these studies. Also, the studies had some problems.","First aid glucose administration routes for symptomatic hypoglycaemia
Review question 
We examined the effects of various routes of glucose administration as a first‐aid treatment in people with suspected or symptomatic hypoglycaemia. 
Background 
Hypoglycaemia, or having low blood sugar levels, is a common occurrence in people with diabetes but may also occur in other persons due to an imbalance in blood sugar regulation. Symptoms of mild or moderate hypoglycaemia are for example, shakiness, dizziness, sweating or nervousness, First aid for this condition is usually self‐administered but is often provided by family or friends, and glucose tablets compared with dietary forms of sugar such as juice, candies or dried fruit strips have shown to result in a better resolution of symptoms. Glucose can be given orally (swallowed), but also inside the cheek against the buccal mucosa (‘buccal administration’), under the tongue (‘sublingual administration’) or via the rectal route. In the latter three ways of treatment, the glucose is not being swallowed as with the oral route. 
Study characteristics 
We identified four studies. One randomised study (clinical trials where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) compared sublingual glucose administration, in the form of table sugar, with an oral administration in 42 hypoglycaemic children between one and 15 years old. Two non‐randomised studies compared buccal glucose administration with oral administration in 23 adult healthy fasting volunteers. One randomised study compared a dextrose gel with oral administration of glucose in 18 people with type 1 diabetes and hypoglycaemia. 
Key results 
Providing sugar under the tongue (sublingual) resulted in a greater rise in blood glucose after 20 minutes than giving the sugar orally, but this was in a specific setting including children with hypoglycaemia and symptoms of concomitant malaria or respiratory tract infection. On the other hand, giving glucose by the buccal mucosa route resulted in a lower plasma glucose concentration than with the oral route. For dextrose gel (where uptake of the glucose occurs through a combination of oral swallowing and via the buccal mucosa), no clear benefit was shown compared to oral glucose administration (glucose tablets or glucose solutions). Most studies did not report on time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia as defined by blood glucose levels above a certain threshold, time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The evidence is of very low certainty due to limitations in study design, few studies and small number of participants in the studies, and because half of the studies were performed with healthy volunteers rather than in people with characteristic hypoglycaemia.

10.1002-14651858.CD014953.pub2,"Background
Cataract surgery is the most common incisional surgical procedure in ophthalmology and is important in ophthalmic graduate medical education. Although most ophthalmology training programs in the United States (US) include virtual reality (VR) training for cataract surgery, comprehensive reviews that detail the impact of VR training on ophthalmology trainee performance are lacking. 
Objectives
To assess the impact of VR training for cataract surgery on the operating performance of postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, measured by operating time, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, supervising physician ratings, and VR simulator task ratings. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 June 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing VR training to any other method of training, including non‐VR simulation training (e.g., wet laboratory training), didactics training, or no supplementary training in postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were operating times in the operating room and intraoperative complications. Secondary outcomes were operating times in simulated settings, simulator task ratings, and supervising physician ratings, either in the operating room or simulated settings. 
Main results
We included six RCTs with a total of 151 postgraduate ophthalmology trainees ranging from 12 to 60 participants in each study. The included studies varied widely in terms of geography: two in the US, and one study each in China, Germany, India, and Morocco. Three studies compared VR training for phacoemulsification cataract surgery on the Eyesi simulator (VRmagic, Mannheim, Germany) with wet laboratory training and two studies compared VR training with no supplementary training. One study compared trainees who received VR training with those who received conventional training for manual small incision cataract surgery on the HelpMeSee simulator (HelpMeSee, New York, NY). Industry financially supported two studies. All studies had at least three domains judged at high or unclear risks of bias. We did not conduct a meta‐analysis due to insufficient data (i.e., lack of precision measurements, or studies reported only P values). All evidence was very low‐certainty, meaning that any estimates were unreliable. 
The evidence for the benefits of VR training for trainees was very uncertain for primary outcomes. VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had shorter operating times (mean difference [MD] −17 minutes, 95% confidence interval [CI] −21.62 to −12.38; 1 study, n = 12; very low‐certainty evidence). Results for operating time were inconsistent when comparing VR and wet laboratory training: one study found that VR relative to wet laboratory training was associated with longer operating times (P = 0.038); the other reported that two training groups had similar operating times (P = 0.14). One study reported that VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had fewer intraoperative complications (P < 0.001); in another study, VR and conventionally trained trainees had similar intraoperative complication rates (MD −8.31, 95% CI −22.78 to 6.16; 1 study, n = 19; very low‐certainty evidence). 
For secondary outcomes, VR training may have similar impact on trainee performance compared to wet laboratory and greater impact compared to no supplementary training, but the evidence was very uncertain. One study reported VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had significantly reduced operating time in simulated settings (P = 0.0013). Another study reported that VR‐trained relative to wet laboratory‐trained trainees had shorter operating times in VR settings (MD −1.40 minutes, 95% CI −1.96 to −0.84; 1 study, n = 60) and similar times in wet laboratory settings (MD 0.16 minutes, 95% CI −0.50 to 0.82; 1 study, n = 60). This study also found the VR‐trained trainees had higher VR simulator ratings (MD 5.17, 95% CI 0.61 to 9.73; 1 study, n = 60). Results for supervising physician ratings in the operating room were inconsistent: one study reported that VR‐ and wet laboratory‐trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings for cataract surgery (P = 0.608); another study reported that VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training were less likely to receive poor ratings by supervising physicians for capsulorhexis construction (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57). In wet laboratory settings, VR‐trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings compared with wet laboratory‐trained trainees (MD −1.50, 95% CI −6.77 to 3.77; n = 60) and higher supervising physician ratings compared with trainees without supplementary training (P < 0.0001). However, the results for all secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution because of very low‐certainty evidence.  
Authors' conclusions
Current research suggests that VR training may be more effective than no supplementary training in improving trainee performance in the operating room and simulated settings for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence comparing VR with conventional or wet laboratory training was less consistent.

## How Virtual Reality Training Helps Eye Doctors Learn Surgery

### Rationale

Eye doctors often do a surgery called cataract surgery. This surgery helps people see better when their eye lens gets cloudy. Learning this surgery is a big part of training for new eye doctors.

This training is very important. New doctors need to learn how to do the surgery well and safely. Many training programs use special virtual reality (VR) tools to help. VR training lets doctors practice without real patients.

We wanted to see if VR training truly helps new eye doctors perform better. We looked at how fast they did surgery and if they had fewer problems. We also checked what their teachers thought of their skills. We think VR training could be a good way to teach new doctors. It gives them a safe place to learn and get better.

### Trial Design

This study looked at how different studies were set up. It was a review of studies where people were put into groups by chance. This is called a ""randomized controlled trial.""

These studies looked at new eye doctors after medical school. They were learning to do cataract surgery. The studies compared VR training to other ways of learning. This included practicing on models, learning from books, or having no extra training.

Doctors in these studies ranged in age, but no specific ages were given. Both male and female doctors were included. The studies came from different parts of the world. We looked at how long it took doctors to do surgery and if they had problems during or after surgery. Teachers also rated their skills. The time a person was in any one study varied.

### Results

We looked at six studies that included 151 new eye doctors. These doctors were training to do cataract surgery. The studies came from different countries like the US, China, and Germany.

Some studies compared VR training to practicing on models. Other studies compared VR training to no extra training.

The results were not always clear. It was hard to be sure about the benefits of VR training. This is because the studies were set up in different ways.

One study showed that doctors with VR training, compared to those with no extra training, did surgery faster. They took about 17 minutes less. One study also found that doctors with VR training had fewer problems during surgery.

When comparing VR training to practicing on models, the results were mixed. Some studies found similar times for both groups. One study even found VR training took longer.

For practice in a VR setting, doctors with VR training did surgery faster than those with no extra training. They also did better on VR tasks.

Teachers' ratings of doctors in real surgery were not always clear. Some studies found similar ratings for VR training and model practice. One study found that teachers gave better ratings to VR-trained doctors compared to those with no extra training.

Overall, the studies suggest that VR training might help new eye doctors. It might make them faster and have fewer problems, especially when compared to no extra training. But we need more clear studies to be sure.","Can virtual reality training for cataract surgery supplement or replace other training methods for ophthalmology trainees? 
Key messagesWe did not find enough evidence to show that virtual reality (VR) training improves cataract surgery performance among ophthalmology trainees compared to wet lab or conventional training. 
What is virtual reality training?VR training uses computer technology to simulate a three‐dimensional interactive environment. 
How does cataract surgery training work in ophthalmology trainees?Most postgraduate ophthalmology trainees in the United States (US) transition gradually from performing specific cataract surgery (replacing the cloudy lens inside the eye with an artificial one) steps in a wet laboratory (practicing on cadaver or artificial tissues) or using VR simulators to performing cataract surgery in the operating room. 
Why is this question important?VR training is becoming increasingly common in postgraduate ophthalmology training, but comprehensive reviews of the impact of VR training on trainees’ cataract surgery performance are lacking. 
What did we want to find out?The primary aim of this review was to determine whether VR training improved operating room performance (measured by operating time in the operating room, intraoperative [during the operation] complications, or postoperative [after the operation] complications) in cataract surgery for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. The secondary aim was to identify the impact of VR training on operating time in simulated settings, supervising physician ratings in the operating room or simulator settings, or VR simulation task ratings. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched for studies that compared VR training to other training methods such as traditional wet laboratory training or no supplementary training in a postgraduate ophthalmology trainee population. 
What did we find?VR relative to conventional or wet laboratory training did not impact operating times, the rate of intraoperative complications, or supervising physician ratings in the operating room. However, compared to trainees without supplementary training, VR‐trained trainees received higher supervising physician ratings in the operating room. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. 
What does this mean?VR training is a promising intervention for teaching cataract surgery, but more rigorous, evidence‐based studies are needed to gauge its impact on key outcomes such as intraoperative and postoperative complications.  
How up‐to‐date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 14 June 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD015397,"Background
With the emergence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in late 2019, governments worldwide implemented a multitude of non‐pharmaceutical interventions in order to control the spread of the virus. Most countries have implemented measures within the school setting in order to reopen schools or keep them open whilst aiming to contain the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. For informed decision‐making on implementation, adaptation, or suspension of such measures, it is not only crucial to evaluate their effectiveness with regard to SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission, but also to assess their unintended consequences. 
Objectives
To comprehensively identify and map the evidence on the unintended health and societal consequences of school‐based measures to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. We aimed to generate a descriptive overview of the range of unintended (beneficial or harmful) consequences reported as well as the study designs that were employed to assess these outcomes. This review was designed to complement an existing Cochrane Review on the effectiveness of these measures by synthesising evidence on the implications of the broader system‐level implications of school measures beyond their effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, four non‐health databases, and two COVID‐19 reference collections on 26 March 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and Google searches. 
Selection criteria
We included quantitative (including mathematical modelling), qualitative, and mixed‐methods studies of any design that provided evidence on any unintended consequences of measures implemented in the school setting to contain the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. Studies had to report on at least one unintended consequence, whether beneficial or harmful, of one or more relevant measures, as conceptualised in a logic model.  
Data collection and analysis
We screened the titles/abstracts and subsequently full texts in duplicate, with any discrepancies between review authors resolved through discussion. One review author extracted data for all included studies, with a second review author reviewing the data extraction for accuracy. The evidence was summarised narratively and graphically across four prespecified intervention categories and six prespecified categories of unintended consequences; findings were described as deriving from quantitative, qualitative, or mixed‐method studies. 
Main results
Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 13 used quantitative methods (3 experimental/quasi‐experimental; 5 observational; 5 modelling); four used qualitative methods; and one used mixed methods. Studies looked at effects in different population groups, mainly in children and teachers. The identified interventions were assigned to four broad categories: 14 studies assessed measures to make contacts safer; four studies looked at measures to reduce contacts; six studies assessed surveillance and response measures; and one study examined multiple measures combined. Studies addressed a wide range of unintended consequences, most of them considered harmful. Eleven studies investigated educational consequences. Seven studies reported on psychosocial outcomes. Three studies each provided information on physical health and health behaviour outcomes beyond COVID‐19 and environmental consequences. Two studies reported on socio‐economic consequences, and no studies reported on equity and equality consequences. 
Authors' conclusions
We identified a heterogeneous evidence base on unintended consequences of measures implemented in the school setting to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2, and summarised the available study data narratively and graphically. Primary research better focused on specific measures and various unintended outcomes is needed to fill knowledge gaps and give a broader picture of the diverse unintended consequences of school‐based measures before a more thorough evidence synthesis is warranted. The most notable lack of evidence we found was regarding psychosocial, equity, and equality outcomes. We also found a lack of research on interventions that aim to reduce the opportunity for contacts. Additionally, study investigators should provide sufficient data on contextual factors and demographics in order to ensure analyses of such are feasible, thus assisting stakeholders in making appropriate, informed decisions for their specific circumstances.

### Plain Title
How School Rules During COVID-19 Affected Kids and Schools

### Rationale
The COVID-19 virus started spreading in late 2019. It made many people sick. Governments all over the world tried to stop the virus. They put rules in place to help.

Schools also had rules to keep kids safe. These rules helped schools open or stay open. We needed to know if these rules worked. We also needed to know if they caused other problems.

This study looked at what else happened because of school rules. We wanted to see if the rules had good or bad side effects. This helps us make smart choices about school rules in the future. We wanted to see what other things happened, not just how the virus spread.

### Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies. We searched for papers about school rules during COVID-19. We wanted to find out what other things happened because of these rules.

We looked for studies that used numbers. We also looked for studies that used people's stories. These studies could be about any unintended effects. These effects could be good or bad.

We searched many health and non-health records. This included a big database called Cochrane. We also checked other papers and used Google. We looked at the titles and summaries first. Then we read the full papers. Two people checked each paper to make sure. We gathered facts from all the chosen papers.

### Results
We found 18 studies that fit our needs. Most of these studies used numbers. Some used stories from people. One study used both.

These studies looked at kids and teachers. They checked what happened to them. The studies looked at different types of school rules. Some rules made being close to others safer. Some rules tried to have fewer people together. Some rules watched for sickness.

Many studies found bad side effects. Eleven studies looked at how learning was affected. Seven studies looked at feelings and social life. Three studies looked at health problems besides COVID-19. Three studies looked at the environment. Two studies looked at money matters. No studies looked at fairness for everyone.

We learned a lot about what else happened from school rules. These rules were meant to stop COVID-19. But they also had other effects. Most of these effects were not good.

We need more studies to learn even more. We need to look at specific rules. We need to look at many different side effects. We also need to know more about feelings and fairness. This will help leaders make better choices for schools.","Unintended consequences of school‐based measures to manage the COVID‐19 pandemic
Why is this question important? 
Countries worldwide have taken many public health and social measures to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2, a highly contagious respiratory virus responsible for COVID‐19. A range of measures have been put in place to minimise transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 within schools and the wider community. Schools have the potential to be settings of high viral transmission because they involve extended interactions amongst people in close proximity. A previous review located and examined studies on the effectiveness of such school‐based measures regarding SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission. It is equally important to look at their unintended consequences on health and society in order that policymakers and parents can make informed decisions. Unintended consequences of a public health measure may be beneficial or harmful (or a mix of both). A public health measure may result in a mix of benefits and harms. For this review, we planned to examine the unintended consequences of measures designed to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 in schools. This review can therefore be seen as complementing the previous review on the effectiveness of such measures.    
What did we do? 
Firstly, we searched nine databases for studies that assessed any measure put in place in the school settings (primary or secondary schools, or both) to prevent transmission of the virus. We considered all types of studies and a broad range of outcomes. 
Secondly, we grouped the identified studies according to the types of measures they examined. We then described which approaches were used in the studies, where these were conducted, and which unintended consequences were evaluated.  
What did we find? 
We found 18 studies that matched our inclusion criteria. Five studies used ‘real‐life’ data (observational studies); five studies used data generated by a computer and based on a set of assumptions (modelling studies); three studies were experimental studies (e.g. laboratory‐based); and four studies used qualitative methods, meaning they based their findings on interviews with people. One study used mixed methods, combining numerical and non‐numerical (qualitative) information.  
Studies examined four different types of measures, as follows.
‐ Measures to reduce contacts (4 studies): policies to reduce the number of students in the school building (i.e. reducing the number of students present per class) and/or to reduce the number of contacts of students (e.g. through defined groups or staggered arrival, breaks, and departures). 
‐ Measures to make contacts safer (14 studies): practices to ensure safer contacts between people in the school and classroom setting (e.g. mask mandates or distancing regulations), to modify the environment or activities (e.g. enhanced cleaning or ventilation practices). 
‐ Surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (6 studies): testing and/or screening strategies (e.g. temperature taking, screening tests for students and staff, and testing of symptomatic students and staff) and self‐isolation or quarantine measures. 
‐ Multicomponent measures (1 study): interventions using a combination of at least two of the above measures. 
We looked at the following unintended outcomes.
‐ Educational consequences (11 studies), e.g. changes in school performance, advancement to the next grade, or change in graduation numbers. 
‐ Psychosocialoutcomes (7 studies), e.g. mental health, anxieties about going to school. 
‐ Physical health and health behaviour outcomes beyond COVID‐19 (3 studies), e.g. hand eczema due to increased handwashing. 
‐ Environmental consequences (3 studies), e.g. changes in air quality in classrooms. 
‐ Socio‐economic consequences (2 studies), e.g. economic burden on families.  
What did we conclude? 
We identified a wide range of unintended consequences of school‐based measures designed to prevent the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. However, the evidence base is small, and there are large gaps where more research is needed. This scoping review is a first step in gauging the extent of those consequences. More research is needed to collect additional information and to enable a more thorough analysis of the evidence. Psychosocial consequences (e.g. mental health issues, depression, loneliness) and equity and equality consequences (e.g. disadvantages for children from low‐income households, unfair distribution of work between genders for parents, are in need of further attention. We recommend that future research look at interventions such as fixed groups, alternating physical presence at school and staggered arrival departure and break times, as well as testing and quarantine measures.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to March 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013173.pub2,"Background
Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is an increasingly recognised neurodevelopmental condition; that is, a neurologically‐based condition which interferes with the acquisition, retention or application of specific skills. ASD is characterised by challenges with socialisation and communication, and by stereotyped and repetitive behaviours. A stereotyped behaviour is one which is repeated over and over again and which seems not to have any useful function. ASD often co‐occurs with mental health disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). People with ASD may show certain cognitive differences (i.e. differences in ways of thinking) which influence their response to therapies. Thus, there is a need for evidence‐based guidelines to treat mental health issues in this group. 
OCD, a common condition characterised by repeated obsessional thoughts and compulsive acts, occurs with greater frequency in persons with ASD than in the general population. Genetic, anatomic, neurobiological and psychological factors have been proposed to explain this co‐occurrence. However, care should be taken to distinguish stereotyped and repetitive behaviours characteristic of ASD from obsessive compulsive acts in OCD. 
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the recommended treatment for OCD, but studies have suggested that this treatment may be less effective in those with OCD co‐occurring with ASD. Hence, modifications to CBT treatment may be helpful when treating OCD co‐occurring with ASD to optimise outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 
Search methods
We searched for studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, five other bibliographic databases, international trial registries and other sources of grey literature (to 24 August 2020). We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies missed from the original electronic searches. We contacted subject experts for further information when needed. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross‐over, cluster‐ and quasi‐randomised controlled trials involving both adults and children with diagnoses of OCD and ASD. We included studies of participants with co‐occurring conditions (i.e. those experiencing other mental illnesses or neurodevelopmental conditions at the same time), but we did not include individuals who had a co‐occurring global learning difficulty. Treatment could be in any setting or format and include behavioural therapy (BT) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which may have been adapted for those with ASD. Comparator interventions included no treatment, waiting list, attention placebo (where the control group receives non‐specific aspects of therapy, but not the active ingredient) and treatment as usual (TAU, where the control group receives the usual treatment, according to accepted standards). 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently screened studies for inclusion. The authors extracted relevant data from the one eligible study, assessed the risk of bias and certainty of evidence (GRADE). Outcomes of interest were changes in OCD symptoms and treatment completion (primary outcome), and severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and behavioural difficulties, as well as degree of family accommodation (secondary outcomes). We did not conduct meta‐analyses as only one study met the selection criteria. 
Main results
We included only one RCT of 46 participants in our analysis. This study compared CBT for OCD in persons with high‐functioning ASD with a control group who received anxiety management only. There were no differences in rates of treatment completion between the CBT (87%) and anxiety management (87%) groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.25; low‐certainty evidence). Behavioural difficulties were not included as an outcome measure in the study. This study showed that there may be a benefit at the end of treatment favouring CBT compared with anxiety management in OCD symptoms (mean difference (MD) ‐3.00, 95% CI ‐8.02 to 2.02), depression symptoms (MD ‐1.80, 95% CI ‐11.50 to 7.90), anxiety symptoms (MD ‐3.20, 95% CI ‐11.38 to 4.98), and quality of life (MD 5.20, 95% CI ‐1.41 to 11.81), but the evidence was of low certainty.  
Authors' conclusions
Evidence is limited regarding the efficacy of CBT for treatment of OCD in ASD. There is much scope for future study, not only examining the efficacy of CBT for OCD in ASD, but also the particular ways that OCD manifests in and affects people with ASD and the role of the family in treatment response. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Helping People with Autism and OCD

### Plain Title
How Does Talk Therapy Work for People with Autism and OCD?

### Rationale
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) makes it hard for people to talk with others. It also makes it hard to make friends. People with ASD often do things over and over again. These are called repetitive behaviors.

Some people with ASD also have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD makes people have unwanted thoughts. It also makes them do repeated actions. OCD can make daily life hard. It can cause much stress.

Doctors often use talk therapy, called CBT, for OCD. But CBT might not work as well for people with both ASD and OCD. We need better ways to help these patients. This study looked at how well CBT works for them. We wanted to see if it could make their lives better.

### Trial Design
This study looked at how CBT helps people with ASD and OCD. It included both kids and adults. They all had a diagnosis of ASD and OCD. Some also had other health problems. We did not include people with severe learning problems.

The study looked for past trials that fit these rules. These trials compared CBT to other ways of care. This included no treatment or usual care. We wanted to see if CBT changed symptoms of OCD. We also looked at how many people finished their treatment. We searched many health databases. We also talked to experts in the field.

### Results
We found only one study that met our rules. It had 46 people with high-functioning ASD. All of them also had OCD.

This study compared CBT to a type of anxiety help. Both groups had 87 out of 100 people finish treatment. This means CBT was just as easy to complete as other care.

The study showed some good news for CBT. People in the CBT group had fewer OCD symptoms. They also had less sadness and worry. Their quality of life got a bit better. But we need more research to be sure of these results.

More studies are needed to learn the best ways to help people with ASD and OCD. We also need to learn more about how OCD affects people with ASD. Family support is also key to good care.","Behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
Aim of the review 
The aim of the review is to see if cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help people who have OCD who also have ASD. 
Background 
People who have been given a diagnosis of ASD tend to have certain things in common. They often understand social interactions and communication differently to other people. People with ASD may also be less flexible in their thinking than other people, which may make it more difficult for them to use psychological therapies in the way that they are usually presented. The opinions of people with ASD are valuable in helping clinicians decide which research areas related to ASD should take priority. 
Someone who has been diagnosed with OCD has certain symptoms which, to some extent, affect how they are able to get on with their lives. Someone with OCD has persistent thoughts, although they don't want the thoughts and often think that the thoughts are unreasonable. These thoughts are often worries about themselves or someone else being harmed or about something not being perfect or just right. Sometimes the person with OCD feels as if they have to think thoughts or do actions repeatedly to 'make things right', even though they often really know that they don't need to. The repeated actions might be something like washing their hands. 
Research has shown that people with ASD are more likely to develop OCD. People may have certain genes that make them more likely to develop both ASD and OCD, or it may be that the way people with ASD tend to think makes them more likely to have OCD. 
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been used for a long time to treat OCD. CBT is usually carried out by visiting a therapist, but it can be delivered in different ways, such as online. CBT involves talking about the repeated thoughts that occur and helping the person manage and reduce them, and also involves trying to carry out compulsive actions less often. Because people with ASD sometimes have a different way of thinking and communicating, clinicians have wondered if CBT would be as useful to treat OCD in people with ASD as it is in people who have OCD but don't have ASD. Other researchers have devised ways to change the way that CBT is delivered to people with ASD to help them to get the most out of the treatment, and this is called 'adapted CBT'. Studies have shown that adapted CBT is useful for some anxiety disorders that occur in ASD. However, not as many studies have looked at how adapted CBT might be useful for OCD in people with ASD. 
Search 
We searched for randomised controlled trials of delivery of CBT to people with OCD who also had ASD. A randomised controlled trial is a trial where the participants are randomly allocated to CBT or another treatment group so that the people running the trial have no say about and do not know to which group the participants belong. The other treatment group is called the control group. In these studies, the people in the control group do not receive CBT, but they may have sessions with their therapists that do not include CBT, or they may be on a waiting list. If meeting with your therapist or waiting for time to pass were just as helpful as CBT, for example, then the results would be less likely to show a difference between the outcomes of the treatment group and the control group. Conversely, if CBT was more effective, then we might expect to see the CBT group doing better than the control group. Therefore, at the end of each trial, when the results in the treatment group are compared to the results in the control group, it gives information about how effective CBT might be for people with OCD and ASD. The evidence in this review is current to August 2020. 
Conclusion 
We found that there was only one published randomised controlled trial of delivery of CBT to people with OCD and ASD that met our search criteria. The control group in this trial was given a treatment called 'anxiety management' which helped the participants to manage anxiety but did not help them to deal specifically with repeated thoughts and actions, as CBT does. This study aimed to see if either anxiety management or CBT was better at treating OCD in people with ASD, but the study did not find a difference in response between the two treatments.

Melanoma has one of the fastest rising incidence rates of any cancer. It accounts for a small percentage of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. History‐taking and visual inspection of a suspicious lesion by a clinician is usually the first in a series of ‘tests’ to diagnose skin cancer. Establishing the accuracy of visual inspection alone is critical to understating the potential contribution of additional tests to assist in the diagnosis of melanoma. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection for the detection of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in adults with limited prior testing and in those referred for further evaluation of a suspicious lesion. Studies were separated according to whether the diagnosis was recorded face‐to‐face (in‐person) or based on remote (image‐based) assessment. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: CENTRAL; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated visual inspection in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma, compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. We excluded studies reporting data for ‘clinical diagnosis’ where dermoscopy may or may not have been used. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities per algorithm and threshold using the bivariate hierarchical model. We investigated the impact of: in‐person test interpretation; use of a purposely developed algorithm to assist diagnosis; and observer expertise. 
Main results
We included 49 publications reporting on a total of 51 study cohorts with 34,351 lesions (including 2499 cases), providing 134 datasets for visual inspection. Across almost all study quality domains, the majority of study reports provided insufficient information to allow us to judge the risk of bias, while in three of four domains that we assessed we scored concerns regarding applicability of study findings as 'high'. Selective participant recruitment, lack of detail regarding the threshold for deciding on a positive test result, and lack of detail on observer expertise were particularly problematic. 
Attempts to analyse studies by degree of prior testing were hampered by a lack of relevant information and by the restricted inclusion of lesions selected for biopsy or excision. Accuracy was generally much higher for in‐person diagnosis compared to image‐based evaluations (relative diagnostic odds ratio of 8.54, 95% CI 2.89 to 25.3, P < 0.001). Meta‐analysis of in‐person evaluations that could be clearly placed on the clinical pathway showed a general trade‐off between sensitivity and specificity, with the highest sensitivity (92.4%, 95% CI 26.2% to 99.8%) and lowest specificity (79.7%, 95% CI 73.7% to 84.7%) observed in participants with limited prior testing (n = 3 datasets). Summary sensitivities were lower for those referred for specialist assessment but with much higher specificities (e.g. sensitivity 76.7%, 95% CI 61.7% to 87.1%) and specificity 95.7%, 95% CI 89.7% to 98.3%) for lesions selected for excision, n = 8 datasets). These differences may be related to differences in the spectrum of included lesions, differences in the definition of a positive test result, or to variations in observer expertise. We did not find clear evidence that accuracy is improved by the use of any algorithm to assist diagnosis in all settings. Attempts to examine the effect of observer expertise in melanoma diagnosis were hindered due to poor reporting. 
Authors' conclusions
Visual inspection is a fundamental component of the assessment of a suspicious skin lesion; however, the evidence suggests that melanomas will be missed if visual inspection is used on its own. The evidence to support its accuracy in the range of settings in which it is used is flawed and very poorly reported. Although published algorithms do not appear to improve accuracy, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the ‘no algorithm’ approach should be preferred in all settings. Despite the volume of research evaluating visual inspection, further prospective evaluation of the potential added value of using established algorithms according to the prior testing or diagnostic difficulty of lesions may be warranted. 
","## Simple Look at Skin Cancer Checks

**Rationale**

Skin cancer is a big problem. One type, called melanoma, is growing fast. It causes most deaths from skin cancer. Doctors often look at a skin spot first to see if it might be cancer. This is called visual inspection. We need to know how well this first look works. This helps us understand if other tests are also needed.

This study wants to find out how good a doctor's first look is at finding melanoma. We looked at adults who had not been tested much before. We also looked at adults sent to a skin doctor because of a worry about a spot. This study is important because it helps us know if looking at a spot alone is enough.

**Trial Design**

This study looked at many past studies. We wanted to see how well doctors find skin cancer just by looking. We included studies that checked adults with skin spots that looked like melanoma. We compared the doctor's look to lab results or checking on the patient later. We did not include studies that used a special magnifying tool called a dermatoscope.

We searched many health databases until August 2016. Two people reviewed all the data. They made sure the information was correct. We wanted to see if checking in person was better than looking at pictures. We also checked if special rules or the doctor's skill made a difference.

**Results**

We looked at 49 reports. These reports covered 51 study groups. A total of 34,351 skin spots were checked. Out of these, 2,499 were melanoma. Many studies did not share enough details. This made it hard to judge how well they were done. For example, we did not always know how doctors decided if a spot was cancer. We also did not always know how skilled the doctors were.

Looking at a patient in person was much better than looking at pictures. Seeing someone face-to-face was about eight times better at finding melanoma. For people not tested much before, the doctor's look found most melanomas (92 times out of 100). But it also said many healthy spots were cancer (about 20 times out of 100).

For people sent to a specialist, the doctor's look found fewer melanomas (about 77 times out of 100). But it was much better at not saying healthy spots were cancer (about 96 times out of 100). This might be because the spots were different. It could also be that doctors had different ways of deciding what was cancer. We did not find clear proof that special rules helped doctors find cancer better. We also could not fully check how a doctor's skill affected the results. This was because not enough details were shared.

Looking at a skin spot is a key part of checking for skin cancer. But our study shows that some melanomas will be missed if doctors only look at them. The past studies on how well looking works are often not clear or have problems. We need more studies to see if using special rules can help doctors find melanoma better. This is especially true for spots that are hard to tell apart.","How accurate is visual inspection of skin lesions with the naked eye for diagnosis of melanoma in adults? 
What is the aim of the review? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate checking suspicious skin lesions (lumps, bumps, wounds, scratches or grazes) with the naked eye (visual inspection) can be to diagnose melanoma (diagnostic accuracy). The Review also investigated whether diagnostic accuracy was different depending on whether the clinician was face to face with the patient (in‐person visual inspection), or looked at an image of the lesion (image‐based visual inspection). Cochrane researchers included 19 studies to answer this question. 
Why is it important to know the diagnostic accuracy of visual examination of skin lesions suspected to be melanomas? 
Not recognising a melanoma when it is present (a false‐negative test result) delays surgery to remove it (excision), risking cancer spreading to other organs in the body and possibly death. Diagnosing a skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) as a melanoma when it is not (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery, further investigations, and patient anxiety. Visual inspection of suspicious skin lesions by a clinician using the naked eye is usually the first of a series of ‘tests’ to diagnose melanoma. Knowing the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection alone is important to decide whether additional tests, such as a biopsy (removing a part of the lesion for examination under a microscope) are needed to improve accuracy to an acceptable level. 
What did the review study? 
Researchers wanted to find out the diagnostic accuracy of in‐person compared with image‐based visual inspection of suspicious skin lesions. Researchers also wanted to find out whether diagnostic accuracy was improved if doctors used a 'visual inspection checklist' or depending on how experienced in visual inspection they were (level of clinical expertise). They considered the diagnostic accuracy of the first visual inspection of a lesion, for example, by a general practitioner (GP), and of lesions that had been referred for further evaluation, for example, by a dermatologist (doctor specialising in skin problems). 
What are the main results of the review? 
Only 19 studies (17 in‐person studies and 2 image‐based studies) were clear whether the test was the first visual inspection of a lesion or was a visual inspection following referral (for example, when patients are referred by a GP to skin specialists for visual inspection). 
First in‐person visual inspection (3 studies) 
The results of three studies of 1339 suspicious skin lesions suggest that in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 90 (9%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ An estimated 268 will have a visual inspection result indicating melanoma is present. Of these, 185 will not be melanoma and will result in an unnecessary biopsy (false‐positive results). 
‐ An estimated 732 will have a visual inspection result indicating that melanoma is not present. Of these, seven will actually have melanoma and would not be sent for biopsy (false‐negative results). 
Two further studies restricted to 4228 suspicious skin lesions that were all selected to be excised found similar results. 
In‐person visual inspection after referral, all lesions selected to be excised (8 studies) 
The results of eight studies of 5331 suspicious skin lesions suggest that in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 90 (9%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ An estimated 108 will have a visual inspection result indicating melanoma is present, and of these, 39 will not be melanoma and will result in an unnecessary biopsy (false‐positive results). 
‐ Of the 892 lesions with a visual inspection result indicating that melanoma is not present, 21 will actually be melanoma and would not be sent for biopsy (false‐negative results). 
Overall, the number of false‐positive results (diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not) was observed to be higher and the number of false‐negative results (not recognising a melanoma when it is present) lower for first visual inspections of suspicious skin lesions compared to visual inspection following referral. 
Visual inspection of images of suspicious skin lesions (2 studies) 
Accuracy was much lower for visual inspection of images of lesions compared to visual inspection in person. 
Value of visual inspection checklists 
There was no evidence that use of a visual inspection checklist or the level of clinical expertise changed diagnostic accuracy. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The majority of included studies diagnosed melanoma by lesion biopsy and confirmed that melanoma was not present by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma. In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow‐up, or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses). Biopsy or follow‐up are likely to have been reliable methods for deciding whether patients really had melanoma. In a few studies, experts diagnosed the absence of melanoma (expert diagnosis), which is less likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had melanoma. There was lots of variation in the results of the studies in this review and the studies did not always describe fully the methods they used, which made it difficult to assess their reliability. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Thirteen studies were undertaken in Europe (68%), with the remainder undertaken in Asia (n = 1), Oceania (n = 4), and North America (n = 1). Mean age ranged from 30 to 73.6 years (reported in 10 studies). The percentage of individuals with melanoma ranged between 4% and 20% in first visualised lesions and between 1% and 50% in studies of referred lesions. In the majority of studies, the lesions were unlikely to be representative of the range of those seen in practice, for example, only including skin lesions of a certain size or with a specific appearance. In addition, variation in the expertise of clinicians performing visual inspection and in the definition used to decide whether or not melanoma was present across studies makes it unclear as to how visual inspection should be carried out and by whom in order to achieve the accuracy observed in studies. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Error rates from visual inspection are too high for it to be relied upon alone. Although not evaluated in this review, other technologies need to be used to ensure accurate diagnosis of skin cancer. There is considerable variation and uncertainty about the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection alone for the diagnosis of melanoma. There is no evidence to suggest that visual inspection checklists reliably improve the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection, so recommendations cannot be made about when they should be used. Despite the existence of numerous research studies, further, well‐reported studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection with and without visual inspection checklists and by clinicians with different levels of expertise are needed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.

10.1002-14651858.CD013276.pub2,"Background
A considerable challenge for maternity care providers is recognising clinical deterioration early in pregnant women. Professional bodies recommend the use of clinical assessment protocols or evaluation tools, commonly referred to as physiological track‐and‐trigger systems (TTS) or early warning systems (EWS), as a means of helping maternity care providers recognise actual or potential clinical deterioration early. TTS/EWS are clinician‐administered (midwife, obstetrician), bedside physiological assessment protocols, charts or tools designed to record routinely assessed clinical parameters; that is, blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, urine output and mental/neurological alertness. In general, these systems involve the application of scores or alert indicators to the observed physiological parameters based on their prespecified limits of normality. The overall system score or alert limit is then used to assist the maternity care provider identify a need to escalate care. This, in turn, may allow for earlier intervention(s) to alter the course of the emerging critical illness and ultimately reduce or avoid mortality and morbidity sequelae. 
Objectives
To evaluate the clinical‐ and cost‐effectiveness of maternal physiological TTS/EWS on pregnancy, labour and birth, postpartum (up to 42 days) and neonatal outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (28 May 2021), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (7 June 2021), OpenGrey, the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database (7 June 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐RCTs, comparing physiological TTS/EWS with no system or another system. Participants were women who were pregnant or had given birth within the previous 42 days, at high risk and low risk for pregnancy, labour and birth, and postpartum complications. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (VS and MN) independently assessed all identified papers for inclusion and performed risk of bias assessments. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Data extraction was also conducted independently by two review authors (VS and MN) and checked for accuracy. We used the summary odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to present the results for dichotomous data and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI to present the results for continuous data. 
Main results
We included two studies, a parallel RCT involving 700 women and a stepped‐wedge cluster trial involving 536,233 women. Both studies were published in 2019, and both were conducted in low‐resource settings. The interventions were the 'Saving Mothers Score' (SMS) and the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device, and both interventions were compared with standard care. Both studies had low or unclear risk of bias on all seven risk of bias criteria. Evidence certainty, assessed using GRADE, ranged from very low to moderate certainty, mainly due to other bias as well as inconsistency and imprecision. 
For women randomised to TTS/EWS compared to standard care there is probably little to no difference in maternal death (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.11; 1 study, 536,233 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care may reduce total haemorrhage (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.69; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For women randomised to TTS/EWS compared to standard care there may be little to no difference in sepsis (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.80; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence), eclampsia (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.03; 2 studies, 536,933 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and HELLP (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.40; 1 study, 700 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and probably little to no difference in maternal admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (OR 0.78, 95% CI  0.53 to 1.15; 2 studies, 536,933 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care may reduce a woman's length of hospital stay (MD ‐1.21, 95% CI ‐1.78 to ‐0.64; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence) but may result in little to no difference in neonatal death (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.84; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Cost‐effectiveness measures were not measured in either of the two studies.  
Authors' conclusions
Use of TTS/EWS in maternity care may be helpful in reducing some maternal outcomes such as haemorrhage and maternal length of hospital stay, possibly through early identification of clinical deterioration and escalation of care. The evidence suggests that the use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care probably results in little to no difference in maternal death and may result in little to no difference in neonatal death. Both of the included studies were conducted in low‐resource settings where the use of TTS/EWS might potentially confer a different effect to TTS/EWS use in high‐resource settings. Further high‐quality trials in high‐ and middle‐resource settings, as well as in discrete populations of high‐ and low‐risk women, are required. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the provided abstract:

### Early Warning Systems for Pregnant Women

**Rationale**

Pregnant women can get sick quickly. Sometimes, it is hard for doctors and nurses to know when a woman is getting very sick. This can lead to serious health problems or even death for the mother or baby.

Hospitals use tools to help spot these problems early. These tools are like a checklist. They are called ""track-and-trigger systems"" or ""early warning systems."" These systems check things like blood pressure, heart rate, and body heat. They also check how much a woman pees and how alert she is.

When a woman’s numbers are not normal, the system gives a warning. This tells the care team to act fast. Early action can help stop the sickness from getting worse. It can save lives and prevent problems. We want to know if these systems truly help pregnant women.

**Trial Design**

This study looked at other studies. These studies checked if early warning systems help pregnant women. They compared using an early warning system to usual care. Usual care means not using such a system or using a different one.

The women in these studies were pregnant or had just given birth. They were within 42 days after giving birth. Some women had a high chance of problems. Others had a low chance.

Two main studies were found. One study had 700 women. The other study had over 500,000 women. These studies were done in places with fewer health resources. Researchers looked at these studies. They checked the results carefully. They wanted to see how the systems affected mothers and babies. They also looked at hospital stays.

**Results**

We found two main studies. One had 700 women. The other had 536,233 women. Both studies happened in places with fewer healthcare options. They used two different early warning systems. These were called ""Saving Mothers Score"" and ""CRADLE Vital Sign Alert."" They compared these to standard care.

Using an early warning system probably did not change the number of mothers who died. This was compared to standard care.

However, using an early warning system may lower severe bleeding. This can be a big problem for mothers. It may also make hospital stays shorter. Women might go home sooner.

The systems likely did not change the number of baby deaths. They also did not seem to change how many mothers went to the intensive care unit. This is a very serious part of the hospital.

The systems may also have little to no effect on infections like sepsis. They also had little to no effect on conditions like eclampsia or HELLP syndrome.

The studies did not check how much these systems cost.

In short, these systems might help with bleeding. They might also cut down on how long moms stay in the hospital. But they may not change deaths for moms or babies. More studies are needed in other places. We need to check both rich and poor health settings. We also need to check women with different health risks.","Physiological track‐and‐trigger/early warning systems for use in maternity care
What is the question? 
The aim of this review is to find out from randomised controlled trials if using simple monitoring tools are helpful in alerting to clinical problems and in reducing serious illness or death in pregnant women and in their first six weeks after birth. Examples of such tools are track and trigger systems or early warning systems kept by the bedside in maternity care. 
Why is this important? 
Many natural functional changes occur in a woman's body during pregnancy. As a result, a pregnant woman, who may appear healthy and well, can become rapidly very sick. This is called clinical deterioration. If not detected sufficiently early and treated successfully, the pregnant woman can become seriously ill or even die. Examples are serious bleeding, development of convulsions when a woman has high blood pressure, blood clots and serious infection. Simple bedside tools or charts can be used by maternity care providers (midwives and doctors) to record information on a woman's health. The recorded health measures include her blood pressure, pulse rate, breathing rate, body temperature, and other health measures such as urine output and mental alertness. The tools have been introduced so that the measures are observed, recorded and interpreted together, rather than as single measures. The intention is to detect when serious illness is, or might be developing. Medical staff can then step in to prevent serious harm.  
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 28 May 2021 and identified two studies that compared an early warning system with standard care. One study was a single‐centre study involving 700 women and the second was a stepped‐wedge cluster trial (multiple centres grouped into 'clusters') involving 536,233 women. Different clusters of centres introduced the tool over time until all centres were using the tool. Both studies were carried out in low‐resource healthcare settings. The tools were called the 'Saving Mothers Score' (SMS) and the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device. Risk of bias in the two studies was low or unclear.  
We found that the tools probably do not reduce maternal death. Women may have less serious bleeding (or haemorrhage) when an early warning tool is used. This finding was supported by low‐certainty evidence. We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to a potentially life‐threatening body response to infection (sepsis), to blood pressure with swelling, protein in the urine and convulsions (eclampsia), to a serious illness in pregnancy that affects the blood and the way the liver works (HELLP), or being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Use of the tools probably reduces the time a woman stays in hospital (moderate‐certainty evidence). We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to the death of the baby in the first month after birth (neonatal death). This finding was supported by low‐certainty evidence. Neither of the two included studies reported cost outcomes. 
What does this mean? 
Use of early warning tools for women in maternity care in low‐resource settings may reduce serious bleeding and probably reduces the number of days a woman stays in the hospital but may not reduce maternal or infant deaths. More studies are required on the different early warning systems in low‐resource settings. Studies are also needed in middle‐ and high‐resource settings, and in high‐ and low‐risk pregnant women.

Accurate rapid diagnostic tests for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection would be a useful tool to help manage the COVID‐19 pandemic. Testing strategies that use rapid antigen tests to detect current infection have the potential to increase access to testing, speed detection of infection, and inform clinical and public health management decisions to reduce transmission. This is the second update of this review, which was first published in 2020. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of rapid, point‐of‐care antigen tests for diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We consider accuracy separately in symptomatic and asymptomatic population groups. Sources of heterogeneity investigated included setting and indication for testing, assay format, sample site, viral load, age, timing of test, and study design. 
Search methods
We searched the COVID‐19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) on 08 March 2021. We included independent evaluations from national reference laboratories, FIND and the Diagnostics Global Health website. We did not apply language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included studies of people with either suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, known SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or known absence of infection, or those who were being screened for infection. We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated commercially produced, rapid antigen tests. We included evaluations of single applications of a test (one test result reported per person) and evaluations of serial testing (repeated antigen testing over time). Reference standards for presence or absence of infection were any laboratory‐based molecular test (primarily reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR)) or pre‐pandemic respiratory sample. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard screening procedures with three people. Two people independently carried out quality assessment (using the QUADAS‐2 tool) and extracted study results. Other study characteristics were extracted by one review author and checked by a second. We present sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each test, and pooled data using the bivariate model. We investigated heterogeneity by including indicator variables in the random‐effects logistic regression models. We tabulated results by test manufacturer and compliance with manufacturer instructions for use and according to symptom status. 
Main results
We included 155 study cohorts (described in 166 study reports, with 24 as preprints). The main results relate to 152 evaluations of single test applications including 100,462 unique samples (16,822 with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2). Studies were mainly conducted in Europe (101/152, 66%), and evaluated 49 different commercial antigen assays. Only 23 studies compared two or more brands of test. 
Risk of bias was high because of participant selection (40, 26%); interpretation of the index test (6, 4%); weaknesses in the reference standard for absence of infection (119, 78%); and participant flow and timing 41 (27%). Characteristics of participants (45, 30%) and index test delivery (47, 31%) differed from the way in which and in whom the test was intended to be used. Nearly all studies (91%) used a single RT‐PCR result to define presence or absence of infection. 
The 152 studies of single test applications reported 228 evaluations of antigen tests. Estimates of sensitivity varied considerably between studies, with consistently high specificities. Average sensitivity was higher in symptomatic (73.0%, 95% CI 69.3% to 76.4%; 109 evaluations; 50,574 samples, 11,662 cases) compared to asymptomatic participants (54.7%, 95% CI 47.7% to 61.6%; 50 evaluations; 40,956 samples, 2641 cases). Average sensitivity was higher in the first week after symptom onset (80.9%, 95% CI 76.9% to 84.4%; 30 evaluations, 2408 cases) than in the second week of symptoms (53.8%, 95% CI 48.0% to 59.6%; 40 evaluations, 1119 cases). For those who were asymptomatic at the time of testing, sensitivity was higher when an epidemiological exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2 was suspected (64.3%, 95% CI 54.6% to 73.0%; 16 evaluations; 7677 samples, 703 cases) compared to where COVID‐19 testing was reported to be widely available to anyone on presentation for testing (49.6%, 95% CI 42.1% to 57.1%; 26 evaluations; 31,904 samples, 1758 cases). Average specificity was similarly high for symptomatic (99.1%) or asymptomatic (99.7%) participants. 
We observed a steady decline in summary sensitivities as measures of sample viral load decreased. 
Sensitivity varied between brands. When tests were used according to manufacturer instructions, average sensitivities by brand ranged from 34.3% to 91.3% in symptomatic participants (20 assays with eligible data) and from 28.6% to 77.8% for asymptomatic participants (12 assays). For symptomatic participants, summary sensitivities for seven assays were 80% or more (meeting acceptable criteria set by the World Health Organization (WHO)). The WHO acceptable performance criterion of 97% specificity was met by 17 of 20 assays when tests were used according to manufacturer instructions, 12 of which demonstrated specificities above 99%. For asymptomatic participants the sensitivities of only two assays approached but did not meet WHO acceptable performance standards in one study each; specificities for asymptomatic participants were in a similar range to those observed for symptomatic people. 
At 5% prevalence using summary data in symptomatic people during the first week after symptom onset, the positive predictive value (PPV) of 89% means that 1 in 10 positive results will be a false positive, and around 1 in 5 cases will be missed. At 0.5% prevalence using summary data for asymptomatic people, where testing was widely available and where epidemiological exposure to COVID‐19 was suspected, resulting PPVs would be 38% to 52%, meaning that between 2 in 5 and 1 in 2 positive results will be false positives, and between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 cases will be missed. 
Authors' conclusions
Antigen tests vary in sensitivity. In people with signs and symptoms of COVID‐19, sensitivities are highest in the first week of illness when viral loads are higher. Assays that meet appropriate performance standards, such as those set by WHO, could replace laboratory‐based RT‐PCR when immediate decisions about patient care must be made, or where RT‐PCR cannot be delivered in a timely manner. However, they are more suitable for use as triage to RT‐PCR testing. The variable sensitivity of antigen tests means that people who test negative may still be infected. Many commercially available rapid antigen tests have not been evaluated in independent validation studies. 
Evidence for testing in asymptomatic cohorts has increased, however sensitivity is lower and there is a paucity of evidence for testing in different settings. Questions remain about the use of antigen test‐based repeat testing strategies. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of screening programmes at reducing transmission of infection, whether mass screening or targeted approaches including schools, healthcare setting and traveller screening.

How Well Do Quick COVID-19 Tests Work?

## Rationale

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a lot of illness. It spread quickly and made many people sick. We needed fast ways to find out who had the virus. This helps stop the spread.

Quick tests that check for the virus can help. They can tell us if someone has the virus right now. This can make testing easier to get. It can also help us find infections fast. This helps doctors and health officials. It helps them make choices to slow down the virus.

This study looks at these quick tests. It wants to see how well they work. It aims to see if they can treat the sickness. This is an update of a study done before.

## Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This study is a review. It looks at many other studies. These studies tested people for COVID-19. They used quick tests that look for parts of the virus. These are called antigen tests.

The study included people with different health conditions. Some people thought they had COVID-19. Some knew they had COVID-19. Some knew they did not have it. Others were checked for the virus. There was no age limit for people in the studies.

The quick tests used were made by companies. Each person in the studies had one test. Or, some people had tests many times. The results of these quick tests were compared. They were compared to lab tests. Lab tests like RT-PCR are very exact.

The study looked at many things. It checked where the tests were done. It checked how the tests were used. It also looked at how much virus was in a person. It saw if age changed the results. It checked how long people had symptoms. It also looked at how the studies were set up.

## Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

We looked at 155 groups of studies. They tested over 100,000 samples. About 1 in 6 samples had COVID-19. Most studies were in Europe. They looked at 49 different types of quick tests. Only a few studies compared more than one test type.

The quick tests found the virus better in people with symptoms. For people with symptoms, tests found the virus about 7 out of 10 times. For people without symptoms, tests found the virus about 5 out of 10 times.

The tests worked best early in sickness. In the first week of symptoms, tests found the virus more than 8 out of 10 times. In the second week of symptoms, tests found the virus about 5 out of 10 times.

The tests were very good at finding people who did not have the virus. This was true for people with or without symptoms. About 99 out of 100 times, the tests correctly said someone did not have COVID-19.

Some quick test brands worked better than others. Some found the virus 9 out of 10 times in people with symptoms. Others found it only 3 out of 10 times. The World Health Organization (WHO) has rules for good tests. Seven quick tests met these rules for people with symptoms. Most quick tests met WHO rules for correctly saying someone did not have the virus.

For people with symptoms in the first week, a positive test means there is a small chance it's wrong. About 1 in 10 positive results might be false. Also, about 1 in 5 cases could be missed.

For people without symptoms, the results are less clear. If 100 people without symptoms are tested, and 2 to 5 of them have COVID-19, then 2 to 5 out of 10 positive tests might be wrong. Also, 1 to 3 out of 10 actual cases could be missed.

**What does this mean for patients?**

These quick tests are useful. They work best for people with COVID-19 symptoms. They are most helpful in the first week of feeling sick. This is when there is more virus in the body.

Good quick tests can help doctors make fast choices. They can be used when waiting for a lab test takes too long. However, if a quick test is negative, you might still have the virus.

Many quick tests sold today have not been checked well. We need more studies. We need to know how well these tests work. This includes testing in schools or for travelers.","How accurate are rapid antigen tests for diagnosing COVID‐19?
Key messages 
• Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID‐19, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected. 
• Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID‐19. 
• The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests. 
What are rapid point‐of‐care antigen tests for COVID‐19? 
Rapid point‐of‐care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID‐19 infection in people with or without COVID‐19 symptoms. They: 
• are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point‐of‐care) or in non‐healthcare settings such as in the home; 
• are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps; 
• are less expensive than standard laboratory tests;
• do not require a specialist operator or setting; and
• provide results ‘while you wait’.
For this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as ‘lateral flow tests’. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over‐the‐counter pregnancy tests. 
Why is this question important? 
People with suspected COVID‐19 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self‐isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID‐19 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT‐PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result. 
In many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID‐19 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID‐19, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point‐of‐care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID‐19 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID‐19 using RT‐PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms. 
What did we find? 
We included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID‐19 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe. 
Main results 
In people with confirmed COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID‐19 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID‐19 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). 
In people who did not have COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms. 
Different brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as ‘acceptable’ for confirming and ruling out COVID‐19 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID‐19. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms. 
Using summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID‐19: 
• 45 people would test positive for COVID‐19. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID‐19 (false positive result). 
• 955 people would test negative for COVID‐19. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID‐19 (false negative result). 
In people with no symptoms of COVID‐19 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID‐19 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID‐19: 
• 62 people would test positive for COVID‐19. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID‐19 (false positive result). 
• 9938 people would test negative for COVID‐19. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID‐19 (false negative result). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
In general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers’ instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID‐19 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT‐PCR result as evidence of no COVID‐19 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms. 
What does this mean? 
In people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT‐PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT‐PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT‐PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self‐isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people ‐ individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected. 
Rapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID‐19. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non‐healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers’ instructions.

At least 1 in 200 people have suffered a severe allergic reaction to a sting from a bee, wasp, or ant, and insect stings are the second most common cause of fatal allergic reactions in some countries. Treatment with insect venom, usually given by a course of injections (called venom immunotherapy), is thought to reduce the risk of allergic reactions to an insect sting. In this review, we evaluated the effectiveness of venom immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings. 
From analysis of 7 studies, which included 392 participants, we found that this treatment reduces the chance of having a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by 90%, a consistent finding between studies. Venom immunotherapy also significantly improves the quality of life of people who have had a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by reducing anxiety and possible limitation of activities caused by fear of insects. However, almost 1 in 10 people treated with venom immunotherapy during the trials had an allergic reaction to their treatment. We were unable to find out whether venom immunotherapy prevents fatal allergic reactions to insect stings, because these are so rare. The decision whether to start venom immunotherapy depends on an accurate diagnosis, followed by careful assessment of a person's risk of having another allergic reaction to a sting, the degree to which the insect sting allergy affects their quality of life, and the risk of an allergic reaction to their treatment.

**1. Plain Title: Shots to Stop Bad Bug Sting Reactions**

**2. Rationale**

Many people get stung by bugs like bees or wasps. For some, this sting is more than just painful. It can cause a very bad allergic reaction. This type of reaction can be scary. It can even cause death in some cases. About 1 in 200 people have a severe bug sting allergy. This is a big problem for many people.

Doctors use a special treatment to help. It is called venom immunotherapy. This treatment uses small amounts of bug venom. It helps train the body not to overreact to a sting. We wanted to see how well this treatment works. We also wanted to see if it makes life better for people.

**3. Trial Design**

We looked at many studies. These studies tested the bug venom shots. We combined the results from 7 studies. These studies included 392 people in total. The people in these studies had very bad allergic reactions to bug stings. We wanted to see if the shots stopped these reactions. We looked at how often people had a bad reaction after getting the shots. We also looked at how the shots changed their daily lives.

**4. Results**

The bug venom shots worked very well. They cut the chance of a serious allergic reaction by 90%. This means for every 10 people who would have had a bad reaction, only 1 still did. This was true across all the studies.

The shots also made life much better for people. People with bug sting allergies often worry a lot. They might avoid outdoor activities. The shots helped them feel less worried. This made them feel much better. Their quality of life improved a lot.

However, there was a small risk with the treatment. About 1 in 10 people had an allergic reaction to the shots themselves. These reactions were usually mild. It is very rare for people to die from bug stings. So, we could not tell if the shots stopped deaths.

Deciding to get the shots is a personal choice. Your doctor will check if you truly have a bad allergy. They will weigh the good and bad points. They will look at how much your allergy affects your life. They will also look at the small risk of a reaction to the shots.","Immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings

What is the issue? 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is very common among patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), it is associated with a high death rated and characterised by the rapid loss of the kidney function. Patients with AKI show increased levels of serum uraemic toxins (creatinine and urea), serum potassium and metabolic acids, accumulation of water and in the most cases a reduction in urine output. In this population these chemicals and fluid overload are related to increased rates of death. Theoretically, effective removal of toxins and excess water from the bloodstream might improve patient outcomes (such as mortality rate and recovery of kidney function). 
Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a blood purification technique that enables removal of excess water and toxins. CRRT involves blood being diverted from the patient via a catheter (a hollow, flexible tube placed into a vein) through a filtering system which continuously and steadily removes excess water and toxins; purified blood is then returned to the patient via the catheter. Higher intensity CRRT improves the removal of toxins and excess water. The aim of this review was to investigate the effect of different intensities of CRRT (intensive or less intensive) on death, recovery of kidney function, and adverse events in people with AKI who are critically ill. 
What did we do? 
We searched the literature up until February 2016 and identified six studies enrolling 3185 patients with AKI that were evaluated in this review. 
What did we find? 
Six randomised studies enrolling 3185 participants were included in our review. Compared to less intensive CRRT, intensive CRRT did not reduce the risk of death, improve the recovery of kidney function, or reduce the risk of adverse events (such as bleeding) in patients with AKI. Intensive CRRT was associated with an increased risk of low blood phosphate levels. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the provided abstract:

### Plain Title
Intensive Kidney Dialysis for Sick Patients with Kidney Injury

### Rationale
Many very sick patients in the hospital have sudden kidney damage. This is called acute kidney injury, or AKI. When kidneys are hurt, they stop cleaning the blood. Bad chemicals build up in the body. Extra water can also stay in the body. These problems make sick patients even sicker. They can even cause death.

Doctors use a treatment called continuous renal replacement therapy, or CRRT. This treatment helps clean the blood. It acts like an artificial kidney. A thin tube goes into a patient's vein. Blood flows out of the body through this tube. It goes through a filter that takes out bad chemicals and extra water. Clean blood then flows back into the patient's body.

Some doctors thought that doing CRRT more strongly might help. This is called ""intensive"" CRRT. They hoped it would remove more bad stuff. They thought this might help patients live longer. They also hoped it would help their kidneys get better. This study looked at if more intensive CRRT was better than less intensive CRRT for these patients.

### Trial Design
This study asked: ""How does intensive CRRT compare to less intensive CRRT?""

Researchers looked at many past studies. They searched for studies about CRRT for AKI patients. They looked for studies published up to February 2016. They found six studies that fit. These studies included a total of 3,185 patients. All these patients had AKI and were very sick. The studies compared two groups of patients. One group got intensive CRRT. The other group got less intensive CRRT.

The researchers wanted to see a few things. They looked at how many patients died. They also checked if patients' kidneys got better. Finally, they looked for any bad side effects. Patients stayed in the study as long as they needed CRRT.

### Results
The researchers found six studies to review. These studies had 3,185 patients in total.

The main results were clear. Intensive CRRT did not lower the risk of death. It also did not help kidneys recover more often. Intensive CRRT did not even lower the risk of bad side effects. In fact, intensive CRRT caused one bad side effect more often. It made patients' blood phosphate levels too low. Low phosphate can cause other health problems.

This study shows that giving more intensive CRRT does not help very sick patients with AKI. It does not make them live longer. It does not make their kidneys better. And it can cause problems like low phosphate. Doctors now know that less intensive CRRT is just as good, and safer for these patients.","Intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury

10.1002-14651858.CD013333.pub2,"Background
Demodex blepharitis is a chronic condition commonly associated with recalcitrant dry eye symptoms though many people with Demodex mites are asymptomatic. The primary cause of this condition in humans is two types of Demodex mites: Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis. There are varying reports of the prevalence of Demodex blepharitis among adults, and it affects both men and women equally. While Demodex mites are commonly treated with tea tree oil, the effectiveness of tea tree oil for treating Demodex blepharitis is not well documented. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of tea tree oil on ocular Demodex infestation in people with Demodex blepharitis. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2019, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; LILACS; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the databases on 18 June 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared treatment with tea tree oil (or its components) versus another treatment or no treatment for people with Demodex blepharitis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts and then full text of records to determine their eligibility. The review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using Covidence. A third review author resolved any conflicts at all stages. 
Main results
We included six RCTs (1124 eyes of 562 participants; 17 to 281 participants per study) from the US, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey. The RCTs compared some formulation of tea tree oil to another treatment or no treatment. Included participants were both men and women, ranging from 39 to 55 years of age. All RCTs were assessed at unclear or high risk of bias in one or more domains. We also identified two RCTs that are ongoing or awaiting publications. 
Data from three RCTs that reported a short‐term mean change in the number of Demodex mites per eight eyelashes contributed to a meta‐analysis. We are uncertain about the mean reduction for the groups that received the tea tree oil intervention (mean difference [MD] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24 to 1.16) at four to six weeks as compared to other interventions. Only one RCT reported data for long‐term changes, which found that the group that received intense pulse light as the treatment had complete eradication of Demodex mites at three months. We graded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as very low. 
Three RCTs reported no evidence of a difference for participant reported symptoms measured on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) between the tea tree oil group and the group receiving other forms of intervention. Mean differences in these studies ranged from ‐10.54 (95% CI – 24.19, 3.11) to 3.40 (95% CI ‐0.70 7.50). We did not conduct a meta‐analysis for this outcome given substantial statistical heterogeneity and graded the certainty of the evidence as low. 
One RCT provided information concerning visual acuity but did not provide sufficient data for between‐group comparisons. The authors noted that mean habitual LogMAR visual acuity for all study participants improved post‐treatment (mean LogMAR 1.16, standard deviation 0.26 at 4 weeks). We graded the certainty of evidence for this outcome as low. No RCTs provided data on mean change in number of cylindrical dandruff or the proportion of participants experiencing conjunctival injection or experiencing meibomian gland dysfunction. 
Three RCTs provided information on adverse events. One reported no adverse events. The other two described a total of six participants randomized to treatment with tea tree oil who experienced ocular irritation or discomfort that resolved with re‐educating the patient on application techniques and continuing use of the tea tree oil. We graded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as very low. 
Authors' conclusions
The current review suggests that there is uncertainty related to the effectiveness of 5% to 50% tea tree oil for the short‐term treatment of Demodex blepharitis; however, if used, lower concentrations may be preferable in the eye care arena to avoid induced ocular irritation. Future studies should be better controlled, assess outcomes at long term (e.g. 10 to 12 weeks or beyond), account for patient compliance, and study the effects of different tea tree oil concentrations. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the provided abstract:

**1. Plain Title: Does Tea Tree Oil Help With Eyelid Mites?**

**2. Rationale**

Your eyelids can have tiny mites living on them. These mites cause a problem called Demodex blepharitis. This problem can make your eyes feel dry. It can also make your eyes feel bad. Many people have these mites. But not everyone has symptoms.

Doctors often use tea tree oil to treat these mites. Yet, we do not know for sure if it works well. We want to see how good tea tree oil is at getting rid of these mites. We also want to see if it helps with eye problems.

**3. Trial Design**

We looked at many studies. These studies checked if tea tree oil works. They looked at studies that compared tea tree oil to other treatments. Some studies looked at no treatment at all.

We chose studies where people were put into groups by chance. This helps make sure the study is fair. The people in these studies were men and women. They were between 39 and 55 years old. They all had Demodex blepharitis. We looked at how long people were in these studies. This helped us see short-term and long-term effects.

**4. Results**

We found six studies to include in our review. These studies had a total of 562 people. These people were from different countries. The studies used different forms of tea tree oil.

For getting rid of mites, we are not sure if tea tree oil works in the short term. Some studies showed a small drop in mites. But we need more clear proof. One study showed a special light treatment got rid of all mites. This was after three months.

We also looked at how people felt. We checked if their eye symptoms got better. Three studies showed no clear change. People felt the same whether they used tea tree oil or other treatments.

One study looked at how well people could see. Their vision got a little better after treatment. This was true for all people in the study. But we cannot say if tea tree oil made this happen.

Some people had side effects. Two studies said that six people felt eye irritation. This happened when they used tea tree oil. But this feeling went away. They learned how to use the oil better.

Our review suggests we are not sure about tea tree oil. It might not work well for getting rid of mites. If you use it, a weak amount might be better. This could help stop eye irritation. More studies are needed to learn more. These studies should be done better. They need to watch people for a longer time. They also need to check how much tea tree oil is best.","Tea tree oil for Demodex blepharitis
What was the aim of this review?To examine the effects of tea tree oil, an essential oil derived from an Australian tree, which can be applied in many different forms (eyelid wipes, eyelid shampoo, oil massages, etc.) on Demodex blepharitis. Demodex blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid caused by Demodex mites (frequently referred to as eyelash mites). 
Key messagesWe are uncertain if tea tree oil is better compared to other treatments. Other factors such as dosage, ocular hygiene, and patient compliance likely affect treatment outcomes; however, more and better‐designed studies are needed to confirm these findings. 
What did we study in this review?Blepharitis causes symptoms such as eye itching, burning, dryness, irritation, watering, or blurry vision, which lead people to seek medical attention. This study aimed to understand the ability of tea tree oil to improve symptoms or to treat Demodex blepharitis (or both) in comparison to no treatment or other forms of treatment containing no tea tree oil. 
What were the main results of this review?This review included six studies with 562 participants (1124 eyes). They were men and women between the ages of 39 and 55 years. The included studies were conducted in the US, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey. Trial designs greatly varied, which limited analyses and the confidence in the results. Most studies included in this report had a high degree of bias. It is uncertain if tea tree oil (concentration ranging from 5% to 50%) is helpful for reducing the number of Demodex mites in people with Demodex blepharitis in short‐term cases. While not fully addressed in the reviewed literature, people should be educated on how to properly apply tea tree oil products because patient compliance and method of application likely affects efficacy. None of the studies in this review reported any side effects directly related to the treatment; however, one study did report irritation around the eyes on using tea tree oil, which was resolved on re‐educating the person on the application technique.

### Plain Title
Stopping Bleeding During Surgery for People with Blood Clotting Problems

### Rationale
Some people have a health issue where their blood does not clot well. This is called a congenital bleeding disorder. It means they bleed too much. This can be very bad during and after a surgery.

To help them, doctors give medicine that helps blood clot. This medicine can be special blood parts or other drugs. But we do not know the best way to give these medicines. We do not know how much to give or for how long.

This study looked for answers. It wanted to find out the best way to give these medicines. This would help people with bleeding problems have safer surgeries.

### Trial Design
This study looked at other studies. It searched for ""randomized controlled trials."" These are studies where people get a medicine or a fake medicine by chance.

The study looked at how well the treatments worked. It also checked if the treatments were safe. It looked at things like how much blood was lost. It also checked if more surgery was needed.

We found four studies to look at. Two studies looked at 59 people with a certain type of bleeding problem. They had a tooth pulled. They got a drug to help clots last longer, or a fake drug. They also got their usual care.

The other two studies looked at 53 people with a different type of bleeding problem. These people had a special issue where their body fought the usual medicine. They got a different clotting medicine during and after surgery. One study looked at giving a lot versus a little medicine. The other study looked at giving one big dose versus a steady flow.

### Results
The studies we found gave some small clues. They helped us learn about two specific cases for people with bleeding problems during surgery.

But, in general, there is not enough proof from studies. We still do not know the best treatments for all types of bleeding problems. We also do not know the best treatments for all types of surgeries.

More studies would be good. They would help us learn more. But these studies are hard to do. Right now, they are not seen as the most important thing to study.

Doctors do surgeries safely for these people every day. They use their own experience. They also use what they learn from other studies that are not as strict.","Preventing bleeding in people with congenital bleeding disorders during and after surgery

10.1002-14651858.CD013444.pub2,"Background
Spasticity and chronic neuropathic pain are common and serious symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). These symptoms increase with disease progression and lead to worsening disability, impaired activities of daily living and quality of life. Anti‐spasticity medications and analgesics are of limited benefit or poorly tolerated. Cannabinoids may reduce spasticity and pain in people with MS. Demand for symptomatic treatment with cannabinoids is high. A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and harms of these drugs is required. 
Objectives
To assess benefit and harms of cannabinoids, including synthetic, or herbal and plant‐derived cannabinoids, for reducing symptoms for adults with MS. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases from inception to December 2021: MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library), CINAHL (EBSCO host), LILACS, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the US National Institutes of Health clinical trial register, the European Union Clinical Trials Register, the International Association for Cannabinoid Medicines databank. We hand searched citation lists of included studies and relevant reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised parallel or cross‐over trials (RCTs) evaluating any cannabinoid (including herbal Cannabis, Cannabis flowers, plant‐based cannabinoids, or synthetic cannabinoids) irrespective of dose, route, frequency, or duration of use for adults with MS. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane Risk of bias 2 tool for parallel RCTs and crossover trials. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: reduction of 30% in the spasticity Numeric Rating Scale, pain relief of 50% or greater in the Numeric Rating Scale‐Pain Intensity, much or very much improvement in the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Health‐Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs) (tolerability), serious adverse events (SAEs), nervous system disorders, psychiatric disorders, physical dependence. 
Main results
We included 25 RCTs with 3763 participants of whom 2290 received cannabinoids. Age ranged from 18 to 60 years, and between 50% and 88% participants across the studies were female.  The included studies were 3 to 48 weeks long and compared nabiximols, an oromucosal spray with a plant derived equal (1:1) combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) (13 studies), synthetic cannabinoids mimicking THC (7 studies), an oral THC extract of Cannabis sativa (2 studies), inhaled herbal Cannabis (1 study) against placebo. One study compared dronabinol, THC extract of Cannabis sativa and placebo, one compared inhaled herbal Cannabis, dronabinol and placebo. We identified eight ongoing studies. 
Critical outcomes 
• Spasticity: nabiximols probably increases the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of spasticity compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 2.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 4.04; 5 RCTs, 1143 participants; I2 = 67%; moderate‐certainty evidence). The absolute effect was 216 more people (95% CI 99 more to 332 more) per 1000 reporting benefit with cannabinoids than with placebo. 
• Chronic neuropathic pain: we found only one small trial that measured the number of participants reporting substantial pain relief with a synthetic cannabinoid compared with placebo (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 16.17; 1 study, 48 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether cannabinoids reduce chronic neuropathic pain intensity. 
• Treatment discontinuation due to AEs: cannabinoids may increase slightly the number of participants who discontinue treatment compared with placebo (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.84; 21 studies, 3110 participants; I² = 17%; low‐certainty evidence); the absolute effect is 39 more people (95% CI 15 more to 76 more) per 1000 people. 
Important outcomes 
• PGIC: cannabinoids probably increase the number of people who report 'very much' or 'much' improvement in health status compared with placebo (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.36; 8 studies, 1215 participants; I² = 0%; moderate‐certainty evidence). The absolute effect is 113 more people (95% CI 57 more to 175 more) per 1000 people reporting improvement. 
• HRQoL: cannabinoids may have little to no effect on HRQoL (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.02; 8 studies, 1942 participants; I2 = 0%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• SAEs: cannabinoids may result in little to no difference in the number of participants who have SAEs compared with placebo (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.99; 20 studies, 3124 participants; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• AEs of the nervous system: cannabinoids may increase nervous system disorders compared with placebo (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.44; 7 studies, 1154 participants; I² = 63%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• Psychiatric disorders: cannabinoids may increase psychiatric disorders compared with placebo (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.88; 6 studies, 1122 participants; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• Drug tolerance: the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of cannabinoids on drug tolerance (OR 3.07, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.95; 2 studies, 458 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Compared with placebo, nabiximols probably reduces the severity of spasticity in the short‐term in people with MS. We are uncertain about the effect on chronic neurological pain and health‐related quality of life. Cannabinoids may increase slightly treatment discontinuation due to AEs, nervous system and psychiatric disorders compared with placebo. We are uncertain about the effect on drug tolerance. The overall certainty of evidence is limited by short‐term duration of the included studies. 
","## Plain Title: Can Cannabis Help MS Symptoms?

### Rationale

Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a disease. It affects the brain and spinal cord. People with MS often feel stiff muscles, called spasticity. They also have long-lasting nerve pain. These problems make it hard to do daily tasks. They also make life less enjoyable.

Current medicines for these issues do not always work well. Some have bad side effects. Cannabis-based drugs might help. Many people with MS want to try them. This study looked at how well these drugs work. It also checked for any harm they might cause.

### Trial Design

This study looked at 25 earlier studies. These studies included 3763 adults with MS. They were between 18 and 60 years old. Most people in the studies were women. Each study lasted from 3 to 48 weeks.

The studies compared cannabis drugs to a fake drug, called a placebo. Cannabis drugs used included a mouth spray, synthetic cannabis, and cannabis plant extracts. One study also looked at smoked cannabis. Researchers gathered facts from these studies. They checked how much spasticity and pain changed. They also looked at overall health and side effects.

### Results

The study found good news for spasticity. A cannabis mouth spray likely helps people feel less stiff. For every 1000 people, 216 more felt better with the spray. This was compared to those who took the fake drug.

For nerve pain, the results were not clear. Only one small study looked at this. So, we cannot say if cannabis helps nerve pain much.

Some people stopped taking cannabis drugs. This was due to side effects. For every 1000 people, 39 more stopped due to bad effects. Cannabis drugs may cause more problems with the brain or nerves. They might also cause more mental health issues.

Overall, people felt their health was much better with cannabis drugs. This was compared to the fake drug. For every 1000 people, 113 more felt better. Cannabis drugs did not seem to change general quality of life much. They also did not cause more serious problems. The effect on how well people could handle the drug was not clear.

In short, a cannabis spray can likely ease muscle stiffness in MS. It may also make people feel better overall. But it might cause some side effects like nerve or mental health issues. More studies are needed to learn about pain relief and long-term effects.","Cannabis and cannabinoids for people with multiple sclerosis
Key messages• Treatment with nabiximols likely results in improvement of spasticity and may not increase serious harmful effects compared with placebo 
• Compared with placebo, cannabinoids (nabiximols, Cannabis extract, synthetic cannabinoids) likely improve well‐being when measured with patient‐reported outcomes  
• Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefit of these medicines for treating chronic neuropathic pain is unclear. 
What is the issue? 
Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience spasticity that causes also pain and impacts on the ability to carry out daily activities. Spasticity is a form of increased muscle tone. Cannabis‐based medicines refer to the use of Cannabis, or its ingredients called cannabinoids, as medical therapies to alleviate spasticity, chronic pain and other symptoms in MS. An international survey found that MS was one of the five medical conditions for which Cannabis was most often used. Another survey conducted in the UK found that more than one in five people with MS reported they had used Cannabis to try to manage their symptoms.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if cannabinoids were better than placebo in adults with MS to improve: 
• spasticity;
• chronic neuropathic pain;
• well‐being,
We also wanted to find out if cannabinoids were associated with:
• treatment discontinuation due to unwanted effects; 
• serious harmful effects;
• nervous system disorders or psychiatric disorders;
• drug tolerance defined as a condition that occurs when the body gets used to a medicine so that more medicine is needed. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that compared cannabinoids against placebo in adult people with MS. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and certainty of evidence. 
What did we find?  
We found 25 studies that involved 3763 people with MS, 2290 of whom received cannabinoids. Fifteen studies were very short term or short‐term studies (two to 12 weeks), seven were intermediate term (12 to 26 weeks), and two were long term (50 and 156 weeks). One study reported results at three days only. The biggest study was conducted in 657 people and the smallest study involved 14 people. Most studies were done in European countries. Thirteen studies evaluated an oral spray (nabiximols) containing two compounds derived from the Cannabis plant. The other studies compared different cannabinoids with placebo. Pharmaceutical companies funded 15 of the studies. 
Main results 
Compared with placebo, cannabinoids: 
• probably increase the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of spasticity for up to 14 weeks (evidence from five studies in 1143 people); 
• may increase the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of chronic neuropathic pain, but the evidence is very uncertain (evidence from one study in 48 people). 
We are uncertain whether cannabinoids reduce chronic neuropathic pain intensity:
• probably increase the number of people who perceive their well‐being as 'very much' or 'much' improved (evidence from eight studies in 1215 people); 
• may increase slightly the number of people who discontinue treatment due to unwanted effects (evidence from 21 studies in 3110 people); 
• may result in little to no difference in the number of people who have serious harmful effects (evidence from 20 studies in 3124 people); 
• may increase nervous system disorders (evidence from seven studies in 1154 people) or psychiatric disorders (evidence from six studies in 1122 people); 
• may have little to no effect on the number of people who have drug tolerance, but the evidence is very uncertain (two studies in 458 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
There is no high‐quality evidence. 
We are moderately confident that cannabinoids work better versus no cannabinoids to improve severity of spasticity and well‐being in adults with MS. We have little confidence in our results for the effect on chronic neuropathic pain because the available evidence is limited. 
There is limited evidence to determine the effects of cannabinoids on serious harmful effects, nervous system or psychiatric disorders, and drug tolerance. 
How up to date is the evidence?The evidence is up‐to‐date to December 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013259.pub2,"Background
Surgery is the cornerstone in curative treatment of colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, surgery itself can adversely affect patient health. 'Enhanced Recovery After Surgery' programmes, which include multimodal interventions, have improved patient outcomes substantially. However, these are mainly applied peri‐ and postoperatively. Multimodal prehabilitation includes multiple preoperative interventions to prepare patients for surgery with the aim of increasing resilience, thereby improving postoperative outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of multimodal prehabilitation programmes on functional capacity, postoperative complications, and quality of life in adult patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO in January 2021. We also searched trial registries up to March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adult patients with non‐metastatic colorectal cancer, scheduled for surgery, comparing multimodal prehabilitation programmes (defined as comprising at least two preoperative interventions) with no prehabilitation. We focused on the following outcomes: functional capacity (i.e. 6‐minute walk test, VO2peak, handgrip strength), postoperative outcomes (i.e. complications, mortality, length of hospital stay, emergency department visits, re‐admissions), health‐related quality of life, compliance, safety of prehabilitation, and return to normal activities. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Any disagreements were solved with discussion and consensus. We pooled data to perform meta‐analyses, where possible. 
Main results
We included three RCTs that enrolled 250 participants with non‐metastatic colorectal cancer, scheduled for elective (mainly laparoscopic) surgery. Included trials were conducted in tertiary care centres and recruited patients during periods ranging from 17 months to 45 months. A total of 130 participants enrolled in a preoperative four‐week trimodal prehabilitation programme consisting of exercise, nutritional intervention, and anxiety reduction techniques. Outcomes of these participants were compared to those of 120 participants who started an identical but postoperative programme. 
Postoperatively, prehabilitation may improve functional capacity, determined with the 6‐minute walk test at four and eight weeks (mean difference (MD) 26.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐13.81 to 65.85; 2 studies; n = 131; and MD 26.58, 95% CI ‐8.88 to 62.04; 2 studies; n = 140); however, the certainty of evidence is low and very low, respectively, due to serious risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. After prehabilitation, the functional capacity before surgery improved, with a clinically relevant mean difference of 24.91 metres (95% CI 11.24 to 38.57; 3 studies; n = 225). The certainty of evidence was moderate due to downgrading for serious risk of bias. Prehabilitation may also result in fewer complications (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.29; 3 studies; n = 250) and fewer emergency department visits (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.32; 3 studies; n = 250). The certainty of evidence was low due to downgrading for serious risk of bias and imprecision. On the other hand, prehabilitation may also result in a higher re‐admission rate (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.65; 3 studies; n = 250). The certainty of evidence was again low due to downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision. The effect on VO2peak, handgrip strength, length of hospital stay, mortality rate, health‐related quality of life, return to normal activities, safety of the programme, and compliance rate could not be analysed quantitatively due to missing or insufficient data. The included studies did not report a difference between groups for health‐related quality of life and length of hospital stay. Data on remaining outcomes were not reported or were reported inadequately in the included studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Prehabilitation may result in an improved functional capacity, determined with the 6‐minute walk test both preoperatively and postoperatively. Complication rates and the number of emergency department visits postoperatively may also diminish due to a prehabilitation programme, while the number of re‐admissions may be higher in the prehabilitation group. The certainty of evidence ranges from moderate to very low, due to downgrading for serious risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. In addition, only three heterogeneous studies were included in this review. Therefore, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Numerous relevant RCTs are ongoing and will be included in a future update of this review. 
","## A New Way to Prepare for Colon Cancer Surgery

### Rationale

Surgery is the main way to treat colon cancer. But surgery can make patients sick. Programs that help patients recover faster after surgery have worked well. These programs usually start after surgery.

This study looked at what happens if we help patients *before* surgery. This is called ""prehabilitation."" It means getting ready for surgery with special steps. We want to see if this makes patients stronger. It might help them get better faster after surgery.

### Trial Design

This study asked: ""How does getting ready before surgery affect patients?"" We looked at past studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means some patients got the special plan, and some did not.

The studies looked at adults with colon cancer. Their cancer had not spread. They were all having surgery. The special plan had at least two things to help them before surgery. For example, it might include exercise, good food, and ways to ease worry.

We wanted to see if this plan helped patients:

*   Walk better (how far they could walk in 6 minutes).
*   Have fewer problems after surgery.
*   Feel better about their health.
*   Get back to their normal life faster.

We also looked at how safe the plan was. And if people stuck with it.

### Results

We found three studies with 250 patients. All patients had colon cancer surgery. Most surgeries were done with small cuts.

One group of 130 patients did a special plan for four weeks before surgery. This plan had exercise, good food, and ways to ease worry. Another group of 120 patients did the same plan, but after surgery.

Here is what we found:

*   **Walking ability:** Patients who did the pre-surgery plan could walk better *before* surgery. They walked about 25 steps further. This is a good change. They also walked better at four and eight weeks after surgery. But we are not very sure about these results.
*   **Problems after surgery:** The pre-surgery plan might lead to fewer problems. And fewer trips to the emergency room. But we are not very sure about this either.
*   **Coming back to the hospital:** Patients who did the pre-surgery plan might have come back to the hospital more often. But again, we are not very sure about this.

We could not tell much about other things. This includes how much oxygen the body uses, hand strength, how long patients stayed in the hospital, or how they felt about their health. The studies did not have enough clear information on these points.

**What we learned:** Getting ready before surgery might make patients stronger. They might walk better before and after surgery. They might also have fewer problems after surgery. But we need more studies to be sure. The studies we looked at were different from each other. So we need to be careful with these results. Many new studies are happening now. We will look at them later.","Preparing a patient with bowel cancer for surgery with multiple interventions
Aim of this review 
The aim of this review is to find out whether multiple interventions introduced in the period prior to surgery for bowel cancer could prepare a patient by increasing the patient's overall fitness, and thus improve outcomes after surgery. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all available randomised controlled trials on this topic. 
Key messages 
Only three studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, information was not available for all outcomes and the overall certainty of evidence was very low to moderate. More and larger studies are needed to gather evidence on this topic. 
What was studied in the review? 
Surgery is often given to cure patients diagnosed with early stage bowel cancer. Surgery has a negative impact on the overall fitness of the patient. The energy level decreases, patients are more dependent in their daily living activities, and quality of life decreases. Furthermore, complications may occur after surgery causing a further decrease of fitness. Preoperative interventions, such as exercise programmes, nutritional advice and supplements, as well as mental support, may increase the fitness of the patient, prior to surgery. This concept is called prehabilitation. The impact of surgery is diminished and consequently results in faster and better recovery. Combining such preoperative interventions results in better preparation for surgery because each interventions may help to strengthen the effects of the others. The review authors aimed to study the effect of such multiple‐intervention preparation programmes before surgery for patients with bowel cancer. The review authors focused on these outcomes: physical fitness, number of complications after surgery, death rate, quality of life (assessed with questionnaires), length of stay in the hospital, number of emergency department visits, number of re‐admissions after surgery, safety of the programme and adherence to the programme. They compared groups with prehabilitation programmes to groups not receiving any preparation prior to surgery, other than standard care. 
Main results of this review 
The review authors found three studies with 250 participants with bowel cancer, without metastases, scheduled for surgery. Studies were conducted in Canada. A total of 130 participants followed four‐week prehabilitation programmes prior to surgery, which included exercises, nutritional advice and supplements, as well as techniques to reduce anxiety about their cancer and its treatment. Another 120 participants followed identical programmes, but only started them after the surgery, when they were discharged from hospital. 
Overall, the review authors did not find an improvement in either group of participants. The certainty of evidence was very low to moderate, mainly because of the small numbers of studies and participants included in the review. Physical fitness potentially improves and the number of complications and emergency department visits may diminish in patients receiving prehabilitation programmes prior to surgery. On the other hand, more re‐admissions to the hospital occurred after prehabilitation programmes. Because data on death rates, quality of life, length of stay in the hospital, safety of the programme and adherence to the programme was not complete or not reported, the review authors did not analyse these outcomes. Due to the mostly low or very low certainty of the evidence, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to January 2021 and also looked for unpublished, ongoing studies up to March 2021. In a future update of this review, many ongoing studies will likely have been completed, which can be included to collect more evidence on this subject.

10.1002-14651858.CD004474.pub2,"Tongxinluo (a traditional Chinese medicine) capsules may help patients suffering from unstable angina 
Tongxinluo, in capsule form, is a traditional Chinese medicine which consists of herbs and insects. Traditionally it has been thought to have clinical benefits for patients with angina, including the reduction of the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and complications of some types of heart surgery. Some studies also suggest a possible benefit in reducing the frequency and severity of angina attacks and improving symptoms. However, none of these individual studies have been reviewed systematically. 
The review authors systematically reviewed evidence from 18 randomised controlled trials for the benefit of tongxinluo with or without other treatments, including routine care or placebo, for patients with unstable angina. All the trials were conducted in China. The total number of participants was 1413, ranging in age from 25 to 88 years. Most studies randomised patients to receive tongxinluo with conventional medication or conventional medications alone. 
There was some evidence from seven studies that tongxinluo improved the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes indicating ischaemia and reduced the number of people with no improvement or worsening of ECG (six studies). Some improvement in angina symptoms (10 studies) and reduced numbers of people showing no improvement or worsening of symptoms were apparent with tongxinluo. Tongxinluo appeared to be as effective as isosorbide mononitrate in three studies. A few cases of slight gastrointestinal discomfort were reported after giving tongxinluo in seven studies and three cases of breaking of tiny blood vessels under the skin (ecchymosis) in one study. 
The evidence suggested possible benefits relating to a range of outcomes among patients with unstable angina but all the studies were of poor quality and neither blinding nor allocation concealment were used. This makes it impossible to reach firm conclusions about the benefit of this treatment. Large, high quality, randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the possible benefit of tongxinluo for unstable angina and to suggest appropriate future use of this herbal medicine.

People can have chest pain called angina. This happens when the heart does not get enough blood. Unstable angina is a serious type of chest pain. It means your heart is at risk. It can lead to a heart attack. This is a big problem for many patients.

Tongxinluo is a type of Chinese medicine. It comes in a capsule. It has herbs and insects. People have used it for a long time. They think it helps with angina. It might lower the chance of a heart attack. It might also help with heart surgery problems. Some studies suggest it makes chest pain happen less often. It might also make the pain less bad. This medicine could help people feel better.

We needed to look at all these studies together. We wanted to see if Tongxinluo really works. This study helps us understand its possible use.

## Trial Design

We wanted to see how Tongxinluo works. We looked at many past studies. We checked 18 studies. These studies were all done in China.

Each study looked at Tongxinluo. Some patients got Tongxinluo. Others got normal care or a fake pill. This allowed us to compare them. The studies included 1413 people. Their ages ranged from 25 to 88 years. Most studies gave some patients Tongxinluo with other drugs. Other patients only got the normal drugs.

We looked at how these studies were set up. We checked their results. We did not do a new study ourselves. We gathered what others had already found. We spent time reviewing all this past work.

## Results

We found some interesting things. Seven studies showed Tongxinluo helped the heart. It made the heart’s electrical test look better. This test is called an ECG. It showed that less people had worsening heart signs. Six studies confirmed this.

Ten studies showed less chest pain. People taking Tongxinluo felt better. Fewer people had pain that got worse. This is a good sign for patients.

Three studies found Tongxinluo worked as well as another drug. This drug is called isosorbide mononitrate. It also helps with chest pain.

A few side effects were seen. Seven studies reported mild upset stomach. One study reported three cases of small skin bruises. These were not serious problems.

Overall, Tongxinluo seems to help with unstable angina. It might reduce pain. It might make heart tests look better. But the studies we looked at were not perfect. It was hard to know for sure if the results were real. Doctors could not hide who got the medicine. This could affect the results.

We need bigger and better studies. These new studies must be well-designed. They will help us know for sure. Then we can understand how to use this medicine best.","Tongxinluo (a traditional Chinese medicine) capsules may help patients suffering from unstable angina 
Tongxinluo, in capsule form, is a traditional Chinese medicine which consists of herbs and insects. Traditionally it has been thought to have clinical benefits for patients with angina, including the reduction of the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and complications of some types of heart surgery. Some studies also suggest a possible benefit in reducing the frequency and severity of angina attacks and improving symptoms. However, none of these individual studies have been reviewed systematically. 
The review authors systematically reviewed evidence from 18 randomised controlled trials for the benefit of tongxinluo with or without other treatments, including routine care or placebo, for patients with unstable angina. All the trials were conducted in China. The total number of participants was 1413, ranging in age from 25 to 88 years. Most studies randomised patients to receive tongxinluo with conventional medication or conventional medications alone. 
There was some evidence from seven studies that tongxinluo improved the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes indicating ischaemia and reduced the number of people with no improvement or worsening of ECG (six studies). Some improvement in angina symptoms (10 studies) and reduced numbers of people showing no improvement or worsening of symptoms were apparent with tongxinluo. Tongxinluo appeared to be as effective as isosorbide mononitrate in three studies. A few cases of slight gastrointestinal discomfort were reported after giving tongxinluo in seven studies and three cases of breaking of tiny blood vessels under the skin (ecchymosis) in one study. 
The evidence suggested possible benefits relating to a range of outcomes among patients with unstable angina but all the studies were of poor quality and neither blinding nor allocation concealment were used. This makes it impossible to reach firm conclusions about the benefit of this treatment. Large, high quality, randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the possible benefit of tongxinluo for unstable angina and to suggest appropriate future use of this herbal medicine.

10.1002-14651858.CD013057.pub2,"Benefits and risks of ear cleaning for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (persistent or recurring ear infection with discharge of pus) 
Why this is important 
Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), also known as chronic otitis media (COM), is an inflammation and infection of the middle ear that lasts for two weeks or more. People with CSOM usually experience recurrent or persistent ear discharge – pus that leaks out from a hole in the eardrum – and hearing loss. 
Different approaches can be used to clean the affected ears and remove discharge. These include: 
‐ using cotton wool or tissue paper (dry mopping);‐ sucking up material blocking the ear with a small device (usually done under a microscope); or‐ washing out the ear (irrigation). 
To find out how effective ear cleaning is in people with CSOM, and whether it causes unwanted effects, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. In particular, we wanted to know whether ear cleaning stopped ear discharge, and whether it affected health‐related quality of life, or hearing. We also wanted to know if it caused pain, discomfort or irritation in the ear, unwanted effects such as dizziness or ear bleeding, or any serious complications. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found three studies in 431 people with CSOM. People were followed for between six weeks and six months after treatment. 
The studies compared:
‐ daily dry mopping versus no treatment (two studies, 351 people);‐ daily suction combined with antibiotic ear drops administered in a clinic, versus one instance of suction only (in a clinic) followed by daily self‐administered antibiotic ear drops (one study, 80 people). 
Daily dry mopping compared against no treatment 
‐ We do not know whether dry mopping stops ear discharge, because the evidence on whether people experienced discharge after four weeks was of very low certainty, and no studies looked at the presence of discharge earlier. 
‐ One study reported serious complications, but it was not clear whether the people who reported complications had their ears cleaned with dry mopping or not, or whether the complications occurred before or after treatment. We therefore could not tell whether dry mopping caused serious complications, or how often these occurred. 
‐ One study looked at hearing, but did not report the results in a way that could tell us whether or not dry mopping affects hearing. 
‐ No studies investigated the impact of dry mopping on health‐related quality of life, ear pain, dizziness or ear bleeding. 
Daily suction compared against one instance of suction only, in addition to antibiotic ear drops 
‐ We do not know whether suction stops ear discharge, because the evidence for between one and two weeks after treatment was of very low certainty, and the results for discharge after four weeks could not be interpreted. 
‐ We do not know if suction affects hearing or dizziness, as the evidence was of very low certainty. 
‐ No studies investigated the impact of suction on health‐related quality of life, ear pain, serious complications or ear bleeding. 
What this means 
We do not know how effective ear cleaning is for people with CSOM, and whether it causes unwanted effects. There are very few studies in this area, and these provide very low‐certainty evidence. Unwanted effects were not well reported in the studies we found. We need researchers to conduct future studies that compare ear cleaning to no cleaning, and compare different cleaning techniques and frequency, so that we can assess the benefits and risks of ear cleaning for people with CSOM.

","## Cleaning Ears for Lasting Ear Infections: What We Know

### Rationale

Many people get ear infections. Sometimes, these infections do not go away. This is called chronic suppurative otitis media, or CSOM. It means the middle part of the ear stays red and swollen.

People with CSOM often have pus coming out of their ear. This happens because there is a hole in the eardrum. They also may not hear as well. This can make life hard.

Doctors and nurses often clean ears to help. They might use cotton swabs. They might suck out the gunk. Or they might wash the ear with water.

We wanted to know if cleaning ears really helps. We also wanted to know if it causes any problems. We looked for studies that checked if cleaning stops pus. We also looked at how it affects how people feel. We checked if it caused ear pain or bleeding.

### Trial Design

We looked at many medical studies. We found all the studies that were about cleaning ears for CSOM. We then put all the results together.

We checked how good the studies were. We looked at how they were done. We looked at how many people were in them. We also checked if the results were the same across studies. Based on this, we decided how sure we were about the findings. We rated our certainty as very low, low, medium, or high.

### Results

We found three studies. These studies looked at 431 people with CSOM. The people were watched for six weeks to six months after treatment.

The studies compared two things:
*   **Daily dry cleaning versus no treatment:** Two studies looked at 351 people. They compared wiping the ear with cotton to not cleaning it.
*   **Daily sucking out ear gunk plus medicine drops versus one-time sucking out gunk plus medicine drops:** One study looked at 80 people. They compared daily suction with ear drops to one-time suction with ear drops.

**What we learned about daily dry cleaning:**
*   We do not know if dry cleaning stops pus. The studies did not give clear answers.
*   One study talked about serious problems. But we do not know if these problems were from the dry cleaning. We also do not know how often they happened.
*   One study looked at hearing. But it did not tell us if dry cleaning helped hearing.
*   No studies looked at how dry cleaning affects how people feel. They also did not look at ear pain or dizzy spells.

**What we learned about daily sucking out ear gunk:**
*   We do not know if sucking out gunk stops pus. The studies did not give clear answers.
*   We do not know if sucking out gunk affects hearing or dizzy spells. The studies were not clear.
*   No studies looked at how sucking out gunk affects how people feel. They also did not look at ear pain or serious problems.

Overall, we do not know if ear cleaning helps people with CSOM. We also do not know if it causes problems. There were not many studies. The studies we found did not give clear answers. Problems from cleaning ears were not reported well.

We need more studies to find out more. Future studies should compare cleaning to no cleaning. They should also compare different ways of cleaning. This will help us know if cleaning ears is good or bad for people with lasting ear infections.

This review has the latest information up to March 2020.","Benefits and risks of ear cleaning for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (persistent or recurring ear infection with discharge of pus)

10.1002-14651858.CD013348.pub2,"Background
Cervical cancer ranks as the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in women. Historically, women with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer have had limited treatment options. New anti‐angiogenesis therapies, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting agents, offer an alternative strategy to conventional chemotherapy; they act by inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels, thereby restricting tumour growth by blocking the blood supply. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of VEGF targeting agents in the management of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer. 
Search methods
We performed searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, online registers of clinical trials, and abstracts of scientific meetings up until 27 May 2020. 
Selection criteria
We examined randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the use of VEGF targeting agents alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy or other VEGF targeting agents. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently screened the results of search strategies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and analysed data according to the standard methods expected by Cochrane. The certainty of evidence was assessed via the GRADE approach. 
Main results
A total of 1634 records were identified. From these, we identified four studies with a total of 808 participants for inclusion. We also identified two studies that were awaiting classification and nine ongoing studies. 
Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy 
Treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy may result in lower risk of death compared to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.95; 1 study, 452 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, there are probably more specific adverse events when compared to chemotherapy alone, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (risk ratio (RR) 18.00, 95% CI 2.42 to 133.67; 1 study, 440 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); serious thromboembolic events (RR 4.5, 95% CI 1.55 to 13.08; 1 study, 440 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and hypertension (RR 13.75, 95% CI 5.07 to 37.29; 1 study, 440 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There may also be a higher incidence of serious haemorrhage (RR 5.00, 95% CI 1.11 to 22.56; 1 study, 440 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In addition, the incidence of serious adverse events is probably higher (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.79; 1 study, 439 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio was USD 295,164 per quality‐adjusted life‐year (1 study, 452 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Cediranib plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy 
Treatment with cediranib plus chemotherapy may or may not result in similar risk of death when compared to chemotherapy alone (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.65; 1 study, 69 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very uncertain results for the incidences of specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (RR 3.27, 95% CI 0.14 to 77.57; 1 study, 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); serious haemorrhage (RR 5.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 109.49; 1 study, 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); serious thromboembolic events (RR 3.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 80.59; 1 study, 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and serious hypertension (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.02 to 8.62; 1 study, 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In addition, there may or may not be a similar incidence of serious adverse events compared to chemotherapy alone (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.78; 1 study, 67 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy/brachytherapy versus chemotherapy or chemotherapy/brachytherapy 
Treatment with apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy/brachytherapy may or may not result in similar risk of death compared to chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy/brachytherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.60; 1 study, 52 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, hypertension events may occur at a higher incidence as compared to chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy/brachytherapy alone (RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.28 to 20.73; 1 study, 52 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Pazopanib plus lapatinib versus lapatinib 
Treatment with pazopanib plus lapatinib may result in higher risk of death compared to lapatinib alone (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.31; 1 study, 117 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very uncertain results for the incidences of specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.59; 1 study, 152 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); haemorrhage (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 5.58; 1 study, 152 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and thromboembolic events (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.50; 1 study, 152 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In addition, the incidence of hypertension events is probably higher (RR 12.00, 95% CI 2.94 to 49.01; 1 study, 152 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There may or may not be a similar incidence of serious adverse events as compared to lapatinib alone (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.26; 1 study, 152 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Pazopanib versus lapatinib 
Treatment with pazopanib may or may not result in similar risk of death as compared to lapatinib (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.38; 1 study, 152 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very uncertain results for the incidences of specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.12; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); haemorrhage (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.40; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and thromboembolic events (RR 3.08, 95% CI 0.13 to 74.42; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In addition, the incidence of hypertension events is probably higher (RR 11.81, 95% CI 2.89 to 48.33; 1 study, 150 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The risk of serious adverse events may or may not be similar as compared to lapatinib (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.07; 1 study, 150 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We found low‐certainty evidence in favour of the use of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. However, bevacizumab probably increases specific adverse events (gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae, thromboembolic events, hypertension) and serious adverse events. We found low‐certainty evidence that does not support the use of cediranib plus chemotherapy, apatinib plus chemotherapy, apatinib plus chemotherapy/brachytherapy, or pazopanib monotherapy. We found low‐certainty evidence suggesting that pazopanib plus lapatinib worsens outcomes. The VEGF inhibitors apatinib and pazopanib may increase the probability of hypertension events. 
","**1. Plain Title: Looking at New Drugs for Cervical Cancer**

**2. Rationale**

Cervical cancer is a serious disease. It is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in women. When the cancer spreads or comes back, treatment choices are few. This makes life hard for women with this type of cancer.

Doctors are looking for new ways to fight cancer. One new way is to stop the cancer from growing new blood vessels. Cancer cells need blood vessels to get food and grow. Drugs that stop this are called VEGF-targeting agents. They cut off the cancer’s food supply.

We want to know if these new drugs help women with advanced cervical cancer. We also want to know if they cause bad side effects. This study looks at how well these drugs work alone or with other cancer drugs. We need to find better ways to treat this cancer. These new drugs could be a step forward.

**3. Trial Design**

This study is a review of other studies. It gathers facts from many past studies. These studies looked at women with cervical cancer. These women had cancer that kept coming back or had spread.

The studies compared new drugs that target VEGF with standard cancer drugs. Some studies gave the new drug alone. Others gave the new drug with regular chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a common cancer treatment. The studies included different ages of women. All women had advanced cervical cancer.

The research team looked for studies up until May 27, 2020. They searched many health databases. Three experts checked all the studies. They made sure the studies were good quality. They looked at how many women died. They also looked at any bad side effects. The goal was to see what benefits and harms these new drugs cause. We do not know how long each woman was in her original study.

**4. Results**

We found four studies to include in our review. These studies had a total of 808 women. We also found two studies that need more review and nine studies that are still going on.

One drug, called **bevacizumab**, was studied with chemotherapy. Women who took bevacizumab plus chemotherapy had a lower risk of death. This is compared to women who only got chemotherapy. But this drug also caused more bad side effects. These included problems in the stomach or gut. It also caused more blood clots and high blood pressure. There was also a higher chance of serious bleeding.

Another drug, called **cediranib**, was studied with chemotherapy. This drug may or may not change the risk of death. It was compared to chemotherapy alone. We are not sure about the side effects of this drug. The results were not clear.

A drug called **apatinib** was studied. It was given with chemotherapy or with chemotherapy and radiation. This drug may or may not change the risk of death. This is compared to chemotherapy or chemotherapy and radiation alone. But it may cause high blood pressure more often.

Two studies looked at a drug called **pazopanib**. In one study, pazopanib was given with another drug called lapatinib. This combination may make the risk of death higher than lapatinib alone. It also likely caused more high blood pressure. In another study, pazopanib alone was compared to lapatinib alone. We are not sure if pazopanib alone changed the risk of death. It likely caused more high blood pressure.

In conclusion, bevacizumab with chemotherapy may help women live longer. But it also causes more serious side effects. The other drugs we looked at, cediranib, apatinib, and pazopanib alone, did not clearly help. Pazopanib with lapatinib may even make things worse. Apatinib and pazopanib may cause high blood pressure. More research is needed to be sure about these drugs.","Inhibition of blood vessel formation in advanced cervical cancer
What is the aim of this review?The aim of this Cochrane Review is to find out whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting drugs, which inhibit the formation of new blood vessels, can improve survival in women with cervical cancer that has spread to distant sites (metastasised) or has not responded to or come back (recurred) after initial treatment. These drugs include bevacizumab, cediranib, apatinib, pazopanib, anlotinib, and nintedanib. 
Key messagesBevacizumab plus chemotherapy may improve survival and probably increases specific and serious adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations through the gut wall, blood clot formation (thromboembolic events) in blood vessels, hypertension (increased blood pressure), and bleeding (haemorrhage). 
Cediranib or apatinib plus chemotherapy, or pazopanib alone, may make little to no difference in survival. Pazopanib plus lapatinib may reduce survival. 
What are the main results of the review?We found four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria and enrolled 808 women. 
We found one study, which included 452 women, that assessed the use of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. The inclusion of bevacizumab may improve overall survival and probably increases the incidences of specific and serious adverse events. 
A second study analysed 69 women treated with cediranib plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. Cediranib may make little to no difference in survival, and it is uncertain whether it increases the incidences of specific or serious adverse events. 
Another study with 59 women reported data on the use of apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy) versus chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy alone. Apatinib may make little to no difference in survival, but it exhibited promising efficacy for progression‐free survival. 
We found one study with 228 women that compared pazopanib plus lapatinib versus only lapatinib, or pazopanib versus lapatinib: pazopanib plus lapatinib may reduce survival and probably increases the incidence of hypertension; pazopanib alone may make little to no difference in survival and probably increases the incidence of hypertension. 
Overall the quality (certainty) of the evidence was low, as each comparison included only one study and most studies were small.

10.1002-14651858.CD008011.pub3,"Treatment for cardiac problems caused by anthracycline chemotherapy for childhood cancer 
Anthracyclines are anticancer drugs used in the treatment of different types of childhood cancer. An important adverse effect of anthracyclines is damage to the heart, which can lead to asymptomatic (without complaints) or symptomatic (with complaints) cardiac problems during and after cancer treatment. While there are several drugs available to treat other types of cardiac problems in adults, it is not known if these drugs are beneficial in treating cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines in childhood cancer patients and survivors. A physician confronted with a childhood cancer patient or survivor with anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems should be able to make an informed decision on how to treat this patient based on high‐quality evidence about the beneficial and adverse effects of the treatment options. We searched for and summarised studies that evaluated drugs for treating anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. 
We identified two randomised studies evaluating two different drugs in two different types of patients. One of these drugs, an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril), had a short‐term beneficial effect on heart function in survivors of childhood cancer with asymptomatic cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines compared with placebo. However, the drug had no significant beneficial effect on other important outcomes and was associated with side effects such as dizziness and fatigue. This study was of reasonable/good quality. The other study was of low quality and found no effect of a short treatment with phosphocreatine in childhood leukaemia patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiac problems compared with a control treatment with vitamin C, adenosine triphosphate, vitamin E, and oral coenzyme Q10. 
We could make no definitive conclusions about treatment options for anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. High‐quality studies are needed to determine if there are drugs that improve heart function in these patients.

### Plain Title

Heart Care for Kids Who Had Cancer Medicine

### Rationale

Cancer medicine called anthracyclines helps kids with cancer. But these strong drugs can hurt their hearts. Some kids have no signs of heart trouble. Others feel sick or tired because of their heart. This heart damage can happen during or after cancer treatment.

Doctors know how to treat heart problems in grown-ups. But we do not know if these same drugs help kids. We need to know what works best for kids whose hearts are hurt by cancer medicine. This study looked for ways to treat these heart problems.

We wanted to find good proof about which medicines help. We also wanted to know if these medicines cause other problems. Finding good answers helps doctors choose the best care for kids.

### Trial Design

How did we study this? We looked at other studies that were already done. We searched for studies about drugs that treat heart damage from cancer medicine in kids. These were kids who had cancer or were cancer survivors.

We found two main studies to review. Both studies tested different drugs on different groups of patients. One study looked at a drug called enalapril. The other looked at a drug called phosphocreatine.

These studies helped us see what impact these drugs had on heart health. They also looked at any bad effects the drugs caused. We used these past studies to try and learn more.

### Results

What did we find? We looked at two studies. The first study looked at a drug called enalapril. This drug is an ACE inhibitor. It helped the hearts of kids who had no signs of heart trouble. Their hearts worked better for a short time. These were kids who had cancer and then heart damage.

But enalapril did not help with other big problems. It also made some kids feel dizzy or tired. This study was well done.

The second study was not as good. It looked at a drug called phosphocreatine. It did not find that this drug helped kids with heart problems. These kids had leukemia. Some had signs of heart trouble, some did not. This drug was compared to other vitamins and supplements.

Overall, we cannot say for sure which drugs are best. We need more good studies. We need to find out if there are drugs that really make kids' hearts work better. This is important for kids who had cancer.","Treatment for cardiac problems caused by anthracycline chemotherapy for childhood cancer

A physician confronted with a childhood cancer patient or survivor with anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems should be able to make an informed decision on how to treat this patient based on high‐quality evidence about the beneficial and adverse effects of the treatment options. We searched for and summarised studies that evaluated drugs for treating anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. 
We identified two randomised studies evaluating two different drugs in two different types of patients. One of these drugs, an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril), had a short‐term beneficial effect on heart function in survivors of childhood cancer with asymptomatic cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines compared with placebo. However, the drug had no significant beneficial effect on other important outcomes and was associated with side effects such as dizziness and fatigue. This study was of reasonable/good quality. The other study was of low quality and found no effect of a short treatment with phosphocreatine in childhood leukaemia patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiac problems compared with a control treatment with vitamin C, adenosine triphosphate, vitamin E, and oral coenzyme Q10. 
We could make no definitive conclusions about treatment options for anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. High‐quality studies are needed to determine if there are drugs that improve heart function in these patients.

This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of herbal therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
The review shows that in people with RA:
‐ Evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil (containing gamma‐linolenic acid (GLA)) probably improve pain; may improve function; and probably does not increase adverse events (unwanted side effects). 
‐ Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F may improve some symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and higher doses (180 mg ‐ 350 mg daily) may be more effective than lower doses (60 mg daily). There are some adverse events associated with Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. 
‐ We are uncertain of the effects of other herbal therapies because only single studies were available, or important features of RA, such as changes in the number of swollen and tender joints, were not reported. 
Often we do not have precise information about side effects and complications, particularly for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects associated with Triperygium wilfordii Hook F may include painful periods in women, decreased fertility in men, insufficient urine excretion, and increased rate of infections. Possible side effects associated with GLA sourced from evening primrose oil include headache, nausea, and diarrhoea, and rare complications include allergy and seizures. 
What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is herbal therapy? 
When you have RA, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis at present, so treatments are used to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move. 
Herbal interventions are defined as any plant preparation (whole, powder, extract, standardised mixture) used for medicinal purposes. Historically, many herbal therapies have been used to treat RA. Like conventional non‐herbal drugs, many herbal therapies are believed to act by blocking the activity of these immune cells and substances and reducing inflammation in the joints, and some people believe they have fewer side effects.  
Best estimate of what happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis:  
Pain (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain):
‐People who took eveing primrose oil, primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil (wih the active ingredient GLA) rated their pain to be 33 points lower (9 to 56 points lower) on a scale of 0 to 100 after 6 months of treatment (33% absolute improvement). 
‐People who took placebo rated their pain to be 19 points lower after treatment.
Physical function (higher score means greater disability):
‐People who took GLA rated their disability 16% better.
‐People who placebo rated their disability 5% better.

Herbal Help for Joint Pain

### Rationale

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a sickness where your body's defense system attacks your joints. This makes your joints swell, get stiff, and hurt. It often starts in your hands and feet. There is no cure for RA now. So, treatments aim to ease pain and stiffness. They also help you move better.

Many plant-based medicines have been used for RA for a long time. People think these herbs can calm down the body's defense cells. They may also lower swelling in the joints. Some people believe these natural ways have fewer bad effects. This study looks at what we know about how well herbal treatments work for RA.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many past research papers. It gathered all the facts about herbal treatments for RA. It focused on what happened to people with RA who took different herbs. It also checked for any bad side effects. The study looked at how herbs affected pain and how well people could move.

### Results

Our study found some helpful things about herbs for RA.

**Evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrant seed oil (all have GLA):**

*   These oils likely made pain better.
*   They may have helped people move better.
*   They likely did not cause more bad side effects.
*   People who took these oils said their pain was 33 points lower. This was on a pain scale of 0 to 100 after 6 months. This is a big improvement.
*   Their ability to move was 16% better.

**Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F:**

*   This herb may make some RA problems better.
*   Higher doses (180 mg - 350 mg each day) might work better than lower doses (60 mg each day).
*   But this herb can have some bad side effects. These can include painful periods in women. It can also cause men to have trouble having kids. Some people may not pee enough. They might also get more infections.

We are not sure about other herbs. This is because there was not enough research on them. Also, some studies did not report important things. They did not say if swollen or tender joints changed.

Side effects for GLA from evening primrose oil can be headaches, feeling sick to your stomach, and loose stools. Rarely, it can cause allergies or fits.

In short, some herbal oils can help with RA pain and movement. They seem to be safe. Another herb might help, but it has more risks. More studies are needed to learn about other herbs.","Herbal therapy for rheumatoid arthritis

10.1002-14651858.CD005231.pub3,"Can smokers be helped to reduce the harm caused by cigarette smoking by smoking fewer cigarettes or using different tobacco products? 
Background 
The best thing to do to reduce the harms caused by smoking is to quit, but some people may not want to do this or may feel that they are unable to stop smoking completely. Cutting down the number of cigarettes smoked daily or using different tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco or low‐tar cigarettes, may reduce some of the harm caused by smoking. It may also help people to stop smoking completely in the long term. On the other hand, reducing smoking or using other tobacco products may not improve health and could reduce a person's motivation to quit smoking altogether. It is important that we review the evidence to find out whether these approaches could help smokers who do not want to or cannot quit to reduce the harm caused by their smoking. We were mainly interested in whether these approaches improved the health of smokers, but also looked at smoking reduction and quitting rates. 
Study characteristics 
We found 20 randomised controlled trials that tested ways to help people to cut down the number of cigarettes they smoked. Some of these just advised smokers to smoke less, but most also provided them with a product to help them cut down: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, bupropion, electronic cigarettes (ecigs), or snus (a form of smokeless, oral tobacco). We also found four randomized controlled trials that tested the effects of using cigarettes designed to reduce the damage caused by smoking: reduced tar, carbon or nicotine cigarettes. Most of the studies used NRT to help people to reduce their smoking. All of the studies included people who were not planning to quit smoking soon. The research is current to October 2015. 
Key results 
Eight studies (with 3081 smokers) found that using NRT roughly doubled the likelihood of halving the number of cigarettes smoked each day, compared to using a placebo. Using NRT in this way also nearly doubled the likelihood of quitting completely. One trial each tested bupropion, varenicline, ecigs and snus to help reduce the harms caused by smoking, and there was no evidence that any of these treatments helped smokers to reduce the number of cigarettes they were smoking each day. This may be because there has not yet been enough research into these methods. Only one of the trials testing cigarettes designed to reduce risk measured their effect on the number of people quitting smoking. It found that people were not more likely to quit smoking if they used reduced‐nicotine cigarettes than if they smoked their usual cigarettes. We did not find any trials which reported the long‐term health effects of the treatments, and so it remains uncertain how much health benefit there is from reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day or smoking cigarettes designed to be less harmful. 
Quality of evidence 
The tobacco industry funded three of the included studies of cigarettes designed to reduce risk. None of the studies looked at whether there had been a long‐term change in the health of the users. We rate the quality of the evidence looking at how many people quit smoking as 'low' or 'very low', generally because the findings are based on a small number of studies. We need more studies to investigate methods of reducing the harm caused by continued smoking. These need to measure the health of the users over a long period.

How to Smoke Less or Use Safer Tobacco Products

## Rationale
Smoking cigarettes harms your health. The best way to be healthy is to stop smoking. But some people find it very hard to quit. They may not want to stop smoking right now.

Cutting down on how many cigarettes you smoke each day might help. Using different tobacco products might also help. These products might cause less harm. They might also help people quit smoking later on.

But we need to know if these choices really make people healthier. We need to know if they truly help people quit smoking for good. This study looked at these ideas. We wanted to see if they could help smokers who do not want to or cannot quit.

## Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies. We searched for studies that tried to help people smoke less. We found 20 such studies.

Most studies gave people a product to help them cut back. These products included:
* Nicotine patches or gum (NRT)
* Medicines like varenicline or bupropion
* Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs)
* Snus (a type of smokeless tobacco you put in your mouth)

Some studies just told people to smoke less. We also found four studies that looked at special cigarettes. These cigarettes were made to cause less harm. They had less tar, carbon, or nicotine.

All the studies included people who were not planning to quit smoking soon. The studies wanted to see if these methods helped people smoke less. They also wanted to see if people quit smoking completely. We looked at studies up to October 2015.

## Results
Eight studies showed good news for NRT. People who used NRT were twice as likely to cut their daily smoking in half. They smoked half the number of cigarettes they used to. Using NRT also made people almost twice as likely to quit smoking for good. These studies included over 3,000 smokers.

Other products were also tested. One study looked at bupropion. One looked at varenicline. One looked at e-cigs. And one looked at snus. These studies did not show that these products helped people smoke less. This might be because we need more studies on them.

One study looked at special cigarettes with less nicotine. It found that these did not make people more likely to quit. People using them were no more likely to quit than those smoking their usual cigarettes.

We did not find studies that showed how these methods affected health over a long time. So, we still do not know how much these methods improve people's health. We need more studies to find this out. We need studies that follow people for a long time. They need to check on their health.

Some studies were paid for by tobacco companies. We need more research on how to help people smoke less. These new studies must look at long-term health changes.","Can smokers be helped to reduce the harm caused by cigarette smoking by smoking fewer cigarettes or using different tobacco products?

10.1002-14651858.CD013316.pub2,"Background
Glioblastoma is an aggressive form of brain cancer. Approximately five in 100 people with glioblastoma survive for five years past diagnosis. Glioblastomas that have a particular modification to their DNA (called methylation) in a particular region (the O6‐methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter) respond better to treatment with chemotherapy using a drug called temozolomide. 
Objectives
To determine which method for assessing MGMT methylation status best predicts overall survival in people diagnosed with glioblastoma who are treated with temozolomide. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index to December 2018, and examined reference lists. For economic evaluation studies, we additionally searched NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED) up to December 2014. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were longitudinal (cohort) studies of adults with diagnosed glioblastoma treated with temozolomide with/without radiotherapy/surgery. Studies had to have related MGMT status in tumour tissue (assessed by one or more method) with overall survival and presented results as hazard ratios or with sufficient information (e.g. Kaplan‐Meier curves) for us to estimate hazard ratios. We focused mainly on studies comparing two or more methods, and listed brief details of articles that examined a single method of measuring MGMT promoter methylation. We also sought economic evaluations conducted alongside trials, modelling studies and cost analysis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently undertook all steps of the identification and data extraction process for multiple‐method studies. We assessed risk of bias and applicability using our own modified and extended version of the QUality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. We compared different techniques, exact promoter regions (5'‐cytosine‐phosphate‐guanine‐3' (CpG) sites) and thresholds for interpretation within studies by examining hazard ratios. We performed meta‐analyses for comparisons of the three most commonly examined methods (immunohistochemistry (IHC), methylation‐specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and pyrosequencing (PSQ)), with ratios of hazard ratios (RHR), using an imputed value of the correlation between results based on the same individuals. 
Main results
We included 32 independent cohorts involving 3474 people that compared two or more methods. We found evidence that MSP (CpG sites 76 to 80 and 84 to 87) is more prognostic than IHC for MGMT protein at varying thresholds (RHR 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.71). We also found evidence that PSQ is more prognostic than IHC for MGMT protein at various thresholds (RHR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.84). The data suggest that PSQ (mainly at CpG sites 74 to 78, using various thresholds) is slightly more prognostic than MSP at sites 76 to 80 and 84 to 87 (RHR 1.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.48). Many variants of PSQ have been compared, although we did not see any strong and consistent messages from the results. Targeting multiple CpG sites is likely to be more prognostic than targeting just one. In addition, we identified and summarised 190 articles describing a single method for measuring MGMT promoter methylation status. 
Authors' conclusions
PSQ and MSP appear more prognostic for overall survival than IHC. Strong evidence is not available to draw conclusions with confidence about the best CpG sites or thresholds for quantitative methods. MSP has been studied mainly for CpG sites 76 to 80 and 84 to 87 and PSQ at CpG sites ranging from 72 to 95. A threshold of 9% for CpG sites 74 to 78 performed better than higher thresholds of 28% or 29% in two of three good‐quality studies making such comparisons. 
","## A Better Way to Predict Brain Cancer Treatment Success

### Rationale

Brain cancer, called glioblastoma, is a very bad disease. Only about 5 out of 100 people live for five years after they find out they have it. This cancer can be hard to treat.

Some glioblastoma cancers have a special mark on their DNA. This mark helps doctors know if a medicine called temozolomide will work well. The mark is called MGMT methylation.

This study looked for the best way to find this mark. A better test can help doctors choose the right treatment. This means more people might live longer.

### Trial Design

This study asked: ""How can we best tell if glioblastoma medicine will work?""

Researchers looked at many past studies. These studies followed adults with glioblastoma. All these adults had treatment with temozolomide. Some also had radiation or surgery.

The studies looked at how long people lived. They also looked at the MGMT mark in their tumors. The tumors were checked using one or more test methods.

We wanted to find studies that compared two or more test methods. We also looked for studies about the cost of these tests.

### Results

We looked at 32 groups of people. This was a total of 3474 people. These groups compared different ways to test for the MGMT mark.

We found that two tests worked better than another test. These better tests are called MSP and PSQ. They were better at predicting how long people would live than a test called IHC.

The PSQ test seemed a little better than MSP. But we need more research to be very sure. It also seems that testing for more than one DNA spot is better than testing for just one.

We also looked at 190 other studies. These studies used only one way to check for the MGMT mark.

In short, PSQ and MSP tests are better at telling how well people with glioblastoma will do. We still need to find the very best way to do these tests. This will help doctors choose the best path for each patient.","Which method of determining MGMT promoter methylation best predicts survival in people with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide? 
What was the aim of this review? 
Glioblastoma is a very aggressive type of brain cancer. People with glioblastoma are usually treated with surgical removal of the tumour followed by radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both. The standard chemotherapy is a medicine called temozolomide. Some glioblastoma tumours have a particular modification in their DNA (which contains the genetic code of organisms), and knowing whether a person has this modification is useful to predict how long the person may live after their diagnosis with cancer and how they may respond to temozolomide. The modification is known as 'methylation of the MGMT promoter region' and it can also affect MGMT protein expression (the way MGMT is made and modified). There are many ways to work out whether a tumour has this modification. In this review, we attempted to work out which method is best. 
What we found 
We identified 32 studies comparing different ways to measure whether the MGMT promoter region is methylated. The main three methods were called 'methylation‐specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR),' 'pyrosequencing' (both of which look directly at the MGMT promoter region) and 'immunohistochemistry' (which looks at MGMT protein expression). We found that methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing are better at predicting overall survival than immunohistochemistry. Methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing can be carried out by targeting different parts of the tumour DNA. Pyrosequencing can be performed using different cut‐off thresholds to determine whether a tumour is methylated or unmethylated. We did not identify very clear signals in terms of the best parts of the DNA to target or which are the best cut‐off thresholds. 
How reliable are results of the studies in this review? 
We rated our confidence in the evidence as 'moderate' for our conclusions about methylation‐specific PCR, but as 'low' for pyrosequencing. Although there were many studies, they all looked at different variants of the methods, so it is difficult to work out exactly which variant is best. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Our review indicates both methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing provide better predictions of survival than immunohistochemistry. There is some evidence that pyrosequencing may be better than methylation‐specific PCR at predicting overall survival, depending on the DNA targets and cut‐off thresholds used. We documented the most frequent DNA targets used in methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing. We described cut‐off thresholds used in pyrosequencing, although it is unclear which of these is best.

Comparing Different Insulin Types for Type 1 Diabetes

### 2. Rationale

Type 1 diabetes is a disease that stays with you. It can cause health problems over time. People with this disease need insulin to live. Insulin helps keep blood sugar levels steady.

For many years, NPH insulin was the main type used. This was an ""intermediate acting"" insulin. It helped keep blood sugar down. But new insulins came out. These were ""long acting"" insulins. They seemed to work more like the body's own insulin.

Doctors thought these new insulins might be better. They hoped they would lower blood sugar more. They also hoped they would prevent problems. These problems include very low blood sugar. They also include long-term health issues. This study looked at if these ideas were true. It compared long-acting insulin to intermediate-acting insulin.

### 3. Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. It gathered information from many research projects. It checked studies that compared different insulins.

The studies looked at people with type 1 diabetes. These people were of different ages. They had type 1 diabetes. The studies lasted up to one year. This means people were in a study for a year or less. In total, 3872 people used long-acting insulin. And 2915 people used intermediate-acting insulin.

### 4. Results

This study found some things. Long-acting insulins lowered a marker of diabetes control. This marker is called glycosylated hemoglobin. But the change was small. It might not be a big help for patients.

Long-acting insulins were better at night. They helped lower blood sugar when people were sleeping. This led to lower blood sugar in the morning. It also meant fewer times of very low blood sugar at night.

The studies did not have data on long-term problems. This means we do not know if these insulins prevent health issues over many years.

The doctors concluded more research is needed. We need to know more about the long-term good and bad effects of long-acting insulins.","Intermediate acting versus long acting insulin for type 1 diabetes mellitus

10.1002-14651858.CD013787,"Background
Specific diagnostic tests to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and resulting COVID‐19 disease are not always available and take time to obtain results. Routine laboratory markers such as white blood cell count, measures of anticoagulation, C‐reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin, are used to assess the clinical status of a patient. These laboratory tests may be useful for the triage of people with potential COVID‐19 to prioritize them for different levels of treatment, especially in situations where time and resources are limited. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of routine laboratory testing as a triage test to determine if a person has COVID‐19. 
Search methods
On 4 May 2020 we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the COVID‐19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID‐19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included both case‐control designs and consecutive series of patients that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of routine laboratory testing as a triage test to determine if a person has COVID‐19. The reference standard could be reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) alone; RT‐PCR plus clinical expertise or and imaging; repeated RT‐PCR several days apart or from different samples; WHO and other case definitions; and any other reference standard used by the study authors. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from each included study. They also assessed the methodological quality of the studies, using QUADAS‐2. We used the 'NLMIXED' procedure in SAS 9.4 for the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) meta‐analyses of tests for which we included four or more studies. To facilitate interpretation of results, for each meta‐analysis we estimated summary sensitivity at the points on the SROC curve that corresponded to the median and interquartile range boundaries of specificities in the included studies. 
Main results
We included 21 studies in this review, including 14,126 COVID‐19 patients and 56,585 non‐COVID‐19 patients in total. Studies evaluated a total of 67 different laboratory tests. Although we were interested in the diagnotic accuracy of routine tests for COVID‐19, the included studies used detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection through RT‐PCR as reference standard. There was considerable heterogeneity between tests, threshold values and the settings in which they were applied. For some tests a positive result was defined as a decrease compared to normal vaues, for other tests a positive result was defined as an increase, and for some tests both increase and decrease may have indicated test positivity. None of the studies had either low risk of bias on all domains or low concerns for applicability for all domains. Only three of the tests evaluated had a summary sensitivity and specificity over 50%. These were: increase in interleukin‐6, increase in C‐reactive protein and lymphocyte count decrease. 
Blood count 
Eleven studies evaluated a decrease in white blood cell count, with a median specificity of 93% and a summary sensitivity of 25% (95% CI 8.0% to 27%; very low‐certainty evidence). The 15 studies that evaluated an increase in white blood cell count had a lower median specificity and a lower corresponding sensitivity. Four studies evaluated a decrease in neutrophil count. Their median specificity was 93%, corresponding to a summary sensitivity of 10% (95% CI 1.0% to 56%; low‐certainty evidence). The 11 studies that evaluated an increase in neutrophil count had a lower median specificity and a lower corresponding sensitivity. The summary sensitivity of an increase in neutrophil percentage (4 studies) was 59% (95% CI 1.0% to 100%) at median specificity (38%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in monocyte count (4 studies) was 13% (95% CI 6.0% to 26%) at median specificity (73%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of a decrease in lymphocyte count (13 studies) was 64% (95% CI 28% to 89%) at median specificity (53%; low‐certainty evidence). Four studies that evaluated a decrease in lymphocyte percentage showed a lower median specificity and lower corresponding sensitivity. The summary sensitivity of a decrease in platelets (4 studies) was 19% (95% CI 10% to 32%) at median specificity (88%; low‐certainty evidence). 
Liver function tests 
The summary sensitivity of an increase in alanine aminotransferase (9 studies) was 12% (95% CI 3% to 34%) at median specificity (92%; low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (7 studies) was 29% (95% CI 17% to 45%) at median specificity (81%) (low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of a decrease in albumin (4 studies) was 21% (95% CI 3% to 67%) at median specificity (66%; low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in total bilirubin (4 studies) was 12% (95% CI 3.0% to 34%) at median specificity (92%; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Markers of inflammation 
The summary sensitivity of an increase in CRP (14 studies) was 66% (95% CI 55% to 75%) at median specificity (44%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in procalcitonin (6 studies) was 3% (95% CI 1% to 19%) at median specificity (86%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in IL‐6 (four studies) was 73% (95% CI 36% to 93%) at median specificity (58%) (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Other biomarkers 
The summary sensitivity of an increase in creatine kinase (5 studies) was 11% (95% CI 6% to 19%) at median specificity (94%) (low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in serum creatinine (four studies) was 7% (95% CI 1% to 37%) at median specificity (91%; low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (4 studies) was 25% (95% CI 15% to 38%) at median specificity (72%; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Although these tests give an indication about the general health status of patients and some tests may be specific indicators for inflammatory processes, none of the tests we investigated are useful for accurately ruling in or ruling out COVID‐19 on their own. Studies were done in specific hospitalized populations, and future studies should consider non‐hospital settings to evaluate how these tests would perform in people with milder symptoms. 
","**1. Simple Ways to Find COVID-19**

**2. Rationale**

Sometimes, we cannot test for COVID-19 right away. The results can take a long time to come back. We need quick ways to tell if someone has COVID-19. This is very important when there are many sick people and not many resources.

Doctors use normal blood tests to check how sick a person is. These tests look at things like white blood cells. They also check for signs of swelling in the body. We wanted to see if these quick tests could tell us who has COVID-19. This would help doctors know who needs care fast. We hoped these tests could help find COVID-19 when the main test is not ready.

**3. Trial Design**

We looked at many past studies. These studies checked how well normal blood tests could find COVID-19. We searched many places for these studies. We looked at studies from May 2020. We did not care what language they were in.

We chose studies that looked at different blood tests. These studies had to use the main COVID-19 test to check their results. The main test is called RT-PCR. It looks for the virus itself. The studies included people of all ages and health conditions. We did not follow new patients ourselves. Instead, we looked at facts from studies already done.

**4. Results**

We looked at 21 studies. These studies had over 14,000 people with COVID-19. They also had over 56,000 people without COVID-19. The studies checked 67 different blood tests.

Most of these simple blood tests did not work well to find COVID-19 by themselves. They were not good enough to say for sure if someone had the virus or not. Only three tests showed some promise.

One test looked at a rise in something called interleukin-6. Another test looked at a rise in C-reactive protein. The third test looked at a drop in white blood cells called lymphocytes. Even these three tests were not perfect. They were right about half the time.

For example, when white blood cells went down, the test was right 25% of the time. When C-reactive protein went up, it was right 66% of the time. When interleukin-6 went up, it was right 73% of the time.

These simple tests can tell doctors about a person's general health. They can also show if there is swelling in the body. But none of these tests can say for sure if someone has COVID-19. We need more studies. These new studies should look at people who are not in the hospital. This would show us how these tests work for people with milder sickness.","How accurate are routine laboratory tests for diagnosis of COVID‐19?
What are routine laboratory tests? 
Routine laboratory tests are blood tests that assess the health status of a patient. Tests include counts of different types of white blood cells (these help the body fight infection), and detection of markers (proteins) that indicate organ damage, and general inflammation. These tests are widely available and in some places they may be the only tests available for diagnosis of COVID‐19. 
What did we want to find out? 
People with suspected COVID‐19 need to know quickly whether they are infected so that they can self‐isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. 
Currently, the standard test for COVID‐19 is usually the RT‐PCR test. In the RT‐PCR, samples from the nose and throat are sent away for testing, usually to a large, central laboratory with specialist equipment. Other tests include imaging tests, like X‐rays, which also require specialist equipment. 
We wanted to know whether routine laboratory tests were sufficiently accurate to diagnose COVID‐19 in people with suspected COVID‐19. We also wanted to know whether they were accurate enough to prioritize patients for different levels of treatment. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of routine laboratory tests to diagnose COVID‐19 compared with RT‐PCR or other tests. Studies could be of any design and be set anywhere in the world. Studies could include participants of any age or sex, with suspected COVID‐19, or use samples from people known to have – or not to have ‐ COVID‐19. 
What we found 
We found 21 studies that looked at 67 different routine laboratory tests for COVID‐19. Most of the studies looked at how accurately these tests diagnosed infection with the virus causing COVID‐19. Four studies included both children and adults, 16 included only adults and one study only children. Seventeen studies were done in China, and one each in Iran, Italy, Taiwan and the USA. All studies took place in hospitals, except one that used samples from a database. Most studies used RT‐PCR to confirm COVID‐19 diagnosis. 
Accuracy of tests is most often reported using ‘sensitivity’ and ‘specificity’. Sensitivity is the proportion of people with COVID‐19 correctly detected by the test; specificity is the proportion of people without COVID‐19 who are correctly identified by the test. The nearer sensitivity and specificity are to 100%, the better the test. A test to prioritize people for treatment would require a high sensitivity of more than 80%. 
Where four or more studies evaluated a particular test, we pooled their results and analyzed them together. Our analyses showed that only three of the tests had both sensitivity and specificity over 50%. Two of these were markers for general inflammation (increases in interleukin‐6 and C‐reactive protein). The third was for lymphocyte count decrease. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell where a low count might indicate infection. 
How reliable are the results? 
Our confidence in the evidence from this review is low because the studies were different from each other, which made them difficult to compare. For example, some included very sick people, while some included people with hardly any COVID‐19 symptoms. Also, the diagnosis of COVID‐19 was confirmed in different ways: RT‐PCR was sometimes used in combination with other tests. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Routine laboratory tests can be issued by most healthcare facilities. However, our results are probably not representative of most clinical situations in which these tests are being used. Most studies included very sick people with high rates of COVID‐19 virus infection of between 27% and 76%. In most primary healthcare facilities, this percentage will be lower. 
What does this mean? 
Routine laboratory tests cannot distinguish between COVID‐19 and other diseases as the cause of infection, inflammation or tissue damage. None of the tests performed well enough to be a standalone diagnostic test for COVID‐19 nor to prioritize patients for treatment. They will mainly be used to provide an overall picture about the health status of the patient. The final COVID‐19 diagnosis has to be made based on other tests. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched all COVID‐19 studies up to 4 May 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD012204.pub2,"Background
The projected rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could develop into a substantial health problem worldwide. Whether dipeptidyl‐peptidase (DPP)‐4 inhibitors or glucagon‐like peptide (GLP)‐1 analogues are able to prevent or delay T2DM and its associated complications in people at risk for the development of T2DM is unknown. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of DPP‐4 inhibitors and GLP‐1 analogues on the prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in people with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting blood glucose, moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; PubMed; Embase; ClinicalTrials.gov; the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We asked investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials. The date of the last search of all databases was January 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of 12 weeks or more comparing DPP‐4 inhibitors and GLP‐1 analogues with any pharmacological glucose‐lowering intervention, behaviour‐changing intervention, placebo or no intervention in people with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, moderately elevated HbA1c or combinations of these. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors read all abstracts and full‐text articles and records, assessed quality and extracted outcome data independently. One review author extracted data which were checked by a second review author. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or the involvement of a third review author. For meta‐analyses, we planned to use a random‐effects model with investigation of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. 
Main results
We included seven completed RCTs; about 98 participants were randomised to a DPP‐4 inhibitor as monotherapy and 1620 participants were randomised to a GLP‐1 analogue as monotherapy. Two trials investigated a DPP‐4 inhibitor and five trials investigated a GLP‐1 analogue. A total of 924 participants with data on allocation to control groups were randomised to a comparator group; 889 participants were randomised to placebo and 33 participants to metformin monotherapy. One RCT of liraglutide contributed 85% of all participants. The duration of the intervention varied from 12 weeks to 160 weeks. We judged none of the included trials at low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains and did not perform meta‐analyses because there were not enough trials. 
One trial comparing the DPP‐4 inhibitor vildagliptin with placebo reported no deaths (very low‐quality evidence). The incidence of T2DM by means of WHO diagnostic criteria in this trial was 3/90 participants randomised to vildagliptin versus 1/89 participants randomised to placebo (very low‐quality evidence). Also, 1/90 participants on vildagliptin versus 2/89 participants on placebo experienced a serious adverse event (very low‐quality evidence). One out of 90 participants experienced congestive heart failure in the vildagliptin group versus none in the placebo group (very low‐quality evidence). There were no data on non‐fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, health‐related quality of life or socioeconomic effects reported. 
All‐cause and cardiovascular mortality following treatment with GLP‐1 analogues were rarely reported; one trial of exenatide reported that no participant died. Another trial of liraglutide 3.0 mg showed that 2/1501 in the liraglutide group versus 2/747 in the placebo group died after 160 weeks of treatment (very low‐quality evidence). 
The incidence of T2DM following treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg compared to placebo after 160 weeks was 26/1472 (1.8%) participants randomised to liraglutide versus 46/738 (6.2%) participants randomised to placebo (very low‐quality evidence). The trial established the risk for (diagnosis of) T2DM as HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% (6.5% or greater), fasting plasma glucose 5.6 mmol/L or greater to 6.9 mmol/L or less (7.0 mmol/L or greater) or two‐hour post‐load plasma glucose 7.8 mmol/L or greater to 11.0 mmol/L (11.1 mmol/L). Altogether, 70/1472 (66%) participants regressed from intermediate hyperglycaemia to normoglycaemia compared with 268/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group. The incidence of T2DM after the 12‐week off‐treatment extension period (i.e. after 172 weeks) showed that five additional participants were diagnosed T2DM in the liraglutide group, compared with one participant in the placebo group. After 12‐week treatment cessation, 740/1472 (50%) participants in the liraglutide group compared with 263/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group had normoglycaemia. 
One trial used exenatide and 2/17 participants randomised to exenatide versus 1/16 participants randomised to placebo developed T2DM (very low‐quality evidence). This trial did not provide a definition of T2DM. One trial reported serious adverse events in 230/1524 (15.1%) participants in the liraglutide 3.0 mg arm versus 96/755 (12.7%) participants in the placebo arm (very low quality evidence). There were no serious adverse events in the trial using exenatide. Non‐fatal myocardial infarction was reported in 1/1524 participants in the liraglutide arm and in 0/55 participants in the placebo arm at 172 weeks (very low‐quality evidence). One trial reported congestive heart failure in 1/1524 participants in the liraglutide arm and in 1/755 participants in the placebo arm (very low‐quality evidence). Participants receiving liraglutide compared with placebo had a small mean improvement in the physical component of the 36‐item Short Form scale showing a difference of 0.87 points (95% CI 0.17 to 1.58; P = 0.02; 1 trial; 1791 participants; very low‐quality evidence). No trial evaluating GLP‐1‐analogues reported data on stroke, microvascular complications or socioeconomic effects. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no firm evidence that DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues compared mainly with placebo substantially influence the risk of T2DM and especially its associated complications in people at increased risk for the development of T2DM. Most trials did not investigate patient‐important outcomes. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Can New Drugs Stop or Delay Type 2 Diabetes?

### Rationale

Type 2 diabetes is a big health problem. It can cause many serious health issues. People can get it if their blood sugar is too high. This is called ""pre-diabetes."" We wanted to know if certain drugs could stop or delay type 2 diabetes. We also wanted to see if these drugs could stop other health problems that come with it.

The drugs we looked at are called DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues. These drugs help your body use sugar better. We hoped they might help people avoid getting type 2 diabetes.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies that were well-designed. These studies compared the new drugs to other treatments. Some people got the new drugs. Others got a sugar pill (placebo) or another medicine. Some people got no treatment.

The studies looked at people who had pre-diabetes. This means their blood sugar was a bit too high. They were at risk for getting type 2 diabetes. The studies lasted for at least 12 weeks. Some lasted much longer, up to over 3 years.

### Results

We looked at seven studies. Most people in these studies took a drug called liraglutide. This is a GLP-1 analogue.

One study looked at a DPP-4 inhibitor. It found no clear proof that this drug stopped type 2 diabetes. It also did not show a clear link to serious health issues.

Another study looked at liraglutide. It found that fewer people got type 2 diabetes with liraglutide. For every 100 people on liraglutide, about 2 got diabetes. For every 100 people on the sugar pill, about 6 got diabetes. This drug also helped more people get back to normal blood sugar levels.

However, after stopping the liraglutide drug, some people still got diabetes.

The studies did not give us strong proof about other serious health problems. These include heart attacks or strokes. There was also little information on how these drugs changed how people felt day to day.

In the end, we don't have strong proof that these drugs stop or delay type 2 diabetes. We also don't have strong proof that they stop other health problems that come with it. More studies are needed to understand this better. These studies should look at what matters most to patients.","Dipeptidyl‐peptidase (DPP)‐4 inhibitors and glucagon‐like peptide (GLP)‐1 analogues for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
Review question 
Are the glucose‐lowering medicines, DPP‐4 inhibitors (e.g. linagliptin or vildagliptin) and GLP‐1 analogues (e.g. exenatide or liraglutide) able to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes and its associated complications in people at risk for the development of type 2 diabetes? 
Background 
DPP‐4 inhibitors and GLP‐1 analogues are widely used to treat people with type 2 diabetes. People with moderately elevated blood glucose are said to be at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (often referred to as 'prediabetes'). It is currently not known whether DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues should be prescribed for people with raised blood glucose levels who do not have type 2 diabetes. We wanted to find out whether these medicines could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people at increased risk. We also wanted to know the effects on patient‐important outcomes such as complications of diabetes (e.g. kidney and eye disease, heart attacks, strokes), death from any cause, health‐related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health) and side effects of the medicines. 
Study characteristics 
Participants had to have blood glucose levels higher than considered normal, but below the glucose levels that are used to diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found seven randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 2702 participants. The duration of the treatments varied from 12 weeks to 160 weeks. One study investigating liraglutide dominated the evidence (2285/2702 participants). The participants in this study were overweight or obese. 
This evidence is up to date as of January 2017.
Key results 
DPP‐4 inhibitors did not reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with placebo (a dummy medicine). In the big study investigating the GLP‐1‐analogue liraglutide, given in a dose used for obese people (3.0 mg), the development of type 2 diabetes was delayed: 26/1472 (1.8%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 46/738 (6.2%) participants randomised to placebo developed type 2 diabetes after 160 weeks. On the other side, 970/1472 (66%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 268/738 (36%) participants randomised to placebo switched back to normal glucose levels. This study was extended for another 12 weeks without treatment and five additional participants developed diabetes in the liraglutide group, compared with one participant in the placebo group. After the 12 weeks without treatment, 740/1472 (50%) participants in the liraglutide group compared with 263/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group had glucose levels considered as normal. This means that to keep chances high to prevent type 2 diabetes in people at risk one probably needs to continuously take this drug. Of note, serious adverse events (e.g. defined as hospitalisation or a hazard putting the participant at risk, such as an interaction with another medicine) happened more often following liraglutide treatment (230/1524 (15%) participants in the liraglutide group and 96/755 (13%) participants in the placebo group) and it is unclear whether taking this drug is safe in the long term. 
We detected neither an advantage nor a disadvantage of DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues in relation to non‐fatal heart attacks, non‐fatal strokes or heart failure. Our included studies did not report on other complications of diabetes such as kidney or eye disease. The effects on health‐related quality of life were inconclusive. In the included studies, very few participants died and there was no apparent relation to treatment. 
Future studies should investigate more patient‐important outcomes like complications of diabetes and especially the side effects of the medications, because we do not know for sure whether 'prediabetes' is just a condition arbitrarily defined by a laboratory measurement, is in fact a real risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether treatment of this condition translates into better patient‐important outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
All included trials had deficiencies in the way they were conducted or how key items were reported. For the individual comparisons, the number of participants was small, resulting in a high risk of random errors (play of chance).

10.1002-14651858.CD013210.pub2,"Background
Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disease of the gut. About 75% of people with CD undergo surgery at least once in their lifetime to induce remission. However, as there is no known cure for the disease, patients usually experience a recurrence even after surgery. Different interventions are routinely used in maintaining postsurgical remission. There is currently no consensus on which treatment is the most effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and harms of interventions for the maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's disease and rank the treatments in order of effectiveness. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 January 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles, abstracts from major gastroenterology meetings, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. There was no restriction on language, date, or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different interventions used for maintaining surgically induced remission in people with CD who were in postsurgical remission. Participants had to have received maintenance treatment for at least three months. We excluded studies assessing enteral diet, diet manipulation, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplementation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by arbitration of a third review author when necessary. We conducted a network meta‐analysis (NMA) using a Bayesian approach through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. For the pairwise comparisons carried out in Review Manager 5, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the NMA, we presented hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) and reported ranking probabilities for each intervention. For the NMA, we focused on three main outcomes: clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Data were insufficient to assess time to relapse and histologic relapse. Adverse events and serious adverse events were not sufficiently or objectively reported to permit an NMA. We used CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta‐Analysis) methods to evaluate our confidence in the findings within networks, and GRADE for entire networks. 
Main results
We included 35 RCTs (3249 participants) in the review. The average age of study participants ranged between 33.6 and 38.8 years. Risk of bias was high in 18 studies, low in four studies, and unclear in 13 studies. Of the 35 included RCTs, 26 studies (2581 participants; 9 interventions) were considered eligible for inclusion in the NMA. The interventions studied included 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA), adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone. This resulted in 30 direct contrasts, which informed 102 mixed‐treatment contrasts. 
The evidence for the clinical relapse network (21 studies; 2245 participants) and endoscopic relapse (12 studies; 1128 participants) were of low certainty while the evidence for withdrawal due to adverse events (15 studies; 1498 participants) was of very low certainty. This assessment was due to high risk of bias in most of the studies, inconsistency, and imprecision across networks. We mainly judged individual contrasts as of low or very low certainty, except 5‐ASA versus placebo, the evidence for which was judged as of moderate certainty. 
We ranked the treatments based on effectiveness and the certainty of the evidence. For clinical relapse, the five most highly ranked treatments were adalimumab, infliximab, budesonide, 5‐ASA, and purine analogues. We found some evidence that adalimumab (HR 0.11, 95% Crl 0.02 to 0.33; low‐certainty evidence) and 5‐ASA may reduce the probability of clinical relapse compared to placebo (HR 0.69, 95% Crl 0.53 to 0.87; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse (HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.27 to 1.34; low‐certainty evidence). We are less confident about the effectiveness of infliximab (HR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.02 to 1.74; very low‐certainty evidence) and purine analogues (HR 0.75, 95% CrI 0.55 to 1.00; low‐certainty evidence). It was unclear whether the other interventions reduced the probability of a clinical relapse, as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing endoscopic relapse. Whilst there might be some evidence of prevention of endoscopic relapse with adalimumab (HR 0.10, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.32; low‐certainty evidence), no other intervention studied appeared to be effective. 
Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing withdrawal due to adverse events. Withdrawal due to adverse events appeared to be least likely with sulfasalazine (HR 1.96, 95% Crl 0.00 to 8.90; very low‐certainty evidence) and most likely with antibiotics (HR 53.92, 95% Crl 0.43 to 259.80; very low‐certainty evidence). When considering the network as a whole, two adverse events leading to study withdrawal (i.e. pancreatitis and leukopenia) occurred in more than 1% of participants treated with an intervention. Pancreatitis occurred in 2.8% (11/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.17% (2/1210) of all other groups studied. Leukopenia occurred in 2.5% (10/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.08% (1/1210) of all other groups studied. 
Authors' conclusions
Due to low‐certainty evidence in the networks, we are unable to draw conclusions on which treatment is most effective for preventing clinical relapse and endoscopic relapse. Evidence on the safety of the interventions was inconclusive, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia from purine analogues were evident in the studies. Larger trials are needed to further understand the effect of the interventions on endoscopic relapse. 
","## Stopping Crohn’s Disease from Coming Back After Surgery

### Rationale

Crohn's disease is a long-term problem with your gut. It can cause pain and other issues. Many people with Crohn's need surgery. This surgery helps them feel better for a while. But Crohn's disease often comes back. There is no cure right now.

Doctors use different medicines to keep the disease away. They want to know which one works best. This study looked at many treatments. It aimed to find out which ones were most helpful. We also wanted to see if any treatments caused problems.

Knowing this can help doctors choose the right medicine. It can help patients stay well longer. This study is important because many people suffer from Crohn's disease. Finding good treatments is key to their health.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. We searched many databases for information. These studies included people with Crohn's disease. They had surgery and felt better. Then they took a medicine to keep the disease away.

We only included studies that compared different treatments. The people in these studies took medicine for at least three months. We did not look at special diets or herbal cures.

We looked for studies that randomly assigned people to groups. This helps make the study fair. We wanted to see how well each treatment worked. We also looked at any side effects. Two experts checked all the information. If they disagreed, a third expert helped decide.

The studies we found included 3,249 people. Their age was around 33 to 38 years old. We looked at how often their Crohn's came back. We also checked if they stopped taking the medicine due to side effects.

### Results

We looked at 35 studies. These studies included many people with Crohn's disease. Their average age was about 33 to 38 years.

We found that some medicines might help. Adalimumab and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) might make Crohn's less likely to return. This is called clinical relapse. Adalimumab seemed to work very well. 5-ASA also showed good results.

We were less sure about other medicines. It was hard to say how well infliximab or purine analogues worked. This is because the studies had some problems. It was hard to be very confident in these results.

When we looked at the gut with a scope, adalimumab also seemed to help. This is called endoscopic relapse. Other treatments did not show clear benefits for this.

Some medicines caused more side effects. People taking antibiotics were more likely to stop treatment due to problems. Sulfasalazine seemed to have fewer side effects.

We found two main side effects with purine analogues. Some people got swelling in their pancreas. This is called pancreatitis. Others had low white blood cell counts. This is called leukopenia.

In general, it was hard to say for sure which treatment was best. Many of the studies were not very strong. More studies are needed to be sure. We need larger studies to learn more about how these medicines work. We also need to know more about their safety.","Interventions for maintaining surgically included remission in Crohn's disease
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out which drugs are most effective for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease who have undergone surgery to achieve remission. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. We examined these studies using a method known as network meta‐analysis (NMA) in order to compare and rank all the treatments in terms of clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse and safety. 
What was studied in the review? 
Crohn's disease is a chronic disease of the gut. It is known to change from periods when people experience a flare‐up of the disease (relapse) to periods of good health (remission). Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. People with Crohn's disease may undergo surgery to remove diseased parts of their gut and achieve remission. However, their symptoms return after a while. Different drugs can be given to ensure that people with Crohn's disease remain in remission for as long as possible. These drugs include mesalazine, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and adalimumab, amongst others. Whilst these drugs have been known to reduce inflammation (pain and swelling) in the gut, side effects can occur with their use. We attempted to find out which treatments are the safest and most effective for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease after surgery. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
We searched for studies published up to 15 January 2019.
What are the main results of the review? 
We included 35 relevant trials, which were published between 1976 and 2018. The studies included a total of 3249 participants who were mostly adults. Our NMA included 26 studies (2581 participants) and compared nine groups of treatments such as 5‐aminosalicylic acid, adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone, which are used in preventing relapse after surgery in people with Crohn's disease. Adalimumab may reduce the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo (dummy treatment). 5‐aminosalicylic acid probably reduces the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo. Budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse. The entire network evidence is of low certainty due to the small number of participants included in the studies and high risk of bias. This means that are confidence in these results is limited. Research to understand the effect of the treatments on endoscopic relapse and safety was limited, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia were reported in participants who received purine analogues. 
Key messages 
We uncertain about which treatments are most effective in preventing postoperative relapse in Crohn's disease. Alhough there is limited research on the harms (side effects) of these treatments, there were reported instances of pancreatitis and leukopenia in participants who received purine analogues.

Each year, in high‐income countries alone, approximately 100 million people develop scars. Excessive scarring can cause pruritus, pain, contractures, and cosmetic disfigurement, and can dramatically affect people's quality of life, both physically and psychologically. Hypertrophic scars are visible and elevated scars that do not spread into surrounding tissues and that often regress spontaneously. Silicone gel sheeting (SGS) is made from medical‐grade silicone reinforced with a silicone membrane backing and is one of the most commonly used treatments for hypertrophic scars. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of silicone gel sheeting for the treatment of hypertrophic scars in any care setting. 
Search methods
In April 2021 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with any hypertrophic scars and assessed the use of SGS. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, data extraction and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. We resolved initial disagreements by discussion, or by consulting a third review author when necessary. 
Main results
Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 10 to 60 participants. The trials were clinically heterogeneous with differences in duration of follow‐up, and scar site. We report 10 comparisons, SGS compared with no SGS treatment and SGS compared with the following treatments: pressure garments; silicone gel; topical onion extract; polyurethane; propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting; Kenalog injection; flashlamp‐pumped pulsed‐dye laser; intense pulsed light  and Gecko Nanoplast (a silicone gel bandage). Six trials had a split‐site design and three trials had an unclear design (resulting in a mix of paired and clustered data). 
Included studies reported limited outcome data for the primary review outcomes of severity of scarring measured by health professionals and adverse events (limited data reported by some included studies, but further analyses of these data was not possible) and no data were reported for severity of scarring reported by patients. For secondary outcomes some pain data were reported, but health‐related quality of life and cost effectiveness were not reported. Many trials had poorly‐reported methodology, meaning the risk of bias was unclear. We rated all evidence as being either of low or very low certainty, often because of imprecision resulting from few participants, low event rates, or both, all in single studies. 
SGS compared with no SGS 
Seven studies with 177 participants compared SGS with no SGS for hypertrophic scars. Two studies with 31 participants (32 scars) reported severity of scarring assessed by health professionals, and it is uncertain whether there is a difference in severity of scarring between the two groups (mean difference (MD) ‐1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.77 to 0.12; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and twice for serious imprecision). One study with 34 participants suggests SGS may result in a slight reduction in pain level compared with no SGS treatment (MD −1.26, 95% CI −2.26 to −0.26; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
SGS compared with pressure garments 
One study with 54 participants was included in this comparison. The study reported that SGS may reduce pain levels compared with pressure garments (MD −1.90, 95% CI −2.99 to −0.81;  low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
SGS compared with silicone gel 
One study with 32 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on severity of scarring assessed by health professionals compared with silicone gel (MD 0.40, 95% CI −0.88 to 1.68; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, twice for imprecision). 
SGS compared with topical onion extract 
One trial (32 participants) was included in this comparison. SGS may slightly reduce severity of scarring compared with topical onion extract (MD ‐1.30, 95% CI ‐2.58 to ‐0.02; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and once for imprecision). 
SGS compared with polyurethane 
One study with 60 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on the severity of scarring assessed by health professionals compared with polyurethane (MD 0.50, 95% CI ‐2.96 to 3.96; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and twice for imprecision). 
SGS compared with self‐adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting 
One study with 38 participants was included in this comparison. It is uncertain if SGS reduces pain compared with self‐adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting (MD −0.12, 95% CI −0.18 to −0.06). This is very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for imprecision and once for indirectness. 
SGS compared with Gecko Nanoplast 
One study with 60 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on pain compared with Gecko Nanoplast (MD 0.70, 95% CI  ‐0.28 to 1.68; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. 
There was a lack of reportable data from the other three comparisons of SGS with Kenalog injection, flashlamp‐pumped pulsed‐dye laser or intense pulsed light. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently limited rigorous RCT evidence available about the clinical effectiveness of SGS in the treatment of hypertrophic scars. None of the included studies provided evidence on severity of scarring validated by participants, health‐related quality of life, or cost effectiveness. Reporting was poor, to the extent that we are not confident that most trials are free from risk of bias. The limitations in current RCT evidence suggest that further trials are required to reduce uncertainty around decision‐making in the use of SGS to treat hypertrophic scars. 
","Here's a Plain Language Summary of the abstract:

**1. Plain Title: How Silicone Gel Sheets Help with Raised Scars**

**2. Rationale**

Many people get scars each year. These scars can itch or hurt. They can also limit how you move. Scars can make people feel bad about how they look. This can be hard on their daily life.

Some scars are called hypertrophic scars. These scars are raised on the skin. They do not spread to other skin areas. These scars can sometimes get better on their own.

Silicone gel sheeting, or SGS, is a common way to treat these scars. SGS is a soft sheet made of medical silicone. It has a special backing. Doctors use it a lot for raised scars.

This study wanted to learn more about SGS. We wanted to see how well it works. We also wanted to see how it compares to other scar treatments. We need to know if SGS can truly help people with raised scars.

**3. Trial Design**

This study looked at other studies. We searched for studies about silicone gel sheets. These studies needed to be good quality trials. They needed to compare SGS to no treatment or other treatments.

The studies we picked included people of all ages. They all had raised scars. We looked at how well SGS worked in different places, like hospitals or clinics. We did not care about the language of the study. We also did not care when the study was done.

Two people checked each study very carefully. They made sure the studies were fair. They also pulled out all the important facts. If they did not agree, a third person helped them.

**4. Results**

We found 13 studies that fit our rules. These studies had a small number of people. Some had as few as 10 people. Others had up to 60 people. The studies looked at different parts of the body. They also followed people for different lengths of time.

Many studies did not give enough clear facts. They did not always say how much the scars improved. They also did not always report bad effects. No studies asked patients how their scars felt.

Here is what we learned from some comparisons:

*   **SGS versus no treatment:** Seven studies looked at SGS compared to no treatment. It is not clear if SGS makes a big difference in how scars look. However, one study showed SGS might make pain a little less.
*   **SGS versus pressure garments:** One study showed SGS might lessen pain more than pressure garments. Pressure garments are tight clothes or wraps.
*   **SGS versus silicone gel:** One study looked at SGS compared to silicone gel. We are not sure if SGS works better to change how scars look.
*   **SGS versus onion extract:** One study found SGS might make scars look a little better than onion extract. Onion extract is a cream from onions.
*   **SGS versus polyurethane:** One study looked at SGS compared to polyurethane. It is not clear if SGS makes scars look better. Polyurethane is a type of dressing.
*   **SGS versus other sheets:** One study looked at SGS compared to special sticky sheets. We are not sure if SGS makes pain less than these other sheets.
*   **SGS versus Gecko Nanoplast:** One study compared SGS to Gecko Nanoplast. This is a type of silicone gel bandage. It is not clear if SGS helps pain more.

Some studies did not have enough facts to compare SGS with other treatments. These treatments included special shots or laser light.

In the end, there is not a lot of strong proof. It is hard to say for sure how well SGS works. The studies often had very few people. They did not always report details well. We need more and better studies. This will help doctors and patients decide if SGS is the best choice for raised scars.","Silicone gel sheeting for treating hypertrophic scars
Background 
A scar is a mark left on the skin after a wound or injury has healed, for example, after surgery or after a burn. Most scars will fade and become paler over time, but some scars may become red and raised (called hypertrophic scars). Hypertrophic scars may take several years to flatten and fade. 
Scars can be itchy, painful or unsightly, and may restrict movement. Scarring can affect people physically and emotionally, and can affect a person's well‐being. 
Treatments aim to improve a scar’s appearance and help to make it less visible. They include: wearing clothing that fits tightly around the skin (pressure garments); treatments applied to the scar; laser therapy and silicone gel sheets. 
Silicone gel sheets are soft wound dressings containing an elastic form of silicone. They have a soft, rubbery texture and stick to the skin. They are commonly used on healing skin to help soften and flatten a hypertrophic scar. 
What did we want to find out? 
In this Cochrane Review, we wanted to find out how well silicone gel sheets worked in treating hypertrophic scars. 
Our methods 
We searched for studies that investigated the use of silicone gel sheets to treat hypertrophic scars. We searched for randomised controlled trials only, in which the treatment each person receives is chosen at random. These studies give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
What we found 
We found 13 studies with 468 people (425 of them completed the study) with hypertrophic scars caused by surgery, injury, burns or scalding. The studies compared the effects of silicone gel sheets with: giving no treatment with silicone gel sheets; wearing pressure garments; applying silicone gel or onion extract; polyurethane dressings; steroid injections;  laser therapy; intense pulsed light or Gecko Nanoplast (a silicone gel bandage). 
All studies were conducted in hospitals, in Europe (6 studies), China (2), the USA (1), Canada (1), Iran (1), Turkey (1) and India (1). They lasted for different lengths of time: from 3 months to 12 months. 
Four studies reported assessments of scars by healthcare professionals in way that was usable for this review. No studies reported useful results for the person's own assessment of their scar after treatment. 
No studies reported useful results for people's well‐being (quality of life): for whether people stayed on the treatment (adherence), whether the treatments had any unwanted effects; or whether the treatments were cost‐effective (the benefits of treatment outweighed any extra costs). 
The studies did not give enough information to compare silicone gel sheets with steroid injections, laser therapy or pulsed light. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Silicone gel sheets may slightly improve the appearance of hypertrophic scars compared with onion extract.  We are uncertain whether silicone gel sheets improve a scar's appearance better than no treatment with silicone gel sheets, or silicone gel, or polyurethane.  
Silicone gel sheets may reduce pain levels compared with pressure garments. Silicone gel sheets may also result in a slight reduction in pain levels compared with no treatment with silicone gel sheets. We are uncertain whether silicone gel sheets decrease pain compared with self‐adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting.  The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of silicone gel sheets on pain compared with Gecko Nanoplast. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence was low, or very low. The evidence we found comes from a few studies (sometimes only one), often in small numbers of people, with poorly reported results, so we are not sure how reliable the results are. We therefore think our conclusions would be likely to change if results from further studies become available. 
Conclusions 
We are uncertain about whether silicone gel sheets work better than most other treatments for hypertrophic scars. Silicone gel sheets may improve the appearance of scars slightly compared with applying onion extract, and may reduce pain compared with no treatment with silicone gel sheets or pressure garments.

10.1002-14651858.CD013826.pub2,"Background
Aerosols and spatter are generated in a dental clinic during aerosol‐generating procedures (AGPs) that use high‐speed hand pieces. Dental healthcare providers can be at increased risk of transmission of diseases such as tuberculosis, measles and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) through droplets on mucosae, inhalation of aerosols or through fomites on mucosae, which harbour micro‐organisms. There are ways to mitigate and contain spatter and aerosols that may, in turn, reduce any risk of disease transmission. In addition to personal protective equipment (PPE) and aerosol‐reducing devices such as high‐volume suction, it has been hypothesised that the use of mouth rinse by patients before dental procedures could reduce the microbial load of aerosols that are generated during dental AGPs. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of preprocedural mouth rinses used in dental clinics to minimise incidence of infection in dental healthcare providers and reduce or neutralise contamination in aerosols. 
Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 4 February 2022. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials and excluded laboratory‐based studies. Study participants were dental patients undergoing AGPs. Studies compared any preprocedural mouth rinse used to reduce contaminated aerosols versus placebo, no mouth rinse or another mouth rinse. Our primary outcome was incidence of infection of dental healthcare providers and secondary outcomes were reduction in the level of contamination of the dental operatory environment, cost, change in mouth microbiota, adverse events, and acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened search results, extracted data from included studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and judged the certainty of the available evidence. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect estimate for continuous outcomes, and random‐effects meta‐analysis to combine data  
Main results
 We included 17 studies with 830 participants aged 18 to 70 years. We judged three trials at high risk of bias, two at low risk and 12 at unclear risk of bias.  
None of the studies measured our primary outcome of the incidence of infection in dental healthcare providers.  
The primary outcome in the studies was reduction in the level of bacterial contamination measured in colony‐forming units (CFUs) at distances of less than 2 m (intended to capture larger droplets) and 2 m or more (to capture droplet nuclei from aerosols arising from the participant's oral cavity). It is unclear what size of CFU reduction represents a clinically significant amount. 
There is low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence that chlorhexidine (CHX) may reduce bacterial contamination, as measured by CFUs, compared with no rinsing or rinsing with water. There were similar results when comparing cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) with no rinsing and when comparing CPC, essential oils/herbal mouthwashes or boric acid with water. There is very low‐certainty evidence that tempered mouth rinses may provide a greater reduction in CFUs than cold mouth rinses. There is low‐certainty evidence that CHX may reduce CFUs more than essential oils/herbal mouthwashes. The evidence for other head‐to‐head comparisons was limited and inconsistent.  
The studies did not provide any information on costs, change in micro‐organisms in the patient's mouth or adverse events such as temporary discolouration, altered taste, allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. The studies did not assess acceptability of the intervention to patients or feasibility of implementation for dentists.  
Authors' conclusions
None of the included studies measured the incidence of infection among dental healthcare providers. The studies measured only reduction in level of bacterial contamination in aerosols. None of the studies evaluated viral or fungal contamination. We have only low to very low certainty for all findings. We are unable to draw conclusions regarding whether there is a role for preprocedural mouth rinses in reducing infection risk or the possible superiority of one preprocedural rinse over another. Studies are needed that measure the effect of rinses on infectious disease risk among dental healthcare providers and on contaminated aerosols at larger distances with standardised outcome measurement. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary based on the provided abstract:

## Plain Title
Can Mouth Rinses Before Dental Work Help Keep Dentists Safe and Clean the Air?

## Rationale
Going to the dentist can sometimes make tiny drops of spit and spray fly into the air. This happens when dentists use fast tools. These drops can carry germs that cause sickness. Dentists and their helpers might get sick from these germs. They can get sick from breathing them in or from touching surfaces. Some sicknesses they could get include things like the flu or other infections.

To keep everyone safe, dentists wear masks and use strong vacuums. Some people think that if patients rinse their mouths before dental work, it might kill some germs. This could mean fewer germs in the air. This study wanted to see if mouth rinses really help lower the risk of infection for dental staff. They also wanted to see if rinses help clean the air.

## Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies that had already been done. It only included studies that compared a mouth rinse to no rinse, water, or another rinse. These studies were ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. This helps make the study fair.

The patients in these studies were people having dental work. They were all adults, mostly between 18 and 70 years old. They had procedures that create a lot of spray. The study looked to see if dentists got fewer infections. It also looked at how much germy stuff was in the air around the dentist's chair. This study did not involve people directly. It reviewed other studies to gather information.

## Results
The study looked at 17 different studies. These studies included 830 people. However, none of these studies actually checked if dentists got sick more or less often. This was the main thing this study wanted to find out.

What the studies did measure was how many germs were in the air. They counted ""colony-forming units,"" which is a way to measure germs. Some studies showed that certain mouth rinses might lower the number of germs. For example, a rinse called chlorhexidine (CHX) might reduce germs more than not rinsing or rinsing with water. Another rinse called cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) also showed similar results. Some studies also suggested that warm rinses might work better than cold ones.

However, the evidence for these findings was not very strong. The studies did not tell us if this drop in germs was a big enough change to actually matter for health. They also did not talk about costs, changes in mouth germs, or bad effects like weird tastes or allergies. We also do not know if patients liked the rinses or if dentists found them easy to use.

Because of this, we cannot say for sure if mouth rinses really stop infections. We also cannot say if one rinse is better than another. More studies are needed. These new studies should actually measure if dentists get sick. They should also measure germs further away from the patient.","Does use of mouth rinse before a dental procedure reduce the risk of infection transmission from patient to health professional? 
Why is this question important? 
Many dental procedures generate droplets that settle on a surface quickly. If high‐speed instruments, such as a drill, are used, aerosols are generated, which consist of tiny particles that remain suspended in the air and that can be inhaled or that settle farther away on surfaces. These aerosols contain a variety of micro‐organisms and may transmit infections either through direct contact or indirectly through the contaminated surfaces. To prevent the spread of infection, it may help to reduce the number of micro‐organisms that are present in these aerosols. The use of mouth rinses before a dental procedure ('preprocedural mouth rinse') has been suggested as a possible way to reduce the amount of contamination of these aerosols. Chlorhexidine, povidone iodine and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) are some of the commonly used mouth rinses. They act by killing or inactivating the micro‐organisms in the mouth and thereby reducing the level of contamination in the aerosol that is generated. We wanted to find out whether rinsing the mouth before a dental procedure reduces the contamination of aerosols produced during dental procedures in practice and helps prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
We searched for all relevant studies that compared mouth rinses used before dental procedures against placebo (fake treatment), no intervention or another mouth rinse considered to be inactive. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed our confidence in the evidence. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find? 
We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies used chlorhexidine, CPC, essential oil/herbal mouth rinses, povidone iodine and boric acid in comparison to no rinsing, or rinsing with water, saline (salt water) or another mouth rinse. None of the studies measured the how often dental healthcare providers became infected with micro‐organisms. All the included studies measured the level of bacterial contamination in droplets or aerosols in the dental clinic. They did not examine contamination with viruses or fungi.  
Most rinses decreased bacterial contamination in aerosols to some extent, but there was considerable variation in the effects and we do not know what size of reduction is necessary to reduce infection risk.  
The studies did not provide any information on costs, change in micro‐organisms in the patient's mouth or side effects such as temporary discolouration, altered taste, allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. The studies did not assess whether patients were happy to use a mouth rinse or whether it was easy for dentists to implement.  
Overall, the results suggest that using a preprocedural mouth rinse may reduce the level of bacterial contamination in aerosols compared with no rinsing or rinsing with water, but we have only low or very low certainty that the evidence is reliable and we do not know how this reduction in contamination relates to the risk of infection. 
What does this mean? 
We have very little confidence in the evidence, and further studies may change the findings of our review. No studies measured infection risk or investigated viral or fungal contamination.  
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to February 2022.

10.1002-14651858.CD013305.pub2,"Background
Behavioural activation is a brief psychotherapeutic approach that seeks to change the way a person interacts with their environment. Behavioural activation is increasingly receiving attention as a potentially cost‐effective intervention for depression, which may require less resources and may be easier to deliver and implement than other types of psychotherapy. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with other psychological therapies for depression in adults. 
To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with medication for depression in adults. 
To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with treatment as usual/waiting list/placebo no treatment for depression in adults. 
Search methods
We searched CCMD‐CTR (all available years), CENTRAL (current issue), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 onwards), Ovid EMBASE (1980 onwards), and Ovid PsycINFO (1806 onwards) on the 17 January 2020 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 'behavioural activation', or the main elements of behavioural activation for depression in participants with clinically diagnosed depression or subthreshold depression. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language or publication status to the searches. We searched international trials registries via the World Health Organization's trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural activation for the treatment of depression or symptoms of depression in adults aged 18 or over. We excluded RCTs conducted in inpatient settings and with trial participants selected because of a physical comorbidity. Studies were included regardless of reported outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened all titles/abstracts and full‐text manuscripts for inclusion. Data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments were also performed by two review authors in duplicate. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for more information. 
Main results
Fifty‐three studies with 5495 participants were included; 51 parallel group RCTs and two cluster‐RCTs. 
We found moderate‐certainty evidence that behavioural activation had greater short‐term efficacy than treatment as usual (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 1.78; 7 RCTs, 1533 participants), although this difference was no longer evident in sensitivity analyses using a worst‐case or intention‐to‐treat scenario. Compared with waiting list, behavioural activation may be more effective, but there were fewer data in this comparison and evidence was of low certainty (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.90 to 5.09; 1 RCT, 26 participants). No evidence on treatment efficacy was available for behavioural activation versus placebo and behavioural activation versus no treatment. 
We found moderate‐certainty evidence suggesting no evidence of a difference in short‐term treatment efficacy between behavioural activation and CBT (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.07; 5 RCTs, 601 participants). Fewer data were available for other comparators. No evidence of a difference in short term‐efficacy was found between behavioural activation and third‐wave CBT (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.33; 2 RCTs, 98 participants; low certainty), and psychodynamic therapy (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.99; 1 RCT,60 participants; very low certainty). Behavioural activation was more effective than humanistic therapy (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.95; 2 RCTs, 46 participants; low certainty) and medication (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.76; 1 RCT; 141 participants; moderate certainty), but both of these results were based on a small number of trials and participants. No evidence on treatment efficacy was available for comparisons between behavioural activation versus interpersonal, cognitive analytic, and integrative therapies. 
There was moderate‐certainty evidence that behavioural activation might have lower treatment acceptability (based on dropout rate) than treatment as usual in the short term, although the data did not confirm a difference and results lacked precision (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.31; 14 RCTs, 2518 participants). Moderate‐certainty evidence did not suggest any difference in short‐term acceptability between behavioural activation and waiting list (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.93; 8 RCTs. 359 participants), no treatment (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.09; 3 RCTs, 187 participants), medication (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.16; 2 RCTs, 243 participants), or placebo (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.67; 1 RCT; 96 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No evidence on treatment acceptability was available comparing behavioural activation versus psychodynamic therapy. 
Low‐certainty evidence did not show a difference in short‐term treatment acceptability (dropout rate) between behavioural activation and CBT (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.25; 12 RCTs, 1195 participants), third‐wave CBT (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.10; 3 RCTs, 147 participants); humanistic therapy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.20 to 5.55; 2 RCTs, 96 participants) (very low certainty), and interpersonal, cognitive analytic, and integrative therapy (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.20; 4 RCTs, 123 participants). 
Results from medium‐ and long‐term primary outcomes, secondary outcomes, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses are summarised in the text. 
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review suggests that behavioural activation may be more effective than humanistic therapy, medication, and treatment as usual, and that it may be no less effective than CBT, psychodynamic therapy, or being placed on a waiting list. However, our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. 
We found no evidence of a difference in short‐term treatment acceptability (based on dropouts) between behavioural activation and most comparison groups (CBT, humanistic therapy, waiting list, placebo, medication, no treatment or treatment as usual). Again, our confidence in all these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. 
No data were available about the efficacy of behavioural activation compared with placebo, or about treatment acceptability comparing behavioural activation and psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal, cognitive analytic and integrative therapies. 
The evidence could be strengthened by better reporting and better quality RCTs of behavioural activation and by assessing working mechanisms of behavioural activation. 
","## Plain Title: How a Simple Therapy Helps People with Sadness

### Rationale

Many people feel very sad. This sadness is called depression. It can make life hard. It can stop people from doing things they enjoy. This is a big problem for many.

One way to help is called behavioral activation. It is a talk therapy. It helps people change how they act. It teaches them to do more fun things. This can help them feel better.

We wanted to see if this therapy works well. We also wanted to know if it is easy to use. This study helps us learn if it is a good choice for people.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. We gathered information from 53 past studies. These studies included 5495 adults. All of them were 18 or older. They all had signs of depression.

These studies were randomized. This means people were put into groups by chance. Some got behavioral activation. Others got different treatments. These could be other talk therapies or medicine. Some groups got no treatment.

We looked at how well behavioral activation worked. We also checked if people liked the treatment. We focused on short-term results. This means we looked at how people felt soon after treatment.

### Results

Behavioral activation made people feel better. It worked better than getting no treatment. It also worked better than just waiting. This was true in the short term.

It worked as well as other talk therapies. For example, it was as good as CBT. CBT is another well-known therapy. It also worked as well as some other types of talk therapy.

Behavioral activation was also better than medicine. This was seen in one study. This is good news for many people.

People generally stayed in behavioral activation. They liked it as much as other treatments. This included other therapies and medicine. It also included waiting lists.

This means behavioral activation is a good choice. It can help many people with depression. It may be a simple way to feel better. More studies will make us even more sure.","Behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults
Review question 
In this Cochrane review, we wanted to find out how well behavioural activation therapy works for depression in adults. 
Why this is important 
Depression is a common mental health problem that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in people, activities, and things that were once enjoyable. A person with depression may feel tearful, irritable, or tired most of the time, and may have problems with sleep, concentration, and memory. These and other symptoms can make daily life more difficult than usual. 
Treatments for depression include medications (antidepressants) and psychological therapies (talking therapies). Behavioural activation is a type of psychological therapy that encourages a person to develop or get back into activities which are meaningful to them. The therapy involved scheduling activities and monitoring behaviours and looking at specific situations where changing these behaviours and activities may be helpful. A therapist may support people in person, over the phone, or online, usually over multiple sessions. 
It is important to know whether behavioural activation could be an effective and acceptable treatment to offer to people with depression. 
What we did 
In January 2020, we searched for studies of behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults (aged over 18 years). We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which treatments were given to study participants at random; these studies give the most reliable evidence. 
We included 53 studies involving 5495 participants. The studies compared behavioural activation with no treatment, standard or usual care, a dummy treatment (placebo), taking medications, being on a waiting list for treatment, or other psychotherapies (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), third‐wave CBT, humanistic therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and integrative therapy). 
The studies were conducted in 14 countries; most were conducted in the USA (27 studies). Most studies lasted from four to 16 weeks. 
The outcomes we focussed on were how well the treatments worked and whether they were acceptable to participants. How well treatments worked (efficacy) was measured by the number of people who responded well to treatment or no longer met criteria for depression at the end of treatment. Acceptability was measured by counting how many people dropped out during the study. 
What did we find? 
Behavioural activation may treat depression better than receiving usual care. We were uncertain whether behavioural activation worked better than medication or being on a waiting list, and we found no evidence for this outcome comparing behavioural activation to no treatment or placebo treatment. 
We found no differences between behavioural activation and CBT in treating depression. Although we did not find enough evidence to compare behavioural activation reliably with other psychotherapies, it may work better than humanistic therapy, and we found no differences between behavioural activation and third‐wave CBT or psychodynamic therapy. No evidence was available comparing behavioural activation to integrative therapies. 
Behavioural activation is probably less acceptable to people than usual care. We found no differences in acceptability of behavioural activation compared with being on a waiting list, no treatment, taking antidepressants, or receiving a placebo treatment. We also found no differences in acceptability between behavioural activation and other psychotherapies studied (CBT, third‐wave CBT, humanistic therapy, integrative therapies). For behavioural activation compared with psychodynamic therapy, we found no evidence on treatment acceptability. 
Conclusions 
Behavioural activation may be an effective and acceptable treatment for depression in adults. Offering this therapy in practice would give people with depression greater treatment choice, and different formats and types of delivery could be explored to meet the demand for mental health support. Our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. 
Most findings were short‐term, meaning that we cannot be sure behavioural activation would be helpful to people with depression in the longer term. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence is mostly low to moderate. Some findings are based on only a few studies, with poorly reported results, in which the participants knew which treatment they received. Therefore, we are not sure how reliable the results are. Our conclusions may change if more studies are conducted.

10.1002-14651858.CD013674.pub2,"Background
Major depressive disorders have a significant impact on children and adolescents, including on educational and vocational outcomes, interpersonal relationships, and physical and mental health and well‐being. There is an association between major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. Antidepressant medication is used in moderate to severe depression; there is now a range of newer generations of these medications. 
Objectives
To investigate, via network meta‐analysis (NMA), the comparative effectiveness and safety of different newer generation antidepressants in children and adolescents with a diagnosed major depressive disorder (MDD) in terms of depression, functioning, suicide‐related outcomes and other adverse outcomes. The impact of age, treatment duration, baseline severity, and pharmaceutical industry funding was investigated on clinician‐rated depression (CDRS‐R) and suicide‐related outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR)), together with Ovid Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO till March 2020. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of six to 18 year olds of either sex and any ethnicity with clinically diagnosed major depressive disorder were included. Trials that compared the effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants with each other or with a placebo were included. Newer generation antidepressants included: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors; norepinephrine dopamine disinhibitors (NDDIs); and tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs). 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We analysed dichotomous data as Odds Ratios (ORs), and continuous data as Mean Difference (MD) for the following outcomes: depression symptom severity (clinician rated), response or remission of depression symptoms, depression symptom severity (self‐rated), functioning, suicide related outcomes and overall adverse outcomes. Random‐effects network meta‐analyses were conducted in a frequentist framework using multivariate meta‐analysis. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Confidence in Network Meta‐analysis (CINeMA). We used ""informative statements"" to standardise the interpretation and description of the results. 
Main results
Twenty‐six studies were included. There were no data for the two primary outcomes (depressive disorder established via clinical diagnostic interview and suicide), therefore, the results comprise only secondary outcomes. Most antidepressants may be associated with a ""small and unimportant"" reduction in depression symptoms on the CDRS‐R scale (range 17 to 113) compared with placebo (high certainty evidence: paroxetine: MD ‐1.43, 95% CI ‐3.90, 1.04; vilazodone: MD ‐0.84, 95% CI ‐3.03, 1.35; desvenlafaxine MD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐3.51, 3.36; moderate certainty evidence: sertraline: MD ‐3.51, 95% CI ‐6.99, ‐0.04; fluoxetine: MD ‐2.84, 95% CI ‐4.12, ‐1.56; escitalopram: MD ‐2.62, 95% CI ‐5.29, 0.04; low certainty evidence: duloxetine: MD ‐2.70, 95% CI ‐5.03, ‐0.37; vortioxetine: MD 0.60, 95% CI ‐2.52, 3.72; very low certainty evidence for comparisons between other antidepressants and placebo). 
There were ""small and unimportant"" differences between most antidepressants in reduction of depression symptoms (high‐ or moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Results were similar across other outcomes of benefit.
In most studies risk of self‐harm or suicide was an exclusion criterion for the study. Proportions of suicide‐related outcomes were low for most included studies and 95% confidence intervals were wide for all comparisons. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of mirtazapine (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.03, 8.04), duloxetine (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.72, 1.82), vilazodone (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.68, 1.48), desvenlafaxine (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.59, 1.52), citalopram (OR 1.72, 95% CI 0.76, 3.87) or vortioxetine (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.29, 8.60) on suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo. There is low certainty evidence that escitalopram may ""at least slightly"" reduce odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.43, 1.84). There is low certainty evidence that fluoxetine (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87, 1.86), paroxetine (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.85, 3.86), sertraline (OR 3.03, 95% CI 0.60, 15.22), and venlafaxine (OR 13.84, 95% CI 1.79, 106.90) may ""at least slightly"" increase odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo. 
There is moderate certainty evidence that venlafaxine probably results in an ""at least slightly"" increased odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with desvenlafaxine (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01, 0.56) and escitalopram (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01, 0.56). There was very low certainty evidence regarding other comparisons between antidepressants. 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, methodological shortcomings of the randomised trials make it difficult to interpret the findings with regard to the efficacy and safety of newer antidepressant medications. Findings suggest that most newer antidepressants may reduce depression symptoms in a small and unimportant way compared with placebo. Furthermore, there are likely to be small and unimportant differences in the reduction of depression symptoms between the majority of antidepressants. However, our findings reflect the average effects of the antidepressants, and given depression is a heterogeneous condition, some individuals may experience a greater response. Guideline developers and others making recommendations might therefore consider whether a recommendation for the use of newer generation antidepressants is warranted for some individuals in some circumstances. Our findings suggest sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine, as well as fluoxetine (which is currently the only treatment recommended for first‐line prescribing) could be considered as a first option. 
Children and adolescents considered at risk of suicide were frequently excluded from trials, so that we cannot be confident about the effects of these medications for these individuals. If an antidepressant is being considered for an individual, this should be done in consultation with the child/adolescent and their family/caregivers and it remains critical to ensure close monitoring of treatment effects and suicide‐related outcomes (combined suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) in those treated with newer generation antidepressants, given findings that some of these medications may be associated with greater odds of these events. Consideration of psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy, as per guideline recommendations, remains important. 
","## New Meds for Kids with Depression: Do They Help?

### Rationale

Being sad all the time is a big problem for kids and teens. It can hurt their schoolwork, friendships, and overall health. Some kids with serious sadness might even think about hurting themselves. Doctors sometimes give medicine called antidepressants for severe sadness. There are many new types of these medicines.

This study wanted to see how well these new medicines work. We also wanted to see how safe they are for kids. We looked at how they impact sadness, daily life, and thoughts about suicide. We hoped to learn which ones are best.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. These studies included kids and teens from 6 to 18 years old. Both boys and girls took part. All of them had been diagnosed with major depression. The studies compared new antidepressants to each other. Some studies also compared them to a sugar pill (placebo).

The medicines included different types of antidepressants. Some examples are SSRIs and SNRIs. These names refer to how the medicines work in the brain. We wanted to see how these medicines changed sadness. We also looked at how they affected daily function and safety.

### Results

We looked at 26 studies. We found that most of the new antidepressants might reduce sadness. But the change was often very small. It might not be a big help for most kids. For example, some common medicines like fluoxetine and sertraline showed a small benefit.

The study found small differences between most of the medicines. This means one medicine was not much better than another for sadness. This was true for other good effects too.

Some studies did not include kids who were thinking about suicide. This makes it hard to know about suicide risks with these medicines. The numbers for suicide-related events were low. It was hard to be sure about the effects of most medicines on suicide thoughts or attempts.

For some medicines, like venlafaxine, there was a higher chance of suicide-related events. This was compared to other medicines or the sugar pill. But the evidence was not strong for many other medicines.

The studies had some problems. It was hard to know for sure how well and safe these medicines are. Most new antidepressants may give only a small benefit for sadness. There may also be small differences between the medicines themselves.

But depression affects each person differently. Some kids might feel much better with these medicines. Doctors should think about if these medicines are right for each child. They should also consider medicines like sertraline or fluoxetine as a first choice.

It is very important to talk with the child and their family. If a child takes an antidepressant, they need close watch. Doctors and parents must check for any thoughts of suicide. Talking to a therapist, like with CBT, is also very important.","Newer generation antidepressants for depression in children and adolescents: a network meta‐analysis 
How well do newer formulations of antidepressants work for children and adolescents with clinical depression? 
Children and adolescents (6 to 18 years) with depression (also called ‘major depressive disorder’) experience a range of negative impacts in all areas of their lives and have an increased risk of suicide, suicidal thinking and suicide attempts. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression, but can also increase the risk of suicide‐related outcomes. 
Who will be interested in this research? 
The research in this Cochrane Review will interest:
‐ people who decide policy, and influence decisions about the prescription of antidepressant medicines to children and adolescents; 
‐ people who prescribe these medicines to children and adolescents;
‐ children and adolescents with depression; and
‐ those who support and care for them (including their parents and caregivers and clinicians who provide treatment). 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how well newer formulations (called ‘new generation’) antidepressants work to improve depression in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years. New generation antidepressants are those that have been developed recently. They are sometimes referred to as ‘second‐‘ and ‘third‐generation’ antidepressants; they do not include older formulations (tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors). 
We wanted to know how these antidepressants affect:
‐ symptoms of depression;
‐ recovery: no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder;
‐ response or remission: scores on a scale indicating an important reduction in depression or no longer experiencing depression; 
‐ ability to function in daily life;
‐ suicide‐related outcomes; and
‐ whether they cause any unwanted effects in children and adolescents.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that tested new generation antidepressants on children or adolescents (or both) who had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. We identified 26 such studies. We then assessed the trustworthiness of those studies, and synthesized the findings across the studies. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
Most newer antidepressants probably reduce depression symptoms better than a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain any medicine but looks identical to the medicine being tested). However, the reduction is small and may not be experienced as important by children and adolescents, their parents and caregivers, or clinicians. When different medications are compared against each other, there may be only small and unimportant differences between most of them for the reduction of symptoms. 
Our findings reflect what happens on average to individuals, but some individuals may experience a greater response. This might lead to recommendations being made for the use of antidepressants for some individuals in some circumstances. Our findings suggest that sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine and fluoxetine can be used if medication is being considered. 
The impact of medication on depression symptoms should be closely monitored by those prescribing the medication, especially as suicide‐related thinking and behaviour may be increased in those taking these medications. Close monitoring of suicide‐related behaviours is vital in those treated with new generation antidepressants. 
What should happen next? 
The studies that provided this evidence largely excluded children and adolescents who: 
‐ were already thinking about suicide and wanting to take their own lives (i.e. had suicidal ideation); 
‐ were self‐harming;
‐ had other mental health conditions; and
‐ had psychosocial difficulties.
Future research should aim to understand the impacts of these medicines in children and adolescents with these problems, who are more typical of those who request clinical services.

10.1002-14651858.CD013256.pub2,"Background
Medications used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have significantly improved patient outcomes and delayed time to surgery. However, some of these therapies are recognized to increase the general risk of infection and have an unclear impact on postoperative infection risk. 
Objectives
To assess the impact of IBD medications on postoperative infection risk within 30 days of surgery. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane IBD Groups Specialized Register (29 October 2019), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2019), EMBASE (January 1985 to October 2019), the Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception up to October 2019 and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials, quasi‐randomized controlled trials, non‐randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies, case‐control studies and cross‐sectional studies comparing patients treated with an IBD medication preoperatively or within 30 days postoperatively to patients who were not taking that medication. Manuscripts and abstracts were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts and extracted data. The primary outcome was postoperative infection within 30 days of surgery. Secondary outcomes included incisional infections and wound dehiscence, intra‐abdominal infectious complications and extra‐abdominal infections. Three authors assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle‐Ottawa scale. We contacted authors for additional information when data were missing. For the primary and secondary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using the generic inverse variance method. When applicable, we analyzed adjusted and unadjusted data separately. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. 
Main results
Sixty‐eight non‐randomized studies were included. Twenty‐four studies had low risk of bias while the remaining had very high risk. Based on pooling of adjusted data, overall infectious complications were increased in patients who received anti‐TNF agents (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.13; very low certainty evidence) and corticosteroids (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.38 to 2.09; low certainty evidence). Use of 5‐ASA (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.14; very low certainty evidence), immunomodulators (OR 1.29; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.76; low certainty evidence) and anti‐integrin agents (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.36; low certainty evidence) had no impact on overall infectious complications. No difference in the odds of wound‐related complications was seen in patients using corticosteroids, 5‐ASA, immunomodulators, anti‐TNF or anti‐integrin agents when compared to controls. Both corticosteroids and anti‐TNF agents increased odds of intra‐abdominal infection (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.28 to 1.84; very low certainty evidence and OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.82; very low certainty evidence, respectively) whereas no impact was observed with 5‐ASA, immunomodulators or anti‐integrin agents. The rate of extra‐abdominal infections was not affected by corticosteroids, immunomodulators, anti‐TNF or anti‐integrin agents. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence regarding corticosteroids, 5ASA, immunomodulators, anti‐TNF mediations and anti‐integrin medications was low or very low in certainty. Thus, the impact of these medications on postoperative infectious complications is uncertain and no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding their safety in the perioperative period. Decisions regarding preoperative IBD medications should be tailored to each patient’s unique circumstances. Future studies should focus on controlling for potential confounding factors to generate higher quality evidence. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study:

### **Can IBD Medicine Cause More Infections After Surgery?**

**Rationale**

Inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, causes a lot of pain. It can make your gut swell. People with IBD often need surgery. Many drugs help people with IBD feel better. These drugs also help delay surgery.

But these drugs can make you sick in other ways. They might make it easier to get infections. We do not know if these drugs cause more infections after surgery. This study looks at if these drugs make infections more likely after surgery. We want to know if these IBD drugs are safe around the time of surgery.

**Trial Design**

This study did not test new drugs. It looked at many old studies. We wanted to see what those studies found. We searched many places for these studies. We looked in online libraries. We looked at study lists. We checked for studies up to October 2019.

We looked for studies about people with IBD. Some people took IBD medicine before surgery. Some took it soon after surgery. Other people did not take these medicines. We wanted to compare these two groups. We looked for studies that had good results. We also looked at ones that had not been published yet.

We checked for infections within 30 days after surgery. This was the main thing we looked for. We also looked for other problems. These included wound infections. We also checked for infections inside the belly. We also looked for infections outside the belly. Two people checked all the study facts. They made sure the facts were correct.

**Results**

We found 68 studies. Most of these studies were not set up to compare groups directly. Some of these studies were very good. Others had some flaws.

We found that some IBD drugs might cause more infections. People who took anti-TNF drugs had more infections. These drugs led to a 1.6 times higher chance of infection. People who took steroids also had more infections. These drugs led to a 1.7 times higher chance of infection. Both of these drugs also made infections inside the belly more likely.

Other IBD drugs did not seem to cause more infections. These included 5-ASA drugs. Immunomodulator drugs did not cause more infections. Anti-integrin drugs also did not cause more infections. None of the drugs changed the chance of wound problems. Also, no drugs changed the chance of infections outside the belly.

The results from these studies were not always clear. This means we cannot say for sure what happens. We need more and better studies. For now, doctors should talk to each patient. They should decide what is best for that person. They should think about the person's unique health needs.","Infection risk after surgery in patients using medications for inflammatory bowel disease 
Background  
More than 1.2 million individuals in North America are affected by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is a condition that involves inflammation in the large and/or small intestine(s), resulting in symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Many of the medications used to treat IBD suppress the immune system. As a result, use of these medications increases the risk of infection. This increased risk of infection is particularly concerning in patients undergoing surgery. 
Review Question  
This systematic review examined the combined data from 68 previously published studies to determine whether patients using IBD medications around the time of surgery had more infections compared to those not using the same medications. 
Study Characteristics  
This systematic review is current up to 29 October 2019. It included 68 studies in patients with IBD who underwent surgery. Most participants were 18 years or older and both men and women were included. Five IBD medication groups were examined within our study. Infections were tracked up to 30 days after surgery. 
Key Results  
Analyses of this large set of data revealed that infection risk around the time of surgery varied depending on which type of IBD medication the patients were on. Patients being treated with corticosteroids or anti‐TNF agents seemed to have more infections after surgery, while those on 5‐ASA, immunomodulators or anti‐integrin agents did not seem to have more infections after surgery. These findings should be taken with caution as our review included studies which were of limited quality, and therefore we were not able to draw any firm conclusions.These findings could help doctors choose which medications to treat IBD patients with before surgery. Decisions should be tailored to each patient's unique health needs. In addition, this study suggests the need to carefully monitor for infections after surgery in patients who are on certain types of IBD medications.  
Limitations  
One limitation of this systematic review was its dependence on data from a wide range of previously published studies, with various approaches and quality control standards. Most studies examined had very low certainty regarding its conclusions. This review illustrates the need for future high‐quality research examining the impact of medications used to treat IBD on infection risk after surgery.

10.1002-14651858.CD012626.pub2,"What are the most effective ways to encourage people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to be more physically active? 
Background 
Being physically active is important for everyone's health. It can be particularly difficult for people with COPD and we do not know the best way to improve physical activity. 
Study characteristics 
This review includes 76 studies involving 8018 people with COPD (published before 27 June 2019). Most studies were funded by government bodies, although some were sponsored by equipment or drug manufacturers. Many strategies have been developed and different studies have measured physical activity in lots of different ways. This means that it was hard to compare and combine their findings. It was also hard to tell exactly what was involved in some of the interventions, and therefore which components were important for improving physical activity. 
Key results 
Some studies looked at current interventions for people with COPD, including pulmonary rehabilitation and different types of exercise training as well as self‐management and education. Other studies have looked at special types of nutritional supplements, oxygen therapy, surgery, muscle stimulation and singing. 
Some strategies that did work involved exercise training, physical activity counselling and COPD medications. Some studies showed that people did an extra 6 to 24 minutes of at least moderate‐intensity physical activity, as well as walking for longer or taking more steps each day. However, we are still uncertain about when or how these approaches should be used. Only a few studies followed people up after the intervention finished. It is not clear exactly what needs to be done to improve physical activity in the long term, which is what may be required for health benefits. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low, due to difficulties working out exactly what people did in the studies, and also because there were lots of single studies (some quite small) looking at different types of interventions. This means that it was difficult to generalise these findings to all people with COPD. 
","## Moving More with COPD

### Rationale

Being active is good for your health. It helps keep your body strong. But it can be hard for people with COPD to be active. COPD is a lung disease. It makes it hard to breathe. This can make simple tasks feel like a lot of work. We need to find good ways to help people with COPD move more.

This study looked at many past studies. We wanted to find out what works best. If people with COPD are more active, it can help them feel better. It can also help them stay healthier. We hope to find ways to make moving easier for them.

### Trial Design

This study looked at how to help people with COPD be more active. We reviewed 76 past studies. These studies included 8018 people in total. All of these people had COPD. The studies were published before June 27, 2019.

Most of these studies got money from the government. Some got money from companies that make medical tools or drugs. The studies looked at many different ways to help people. They also measured activity in different ways. This made it hard to compare them. It was also hard to know what exactly each plan involved. We want to find out what parts of a plan are most helpful.

### Results

We looked at many ideas to help people with COPD. Some ideas included special lung exercises. Others taught people how to manage their health. Some studies looked at diet help. Some even looked at oxygen or surgery. We also saw studies on muscle shocks and singing.

Some things did help people move more. Exercise training was one helpful thing. Talking to someone about activity also helped. COPD medicines also made a difference. Some studies showed people added 6 to 24 minutes of activity each day. They also walked more steps.

But we still do not know the best way to use these ideas. We do not know when to use them. Or how to use them. Most studies only watched people for a short time. We do not know what helps people stay active for a long time. This long-term activity is key for health.

The studies we looked at were not always clear. It was hard to know what people truly did. Many studies were small. This means it is hard to say if these ideas will work for everyone with COPD. More study is needed to find out the best long-term solutions.","What are the most effective ways to encourage people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to be more physically active?

People with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) need treatment with insulin for survival. Whether any particular type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin provides benefit especially regarding risk of diabetes complications and hypoglycaemia is unknown. 
Objectives
To compare the effects of long‐term treatment with (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogues to NPH insulin (neutral protamine Hagedorn) or another (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogue in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We explored the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medical Agency (EMA) web pages. We asked pharmaceutical companies, EMA and investigators for additional data and clinical study reports (CSRs). The date of the last search of all databases was 24 August 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of 24 weeks or more comparing one (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin to NPH insulin or another (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin in people with T1DM. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed risk of bias using the new Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 (RoB 2) tool and extracted data. Our main outcomes were all‐cause mortality, health‐related quality of life (QoL), severe hypoglycaemia, non‐fatal myocardial infarction/stroke (NFMI/NFS), severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia, serious adverse events (SAEs) and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). We used a random‐effects model to perform meta‐analyses and calculated risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and 95% prediction intervals for effect estimates. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence applying the GRADE instrument. 
Main results
We included 26 RCTs. Two studies were unpublished. We obtained CSRs, clinical study synopses or both as well as medical reviews from regulatory agencies on 23 studies which contributed to better analysis of risk of bias and improved data extraction. A total of 8784 participants were randomised: 2428 participants were allocated to NPH insulin, 2889 participants to insulin detemir, 2095 participants to insulin glargine and 1372 participants to insulin degludec. Eight studies contributing 21% of all participants comprised children. The duration of the intervention varied from 24 weeks to 104 weeks. 
Insulin degludec versus NPH insulin: we identified no studies comparing insulin degludec with NPH insulin. 
Insulin detemir versus NPH insulin (9 RCTs): five deaths reported in two studies including adults occurred in the insulin detemir group (Peto OR 4.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 31.38; 9 studies, 3334 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Three studies with 870 participants reported QoL showing no true beneficial or harmful effect for either intervention (low‐certainty evidence). There was a reduction in severe hypoglycaemia in favour of insulin detemir: 171/2019 participants (8.5%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 138/1200 participants (11.5%) in the NPH insulin group experienced severe hypoglycaemia (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.92; 8 studies, 3219 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between 0.34 and 1.39. Only 1/331 participants in the insulin detemir group compared with 0/164 participants in the NPH insulin group experienced a NFMI (1 study, 495 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No study reported NFS. A total of 165/2094 participants (7.9%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 102/1238 participants (8.2%) in the NPH insulin group experienced SAEs (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.21; 9 studies, 3332 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia was observed in 70/1823 participants (3.8%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 60/1102 participants (5.4%) in the NPH insulin group (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.17; 7 studies, 2925 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The MD in HbA1c comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin was 0.01%, 95% CI ‐0.1 to 0.1; 8 studies, 3122 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence. 
Insulin glargine versus NPH insulin (9 RCTs): one adult died in the NPH insulin group (Peto OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.00 to 6.98; 8 studies, 2175 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Four studies with 1013 participants reported QoL showing no true beneficial effect or harmful effect for either intervention (low‐certainty evidence). Severe hypoglycaemia was observed in 122/1191 participants (10.2%) in the insulin glargine group compared with 145/1159 participants (12.5%) in the NPH insulin group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.04; 9 studies, 2350 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No participant experienced a NFMI and one participant in the NPH insulin group experienced a NFS in the single study reporting this outcome (585 participants; low‐certainty evidence). A total of 109/1131 participants (9.6%) in the insulin glargine group compared with 110/1098 participants (10.0%) in the NPH insulin group experienced SAEs (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.84; 8 studies, 2229 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia was observed in 69/938 participants (7.4%) in the insulin glargine group compared with 83/955 participants (8.7%) in the NPH insulin group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.12; 6 studies, 1893 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The MD in HbA1c comparing insulin glargine with NPH insulin was 0.02%, 95% CI ‐0.1 to 0.1; 9 studies, 2285 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence. 
Insulin detemir versus insulin glargine (2 RCTs),insulin degludec versus insulin detemir (2 RCTs), insulin degludec versus insulin glargine (4 RCTs): there was no evidence of a clinically relevant difference for all main outcomes comparing (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogues with each other. 
For all outcomes none of the comparisons indicated differences in tests of interaction for children versus adults. 
Authors' conclusions
Comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin for T1DM showed lower risk of severe hypoglycaemia in favour of insulin detemir (moderate‐certainty evidence). However, the 95% prediction interval indicated inconsistency in this finding. Both insulin detemir and insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin did not show benefits or harms for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia. For all other main outcomes with overall low risk of bias and comparing insulin analogues with each other, there was no true beneficial or harmful effect for any intervention. Data on patient‐important outcomes such as QoL, macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications were sparse or missing. No clinically relevant differences were found between children and adults.

## Plain Title
Better Insulin for People with Type 1 Diabetes

## Rationale
People with type 1 diabetes need insulin every day. Without it, they can get very sick. Some types of insulin work for a long time. These are called long-acting insulins. We wanted to know if certain long-acting insulins are better than others. We also wanted to see if they cause fewer low blood sugar events.

Low blood sugar is a big problem for people with diabetes. It can be very serious. It can also make people feel tired or sick. This study looked at different long-acting insulins. We wanted to see if one type was safer or worked better. We hoped to find an insulin that helps people stay healthy.

## Trial Design
How is this study designed?

We looked at many past studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. One group got one type of insulin. Another group got a different type.

The studies lasted at least 24 weeks. Some lasted as long as 104 weeks. We looked at studies with both adults and children. All people in the studies had type 1 diabetes. We wanted to see how well these insulins worked over time.

## Results
What were the main results of the study?

We looked at 26 studies in total. About 8,784 people took part in these studies. Some people used a common insulin called NPH insulin. Others used newer long-acting insulins. These were insulin detemir, insulin glargine, and insulin degludec.

When we compared insulin detemir to NPH insulin, we found something important. Insulin detemir led to fewer severe low blood sugar events. About 8 out of 100 people using detemir had severe low blood sugar. This was compared to 11 out of 100 people using NPH insulin. This is good news for people who use insulin detemir.

For other main health problems, the different insulins were much the same. This included serious bad events or how people felt about their health. The different long-acting insulins also did not change blood sugar levels much.

When we compared the newer long-acting insulins to each other, there was no real difference. For example, insulin detemir and insulin glargine worked about the same. Children and adults also showed similar results.

Our main finding is that insulin detemir may lower the risk of severe low blood sugar. This is a big benefit for patients. However, we need more studies to be sure. More research is also needed on how these insulins affect long-term health. We need to know more about how they impact quality of life.","Do people with type 1 diabetes mellitus benefit from using a different type of insulin as their basal insulin? 
Background 
Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar (glucose) level to become too high. Insulin is a hormone that is released by the pancreas (a small organ behind the stomach) which controls the blood levels of glucose. In people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) the pancreas does not produce any insulin, so the person has to inject insulin to control the glucose levels and keep well. The goal of insulin therapy is to provide insulin that mimics physiologic insulin secretion. Insulin is given by an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) by means of insulin syringes, insulin pens or insulin pumps. In order to control blood glucose levels in periods of fasting, basal or background insulin is needed. Basal insulin can be given by means of daily or twice‐daily injections of an intermediate‐acting or (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin. Basal insulin can be given as intermediate‐acting human neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or as (ultra‐)long‐acting analogue insulin (synthetic insulin). Bolus insulin is taken at mealtime (prandial insulin) to control blood glucose levels following a meal and is given by means of short‐acting or rapid‐acting insulin. The aim for most people with T1DM is to achieve near‐normal blood glucose levels to avoid long‐term complications such as kidney and eye disease and to allow flexibility regarding time, type and amount of food intake. The major unwanted effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) which can be severe. 
We wanted to find out whether one type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin compared with NPH insulin or another type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin is better for people with T1DM. The outcomes we were specifically interested in were death, health‐related quality of life, severe (night‐time) hypoglycaemia, serious unwanted events, non‐fatal complications of diabetes (heart attacks, strokes) and levels of glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) which is an indicator of long‐term glucose control. 
What did we look for? 
We searched medical databases and contacted pharmaceutical manufacturers and drug regulatory agencies for studies that:— were randomised controlled trials (medical studies where participants are put randomly into one of the treatment groups);— included people with T1DM;— compared one (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin with another (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin or NPH insulin;— lasted at least 24 weeks. 
What did we find?We found 26 studies including a total of 8780 participants (21% were children). The studies lasted between 24 weeks and two years. They compared:— NPH insulin with insulin detemir (nine studies);— NPH insulin with insulin glargine (nine studies);— Insulin detemir with insulin glargine (two studies);— Insulin degludec with insulin detemir (two studies);— Insulin degludec with insulin glargine (four studies). 
No study compared NPH insulin with insulin degludec.
Key results 
There were no clear differences for all main outcomes comparing (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogues with each other. 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reduced with insulin detemir: among 1000 participants using NPH insulin, 115 would experience severe hypoglycaemia; using insulin detemir there would be 36 participants fewer (9 to 55 participants fewer) experiencing severe hypoglycaemia. However, the results were inconsistent, meaning if another study was performed there may not be a clear difference between insulin detemir and NPH insulin. There was no clear difference regarding the risk of severe night‐time hypoglycaemia. There were no clear differences for health‐related quality of life, serious unwanted effects or HbA1c levels. Very few people experienced a heart attack or died, and stroke was not reported. 
There were no clear differences comparing insulin glargine with NPH insulin for all main outcomes. Very few people experienced a heart attack, stroke or died. 
There were also no clear differences for all comparisons between children and adults.
Certainty of the evidence In the comparison of the insulin analogues detemir and glargine with NPH insulin, we are moderately confident about the results for death, severe (night‐time) hypoglycaemia, serious unwanted effects and HbA1c levels. We are uncertain about the effects on heart attacks, stroke and health‐related quality of life, mainly because there were only a few studies which did not last long enough to reliably investigate these outcomes.

Intestinal dysbiosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in very preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Dietary supplementation with synbiotics (probiotic micro‐organisms combined with prebiotic oligosaccharides) to modulate the intestinal microbiome has been proposed as a strategy to reduce the risk of NEC and associated mortality and morbidity. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of enteral supplementation with synbiotics (versus placebo or no treatment, or versus probiotics or prebiotics alone) for preventing NEC and associated morbidity and mortality in very preterm or VLBW infants. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, the Maternity and Infant Care database and CINAHL, from earliest records to 17 June 2021. We searched clinical trials databases and conference proceedings, and examined the reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing prophylactic synbiotics supplementation with placebo or no synbiotics in very preterm (< 32 weeks' gestation) or very low birth weight (< 1500 g) infants. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors separately performed the screening and selection process,  evaluated risk of bias of the trials, extracted data, and synthesised effect estimates using risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), and mean difference, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the level of certainty for effects on NEC, all‐cause mortality, late‐onset invasive infection, and neurodevelopmental impairment. 
Main results
We included six trials in which a total of 925 infants participated. Most trials were small (median sample size 200). Lack of clarity on methods used to conceal allocation and mask caregivers or investigators were potential sources of bias in four of the trials. The studied synbiotics preparations contained lactobacilli or bifidobacteria (or both) combined with fructo‐ or galacto‐oligosaccharides (or both).  
Meta‐analyses suggested that synbiotics may reduce the risk of NEC (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.40; RD 70 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 100 fewer to 40 fewer; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 14, 95% CI 10 to 25; six trials (907 infants); low certainty evidence); and all‐cause mortality prior to hospital discharge (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.85; RD 50 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 120 fewer to 100 fewer; NNTB 20, 95% CI 8 to 100; six trials (925 infants); low‐certainty evidence). Synbiotics may have little or no effect on late‐onset invasive infection, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.21; RD 20 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 70 fewer to 30 more; five trials (707 infants); very low‐certainty evidence). None of the trials assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes. In the absence of high levels of heterogeneity, we did not undertake any subgroup analysis (including the type of feeding). 
Authors' conclusions
The available trial data provide only low‐certainty evidence about the effects of synbiotics on the risk of NEC and associated morbidity and mortality for very preterm or very low birth weight infants. Our confidence in the effect estimates is limited; the true effects may be substantially different from these estimates. Large, high‐quality trials would be needed to provide evidence of sufficient validity and applicability to inform policy and practice.

### Plain Title
Can Special Foods Help Very Tiny Babies?

### Rationale
Babies born very early or very small can get a serious gut problem. This problem is called necrotising enterocolitis, or NEC. NEC can hurt their gut. It can make them very sick. It can even cause them to die.

Some doctors think that the germs in a baby's gut play a part in NEC. If these germs are out of balance, it can cause problems. We call this ""intestinal dysbiosis.""

This study looked at special foods called synbiotics. Synbiotics are a mix of good germs and food for those germs. We hoped synbiotics could help balance the gut germs. This might stop NEC. It could also help babies live longer and be healthier.

### Trial Design
This study asked: ""Can synbiotics stop NEC in tiny babies?"" We looked at past studies that gave synbiotics to babies. We compared them to babies who did not get synbiotics. Or babies who got a fake treatment. Or babies who got only parts of synbiotics.

We looked at studies with babies born before 32 weeks. Or babies who weighed less than 1500 grams. These are very preterm or very low birth weight babies.

Two people checked all the studies. They made sure the studies were fair. They gathered all the facts from these studies. Then, they put all the facts together. We wanted to see if synbiotics helped these babies.

### Results
We found six studies. A total of 925 babies were in these studies. Most studies were small. Some studies did not clearly say how they kept things fair. This means the results from these studies might not be perfect.

The synbiotics used in these studies had good germs. These germs were lactobacilli or bifidobacteria. They also had special sugars called fructo- or galacto-oligosaccharides.

When we looked at all the studies together, synbiotics seemed to help. They might make babies less likely to get NEC. For every 1000 babies, 70 fewer might get NEC. Synbiotics also might make babies less likely to die before leaving the hospital. For every 1000 babies, 50 fewer might die.

However, we are not very sure about these results. The studies were small. Some studies were not very clear about their methods. So, the true effects might be different.

Synbiotics may not help with other infections. But we are very unsure about this. The studies did not look at how babies grew or learned later.

In the end, we need bigger and better studies. These new studies would give us clearer answers. Then, doctors can know for sure if synbiotics are good for these tiny babies.","Do synbiotics prevent necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm or very low birth weight infants? 
Background 
Very preterm (born more than eight weeks early) and very low birth weight (less than 1.5 kg) infants are at risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis, a severe condition where some of the lining of the infant's bowel becomes inflamed, and the cells of this tissue die. This condition is associated with death, serious infection, and long‐term disability, as well as developmental problems. 
What did we want to find out? 
One way to help prevent necrotising enterocolitis may be to add synbiotics (combinations of probiotic bacteria or yeasts plus non‐digestible sugars to support probiotic growth and colonisation) to milk feeds. We wanted to find out whether synbiotics might benefit very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Our outcomes of interest included necrotising enterocolitis, death from any cause, serious infection, duration of hospitalisation since birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
What did we do? 
For our Cochrane Review, we searched several important databases to identify randomized controlled trials that investigated the use of synbiotics for preventing necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm and very low birth weight infants. We used standard Cochrane methods to conduct our review and perform our analyses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. 
What did we find? 
We found six trials with a total of 925 infant participants. Trials were mostly small, and most had design flaws that might have biased their findings. 
Main results 
Combined analyses showed that giving synbiotics to very preterm or very low birth weight infants may reduce the risk of necrotising enterocolitis and death. Synbiotics may have little or no effect in reducing the risk of serious infection, but the evidence is very uncertain. None of the studies that we identified assessed the effect of synbiotics on disability or developmental outcomes. 
What are the limitations of this evidence? 
Although the evidence from randomised controlled trials can potentially be of high certainty, the methods used in our review's included trials may have introduced biases that exaggerated the benefits of giving synbiotics to very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Also, because most of the trials were small, the effect estimates for some outcomes were imprecise. For these reasons, we graded down the certainty of the evidence. All evidence in our review is of low or very low certainty. 
There is low‐certainty evidence that synbiotics prevent necrotising enterocolitis and death from any cause. There is very low‐certainty evidence that synbiotics may have little or no effect in preventing serious infection.

10.1002-14651858.CD013779,"Background
Evidence from disease epidemics shows that healthcare workers are at risk of developing short‐ and long‐term mental health problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned about the potential negative impact of the COVID‐19 crisis on the mental well‐being of health and social care professionals. Symptoms of mental health problems commonly include depression, anxiety, stress, and additional cognitive and social problems; these can impact on function in the workplace. The mental health and resilience (ability to cope with the negative effects of stress) of frontline health and social care professionals ('frontline workers' in this review) could be supported during disease epidemics by workplace interventions, interventions to support basic daily needs, psychological support interventions, pharmacological interventions, or a combination of any or all of these. 
Objectives
Objective 1: to assess the effects of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. 
Objective 2: to identify barriers and facilitators that may impact on the implementation of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. 
Search methods
On 28 May 2020 we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus databases and WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing. We also searched ongoing trials registers and Google Scholar. We ran all searches from the year 2002 onwards, with no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included studies in which participants were health and social care professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks, categorised as epidemics or pandemics by WHO, from 2002 onwards. For objective 1 we included quantitative evidence from randomised trials, non‐randomised trials, controlled before‐after studies and interrupted time series studies, which investigated the effect of any intervention to support mental health or resilience, compared to no intervention, standard care, placebo or attention control intervention, or other active interventions. For objective 2 we included qualitative evidence from studies that described barriers and facilitators to the implementation of interventions. Outcomes critical to this review were general mental health and resilience. Additional outcomes included psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression or stress; burnout; other mental health disorders; workplace staffing; and adverse events arising from interventions. 
Data collection and analysis
Pairs of review authors independently applied selection criteria to abstracts and full papers, with disagreements resolved through discussion. One review author systematically extracted data, cross‐checked by a second review author. For objective 1, we assessed risk of bias of studies of effectiveness using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. For objective 2, we assessed methodological limitations using either the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) qualitative study tool, for qualitative studies, or WEIRD (Ways of Evaluating Important and Relevant Data) tool, for descriptive studies. We planned meta‐analyses of pairwise comparisons for outcomes if direct evidence were available. Two review authors extracted evidence relating to barriers and facilitators to implementation, organised these around the domains of the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research, and used the GRADE‐CERQual approach to assess confidence in each finding. We planned to produce an overarching synthesis, bringing quantitative and qualitative findings together. 
Main results
We included 16 studies that reported implementation of an intervention aimed at supporting the resilience or mental health of frontline workers during disease outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): 2; Ebola: 9; Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS): 1; COVID‐19: 4). Interventions studied included workplace interventions, such as training, structure and communication (6 studies); psychological support interventions, such as counselling and psychology services (8 studies); and multifaceted interventions (2 studies). 
Objective 1: a mixed‐methods study that incorporated a cluster‐randomised trial, investigating the effect of a work‐based intervention, provided very low‐certainty evidence about the effect of training frontline healthcare workers to deliver psychological first aid on a measure of burnout. 
Objective 2: we included all 16 studies in our qualitative evidence synthesis; we classified seven as qualitative and nine as descriptive studies. We identified 17 key findings from multiple barriers and facilitators reported in studies. We did not have high confidence in any of the findings; we had moderate confidence in six findings and low to very low confidence in 11 findings. We are moderately confident that the following two factors were barriers to intervention implementation: frontline workers, or the organisations in which they worked, not being fully aware of what they needed to support their mental well‐being; and a lack of equipment, staff time or skills needed for an intervention. We are moderately confident that the following three factors were facilitators of intervention implementation: interventions that could be adapted for local needs; having effective communication, both formally and socially; and having positive, safe and supportive learning environments for frontline workers. We are moderately confident that the knowledge or beliefs, or both, that people have about an intervention can act as either barriers or facilitators to implementation of the intervention. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a lack of both quantitative and qualitative evidence from studies carried out during or after disease epidemics and pandemics that can inform the selection of interventions that are beneficial to the resilience and mental health of frontline workers. Alternative sources of evidence (e.g. from other healthcare crises, and general evidence about interventions that support mental well‐being) could therefore be used to inform decision making. When selecting interventions aimed at supporting frontline workers' mental health, organisational, social, personal, and psychological factors may all be important. Research to determine the effectiveness of interventions is a high priority. The COVID‐19 pandemic provides unique opportunities for robust evaluation of interventions. Future studies must be developed with appropriately rigorous planning, including development, peer review and transparent reporting of research protocols, following guidance and standards for best practice, and with appropriate length of follow‐up. Factors that may act as barriers and facilitators to implementation of interventions should be considered during the planning of future research and when selecting interventions to deliver within local settings. 
","## Helping Our Healthcare Heroes: A Study on Mental Health Support

### Rationale

When there is a disease outbreak, like COVID-19, many people get sick. Healthcare workers are on the front lines. They take care of sick people. This can be very stressful. It can cause them to feel sad, worried, or stressed. They might also have trouble thinking clearly or getting along with others. This can make their jobs harder.

We need to help these workers stay strong. We need to help them cope with stress. This is called building their ""resilience."" We want to find ways to support their mental health. This study looked at different ways to help them. We wanted to see what works best.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. It gathered information from them. It asked two main questions.

First, ""What kinds of help work best?"" This includes things like special training or talking to someone. It looked at how these things helped healthcare workers. We looked at studies from 2002 onwards. These studies included doctors, nurses, and other care providers. They worked during outbreaks like SARS, Ebola, and COVID-19.

Second, ""What makes it easy or hard to give this help?"" For example, do workers know they need help? Do they have enough time for the help?

We wanted to see if these support methods helped workers. Did they feel less stressed? Were they able to cope better? We looked at many research papers. We read them carefully. We made sure to gather good information.

### Results

We looked at 16 studies in total. These studies tested different kinds of help. Some gave special training at work. Some offered counseling. Some did a mix of things.

We found that there is not enough strong evidence. We cannot say for sure what types of help work best. We need more studies to find clear answers.

However, we did learn some things about what makes support easy or hard to give:

**Things that made it hard:**
* Workers or their workplaces did not know what kind of support they needed.
* There was not enough staff, time, or tools to give the support.

**Things that made it easy:**
* Help that could change to fit local needs.
* Good talks between people, both at work and socially.
* Safe and helpful places for workers to learn and grow.

Also, what people believed about the help could make it easy or hard. If they thought it was good, it helped. If they doubted it, it was harder.

In conclusion, we need more good studies. We need to learn more about what truly helps our frontline workers. This is very important. The COVID-19 pandemic showed us how vital this help is.","What is the best way to support resilience and mental well‐being in frontline healthcare professionals during and after a pandemic? 
What is ‘resilience’? 
Working as a 'frontline' health or social care professional during a global disease pandemic, like COVID‐19, can be very stressful. Over time, the negative effects of stress can lead to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, which, in turn, may affect work, family and other social relationships. ‘Resilience’ is the ability to cope with the negative effects of stress and so avoid mental health problems and their wider effects. 
Healthcare providers can use various strategies (interventions) to support resilience and mental well‐being in their frontline healthcare professionals. These could include work‐based interventions, such as changing routines or improving equipment; or psychological support interventions, such as counselling. 
What did we want to find out? 
First (objective 1), we wanted to know how successfully any interventions improved frontline health professionals’ resilience or mental well‐being. 
Second (objective 2), we wanted to know what made it easier (facilitators) or harder (barriers) to deliver these interventions. 
What did we do? 
We searched medical databases for any kind of study that investigated interventions designed to support resilience and mental well‐being in healthcare professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks. The disease outbreaks had to be classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as epidemics or pandemics, and take place from 2002 onwards (the year before the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak). 
What did we find? 
We found 16 relevant studies. These studies came from different disease outbreaks ‐ two were from SARS; nine from Ebola; one from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); and four from COVID‐19. The studies mainly looked at workplace interventions that involved either psychological support (for example, counselling or seeing a psychologist) or work‐based interventions (for example, giving training, or changing routines). 
Objective 1: one study investigated how well an intervention worked. This study was carried out immediately after the Ebola outbreak, and investigated whether staff who were training to give other people (such as patients and their family members) 'psychological first aid' felt less ‘burnt out’. We had some concerns about the results that this study reported and about some of its methods. This means that our certainty of the evidence is very low and we cannot say whether the intervention helped or not. 
Objective 2: all 16 studies provided some evidence about barriers and facilitators to implement interventions. We found 17 main findings from these studies. We do not have high confidence in any of the findings; we had moderate confidence in six findings and low to very low confidence in 11 findings. 
We are moderately confident that the following two factors were barriers to implementation of an intervention: frontline workers, or the organisations in which they worked, not being fully aware of what they needed to support their mental well‐being; and a lack of equipment, staff time or skills needed for an intervention. 
We are moderately confident that the following three factors were facilitators to implementation of an intervention: interventions that could be adapted for a local area; having effective communication, both formally within an organisation and informal or social networks; and having positive, safe and supportive learning environments for frontline healthcare professionals. 
We are moderately confident that the knowledge and beliefs that frontline healthcare professionals have about an intervention can either help or hinder implementation of the intervention. 
Key messages 
We did not find any evidence that tells us about how well different strategies work at supporting the resilience and mental well‐being of frontline workers. We found some limited evidence about things that might help successful delivery of interventions. Properly planned research studies to find out the best ways to support the resilience and mental well‐being of health and social care workers are urgently required.

10.1002-14651858.CD010709.pub2,"Background
Guidelines recommend routine arteriovenous (AV) graft and fistula surveillance (technology‐based screening) in addition to clinical monitoring (physical examination) for early identification and pre‐emptive correction of a stenosis before the access becomes dysfunctional. However, consequences on patient‐relevant outcomes of pre‐emptive correction of a stenosis in a functioning access as opposed to deferred correction, i.e. correction postponed to when the access becomes dysfunctional, are uncertain. 
Objectives
We aimed to evaluate 1) whether pre‐emptive correction of an AV access stenosis improves clinically relevant outcomes; 2) whether the effects of pre‐emptive correction of an AV access stenosis differ by access type (fistula versus graft), aim (primary and secondary prophylaxis), and surveillance method for primary prophylaxis (Doppler ultrasound for the screening of functional and anatomical changes versus measurement of the flow in the access); and 3) whether other factors (dialysis duration, access location, configuration or materials, algorithm for referral for intervention, intervention strategies (surgical versus radiological or other), or study design) explain the heterogeneity that might exist in the effect estimates. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 30 November 2015 using search terms relevant to this review. 
Selection criteria
We included all studies of any access surveillance method for early identification and pre‐emptive treatment of an AV access stenosis. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on potentially remediable and irremediable failure of the access (i.e. thrombosis and access loss respectively); infection and mortality; and resource use (hospitalisation, diagnostic and intervention procedures). Analysis was by a random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR), hazard ratio (HR) or incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We identified 14 studies (1390 participants), nine enrolled adults without a known access stenosis (primary prophylaxis; three studies including people using fistulas) and five enrolled adults with a documented stenosis in a non‐dysfunctional access (secondary prophylaxis; three studies in people using fistulas). Study follow‐up ranged from 6 to 38 months, and study size ranged from 58 to 189 participants. In low‐ to moderate‐quality evidence (based on GRADE criteria) in adults treated with haemodialysis, relative to no surveillance and deferred correction, surveillance with pre‐emptive correction of an AV stenosis reduced the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.97; I² = 30%; 18 study comparisons, 1212 participants), and probably improves the longevity of AV access (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99; I² = 0%; 11 study comparisons, 972 participants). In analyses subgrouped by access type, pre‐emptive stenosis correction did not reduce the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.12; I² = 0%; 11 study comparisons, 697 participants) or access loss in grafts (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.11; I² = 0%; 7 study comparisons; 662 participants), but did reduce the risk of thrombosis (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.71; I² = 0%; 7 study comparisons, 515 participants) and the risk of access loss in fistulas (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.86; I² = 0%; 4 studies; 310 participants). Three of the four studies reporting access loss data in fistulas (199 participants) were conducted in the same centre. Insufficient data were available to assess whether benefits vary by prophylaxis aim in fistulas (i.e. primary and secondary prophylaxis). Although the magnitude of the effects of pre‐emptive stenosis correction was considerable for patient‐centred outcomes, results were either heterogeneous or imprecise. While pre‐emptive stenosis correction may reduce the rates of hospitalisation (IRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93; I² = 67%; 4 study comparisons, 219 participants) and use of catheters (IRR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98; I² = 53%; 6 study comparisons, 394 participants), it may also increase the rates of diagnostic procedures (IRR 1.78, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.67; I² = 62%; 7 study comparisons, 539 participants), infection (IRR 1.74, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.91; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 248 participants) and mortality (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.11; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 386 participants). 
In general, risk of bias was high or unclear in most studies for many domains we assessed. Four studies were published after 2005 and only one had evidence of registration within a trial registry. No study reported information on authorship and/or involvement of the study sponsor in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. 
Authors' conclusions
Pre‐emptive correction of a newly identified or known stenosis in a functional AV access does not improve access longevity. Although pre‐emptive stenosis correction may be promising in fistulas existing evidence is insufficient to guide clinical practice and health policy. While pre‐emptive stenosis correction may reduce the risk of hospitalisation, this benefit is uncertain whereas there may be a substantial increase (i.e. 80%) in the use of access‐related procedures and procedure‐related adverse events (e.g. infection, mortality). The net effects of pre‐emptive correction on harms and resource use are thus unclear. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Fixing Blocked Blood Vessels for Dialysis

### Rationale

Many people need dialysis to clean their blood. To do this, doctors create a special blood vessel, called an AV access, in the arm. Sometimes, these blood vessels can get narrow or blocked. This is called a stenosis.

A stenosis can stop the dialysis from working well. It can also cause other problems. Doctors often check these blood vessels to find problems early. They want to fix them before they get bad.

We wanted to see if fixing these narrow spots early helps patients more. We looked at whether fixing them early is better than waiting until the problem causes issues with dialysis. We also wanted to know if this works better for certain types of AV access.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. We gathered information from all of them. These studies included people who needed dialysis. All these adults had an AV access in their arm.

Some studies looked at people who did not have a known problem. Other studies looked at people who had a narrow spot but their AV access still worked. The follow-up time for these studies was from 6 months to over 3 years. Each study had between 58 and 189 people.

We wanted to see how fixing these narrow spots early affects problems like blood clots. We also looked at how it affects how long the AV access lasts. We also checked for things like hospital stays and other procedures.

### Results

We found 14 studies with a total of 1390 people. Most of the studies looked at adults on dialysis. Fixing narrow spots early seemed to help. It lowered the chance of blood clots by about one in five. It also made the AV access last longer by about one in five.

However, this was mostly true for one type of AV access called a fistula. For another type, called a graft, fixing problems early did not lower the chance of blood clots or losing the access. For fistulas, fixing problems early cut the risk of blood clots and losing the access in half.

Fixing problems early might also mean fewer hospital stays. It could also mean less need for tubes in the neck or chest. But, it might also mean more tests and procedures. There was also a chance of more infections and even a higher risk of death.

The information we have is not strong enough to tell doctors exactly what to do. Fixing narrow spots early might help fistulas. But we need more studies to be sure. The good things might be outweighed by the extra tests and risks.

In general, the studies we looked at had some issues. Many of them were not very clear about how they were done. More and better studies are needed to understand this topic fully.","Pre‐emptive correction of stenosis of the arteriovenous access for haemodialysis
An arteriovenous access consists of a direct surgical connection between an artery and a vein in the arm (fistula) or a plastic conduit connecting an artery and a vein (graft). If these forms of access become dysfunctional the delivery of dialysis therapy becomes suboptimal. The most common cause of access dysfunction is the development of a restriction or conduit narrowing called 'stenosis'. Because early correction of stenosis is considered critical to maintain the patency (openness) of the access and prolong its use, guidelines recommend regular surveillance of the access (i.e. screening based on diagnostic tests) in addition to or instead of a physical exam (clinical monitoring) to identify and treat early lesions. 
In this review we included 14 studies, randomising 1390 participants to either a pre‐emptive correction of an access stenosis (i.e. before the access became dysfunctional) or a deferred correction of an access stenosis (i.e. if and when the access became dysfunctional). This review shows that pre‐emptive correction of an arteriovenous access stenosis does not improve longevity of the access overall. In people using grafts pre‐emptive correction does not reduce the risk of thrombosis or access loss. In people using fistulas pre‐emptive stenosis correction reduces the risk of thrombosis and may prolong the longevity of the access. However, this surveillance and pre‐emptive correction strategy may increase the number of access‐related procedures and procedure‐related adverse events. 
This systematic review presents, to clinicians and patients, evidence‐based data that do not support the use of access surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of stenosis in grafts. Although surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of stenosis reduce the risk of thrombosis and may reduce the risk of access loss in fistulas, they may also increase the risk of procedure‐related adverse events and health‐care cost. Large multicentre clinical trials are necessary in this patient population to better clarify potential harms and expected benefits of routine surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of fistula stenosis.

10.1002-14651858.CD013165.pub2,"Background
Hyperkalaemia is a common electrolyte abnormality caused by reduced renal potassium excretion in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Potassium binders, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate and calcium polystyrene sulfonate, are widely used but may lead to constipation and other adverse gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, reducing their tolerability. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer ion exchange resins for treatment of hyperkalaemia which may cause fewer GI side‐effects. Although more recent studies are focusing on clinically‐relevant endpoints such as cardiac complications or death, the evidence on safety is still limited. Given the recent expansion in the available treatment options, it is appropriate to review the evidence of effectiveness and tolerability of all potassium exchange resins among people with CKD, with the aim to provide guidance to consumers, practitioners, and policy‐makers. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of potassium binders for treating chronic hyperkalaemia among adults and children with CKD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 10 March 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled studies (quasi‐RCTs) evaluating potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia administered in adults and children with CKD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed risks of bias and extracted data. Treatment estimates were summarised by random effects meta‐analysis and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence interval (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using GRADE processes. 
Main results
Fifteen studies, randomising 1849 adult participants were eligible for inclusion. Twelve studies involved participants with CKD (stages 1 to 5) not requiring dialysis and three studies were among participants treated with haemodialysis. Potassium binders included calcium polystyrene sulfonate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. A range of routes, doses, and timing of drug administration were used. Study duration varied from 12 hours to 52 weeks (median 4 weeks). Three were cross‐over studies. The mean study age ranged from 53.1 years to 73 years. No studies evaluated treatment in children. 
Some studies had methodological domains that were at high or unclear risks of bias, leading to low certainty in the results. Studies were not designed to measure treatment effects on cardiac arrhythmias or major GI symptoms. 
Ten studies (1367 randomised participants) compared a potassium binder to placebo. The certainty of the evidence was low for all outcomes. We categorised treatments in newer agents (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) and older agents (calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate). Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate may make little or no difference to death (any cause) (4 studies, 688 participants: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.11, 4.32; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. The treatment effect of older potassium binders on death (any cause) was unknown. One cardiovascular death was reported with potassium binder in one study, showing that there was no difference between patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo for cardiovascular death in CKD and HD. There was no evidence of a difference between patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo for health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) at the end of treatment (one study) in CKD or HD. Potassium binders had uncertain effects on nausea (3 studies, 229 participants: RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.65, 6.78; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), diarrhoea (5 studies, 720 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.47, 1.48; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), and vomiting (2 studies, 122 participants: RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.35 to 8.51; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. Potassium binders may lower serum potassium levels (at the end of treatment) (3 studies, 277 participants: MD ‐0.62 mEq/L, 95% CI ‐0.97, ‐0.27; I2 = 92%; low certainty evidence) in CKD and HD. Potassium binders had uncertain effects on constipation (4 studies, 425 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.71, 3.52; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. Potassium binders may decrease systolic blood pressure (BP) (2 studies, 369 participants: MD ‐3.73 mmHg, 95%CI ‐6.64 to ‐0.83; I2 = 79%; low certainty evidence) and diastolic BP (one study) at the end of the treatment. No study reported outcome data for cardiac arrhythmias or major GI events. 
Calcium polystyrene sulfonate may make little or no difference to serum potassium levels at end of treatment, compared to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (2 studies, 117 participants: MD 0.38 mEq/L, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.79; I2 = 42%, low certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in systolic BP (one study), diastolic BP (one study), or constipation (one study) between calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate. 
There was no difference between high‐dose and low‐dose patiromer for death (sudden death) (one study), stroke (one study), myocardial infarction (one study), or constipation (one study). 
The comparative effects whether potassium binders were administered with or without food, laxatives, or sorbitol, were very uncertain with insufficient data to perform meta‐analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence supporting clinical decision‐making for different potassium binders to treat chronic hyperkalaemia in adults with CKD is of low certainty; no studies were identified in children. Available studies have not been designed to measure treatment effects on clinical outcomes such as cardiac arrhythmias or major GI symptoms. This review suggests the need for a large, adequately powered study of potassium binders versus placebo that assesses clinical outcomes of relevance to patients, clinicians and policy‐makers. This data could be used to assess cost‐effectiveness, given the lack of definitive studies and the clinical importance of potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia in people with CKD. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Helping People with Kidney Disease Control Potassium Levels

### Rationale

Your kidneys help keep your body working right. They clean your blood and keep a healthy balance of salts and minerals. One important mineral is potassium. Too much potassium in your blood is called hyperkalemia. This can be a problem for people with long-term kidney disease.

Too much potassium can cause serious heart problems. It can even be life-threatening. Doctors use special medicines called potassium binders to lower potassium. Older binders can cause problems like constipation. This makes them hard to take. Newer binders may cause fewer side effects.

We need to know more about these medicines. Are they safe? Do they work well? This study looks at all the potassium binders. We want to help patients, doctors, and policy makers choose the best options.

### Trial Design

We looked at studies about potassium binders. We wanted to see how well they worked. We also looked at their side effects.

We focused on adults with kidney disease. Some had mild kidney disease. Others needed dialysis to clean their blood. We did not find studies about children.

The studies tested different binders. They looked at old and new medicines. The studies lasted from half a day to a year. Most studies lasted about one month. We wanted to see if the medicines helped lower potassium. We also looked at other issues like death and tummy problems.

### Results

We found 15 studies. They included 1849 adults. These studies tested different potassium binders. The results were not always clear. This means we are not very sure about some of the findings.

Newer binders, like patiromer, may not change the risk of death. We do not know about older binders. Newer binders also did not seem to affect heart deaths. We found no proof that newer binders changed how people felt about their health.

Potassium binders may lower potassium levels. This is good news for people with high potassium. They may also lower blood pressure. We are not sure about other side effects. These include feeling sick, diarrhea, or throwing up. We also do not know if they cause more constipation.

The studies did not look at serious heart rhythm problems. They also did not look at major gut problems. More research is needed to learn more about these.

We need bigger studies. These studies should look at what matters most to patients. This includes heart problems and serious side effects. This will help us know which binders are best. It will also help us see if they are worth the cost.","Are potassium treatments effective for reduce the excess of potassium among people with chronic kidney disease? 
What is the issue? 
High levels of potassium (a body salt) can build up with chronic kidney disease. This can lead to changes in muscle function including the heart muscle, and cause problems with heart rhythms that can be dangerous. Dialysis can remove potassium from the blood, but for some patients levels can still be high. Patients with severe kidney failure who have not yet started dialysis may have high potassium levels. Treatments have been available for many years but can cause constipation and abdominal discomfort, which make them intolerable for many patients. Newer treatments have been developed including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These may be more tolerable but it is uncertain whether they help to prevent heart complications. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all the research trials that have assessed the potassium‐lowering treatments for children and adults with chronic kidney diseases. We evaluated how certain we could be about the overall findings using a system called ""GRADE"". 
What did we find? 
There are 15 studies involving 1849 randomised adults. Patients in the studies were given a potassium binder or a dummy pill (placebo) or standard care. The treatment they got was decided by random chance. The studies were generally short‐term over days to weeks and focused on potassium levels. Heart related complications could not be measured in this short time frame. Based on the existing research, we can't be sure whether potassium binders improve well‐being or prevent complications in people with chronic kidney disease. There were no studies in children. 
Conclusions 
We can't be certain about the best treatments to reduce body potassium levels for people with chronic kidney disease. We need more information from clinical studies that involve a larger number of patients who have the treatment over several months or years.

10.1002-14651858.CD013666.pub2,"Background
Respiratory disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF), and many different therapies are used by people with CF in the management of respiratory problems. Bronchodilator therapy is used to relieve symptoms of shortness of breath and to open the airways to allow clearance of mucus. Despite the widespread use of inhaled bronchodilators in CF, there is little objective evidence of their efficacy. A Cochrane Review looking at both short‐ and long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF was withdrawn from the Cochrane Library in 2016. That review has been replaced by two separate Cochrane Reviews: one on long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF, and this review on short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF. For this review 'inhaled' includes the use of pressurised metered dose inhalers (MDIs), with or without a spacer, dry powder devices and nebulisers. 
Objectives
To evaluate short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators in children and adults with CF in terms of clinical outcomes and safety. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books on 28 March 2022 and searched trial registries for any new or ongoing trials on 12 April 2022. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs that looked at the effect of any short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator delivered by any device, at any dose, at any frequency and for any duration compared to either placebo or another short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator in people with CF. We screened references as per standard Cochrane methodology. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. Where we were not able to enter data into our analyses we reported results directly from the papers. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 11 trials from our systematic search, with 191 participants meeting our inclusion criteria; three of these trials had three treatment arms. Eight trials compared short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to placebo and four trials compared short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists to placebo. Three trials compared short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists. All were cross‐over trials with only small numbers of participants. We were only able to enter data into the analysis from three trials comparing short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to placebo. 
Short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus placebo 
All eight trials (six single‐dose trials and two longer‐term trials) reporting on this comparison reported on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), either as per cent predicted (% predicted) or L. We were able to combine the data from two trials in a meta‐analysis which showed a greater per cent change from baseline in FEV1 L after beta‐2 agonists compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 6.95%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 12.02; 2 trials, 82 participants). Only one of the longer‐term trials reported on exacerbations, as measured by hospitalisations and courses of antibiotics. Only the second longer‐term trial presented results for participant‐reported outcomes. Three trials narratively reported adverse events, and these were all mild. Three single‐dose trials and the two longer trials reported on forced vital capacity (FVC), and five trials reported on peak expiratory flow, i.e. forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF25-75). One trial reported on airway clearance in terms of sputum weight. We judged the certainty of evidence for each of these outcomes to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. 
Short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists versus placebo 
All four trials reporting on this comparison looked at the effects of ipratropium bromide, but in different doses and via different delivery methods. One trial reported FEV1 % predicted; three trials measured this in L. Two trials reported adverse events, but these were few and mild. One trial reported FVC and three trials reported FEF25-75. None of the trials reported on quality of life, exacerbations or airway clearance. We judged the certainty of evidence for each of these outcomes to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. 
Short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists  
None of the three single‐dose trials reporting on this comparison provided data we could analyse. The original papers from three trials report that both treatments lead to an improvement in FEV1 L. Only one trial reported on adverse events; but none were experienced by any participant. No trial reported on any of our other outcomes. We judged the certainty of evidence to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists compared to short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. 
Authors' conclusions
All included trials in this review are small and of a cross‐over design. Most trials looked at very short‐term effects of inhaled bronchodilators, and therefore did not measure longer‐term outcomes. The certainty of evidence across all outcomes was very low, and therefore we have been unable to describe any effects with certainty. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Helping People with Cystic Fibrosis Breathe Better

### Rationale

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a serious illness. It mainly affects the lungs. This illness causes thick, sticky mucus. This mucus can block airways. It makes it hard to breathe. People with CF often cough a lot. They may get lung infections. This can lead to serious health problems. It can even lead to death.

Many people with CF use medicines to help their breathing. Bronchodilators are one type of medicine. They help open up the airways. This makes breathing easier. It also helps clear mucus. These medicines are given through an inhaler. You breathe them into your lungs.

There are two main types of bronchodilators. Some work fast. They are called short-acting. Others work for a longer time. They are called long-acting. Doctors often give short-acting bronchodilators to CF patients. But we do not have much proof that they work well for CF. This study looked at how well short-acting ones work. We wanted to see if they are safe.

### Trial Design

This study asked, ""How well do short-acting inhaled bronchodilators work for people with CF?"" We looked at past research. We gathered results from many studies. This type of study is called a review. It helps us see the full picture.

We looked for studies that met certain rules. They had to be well-designed. These are called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people got either the medicine or a fake medicine. The fake medicine is called a ""placebo."" Some studies compared two different medicines.

We looked at studies with children and adults. All of them had CF. The studies used short-acting bronchodilators. These medicines were given by inhalers. We looked for studies that checked how well people breathed. We also checked for side effects. We looked for studies that lasted any amount of time.

### Results

We found 11 studies. A total of 191 people took part. Most studies were small. They looked at short-term effects. This means they did not follow people for a long time.

Eight studies compared a fast-acting bronchodilator (called beta-2 agonists) to a fake medicine. Two of these studies showed some benefit. People who took the medicine breathed a little better. Their lung function improved. This was a small change. We are not very sure about this result. The quality of the evidence was low.

Four studies compared a different fast-acting bronchodilator (called muscarinic antagonists) to a fake medicine. These studies showed very little effect. We are very unsure about how well these medicines work for CF.

Three studies compared the two types of bronchodilators to each other. We could not combine their results. The studies did not show a clear winner. We are very unsure about which one works better.

Many studies did not report important things. They did not say if people felt better. They did not say if patients had fewer lung problems. Side effects were rare and mild.

The studies we found were small. They did not last long enough. We need more and better studies. We need to be sure these medicines help people with CF. For now, we are very unsure about how well short-acting bronchodilators work. We are also unsure about their safety over time.","Short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for using short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators (treatments which widen and open the airways, making it easier to breathe) in people with cystic fibrosis. Short‐acting bronchodilators take effect quickly and generally last 4 to 6 hours. We were interested in any type of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator, given at any dose, and by any type of device (inhalers or nebulisers). 
Both nebulisers and inhalers deliver medicine. Nebulisers turn liquid medication into an easily‐inhaled mist. They vary in type but need a power source, e.g. a rechargeable battery, to function. Inhalers deliver short bursts of medicine (as an aerosol or dry powder) via a manual handheld device. The most common type of inhaler is a metered‐dose inhaler. Inhalers can be used with spacers (empty tubes, usually made from plastic that slot onto the mouthpiece of the inhaler).  
Inhaled bronchodilators are used by many people with cystic fibrosis to help them breathe, and to make it easier to clear mucus from their lungs. We wanted to know if these treatments were better than a placebo (dummy) treatment or another type of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 28 March 2022.
Trial characteristics 
The review included 11 trials with 191 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 5 and 40 years of age. Trials compared two different types of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator (beta‐2 agonists such as salbutamol or albuterol, and muscarinic antagonists such as ipratropium bromide) against a placebo substance which contained no medication, or a different short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator; three of the trials had three comparison groups ‐ beta‐2 agonists versus muscarinic antagonists versus placebo. All trials were cross‐over trials, so all of the people included in the trial received both treatments at different times, and the order that they received the treatments was random. The trials lasted from a single‐dose trial to 6 months. Eight trials looked at the effects of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus placebo, four trials at the effects of a short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist versus placebo, and three trials looked at the effects of a short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonist with a short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist. 
Key results 
All trials looked at the effect of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators on lung function, measured as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), but this was reported in different ways and at different time points.  
We are uncertain whether any of the short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators have an effect on FEV1 compared to placebo. The trials were too small and there were not enough data to show if there was an effect or not. 
Only six of the 11 trials reported on harmful effects of treatment: one trial reported no harmful effects and five trials reported mild tremors, dry mouth and fatigue. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence across all trials was very low. All trials used a cross‐over design where the participants are given one treatment and then swapped to the other treatment with a washout period (the length of time for a drug to be eliminated from the body) in between. It is possible that the clinical status of participants was not the same at the beginning of the first treatment phase as at the beginning of the second treatment phase. The trials were also very small and were carried out more than 10 years ago.

Review question
This review aimed to gather evidence for the use of any physical activity intervention for people with congenital heart disease. We aimed to compare interventions including exercise training, physical activity promotion or lung training with no intervention (usual care). 
Background
Congenital heart disease is the term used for a range of birth defects that affect how the heart works. People with congenital heart disease have reduced life expectancy, physical fitness and quality of life. However, due to better prenatal diagnoses, surgical procedures (often performed in the early years of life) and earlier interventions, the survival rate for those born with this disease has improved dramatically, such that most people will now live into adulthood. Exercise training and physical activity interventions are known to improve fitness, physical activity, survival and quality of life in healthy people, but it is not clear how effective these programmes are for people with long‐term medical conditions. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies in September 2019 and identified 15 studies involving 924 participants. The studies used three main types of interventions, including programmes designed to increase physical activity, aerobic fitness and health‐related quality of life and compared physical activity intervention and control interventions in people with congenital heart disease.  
Key results
We included 15 trials with 924 participants. Half of the participants were female. Of the 15 trials, 5 used a total of 500 young people (less than 18 years of age) and 10 trials used a total of 424 adult participants. We found that physical fitness and physical activity may slightly increase but we are very uncertain about quality of life. There is currently no data to say if this small increase in fitness will result in fewer visits to the hospital. But there were no recorded deaths or serious events that were related to participation in physical activity. 
Quality of evidence
Using a validated scientific approach (GRADE), the certainty in the evidence base was moderate for fitness, low for physical activity and very low for quality of life. Most outcomes were limited due to small study participant numbers and poor reporting of study details.

## Plain Title: Staying Active with Heart Problems from Birth

### Rationale

Your heart works to pump blood through your body. Some people are born with heart problems. This is called congenital heart disease. It means their heart does not work as it should.

People with this problem often live shorter lives. They may not be as fit. Their daily life may be harder. But doctors are better at finding these problems early. Surgeries also help more people live to be adults.

Staying active is good for your heart. It helps healthy people live longer. It makes them feel better. But we do not know if this is true for people with heart problems from birth. This study looked at exercise for these people. We wanted to see if it helps them.

### Trial Design

This study asked, ""How do we learn about being active with heart problems?""

We looked at past studies. These studies tested ways to help people be more active. Some focused on exercise training. Others helped people move more in their daily lives. Some helped with breathing.

These studies compared being active to usual care. Usual care means not doing a special activity program. We looked for studies that included people with heart problems from birth. We found 15 studies to review. These studies included 924 people.

Some studies had young people, under 18 years old. Other studies had adults. We looked at how these programs affected their health. We checked their fitness. We also looked at how much they moved. We also checked how good their lives felt.

### Results

We looked at 15 studies. A total of 924 people took part. About half of these people were women.

Five studies had 500 young people. Ten studies had 424 adults.

We found that being active might help. It could make people a little more fit. It could also make them move a little more. But we are not sure how much it helps their daily life. We do not know if more fitness means fewer trips to the hospital.

Good news: No one died because of these activities. No one had serious harm from them either.

We think the proof for fitness is fair. The proof for daily activity is not strong. The proof for how good life feels is very weak. This is because many studies had few people. They also did not share all their details.

More studies are needed to be sure. But it seems safe for people with heart problems from birth to be active.","Physical activity interventions for people with congenital heart disease

10.1002-14651858.CD013694.pub2,"Background
Tuberculosis is a leading cause of infectious disease‐related death and is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of specific rapid molecular tests, including Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra, as initial diagnostic tests for the detection of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. However, the WHO estimates that nearly one‐third of all active tuberculosis cases go undiagnosed and unreported. We were interested in whether a single test, Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra, could be useful as a screening test to close this diagnostic gap and improve tuberculosis case detection. 
Objectives
To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in adults, irrespective of signs or symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in high‐risk groups and in the general population. Screening ""irrespective of signs or symptoms"" refers to screening of people who have not been assessed for the presence of tuberculosis symptoms (e.g. cough). 
To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for detecting rifampicin resistance in adults screened for tuberculosis, irrespective of signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in high‐risk groups and in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched 12 databases including the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE and Embase, on 19 March 2020 without language restrictions. We also reviewed reference lists of included articles and related Cochrane Reviews, and contacted researchers in the field to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Cross‐sectional and cohort studies in which adults (15 years and older) in high‐risk groups (e.g. people living with HIV, household contacts of people with tuberculosis) or in the general population were screened for pulmonary tuberculosis using Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra. For tuberculosis detection, the reference standard was culture. For rifampicin resistance detection, the reference standards were culture‐based drug susceptibility testing and line probe assays. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form and assessed risk of bias and applicability using QUADAS‐2. We used a bivariate random‐effects model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) separately for tuberculosis detection and rifampicin resistance detection. We estimated all models using a Bayesian approach. For tuberculosis detection, we first estimated screening accuracy in distinct high‐risk groups, including people living with HIV, household contacts, people residing in prisons, and miners, and then in several high‐risk groups combined. 
Main results
We included a total of 21 studies: 18 studies (13,114 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for pulmonary tuberculosis and one study (571 participants) evaluated both Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Three studies (159 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance. Fifteen studies (75%) were conducted in high tuberculosis burden and 16 (80%) in high TB/HIV‐burden countries. We judged most studies to have low risk of bias in all four QUADAS‐2 domains and low concern for applicability. 
Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as screening tests for pulmonary tuberculosis 
In people living with HIV (12 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CrI) were 61.8% (53.6 to 69.9) (602 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and 98.8% (98.0 to 99.4) (4173 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 50 have tuberculosis on culture, 40 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive; of these, 9 (22%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); and 960 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; of these, 19 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives). 
In people living with HIV (1 study), Xpert Ultra sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) were 69% (57 to 80) (68 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 98% (97 to 99) (503 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 50 have tuberculosis on culture, 53 would be Xpert Ultra‐positive; of these, 19 (36%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); and 947 would be Xpert Ultra‐negative; of these, 16 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives). 
In non‐hospitalized people in high‐risk groups (5 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 69.4% (47.7 to 86.2) (337 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and 98.8% (97.2 to 99.5) (8619 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 10 have tuberculosis on culture, 19 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive; of these, 12 (63%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); and 981 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; of these, 3 (0%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives). 
We did not identify any studies using Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra for screening in the general population. 
Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for rifampicin resistance 
Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity was 81% and 100% (2 studies, 20 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and specificity was 94% to 100%, (3 studies, 139 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Of the high‐risks groups evaluated, Xpert MTB/RIF applied as a screening test was accurate for tuberculosis in high tuberculosis burden settings. Sensitivity and specificity were similar in people living with HIV and non‐hospitalized people in high‐risk groups. In people living with HIV, Xpert Ultra sensitivity was slightly higher than that of Xpert MTB/RIF and specificity similar. As there was only one study of Xpert Ultra in this analysis, results should be interpreted with caution. There were no studies that evaluated the tests in people with diabetes mellitus and other groups considered at high‐risk for tuberculosis, or in the general population. 
","## Finding Hidden TB: A New Way to Check for Sickness

### Rationale

Tuberculosis, or TB, is a very serious sickness. It is one of the main causes of death from germs around the world. Many people get sick with TB each year. Sadly, many people with TB do not know they have it. This means they do not get the help they need. They can also pass the sickness to others.

There are quick tests for TB, like Xpert MTB/RIF. These tests usually check people who already have signs of TB. But we wanted to see if these tests could find TB in people who do not have signs. We hoped this would help find more people with TB. Finding more cases means more people can get well. It also helps stop the spread of TB.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. We searched large health databases. We looked for studies that used Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra. These tests checked adults for TB. The adults were 15 years or older. They were in groups that have a higher chance of getting TB. This included people with HIV. It also included people who live with someone who has TB. Some studies looked at people in prisons or mines.

The main goal was to see how well these tests worked. We wanted to know if they could find TB. We also checked if they could find TB that resists common medicines. For TB, we compared the test results to a lab test called a culture. A culture is a very sure way to find TB. For drug resistance, we used other lab tests. The study did not ask people to be in it for a certain amount of time. Instead, it gathered past results from many studies.

### Results

We looked at 21 studies in total. These studies included over 13,000 people. Most studies focused on Xpert MTB/RIF. Only one study looked at Xpert Ultra. Many of these studies were in places where TB is common.

**Finding TB with Xpert MTB/RIF:**

*   **For people with HIV:** The test found TB in about 6 out of 10 people who had it. It correctly said ""no TB"" in almost all people who did not have it. If 1,000 people with HIV were tested, and 50 truly had TB, the test would say 40 had TB. Out of those 40, 9 would not actually have TB. Out of the 960 people the test said did not have TB, 19 actually did.
*   **For other high-risk people (not in the hospital):** The test found TB in about 7 out of 10 people who had it. It correctly said ""no TB"" in almost all people who did not have it. If 1,000 people from these groups were tested, and 10 truly had TB, the test would say 19 had TB. Out of those 19, 12 would not actually have TB. Out of the 981 people the test said did not have TB, 3 actually did.

**Finding TB with Xpert Ultra (for people with HIV, from one study):**

*   This test found TB in about 7 out of 10 people who had it. It correctly said ""no TB"" in almost all people who did not have it. If 1,000 people with HIV were tested, and 50 truly had TB, the test would say 53 had TB. Out of those 53, 19 would not actually have TB. Out of the 947 people the test said did not have TB, 16 actually did.

We did not find any studies that used these tests to check everyone in the general public.

**Finding drug-resistant TB with Xpert MTB/RIF:**

*   This test was good at finding TB that resists a medicine called rifampicin. It found resistance in 8 to 10 out of 10 people who had it. It correctly said ""no resistance"" in about 9 to 10 out of 10 people who did not have it.

The study showed that Xpert MTB/RIF can be a good way to check for TB. This is true for groups that have a high chance of getting TB. The Xpert Ultra test might be a bit better at finding TB in people with HIV. But we need more studies for Xpert Ultra. These tests help find TB in people who do not show signs of being sick. This is important to help more people get well. It also helps to stop TB from spreading.","How accurate are sputum Xpert tests for screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults whether or not they have tuberculosis symptoms? 
Why is using Xpert tests to screen for pulmonary tuberculosis important? 
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of infectious disease‐related death and one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using specific rapid tests as initial tests for diagnosing tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. However, the WHO estimates that nearly one‐third of all active tuberculosis cases go undiagnosed and unreported. Not recognizing tuberculosis when it is present (a false negative test result) may result in illness and death and an increased risk of infecting others. An incorrect diagnosis of tuberculosis (false‐positive result) may mean that people are given antibiotics when there is no benefit to be gained. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as screening tests for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults whether or not they have tuberculosis symptoms (such as cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats). We were interested in how the tests worked in groups at high risk for tuberculosis, including people living with HIV (PLHIV), household contacts of people with tuberculosis, miners, people residing in prisons, people with diabetes, and in the general public. 
What was studied in this review? 
Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are rapid tests for simultaneously diagnosing tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. We combined study results to determine: 
‐ sensitivity: people with tuberculosis (rifampicin resistance) correctly diagnosed as having the condition. 
‐ specificity: people without tuberculosis (rifampicin resistance) correctly identified as not having the condition. 
The closer sensitivity and specificity are to 100%, the better the test.
What are the main results in this review? 
Twenty‐one studies: 18 studies (13,114 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for pulmonary tuberculosis and one study (571 participants) evaluated both Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Three studies (159 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance. 
For every 1000 people tested, if 50 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard:
PLHIV 
‐ Xpert MTB/RIF (12 studies):
· 40 people would test positive, including 9 without tuberculosis (62% sensitivity)
· 960 people would test negative, including 19 with tuberculosis (99% specificity)
‐ Xpert Ultra (1 study):
· 53 people would test positive, including 19 without tuberculosis (69% sensitivity)
· 947 people would test negative, including 16 with tuberculosis (98% specificity)
For every 1000 people tested, if 10 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard:
Other high‐risk groups combined 
‐ Xpert MTB/RIF (5 studies):
· 19 people would test positive, including 12 without tuberculosis (69% sensitivity)
· 981 people would test negative, including 3 with tuberculosis (99% specificity)
For detection of rifampicin resistance, Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity was 81% and 100% (2 studies) and specificity was 94% to 100% (3 studies). 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
In the included studies, the reference standards for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis (culture) and rifampicin resistance (drug susceptibility testing) are likely to have been reliable methods for deciding whether patients really had the conditions. We were fairly confident in the results for Xpert MTB/RIF in PLHIV, and less so for other high‐risk groups. Not enough people have been studied to be confident about the results for Xpert Ultra or for detection of rifampicin resistance. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were mainly performed in high tuberculosis and high HIV burden settings. No studies evaluated the tests in people with diabetes mellitus or the general population. 
What are the implications of this review? 
In PLHIV, Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test was accurate for tuberculosis in high tuberculosis burden settings. In high‐risk groups, Xpert MTB/RIF may assist in identifying tuberculosis, but the certainty of evidence is low. In PLHIV, Xpert Ultra sensitivity was slightly higher than that of Xpert MTB/RIF and specificity similar based on one study. There were few studies and few people tested for rifampicin resistance and no studies that evaluated the tests in people with diabetes or in the general population.

Road traffic suicides are common. However, due to the difficulty in distinguishing between motor vehicle crash fatalities and actual suicides, no official figures exist for this method of suicide. Restricting access to means is an important universal or population‐based approach to suicide prevention with clear evidence of its effectiveness. However, the evidence with respect to means restriction for the prevention of suicide on roads is not well established. We conducted a systematic review to assess the impact of restrictions on the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to restrict the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Transport Research International Documentation (TRID) Database from the date of database inception to March 2020. We conducted searches of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. We applied no date, language, or publication status restrictions to these searches. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials, controlled intervention studies without randomisation, before‐after studies, or studies using interrupted time series designs, which evaluated interventions to restrict the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened abstracts and full‐text publications against the inclusion criteria. Two review authors planned to independently extract data and assess risk of bias of included studies. However, we identified no studies eligible for inclusion. 
Main results
We identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review highlights the paucity of research around road traffic suicides and the need for future robust studies that aim to investigate the effectiveness of interventions to prevent suicide on roads. Suicide ascertainment is a key issue; therefore, clear objective criteria are necessary in order to scale up and study this method more accurately. In the absence of any substantial evidence, we advocate for more awareness on road traffic suicides and its inclusion in future government suicide prevention policies. Further research exploring effective measures, particularly those that do not require driver compliance, are also needed. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title: Preventing Suicides on Our Roads

### Rationale

It is sad when someone ends their life. Some people use cars or roads to do this. It is hard to know how many do. This is because it is tough to tell the difference. Was it an accident, or was it a suicide? No one has exact numbers for this.

Stopping access to ways people use to harm themselves can help. This is a good way to stop suicides in general. There is clear proof this works. But, we do not know much about stopping suicides on roads. We need to learn more about this. We need to know if taking away things used for suicide on roads helps. This study looked for other studies about this very topic.

### Trial Design

How did we do this study? We looked for past research. We checked many sources of health studies. These sources included: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and TRID. We looked from when these sources first started up to March 2020. We also looked for new studies not yet fully public. We checked the World Health Organization site and ClinicalTrials.gov. We did not limit by date or language.

We wanted specific kinds of studies. We looked for studies that used groups of people. Some studies compare a new way to an old way. Some studies look at things before and after a change. Other studies look at changes over time. All these studies needed to test ways to stop access to suicide means on roads. We wanted to see if these efforts worked.

Two people checked each study found. They read the short summaries and full papers. They looked for studies that met our rules. They also planned to check how well those studies were done. But, we did not find any studies that fit.

### Results

What did we find? We found no studies that met our rules. This means there is not much research on this topic. We need more strong studies. These studies should look at ways to stop suicides on roads.

It is hard to know for sure if a death on the road was a suicide. We need better ways to tell. This will help us study this problem more clearly.

There is no strong proof yet. So, we ask people to learn more about road suicides. We want leaders to add this to plans to stop suicide. We also need more research. We need to find ways that work to prevent these deaths. Especially ways that do not rely on drivers doing something different.","Means restriction to prevent suicide on roads
Why is this review important? 
Road traffic suicides are difficult to distinguish from motor vehicle crash fatalities and, therefore, no official figures exist for this method of suicide. Limiting access to lethal methods used for suicide (called means restriction) is an important universal or population strategy for preventing suicide. While there is evidence that means restriction is an effective approach for preventing suicides, the evidence for preventing suicide on roads is not well established. Therefore, this review aimed to explore the impact restriction of access would have on suicide on roads. 
Searching for evidence 
We searched several medical databases to find studies that assessed the impact of restricting access to means of suicide on roads. We searched the databases up to March 2020. We also searched international trial registries for unpublished and ongoing studies. Our main outcomes of interest were suicide and attempted suicide or self‐harm. 
Key results 
We found no studies eligible for inclusion in the review. As a result, we cannot draw any conclusions as to the effectiveness of means restriction interventions for the prevention of suicide on roads. Determining suicidal intent is a major problem in road crash fatalities, therefore clear objective criteria are necessary in order to scale up, study and understand this method of suicide more accurately. Improved awareness of suicide on roads in suicide prevention activities is needed, as well as, its inclusion in future government suicide prevention policies. Robust studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions to prevent suicide on roads are urgently required

10.1002-14651858.CD013740.pub2,"Mindfulness for improving mental well‐being in medical students and junior doctors
Why is this review important? 
The medical profession is recognised for its challenging and demanding nature. Medical students and junior doctors have been identified as having increased personal and professional stressors during their years of training. As a result, they face increased strain on their mental well‐being. It is important that this group is supported in their mental well‐being to ensure an overall balance in health, as well as to aid their responsibilities of patient care and patient safety. Furthermore, medical students and junior doctors are often time‐poor. Therefore, it is important to establish whether mindfulness is an effective intervention which justifies its time commitment. There are no previous Cochrane Reviews examining mindfulness in our target population.  
Who will be interested in this review? 
Medical students and junior doctors; other medical professionals at different levels of training and expertise; and institutions such as universities and hospitals involved in the education and training of medical students.  
What question does this review aim to answer? 
What effects do mindfulness‐based psychological interventions have on the mental well‐being of medical students and junior doctors? 
Which studies were included in this review? 
We searched databases to find all studies of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors published up to October 2021. In order to be included in this review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to groups using a random method). Studies needed to include medical students from any year level or junior doctors in postgraduate years one, two or three. We did not exclude any studies based on participants' age, nationality or pre‐existing health conditions. We included 10 studies with a total of 731 participants in the analysis.  
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
Overall, we did not identify any evidence of an effect of mindfulness‐based interventions on anxiety or depression symptoms. However, mindfulness‐based interventions appeared to have a small positive effect on stress and a borderline positive effect on burnout. We were unable to report if mindfulness‐based interventions had any effect on deliberate self‐harm, suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour as no studies examined these outcomes. Lastly, as many studies lacked longer‐term follow‐up of participants, it is not possible to comment on the long‐term effects of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors.  
We rated the overall certainty of evidence as 'low' or 'very low'. 
What should happen next? 
While there were no strong positive findings from the review, some results regarding mindfulness and stress outcomes suggest that there needs to be further research into mindfulness. Any future research should be rigorously designed, and ideally, include assessments of the longer‐term impact of mindfulness.   
","Here is a Plain Language Summary based on the provided abstract:

## Plain Title
Mindfulness for Medical Students and Junior Doctors: Does It Help Their Minds?

## Rationale
Being a doctor or a student learning to be one is very hard work. These roles can be very stressful. Medical students and junior doctors often feel a lot of pressure. This pressure can hurt their mental health. Good mental health is key for these people. It helps them stay healthy. It also helps them care for patients well and keep patients safe.

These busy people do not have much extra time. So, we need to know if mindfulness is a good use of their time. Mindfulness is a way to focus on the present moment. We want to see if it helps their minds feel better. No one has looked at this before for this group. We think mindfulness might help them feel less stressed.

## Trial Design
This study looked at other studies. We searched many places for research up to October 2021. We wanted to find studies about mindfulness for medical students and junior doctors. The studies had to be ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance.

We included students at any level. We also included junior doctors in their first three years after medical school. We did not care about their age, where they were from, or if they had other health problems. We found 10 studies. A total of 731 people took part in these studies. This study itself did not involve people directly. It looked at what other studies found.

## Results
We did not find strong proof that mindfulness helped with worry or feeling sad. But mindfulness seemed to help a little with stress. It also seemed to help a little with feeling worn out from work, also called burnout.

No studies looked at if mindfulness helped with self-harm or thoughts of suicide. We also cannot say if mindfulness helps over a long time. Many studies did not follow people long enough. We rated the proof as ""low"" or "" very low."" This means we are not very sure about the results.

Even so, the small help with stress suggests we should study mindfulness more. Future studies need to be done very carefully. They should also check if mindfulness helps for a long time.","Mindfulness for improving mental well‐being in medical students and junior doctors

What question does this review aim to answer? 
What effects do mindfulness‐based psychological interventions have on the mental well‐being of medical students and junior doctors? 
Which studies were included in this review? 
We searched databases to find all studies of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors published up to October 2021. In order to be included in this review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to groups using a random method). Studies needed to include medical students from any year level or junior doctors in postgraduate years one, two or three. We did not exclude any studies based on participants' age, nationality or pre‐existing health conditions. We included 10 studies with a total of 731 participants in the analysis.  
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
Overall, we did not identify any evidence of an effect of mindfulness‐based interventions on anxiety or depression symptoms. However, mindfulness‐based interventions appeared to have a small positive effect on stress and a borderline positive effect on burnout. We were unable to report if mindfulness‐based interventions had any effect on deliberate self‐harm, suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour as no studies examined these outcomes. Lastly, as many studies lacked longer‐term follow‐up of participants, it is not possible to comment on the long‐term effects of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors.  
We rated the overall certainty of evidence as 'low' or 'very low'. 
What should happen next? 
While there were no strong positive findings from the review, some results regarding mindfulness and stress outcomes suggest that there needs to be further research into mindfulness. Any future research should be rigorously designed, and ideally, include assessments of the longer‐term impact of mindfulness.

Review question 
How does key‐hole (laparoscopic) abdominal surgery compare with standard access (open) abdominal operation for people with pancreatic cancer? 
Background 
The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen that secretes pancreatic juice that aids digestion and contains cells that produce important hormones such as insulin. The pancreas can be divided into the head of the pancreas (right part of the pancreas) and the body and tail of the pancreas (left part or distal part of the pancreas). Distal pancreatic cancer is cancer of the body and/or tail of the pancreas. Removal of distal pancreatic cancer by surgery (distal pancreatectomy) is the preferred treatment for people with distal pancreatic cancers limited to the pancreas who are likely to withstand major surgery, because no other treatments have the potential to cure pancreatic cancer. Cancer can be removed through an abdominal operation, either laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy or open distal pancreatectomy. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is a relatively new procedure as compared with the well‐established open distal pancreatectomy. In operations on other parts of the body, laparoscopic surgery has been shown to reduce complications and length of hospital stay as compared with open surgery. However, concerns remain about the safety of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy in terms of complications after operation (postoperative complications). In addition, it is not clear whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy achieves the same amount of cancer clearance as is attained by open distal pancreatectomy. It also is not clear whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is better than open distal pancreatectomy in terms of earlier recovery after operation. We sought to resolve this issue by searching the medical literature for studies on this topic until June 2015. 
Study characteristics 
No randomised controlled trials have examined this topic. Randomised controlled trials are the best studies for finding out whether one treatment is better or worse than another because they ensure that similar types of people are receiving the treatments being assessed. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, we sought information from non‐randomised studies. We identified 12 non‐randomised studies that compared laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy in a total of 1576 patients. One of these studies did not provide results in a useable way. Thus, we included 11 studies in which a total of 1506 patients underwent distal pancreatectomy. Some 353 patients underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, and 1153 patients underwent open distal pancreatectomy. In all studies, historical information was collected from hospital records (retrospective studies). In general, historical information is less reliable than newly collected (prospective) information and findings of randomised controlled trials. 
Key results 
Differences in short‐term deaths, long‐term deaths, percentage of people with major complications, percentage of people with a pancreatic fistula (abnormal communication between the pancreas and other organs or the skin), recurrence of cancer at final time of follow‐up of participants, percentage of people with any complications and percentage of patients in whom cancer was not completely removed were imprecise. Average length of hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group than in the open group by about two days. However, this is not relevant until we can be sure that cancer cures are similar between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery. No studies have reported quality of life at any point in time, short‐term recurrence of cancer, time to return to normal activity, time to return to work or blood transfusion requirements. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was very low, mainly because it was not clear whether similar types of participants received laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy. In many studies, people with less extensive cancer received laparoscopic surgery, and those with more extensive cancer received open surgery. This makes study findings unreliable. Well‐designed randomised controlled trials are necessary if we are to obtain good quality evidence on this topic. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title
Key-Hole Surgery versus Standard Surgery for Pancreatic Cancer

### Rationale
The pancreas is a body part in your belly. It helps you digest food. It also makes hormones, like insulin, that control blood sugar.

Sometimes, cancer grows in the left part of the pancreas. This is called distal pancreatic cancer. Surgery is the best way to treat this cancer. It can cure the cancer if it has not spread.

There are two main ways to do this surgery. One is standard surgery, where doctors make a large cut. This is called open surgery. The other is key-hole surgery, where doctors make small cuts. This is called laparoscopic surgery.

For other body parts, key-hole surgery can lead to fewer problems and a shorter stay in the hospital. But for pancreatic cancer, we don't know if key-hole surgery is as safe. We also don't know if it removes all the cancer as well as standard surgery. And we want to know if people get better faster with key-hole surgery.

This study looked at past medical papers to find answers. We wanted to see if key-hole surgery is a good choice for people with pancreatic cancer.

### Trial Design
How is this study designed?

Doctors looked at many old medical papers. These papers compared key-hole surgery and standard surgery for pancreatic cancer. The papers shared facts from hospital records. This kind of study looks back at what happened in the past.

The study included 11 medical papers. These papers had facts from 1506 patients in total. Some 353 patients had key-hole surgery. And 1153 patients had standard surgery.

The papers did not say if people in each group were the same. For example, some papers showed that people with less serious cancer had key-hole surgery. People with more serious cancer had standard surgery. This can make the study results less clear.

We could not find studies where people were put into groups by chance. These ""randomized controlled trials"" are the best kind of studies. They make sure groups are alike. This helps us know if one treatment is truly better.

### Results
What were the main results of the study?

We did not find clear answers for many things. We could not tell if key-hole surgery changed how many people died soon after surgery. We also could not tell about deaths later on. It was not clear if one surgery caused more big problems. It was also not clear if a problem called a pancreatic fistula was more common. This is when the pancreas leaks.

We could not tell if the cancer came back more often with one type of surgery. And we could not tell if one surgery removed all the cancer better.

We did find one thing. People who had key-hole surgery stayed in the hospital for about two fewer days. This is good, but it is not the most important thing. We need to be sure that both surgeries cure cancer just as well.

The papers did not talk about how surgery affected people's lives. They did not say when people could go back to normal life or work. They also did not say how much blood people needed during surgery.

The information we found was not very strong. This is because the studies were not set up in the best way. We need better studies to truly know if key-hole surgery is better for pancreatic cancer. Doctors need to do studies where patients are put into groups by chance. This would give us clearer answers.","Key‐hole (laparoscopic) versus standard access (open) abdominal operation for people with pancreatic cancer

10.1002-14651858.CD013198.pub2,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. Acute exacerbations punctuate the natural history of COPD and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and disease progression. Chronic airflow limitation is caused by a combination of small airways (bronchitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema), which can impact day‐to‐day activities and overall quality of life. In carefully selected patients with COPD, long‐term, prophylactic use of antibiotics may reduce bacterial load, inflammation of the airways, and the frequency of exacerbations. 
Objectives
To assess effects of different prophylactic antibiotics on exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events in people with COPD in three separate network meta‐analyses (NMAs), and to provide rankings of identified antibiotics. 
Search methods
To identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs), we searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials and clinical trials registries. We conducted the most recent search on 22 January 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs with a parallel design of at least 12 weeks' duration evaluating long‐term administration of antibiotics prophylactically compared with other antibiotics, or placebo, for patients with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
This Cochrane Review collected and updated pair‐wise data from two previous Cochrane Reviews. Searches were updated and additional studies included. We conducted three separate network meta‐analyses (NMAs) within a Bayesian framework to assess three outcomes: exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events. For quality of life, we collected data from St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Using previously validated methods, we selected the simplest model that could adequately fit the data for every analysis. We used threshold analysis to indicate which results were robust to potential biases, taking into account each study’s contributions to the overall results and network structure. Probability ranking was performed for each antibiotic class for exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events. 
Main results
Characteristics of studies and participants  
Eight trials were conducted at multiple sites that included hospital clinics or academic health centres. Seven were single‐centre trials conducted in hospital clinics. Two trials did not report settings. Trials durations ranged from 12 to 52 weeks. Most participants had moderate to severe disease. Mean age ranged from 64 years to 73 years, and more males were recruited (51% to 100%). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) ranged from 0.935 to 1.36 L. Most participants had previous exacerbations. Data from 12 studies were included in the NMAs (3405 participants; 16 treatment arms including placebo). Prophylactic antibiotics evaluated were macrolides (azithromycin and erythromycin), tetracyclines (doxycyclines), quinolones (moxifloxacin) and macrolides plus tetracyclines (roxithromycin plus doxycycline). 
Risk of bias and threshold analysis  
Most studies were at low risk across domains, except detection bias, for which only seven studies were judged at low risk. In the threshold analysis for exacerbations, all comparisons in which one antibiotic was compared with another were robust to sampling variation, especially macrolide comparisons. Comparisons of classes with placebo were sensitive to potential bias, especially macrolide versus placebo, therefore, any bias in the comparison was likely to favour the active class, so any adjustment would bring the estimated relative effect closer to the null value, thus quinolone may become the best class to prevent exacerbations. 
Exacerbations  
Nine studies were included (2732 participants) in this NMA (exacerbations analysed as time to first exacerbation or people with one or more exacerbations). Macrolides and quinolones reduced exacerbations. Macrolides had a greater effect in reducing exacerbations compared with placebo (macrolides: hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.60 to 0.75; quinolones: HR 0.89, 95% CrI 0.75 to 1.04), resulting in 127 fewer people per 1000 experiencing exacerbations on macrolides. The difference in exacerbations between tetracyclines and placebo was uncertain (HR 1.29, 95% CrI 0.66 to 2.41). Macrolides ranked first (95% CrI first to second), with quinolones ranked second (95% CrI second to third). Tetracyclines ranked fourth, which was lower than placebo (ranked third). Contributing studies were considered as low risk of bias in a threshold analysis. 
Quality of life (SGRQ)  
Seven studies were included (2237 participants) in this NMA. SGRQ scores improved with macrolide treatment compared with placebo (fixed effect‐fixed class effect: mean difference (MD) ‐2.30, 95% CrI ‐3.61 to ‐0.99), but the mean difference did not reach the minimally clinical important difference (MCID) of 4 points. Tetracyclines and quinolones did not improve quality of life any more than placebo, and we did not detect a difference between antibiotic classes. 
Serious adverse events  
Nine studies were included (3180 participants) in the NMA. Macrolides reduced the odds of a serious adverse event compared with placebo (fixed effect‐fixed class effect: odds ratio (OR) 0.76, 95% CrI 0.62 to 0.93). There was probably little to no difference in the effect of quinolone compared with placebo or tetracycline plus macrolide compared with placebo. There was probably little to no difference in serious adverse events between quinolones or tetracycline plus macrolide. With macrolide treatment 49 fewer people per 1000 experienced a serious adverse event compared with those given placebo. Macrolides ranked first, followed by quinolones. Tetracycline did not rank better than placebo. 
Drug resistance  
Ten studies reported drug resistance. Results were not combined due to variation in outcome measures. All studies concluded that prophylactic antibiotic administration was associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance. 
Authors' conclusions
This NMA evaluated the safety and efficacy of different antibiotics used prophylactically for COPD patients. Compared to placebo, prolonged administration of macrolides (ranked first) appeared beneficial in prolonging the time to next exacerbation, improving quality of life, and reducing serious adverse events. No clear benefits were associated with use of quinolones or tetracyclines. In addition, antibiotic resistance was a concern and could not be thoroughly assessed in this review. Given the trade‐off between effectiveness, safety, and risk of antibiotic resistance, prophylactic administration of antibiotics may be best reserved for selected patients, such as those experiencing frequent exacerbations. However, none of the eligible studies excluded patients with previously isolated non‐tuberculous mycobacteria, which would contraindicate prophylactic administration of antibiotics, due to the risk of developing resistant non‐tuberculous mycobacteria. 
","## How Antibiotics Can Help Lung Disease Patients

### Rationale

COPD is a serious lung problem. It makes it hard to breathe. This disease can cause flare-ups. These flare-ups make you very sick. They can also make your disease worse. COPD can affect daily life. It lowers your quality of life.

Some doctors think antibiotics can help. They might lower bad bugs in the lungs. They could also calm down lung swelling. This might mean fewer sick days for patients. This study looked at different antibiotics. It wanted to see which ones worked best. It also checked if they were safe.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. It gathered information from them. These studies were carefully chosen. Each study lasted at least 12 weeks. They compared antibiotics. They also compared antibiotics to a fake pill (placebo).

The people in these studies had COPD. Most had moderate to severe disease. Their average age was from 64 to 73 years old. More men took part than women. All had trouble breathing. Most had been sick with flare-ups before.

This study looked at 12 of these studies. A total of 3405 people were included. They took different types of antibiotics. These included macrolides, tetracyclines, and quinolones. Some also took two types together.

The study looked at three main things. It checked how often people got sick. It looked at their quality of life. It also noted any serious side effects. The study used special math to combine all the results.

### Results

**Fewer Sick Days:**

Antibiotics called macrolides helped a lot. They made people less likely to get sick. For every 1000 people, 127 fewer got sick on macrolides. Quinolones also helped. Tetracyclines did not show a clear benefit. Macrolides were the best at stopping flare-ups. Quinolones were the second best.

**Better Quality of Life:**

Macrolides also made people feel better. They improved quality of life scores. But this change was small. It was not a big improvement. Other antibiotics did not help people feel better.

**Fewer Bad Side Effects:**

Macrolides also lowered serious side effects. For every 1000 people, 49 fewer had a serious side effect. This was compared to those who took a fake pill. Quinolones also seemed to help. Tetracyclines did not show a clear benefit here. Macrolides were the best at lowering side effects.

**Antibiotic Resistance:**

The study found a worry. Taking antibiotics for a long time can cause problems. It can make bugs stronger. This means antibiotics might not work as well later. This issue needs more study.

**What We Learned:**

Taking macrolide antibiotics for a long time helped. It meant fewer sick days. It also made people feel a little better. And it lowered serious side effects. Quinolones also showed some good results. Other antibiotics were not as helpful.

But doctors need to be careful. Giving antibiotics often can make them stop working. So, these antibiotics may be best for some patients. For example, those who get sick very often. More studies are needed to understand the risks.","Prophylactic antibiotics for people with COPD
Review question 
Which preventative antibiotic is effective and safe for reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life, and reducing serious side effects in people with COPD? 
What is COPD? 
COPD is a lung condition that can cause long‐term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Flare‐ups (so‐called exacerbations) can be triggered by infection or inflammation, causing worsening symptoms and lung damage. Frequent exacerbations can lead to reduced quality of life and can increase the risk of death. 
Why did we do this review? 
We wanted to find out if one type of preventative antibiotic was better than another in reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life, and reducing side effects. We did this by using information from two previous reviews and comparing different antibiotics with each other, and with a control treatment (called placebo), by creating networks. As information was limited, the networks allowed us to combine information and determine the best preventative antibiotics by ranking them in order of ability to reduce exacerbations, improve quality of life, and reduce serious side effects. 
What evidence did we find? 
We tested three types of antibiotics: macrolides, quinolones, and tetracyclines. Macrolides were better in reducing exacerbations compared to control treatment. There was no clear difference in exacerbations when quinolone or tetracycline was compared with a control treatment. Tetracyclines were ranked lower than placebo in reducing exacerbations. We used the data for each antibiotic group to rank antibiotic groups in order of their ability to reduce exacerbations. We found that macrolides ranked first, followed by quinolones (second). Tetracyclines were ranked fourth and were not better than control treatment (ranked third). 
Macrolides improved quality of life compared with control treatment. Quinolones did not appear to impact quality of life, and tetracyclines may have been associated with worsening quality of life compared to control treatment. 
Macrolides were more effective in reducing serious unwanted events. There was no clear benefit for serious unwanted events with quinolone, tetracycline, or combined macrolide plus tetracycline compared with control treatment. 
We could not clearly show benefit or harm of preventative antibiotic use for microbial resistance. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did not find any concerns about the ways in which studies were carried out, except that for some studies, people collecting the information knew (1) which patient was included in which treatment group, and (2) patient results when treatments were completed. Overall, the numerical information was robust and was unlikely to be influenced by differences noted between individual studies. 
Conclusion 
We found that exacerbations were reduced, quality of life was improved, and unwanted events were fewer with macrolides compared with control treatment. We could not determine whether quinolones or tetracyclines were of benefit compared with control treatment. Macrolides were ranked highest, followed by quinolones, which ranked second. Tetracyclines were no better than control treatment (ranked fourth and third, respectively). Although these NMAs show some benefit of using macrolides, they are based on a limited number of studies, and concerns remain about antibiotic resistance with long‐term use of antibiotics.

10.1002-14651858.CD013812,"Background
In response to the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the impact of COVID‐19, national and subnational governments implemented a variety of measures in order to control the spread of the virus and the associated disease. While these measures were imposed with the intention of controlling the pandemic, they were also associated with severe psychosocial, societal, and economic implications on a societal level. One setting affected heavily by these measures is the school setting. By mid‐April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world’s student population. In consideration of the adverse consequences of school closures, many countries around the world reopened their schools in the months after the initial closures. To safely reopen schools and keep them open, governments implemented a broad range of measures. 
The evidence with regards to these measures, however, is heterogeneous, with a multitude of study designs, populations, settings, interventions and outcomes being assessed. To make sense of this heterogeneity, we conducted a rapid scoping review (8 October to 5 November 2020). This rapid scoping review is intended to serve as a precursor to a systematic review of effectiveness, which will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA‐ScR) checklist and was registered with the Open Science Framework. 
Objectives
To identify and comprehensively map the evidence assessing the impacts of measures implemented in the school setting to reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the SARS‐CoV‐2/COVID‐19 pandemic, with particular focus on the types of measures implemented in different school settings, the outcomes used to measure their impacts and the study types used to assess these. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the CDC COVID‐19 Research Articles Downloadable Database for preprints, and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 8 October 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included studies that assessed the impact of measures implemented in the school setting. Eligible populations were populations at risk of becoming infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, or developing COVID‐19 disease, or both, and included people both directly and indirectly impacted by interventions, including students, teachers, other school staff, and contacts of these groups, as well as the broader community. We considered all types of empirical studies, which quantitatively assessed impact including epidemiological studies, modelling studies, mixed‐methods studies, and diagnostic studies that assessed the impact of relevant interventions beyond diagnostic test accuracy. Broad outcome categories of interest included infectious disease transmission‐related outcomes, other harmful or beneficial health‐related outcomes, and societal, economic, and ecological implications. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data from included studies in a standardized manner, and mapped them to categories within our a priori logic model where possible. Where not possible, we inductively developed new categories. In line with standard expectations for scoping reviews, the review provides an overview of the existing evidence regardless of methodological quality or risk of bias, and was not designed to synthesize effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterize strength of evidence (GRADE). 
Main results
We included 42 studies that assessed measures implemented in the school setting. The majority of studies used mathematical modelling designs (n = 31), while nine studies used observational designs, and two studies used experimental or quasi‐experimental designs. Studies conducted in real‐world contexts or using real data focused on the WHO European region (EUR; n = 20), the WHO region of the Americas (AMR; n = 13), the West Pacific region (WPR; n = 6), and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR; n = 1). One study conducted a global assessment and one did not report on data from, or that were applicable to, a specific country. 
Three broad intervention categories emerged from the included studies: organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (n = 36), structural/environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (n = 11), and surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (n = 19). Most studies assessed SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission‐related outcomes (n = 29), while others assessed healthcare utilization (n = 8), other health outcomes (n = 3), and societal, economic, and ecological outcomes (n = 5). Studies assessed both harmful and beneficial outcomes across all outcome categories. 
Authors' conclusions
We identified a heterogeneous and complex evidence base of measures implemented in the school setting. This review is an important first step in understanding the available evidence and will inform the development of rapid reviews on this topic.

## Plain Title: Keeping Schools Open Safely During COVID-19

### Rationale

The COVID-19 sickness spread fast. Many countries closed schools to stop the virus. These closures helped, but they also caused big problems for kids, families, and money. Many schools reopened after a while. They put in place rules to keep everyone safe.

We need to know what rules work best. This study looked at different rules schools used. We wanted to see what kind of studies were done. We also wanted to see what things they measured. This helps us learn how to keep schools open safely.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. It was a fast review of past research. We searched many places for studies about schools and COVID-19. We looked for studies up until October 8, 2020.

We included studies about any rules used in schools. These rules could be about opening schools or keeping them open. The studies involved students, teachers, staff, and their families. They also looked at the whole community. We wanted to see how the rules affected people. We looked at how the virus spread. We also looked at health, money, and other effects.

This type of study maps out what research exists. It does not say if one rule is better than another. It helps us see what we know and what we still need to learn.

### Results

We found 42 studies about school safety rules. Most of these studies used math models to guess what might happen. A few studies looked at real-life situations. These real-life studies came from Europe, North and South America, and the Western Pacific.

The studies looked at three main types of rules. Some rules changed how schools were set up to stop the virus. Other rules changed the school buildings or outdoor areas. Some rules focused on testing to find sick people.

Most studies checked how much the virus spread. Some looked at how many people went to the doctor. Others looked at general health or money problems. The studies found both good and bad results from the rules.

This study shows that many different types of rules were used. It also shows that the studies were very different. This is the first step to understand all the information. It will help make new guides for schools.","Which school‐based measures designed to contain the COVID‐19 pandemic have been evaluated to date, and how were they evaluated? 
Why is this question important? 
To combat the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the impact of COVID‐19, countries worldwide have taken a variety of public health measures. In many countries, shutting schools was one of the earliest responses. By mid‐April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world’s student population. This severely disrupted school, family and work life, with likely negative impacts including: 
‐ a worsening of children’s and adolescents’ health and well‐being;‐ increases in inequalities between children and adolescents from disadvantaged and more privileged backgrounds;‐ possible decreased parental income and job security;‐ possible loss of parental economic productivity. 
Given the potential negative consequences of school closures, many countries have since reopened schools. To avoid disease transmission among students, between staff and students, and beyond, a range of school‐based measures have been put in place. These include: 
‐ students and staff wearing face masks and regularly washing their hands;‐ adapting school activities (for example, not singing in music classes);‐ improving ventilation systems; and‐ screening suspected cases of infection. 
To date, we know little about which school‐based measures designed to contain COVID‐19 have been evaluated, and how they have been evaluated. It is important to find this out, so that, in time, we can compare the effectiveness of different measures and inform future policy guidelines. 
We set out to identify and map the evidence on school‐based measures to contain COVID‐19. This work is intended to form the basis of a future review about the effectiveness of these measures. This review will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
How did we identify and map the evidence? 
First, we searched for studies that evaluated any intervention set in schools designed to prevent the spread of COVID‐19. We considered all types of studies, and a broad range of outcomes, including: 
‐ infectious disease transmission;‐ other harmful or beneficial effects on health;‐ wider implications for society, the economy, and the population. 
We then grouped studies according to how similar or different they were. This allowed us to gauge: 
‐ which types of study have been used to evaluate measures to date;‐ where studies have been conducted;‐ which types of intervention have been evaluated; and‐ which outcomes have been studied. 
What did we find? 
We found 42 studies.
Type of study 
Thirty‐one studies used mathematical modelling designs, to predict the effects of measures on populations. Two studies used experimental designs, in which researchers divide people or settings into groups to compare the effects of different measures. Nine studies used observational designs, in which researchers simply observed the effect of the intervention. 
Study setting 
Studies were conducted in Europe (20 studies), North and South America (13 studies), the West Pacific (6 studies), and the Eastern Mediterranean (1 study). Most studies evaluated measures in more than one school setting (for example, primary education and secondary education). Three studies focused on secondary schools. 
Type of intervention 
Studies evaluated three broad types of measure:
1. Organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (36 studies): these included: 
‐ measures designed to limit risks of disease transmission between people who come into contact with each other (such as face‐masks and physical distancing policies); and‐ measures to reduce opportunities for contact (for example, staggered arrival, break and departure times). 
2. Structural or environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (11 studies): for example, dividing up school playgrounds or improving air circulation. 
3. Surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (19 studies): these included: 
‐ testing, tracing, and symptom screening; and‐ isolation of confirmed cases or quarantine of suspected cases. 
Outcomes studied 
Studies assessed the effects of measures on:
‐ SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission (29 studies), including the number of new cases or the average number of people to whom one infected person will pass the virus (reproduction number R);‐ healthcare use (8 studies), for example, the number of hospitalizations;‐ other health outcomes (3 studies), for example, the risk of developing hand eczema (a skin condition); and‐ societal, economic, and other population‐level outcomes (5 studies), including cost. 
What are the implications of our findings? 
A wide range of school‐based measures designed to contain COVID‐19 have been evaluated to date. To evaluate these, researchers have used different methods and investigated different outcomes. This review is an important first step in gauging what evidence is available, and will inform future rapid reviews on this topic.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD‐1/PD‐L1 axis have changed the first‐line treatment of people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Single‐agent pembrolizumab (a PD‐1 inhibitor) is currently the standard of care as monotherapy in patients with PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50%, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy when PD‐L1 expression is less than 50%. Atezolizumab (PD‐L1 inhibitor) has also been approved in combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab (an anti‐angiogenic antibody) in first‐line NSCLC regardless of PD‐L1 expression. The combination of first‐line PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitors with anti‐CTLA‐4 antibodies has also been shown to improve survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, particularly in people with high tumour mutational burden (TMB). The association of ipilimumab (an anti CTLA4) and nivolumab (PD‐1 inhibitor) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in all patients with PD‐L1 expression ≥1%. Although these antibodies are currently used in clinical practice, some questions remain unanswered, such as the best‐treatment strategy, the role of different biomarkers for treatment selection and the effectiveness of immunotherapy according to specific clinical characteristics. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of first‐line immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), as monotherapy or in combination, compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab for people with advanced NSCLC, according to the level of PD‐L1 expression. 
Search methods
We performed an electronic search of the main databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase) from inception until 31 December 2020 and conferences meetings from 2015 onwards. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy or safety of first‐line ICI treatment for adults with advanced NSCLC who had not previously received any anticancer treatment. We included trials comparing single‐ or double‐ICI treatment to standard first‐line therapy (platinum‐based chemotherapy +/‐ bevacizumab). All data come from ‘international multicentre studies involving adults, age 18 or over, with histologically‐confirmed stage IV NSCLC. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed the search results and a fourth review author resolved any disagreements. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS); secondary outcomes were overall objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v 1.1, grade 3 to 5 treatment‐related adverse events (AEs) (CTCAE v 5.0) and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). We performed meta‐analyses where appropriate using the random‐effects model for hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and used the I² statistic to investigate heterogeneity. 
Main results
Main results 
We identified 15 trials for inclusion, seven completed and eight ongoing trials. We obtained data for 5893 participants from seven trials comparing first‐line single‐ (six trials) or double‐ (two trials) agent ICI with platinum‐based chemotherapy, one trial comparing both first‐line single‐ and double‐agent ICsI with platinum‐based chemotherapy. All trials were at low risk of selection and detection bias, some were classified at high risk of performance, attrition or other source of bias. The overall certainty of evidence according to GRADE ranged from moderate‐to‐low because of risk of bias, inconsistency, or imprecision. The majority of the included trials reported their outcomes by PD‐L1 expressions, with PD‐L1 ≥ 50 being considered the most clinically useful cut‐off level for decision makers. Also, iIn order to avoid overlaps between various PDL‐1 expressions we prioritised the review outcomes according to PD‐L1 ≥ 50. 
Single‐agent ICIIn the PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50% group single‐agent ICI probably improved OS compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.76, 6 RCTs, 2111 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). In this group, single‐agent ICI also may improve PFS (HR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.88, 5 RCTs, 1886 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and ORR (risk ratio (RR):1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75, 4 RCTs, 1672 participants, low‐certainty evidence). HRQoL data were available for only one study including only people with PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50%, which suggested that single‐agent ICI may improve HRQoL at 15 weeks compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 1.51, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.10, 1 RCT, 297 participants, low‐certainty evidence).In the included studies, treatment‐related AEs were not reported according to PD‐L1 expression levels. Grade 3‐4 AEs may be less frequent with single‐agent ICI compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 0.41, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.50, I² = 62%, 5 RCTs, 3346 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
More information about efficacy of single‐agent ICI compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy according to the level of PD‐L1 expression and to TMB status or specific clinical characteristics is available in the full text. 
Double‐agent ICI Double‐ICI treatment probably prolonged OS compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy in people with PD‐L1 expression ≥50% (HR: 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.89 2 RCTs, 612 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence).Trials did not report data on HRQoL, PFS and ORR according to PD‐L1 groups.Treatment related AEs were not reported according to PD‐L1 expression levels. The frequency of grade 3‐4 AEs may not differ between double‐ICI treatment and platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09, I² = 81%, 2 RCTs, 1869 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
More information about efficacy of double‐agent ICI according to the level of PD‐L1 expression and to TMB status is available in the full text. 
Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence in this review suggests that single‐agent ICI in people with NSCLC and PD‐L1 ≥50% probably leads to a higher overall survival rate and may lead to a higher progression‐free survival and overall response rate when compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy and may also lead to a lower rate of adverse events and higher HRQoL. Combined ICI in people with NSCLC and PD‐L1 ≥50% also probably leads to a higher overall survival rate when compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy, but its effect on progression‐free survival, overall response rate and HRQoL is unknown due to a lack of data. The rate of adverse events may not differ between groups. 
This review used to be a living review. It is transitioned out of living mode because current research is exploring ICI in association with chemotherapy or other immunotherapeutic drugs versus ICI as single agent rather than platinum based chemotherapy. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Better Treatment for Lung Cancer

### Rationale

Lung cancer is a very serious disease. It can spread quickly. This causes a lot of problems for patients. Doctors want to find better ways to treat it.

New drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a big step forward. These drugs help your body's immune system fight cancer. They work by blocking certain signals that cancer cells use to hide.

Some ICIs are used alone. Others are used with other drugs. Doctors want to know which ways work best. This study helps answer those questions.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past research. It gathered information from many different studies. These studies included adults with advanced lung cancer. All patients were 18 years or older. They had not received other cancer treatment before.

The studies compared ICI drugs to standard chemotherapy. Some used one ICI drug. Some used two ICI drugs. Others used ICI drugs plus other treatments. Researchers looked at how well the treatments worked. They also looked at side effects.

The studies looked at a marker called PD-L1. This marker helps doctors choose the best treatment. Higher levels of PD-L1 mean certain drugs might work better.

### Results

The study looked at 15 different research trials. Seven of these trials were finished. They included over 5,800 patients.

**One ICI Drug Alone:**
* For patients with high PD-L1 (50% or more), one ICI drug was better. It helped patients live longer.
* It also helped keep the cancer from growing for longer.
* More patients saw their cancer shrink with one ICI drug.
* Patients felt better and had a better quality of life.
* These patients had fewer serious side effects than with chemotherapy.

**Two ICI Drugs Together:**
* For patients with high PD-L1 (50% or more), two ICI drugs also helped patients live longer.
* We do not know yet if two ICI drugs help keep cancer from growing for longer. We also do not know their effect on cancer shrinking or quality of life. More research is needed here.
* The number of serious side effects was about the same as with chemotherapy.

**What This Means for Patients:**
This study shows that ICI drugs are a good choice for advanced lung cancer. Especially for those with high PD-L1. They help patients live longer and often feel better. They can also have fewer side effects than older treatments.

Doctors are still learning the best ways to use these drugs. But this study gives clear steps forward. It helps doctors choose the best treatment for each patient.","Immunotherapy versus chemotherapy for people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer who have not been not previously been treated 
Review question 
Is immunotherapy more effective and less toxic than chemotherapy for people diagnosed with non‐small cell lung cancer (a subtype of lung cancer) who have not previously been treated and who are not suitable for curative treatment? 
Background 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths and non‐small cell lung cancer represent more than 85% of all lung cancer cases. Curative surgery and radiotherapy are not treatment options when the disease is at an advanced stage and until recently these people were offered chemotherapy. Since 2016, immunotherapies (antibodies able to stimulate the immune system against cancer cells) have been shown to improve survival for these patients. 
Side effects of immunotherapies are mainly inflammation of the tissues caused by the activation of the immune system against different organs, while chemotherapy usually causes a reduction in the white blood cells and red blood cells, hair loss, nausea and vomiting.In this Cochrane Review, we tried to find out how effective and safe immunotherapies (given alone or as combinations) are compared to standard chemotherapy for people with non‐small cell lung cancer who are not suitable for possibly curative treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the main databases and records of conference meetings up to 31st December 2020. We included seven studies (5893 participants) comparing immunotherapies (antibodies that interact with specific proteins called immune checkpoints) with chemotherapy for people with non‐small cell lung cancer not previously treated. 
Key results 
We reported the results by PD‐L1 levels (a protein produced by the tumour or immune cells and bound by immune checkpoint inhibitors) 
In people with more than 50% of tumour/immune cells expressing PD‐L1 protein, single immunotherapy might improve survival with fewer side effects. In addition, treatment with combined immunotherapies may improve survival in both people with high expression of PD‐L1 protein.The rate of toxic effects may be the same for people treated with combined immunotherapies or chemotherapy. 
Certainty of evidence 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low.
Conclusions 
For people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer with a high expression of PD‐L1 protein, immunotherapies alone or combinations of immunotherapies prolonged life compared to chemotherapy. The frequency of side effects may be lower with the use of immunotherapies alone compared to chemotherapy. The frequency of side effects may not differ between combinations of immunotherapies and chemotherapy.

10.1002-14651858.CD011082.pub2,"Antimicrobial dressings attached to the central venous catheters in reducing catheter‐related infections in newborn infants 
Review question: In newborn infants who require a central venous catheter, does the use of antiseptic or antibiotic catheter dressing, compared to no dressing, reduce catheter‐related infections? 
Background: Central venous catheters (CVCs) are small tubes inserted into the vein to give fluids, medication and intravenous nutrition to sick patients. The risks of CVCs are well‐known, and can cause infections, which may result in death or serious illnesses. Newborn infants are vulnerable, as they on the one hand require the CVCs to sustain life, and on the other hand are at high risks of the complications, due to their thin skin and poorly‐developed immune system. 
Several measures have been developed to reduce infections in newborn infants. These include hand hygiene for caregivers, skin cleaning for the infants, antibiotics and modification of the catheters including the use of antiseptic or antibiotic‐coated catheter dressing or patch that could be placed on the skin at the CVC insertion site. While promising, these measures need on‐going evaluation. In this review, we synthesized up‐to‐date evidence on the effectiveness and safety of antiseptic or antibiotic dressing as a part of CVC care in sick newborn infants. 
Search date: We performed a search in multiple medical databases in September 2015. 
Study characteristics: Three studies (total participants: 855) fit our inclusion criteria. There were two main comparisons: i) chlorhexidine dressing and alcohol skin cleansing against standard polyurethane dressing and povidone‐iodine skin cleansing (from one large study), and ii) silver‐alginate patch against a control group without patch (from two smaller studies). The quality of the included studies are high, except that the people closely involved in the trials such as the care personnel were not masked from knowing whether or not the infants in the study were given antiseptic or antibiotic dressing, which might have affected their recording or interpretation of the results. 
Study funding sources: One of the studies was funded in part by Johnson and Johnson Medical; Children's Foundation; Children's Hospital, Milwaukee and National Institutes of Health. Another study was funded by the Vanderbilt NICU Research Fund. Funding source was not stated in the third study. 
Key results: In our main findings, chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol skin cleansing made no difference to catheter‐related blood stream infection (CRBSI) and blood stream infection (""sepsis"") without an identifiable source, although it significantly reduced the chance of micro‐organisms lodging in the CVCs (""catheter colonisation""), with an average of 9% reduction in risk among newborn infants with a baseline risk of 24% (1 study, 655 infants). However, infants who received chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol skin cleansing were more likely to develop skin irritation (""contact dermatitis""), as 19 out of 335 infants (5.7%) in the chlorhexidine group developed this complication compared to none in the group that received standard dressing/povidone‐iodine cleansing. However, it was unclear whether the dressing or the alcohol solution was mainly responsible for the skin irritation, as the other group did not use alcohol solution for skin cleansing. In the other comparison, silver‐alginate patch made no overall differences in CRBSI and mortality compared to no dressing, neither did it cause any adverse reaction. 
Quality of the evidence: There was moderate‐quality evidence for all the major outcomes. The major factor that affected the quality of evidence was the lack of precision in the result estimates, as the calculated plausible range of the effects (the 95% confidence intervals) were wide. 
Conclusions: Chlorhexidine CVC dressing with alcohol skin cleansing posed a high risk of skin irritation against a modest reduction in catheter colonisation. For silver‐alginate patch, evidence is still insufficient for a clear picture of benefit an harm. We have made recommendations for future research that evaluate these interventions. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Helping Sick Babies with Tubes

### Rationale

Sick babies often need special care. Sometimes, doctors put a small tube into a vein. This tube is a central venous catheter, or CVC. It helps give babies vital fluids and medicine. It can also give them food.

But CVCs can cause problems. They can lead to serious infections. These infections can make babies very sick. They can even be deadly. Young babies are at high risk. Their skin is thin. Their bodies fight germs less well.

Doctors want to stop these infections. They use different ways to do this. One way is to keep hands clean. Another is to clean the baby's skin. Some doctors use special dressings. These dressings have germ-fighting power. They go on the skin where the CVC enters.

This study looked at these special dressings. We wanted to see if they help. Do they keep babies safer from infections? We also looked if they cause any harm.

### Trial Design

This study asked a simple question. Do special dressings reduce infections in babies? We looked at studies that already happened. We searched many medical sites in September 2015.

We found three studies. These studies looked at 855 babies in total. All these babies needed CVCs. The studies compared two main things.

One study looked at a dressing with chlorhexidine. This dressing was used with alcohol to clean skin. It was compared to a standard dressing. That standard dressing used povidone-iodine to clean skin.

Two other studies looked at a silver-alginate patch. This patch was compared to no patch at all.

The studies we found were good quality. But the care staff knew which babies got which dressing. This might have changed how they wrote down results. This is something to keep in mind.

### Results

We looked closely at what we found. The chlorhexidine dressing and alcohol clean did not stop blood infections. It did not stop other blood infections either.

But it did reduce germs on the CVC tube itself. It cut the risk of germs by 9%. This was seen in one study with 655 babies.

However, some babies had a problem. They got skin irritation. This happened more with the chlorhexidine dressing. 19 out of 335 babies got a rash. No babies in the other group got a rash. It is hard to know if the dressing caused it. It could have been the alcohol.

The silver-alginate patch did not make a difference. It did not stop blood infections. It did not change how many babies died. It also did not cause any bad skin reactions.

Our findings were fair. We need more studies to be sure. It is not always clear how much these dressings help.

In conclusion, the chlorhexidine dressing might lower germs. But it can also cause skin problems. We do not know enough about the silver-alginate patch. More research is needed to learn more.","Antimicrobial dressings attached to the central venous catheters in reducing catheter‐related infections in newborn infants

Humour‐based interventions are defined as any intervention that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression, or appreciation of the absurdity or incongruity of life's situations. Humour‐based interventions can be implemented in different settings, including hospitals, nursing homes and day care centres. They have been posed as an adjunct to usual care for people with schizophrenia, but a summary of the evidence is lacking. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of humour‐based interventions as an add‐on intervention to standard care for people with schizophrenia. 
Search methods
On 31 July 2019 and 10 February 2021 we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study‐based register of trials, which is based on CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.Gov, Embase, ISRCTN, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and WHO ICTRP. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing humour‐based interventions with active controls, other psychological interventions, or standard care for people with schizophrenia. We excluded studies fulfilling our prespecified selection criteria but without useable data from further quantitative synthesis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality, following the guidance from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For binary outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean differences (MDs) and their 95% CIs. We assessed risks of bias for included studies and created summary of findings tables using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included three studies in this review for qualitative synthesis, although one study did not report any relevant outcomes. We therefore include two studies (n = 96) in our quantitative synthesis. No data were available on the following prespecified primary outcomes: clinically‐important change in general mental state, clinically‐important change in negative symptoms, clinically‐important change in overall quality of life, and adverse effects. As compared with active control, humour‐based interventions may not improve the average endpoint score of a general mental state scale (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score: MD −1.70, 95% CI −17.01 to 13.61; 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence); positive symptoms (PANSS positive symptom score: MD 0.00, 95% CI −2.58 to 2.58; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence), negative symptoms (PANSS negative symptom score: MD −0.70, 95% CI −4.22 to 2.82; 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence) and anxiety (State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI): MD −2.60, 95% CI −5.76 to 0.56; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence). Due to the small sample size, we remain uncertain about the effect of humour‐based interventions on leaving the study early as compared with active control (no event, 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence). On the other hand, humour‐based interventions may reduce depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): MD −6.20, 95% CI −12.08 to −0.32; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence). Compared with standard care, humour‐based interventions may not improve  depressive symptoms (BDI second edition: MD 0.80, 95% CI −2.64 to 4.24; 1 study, 59 participants; low certainty of evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of humour‐based interventions on leaving the study early for any reason compared with standard care (risk ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.80; 1 study, 66 participants; very low certainty of evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We are currently uncertain whether the evidence supports the use of humour‐based interventions in people with schizophrenia. Future research with rigorous and transparent methodology investigating clinically important outcomes is warranted.

## Plain Title: Can Laughter Help People with Schizophrenia?

### Rationale

Schizophrenia is a brain illness. It can make it hard for people to think clearly. It can also make it hard to feel emotions or connect with others. This can be very tough for people who have it. It can also be tough for their families.

Doctors often give medicine to people with schizophrenia. They also offer other types of help, like talking to a therapist. Some people think that humor might also help. Humor means finding funny things in life. It can be like telling jokes or seeing the fun side of things.

This study looked at how humor might help people with schizophrenia. We wanted to see if humor could be an extra tool to make them feel better. We looked at past studies to find out more.

### Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This study is a ""review"" of other studies. This means we did not do new tests with patients. Instead, we looked at studies that were already done. We looked for studies that compared humor-based help with other types of care.

We looked for studies that included people with schizophrenia. These studies often compare one group getting the new help (like humor) to another group getting the usual care. We looked for ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance.

We searched big health databases for these studies. We looked at studies published up to February 2021. Two people checked each study very carefully. They made sure the studies fit our rules. They also pulled out all the important facts from each study.

### Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

We found three studies about humor and schizophrenia. But only two of them had useful information for us to combine. These two studies included 96 people in total.

We looked for big changes in mental health, quality of life, and bad side effects. But the studies did not have this information.

Here is what we did find:

*   **Overall mental state:** Humor did not seem to make a big difference in how people felt overall. This was compared to other active treatments.
*   **Positive symptoms:** These are things like hearing voices or having strange beliefs. Humor did not seem to change these symptoms much.
*   **Negative symptoms:** These are things like not showing feelings or not wanting to do things. Humor did not seem to change these symptoms much either.
*   **Anxiety:** This is feeling worried or nervous. Humor did not seem to help much with anxiety.
*   **Depression:** This is feeling very sad or down. In one study, humor seemed to make depressive symptoms a little better. But in another study, it did not.

It was hard to know if humor made people leave studies early. The numbers were too small to be sure.

**What did the investigators conclude?**

Right now, we are not sure if humor-based help works for people with schizophrenia. The studies we found were small. They did not give us clear answers.

We need more research to know for sure. Future studies should be very careful in how they are done. They should also look at things that truly matter to patients.","Humour‐based interventions for people with schizophrenia
Review question 
Are humour‐based interventions effective in treating people with schizophrenia?
Background 
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness. It is a disorder of thought, namely firm fixed false beliefs despite there being evidence to the contrary, loss of reality ties, and altered perception. These symptoms are further classified as (i) positive symptoms, such as speech without order, illusions or mistaken and persistent ideas; and (ii) negative symptoms, a lack of emotion or restricted quantity of speech; and decline in cognitive function, including attention, memory, and behavior control. The standard treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications. Treatment with humour‐based interventions, such as watching humorous movies, funny videos, or comedies, has been proposed as an add‐on treatment that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression, or appreciation of the irrationality or inconsistency of life's situations. 
Searching for evidence 
We ran an electronic search in February 2021 for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive humour‐based interventions in addition to usual care, or to receive usual care only, another psychological intervention or a control condition. We found eight records and checked them for suitability to include in our review. 
Evidence found 
Three trials met the review requirements and two low‐quality trials (total number of participants = 96) provided useable data. Compared with active control, humour‐based interventions may not improve positive symptoms and anxiety, but may improve depressive symptoms. However, when compared with standard care, humour‐based intervention may not improve the depressive symptoms. Current evidence is very limited and is of low to very low quality. We are uncertain as to whether humour‐based interventions may lead to clinically‐important improvement in mental state or quality of life in people with schizophrenia. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient research evidence to support the use of humour‐based interventions in people with schizophrenia.

Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is a type of eye movement disorder that can negatively impact vision. Currently, INS cannot be cured, but its effects can potentially be treated pharmacologically, optically, or surgically. This review focuses on the surgical interventions for INS. 
Despite the range of surgical interventions available, and currently applied in practice for the management of INS, there is no clear consensus, and no accepted clinical guidelines regarding the relative efficacy and safety of the various treatment options. A better understanding of these surgical options, along with their associated side effects, will assist clinicians in evidence‐based decision‐making in relation to the management of INS. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions for INS.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to 3 July 2020, with no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying the efficacy and safety of surgical options for treating INS. 
Data collection and analysis
Our prespecified outcome measures were the change from baseline in: binocular best‐corrected distance visual acuity; head posture; amplitude, frequency, intensity, and foveation period durations of the nystagmus waveform; visual recognition times; quality of life and self‐reported outcome measures; incidence of adverse effects with a probable causal link to treatment; and permanent adverse effects after surgery. 
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full‐text articles, extracted data from eligible RCTs, and judged the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. We reached consensus on any disagreements by discussion. We summarised the overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We only identified one eligible RCT (N = 10 participants), undertaken in India. This trial randomised participants to receive either a large retro‐equatorial recession of the horizontal rectus muscle of 9 mm on the medial rectus and 12 mm on the lateral rectus, or a simple tenotomy and resuturing of the four horizontal rectus muscles. We did not identify any RCTs comparing a surgical intervention for INS relative to no treatment. 
In the single eligible RCT, both eyes of each participant received the same intervention. The participants’ age and gender were not reported, nor was information on whether participants were idiopathic or had sensory disorders. The study only included participants with null in primary position and did not explicitly exclude those with congenital periodic alternating nystagmus. The study did not report funding source(s) or author declaration of interests. The evaluation period was six months. 
We judged this study at low risk for sequence generation and other sources of bias, but at high risk of bias for performance and detection bias. The risk of bias was unclear for selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. 
There is very uncertain evidence about the effect of the interventions on visual acuity and change in amplitude, frequency, and intensity of the nystagmus waveform. We were unable to calculate relative effects due to lack of data. None of the participants in either intervention group reported adverse effects at six‐month follow‐up (very low‐certainty evidence). There was no quantitative data reported for quality of life, although the study reported an improvement in quality of life after surgery in both intervention groups (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Change in head posture, foveation period durations of the nystagmus waveform, visual recognition times, and permanent adverse effects after surgery were not reported in the included study. 
We judged the certainty of the evidence, for both the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes, to be very low. Due to a lack of comprehensive reporting of adverse events, there was also very low‐certainty of the safety profile of the evaluated surgical interventions in this population. As such, we are very uncertain about the relative efficacy and safety of these interventions for the surgical management of INS. 
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review identified minimal high‐quality evidence relating to the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions for INS. The limited availability of evidence must be considered by clinicians when treating INS, particularly given these procedures are irreversible and often performed on children. More high‐quality RCTs are needed to better understand the efficacy and safety profile of surgical interventions for INS. This will assist clinicians, people with INS, and their parents or caregivers to make evidence‐based treatment decisions. 
","## A Look at Eye Surgery for Shaky Eyes

### Rationale

Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) makes eyes move without control. This can make it hard to see clearly. There is no cure for INS. But doctors try to make it better. They use medicine, glasses, or surgery. This study looked at surgery options.

Doctors use different surgeries for INS. But they do not agree on which ones work best. They also do not know which ones are safest. We need to know more about these surgeries. This will help doctors make good choices. It will help them pick the best treatment for patients.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past research. It wanted to find studies about INS surgery. The goal was to see if surgery helps. It also wanted to see if surgery is safe. The search looked at many health databases. It looked for studies up to July 2020. No language was left out.

The study looked for a certain type of research. It only included ""randomized controlled trials."" These are studies where people get different treatments by chance. This helps to see what works best. The studies had to be about INS surgery.

The study checked many things. It looked at how well people could see. It checked head position. It also looked at how much the eyes shook. It noted how long people could focus. It asked about their quality of life. It also recorded any bad side effects. Two doctors checked all the information. They made sure it was fair.

### Results

We found only one study that fit our rules. It was a small study from India. It had 10 people in it. These people got one of two types of eye surgery. Both types of surgery moved eye muscles. We do not know the age or gender of the people. We also do not know if their INS cause was known. The study lasted six months.

The study did not report much clear data. We are very unsure if surgery helps vision. We are also unsure if it changes eye shaking. No one in the study reported bad side effects. But this information is not very reliable. The study said people felt better after surgery. But there was no clear proof.

The study did not report other important things. We do not know about head position changes. We do not know about focus time. We also do not know about long-term bad effects.

We are not sure about how well these surgeries work. We are also not sure how safe they are. This is because there was very little good information. Doctors need to think about this. Surgery cannot be undone. Children often get this surgery. More good studies are needed. This will help people with INS. It will also help their parents and doctors. They can then make better choices.","What are the benefits and risks of different surgical procedures for infantile nystagmus syndrome (an eye disorder that develops shortly after birth)? 
Why is this question important?Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is an eye disorder that causes involuntary movement of the eyes from side to side, up and down, or in circles. INS typically develops shortly after birth, and persists throughout life. It is often associated with visual problems, such as:‐ long‐sightedness (when people can see distant objects clearly, but near objects appear blurred);‐ or short‐sightedness (when people can see near objects clearly, but distant objects appear blurred). 
There is currently no cure for INS. However, it is possible to reduce eye movement and improve people’s vision. One of the main options is eye surgery, which involves operating on the muscles that control eye movement. Several different surgical procedures can be used: some procedures involve detaching and reattaching the eye muscles, whereas others require complete removal of these muscles.   
It is unclear whether some surgical procedures for INS have more benefits or risks than others. To find out which surgical procedures work best, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. We were particularly interested in whether different surgical procedures could improve vision and quality of life in people with INS. We also wanted to know about any adverse (unwanted) effects. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for randomised controlled studies, in which people were randomly divided into two or more treatment groups. This makes it less likely that any differences between treatment effects were actually due to differences in the people who received them (rather than due to the treatments themselves, which is what we wanted to find out). 
We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find?We found one study, set in India, that involved a total of 10 people with INS who were followed for six months after surgery. The study authors did not report any information about: ‐ the age and gender of the people who took part in it;‐ or the source of funding for the study. 
The study compared two different surgical procedures: ‐ one procedure in which two horizontal rectus muscles (eye muscles that control side‐to‐side eye movements) were moved from their original position to a position further back on the eyeball; and‐ another procedure in which four horizontal rectus muscles were detached and reattached, in their original position.The procedures were conducted in both eyes. 
The study compared the effects of the treatments on:‐ clarity of vision six months after surgery;‐ intensity of eye movement six months after surgery;‐ adverse events six months after surgery; and‐ quality of life.   
The study did not investigate the effects of treatments on:‐ head posture;‐ the amount of time when the eye is still; or‐ the time it takes to recognise objects. 
We have very little confidence in the evidence from the study we found, because:‐ it is based on a very small number of people; and‐ the patients and researchers in the study knew which type of surgery each patient received. This knowledge may have influenced the study results. 
We therefore cannot determine whether the two procedures investigated in the study had different benefits and risks. 
What does this mean?There is insufficient evidence to determine whether some surgical procedures are better than others for INS. We need researchers to conduct robust randomised controlled trials in future, so that we can compare different procedures. This would help clinicians, and people with INS, to make treatment decisions based on evidence from research. 
How‐up‐to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to July 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013336,"Extended versus standard lymph node dissection in patients with bladder cancer undergoing total bladder removal 
Review question 
When removing the whole bladder for bladder cancer, how does removing the lymph nodes from a large area (extended lymph node dissection) compare to only from a smaller area (standard lymph node dissection)? 
Background 
People with advanced cancer of the bladder that has spread into the deep muscle layers (but not outside the bladder) often have an operation to remove the whole bladder. As part of this operation, surgeons remove lymph nodes in that part of the body, which is an important part of the immune system. Traditionally, only the lymph nodes close to the bladder and its major blood vessels were removed. This is called a standard lymph node dissection which removes lymph nodes as high up as to where the main blood vessels for the pelvis and the leg split up. Some people think that also removing lymph nodes further away from the bladder is better in getting rid of cancer. This is called an extended lymph node dissection. It removes lymph nodes as high up as the blood vessels that supply the lower part of the intestines. We don't know whether this indeed helps people live longer and not die from bladder cancer and how the unwanted effects compare. 
Study characteristics 
We included only studies in which chance determined whether people got a standard or extended lymph node dissection that was reported in literature up to April 29, 2019. 
Key results 
We found only one such study that answered our review question. This study was done at 16 large hospitals in Germany and included 401 men and women with bladder cancer. 
We found that having an extended node dissection may make people less likely to die for any reason or to die from bladder cancer over time, although our confidence in this result is limited. 
We are uncertain whether an extended node dissection causes more serious unwanted effects than a standard lymph node dissection. 
We are also uncertain whether an extended node dissection makes cancer less likely to come back over time and causes a similar risk of not‐so‐serious unwanted effects compared to a standard lymph node dissection. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of evidence for these findings was low or very low, meaning that the true outcomes may be very different from what this review found. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary based on the provided abstract:

## Plain Title
Removing More Glands During Bladder Cancer Surgery

## Rationale
People can get cancer in their bladder. If the cancer grows deep into the bladder muscle, doctors often suggest surgery. This surgery removes the whole bladder.

Near the bladder are small glands called lymph nodes. These glands are part of your body's defense system. Cancer cells can spread to these glands.

In the past, doctors only took out lymph nodes close to the bladder. This is called a standard removal. It removed glands up to where major blood vessels split.

Some doctors now think taking out more glands might be better. This is called an extended removal. It removes glands from a larger area.

We need to know if taking out more glands helps people live longer. We also need to know if it causes more problems. This study looks at which method is better.

## Trial Design
This study asked a main question. When doctors remove the bladder for cancer, is taking out more lymph nodes better? Is it better than taking out fewer lymph nodes?

We looked for studies that answered this. We only included studies where people were put into groups by chance. One group had standard lymph node removal. The other group had extended lymph node removal.

We looked at studies published before April 29, 2019. This helped us compare the two ways of removing lymph nodes.

## Results
We found only one study that matched our needs. This study took place in 16 big hospitals. All these hospitals were in Germany.

The study included 401 men and women. All of them had bladder cancer.

The study suggests that taking out more lymph nodes may help. It might make people less likely to die from any cause. It might also make them less likely to die from bladder cancer.

However, we are not very sure about this finding. More research is needed to be certain.

We are also not sure if taking out more lymph nodes causes more serious problems. We need more information on this.

We do not know if taking out more lymph nodes stops the cancer from coming back. We also don't know if it causes the same mild problems as taking out fewer lymph nodes.

The evidence we found was not very strong. This means the true results might be quite different. We need more studies to get clear answers.","Extended versus standard lymph node dissection in patients with bladder cancer undergoing total bladder removal

10.1002-14651858.CD014201,"Background
The hallmark of severe hemophilia (A or B) is recurrent bleeding into joints and soft tissues with progressive joint damage, despite on‐demand treatment. Prophylaxis has long been used, but not universally adopted, because of medical, psychosocial, and cost controversies. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of clotting factor concentrate prophylaxis in managing previously‐treated individuals with hemophilia A or B. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. In addition, we searched MEDLINE and Embase and online trial registries. 
Most recent search of Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register: 24 February 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs evaluating people with hemophilia A or hemophilia B, who were previously treated with clotting factor concentrates to manage their hemophilia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently reviewed trials for eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
Ten trials (including 608 participants) were eligible for inclusion. Eight of the trials (477 participants) had arms comparing two or more prophylactic regimens to one another and four of the trials (n = 258) compared prophylaxis to on‐demand treatment (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). 
Comparison of two or more prophylactic regimens 
For trials comparing one prophylaxis regimen to another, given the heterogeneity of the data, none of the data were pooled for this comparison. Considering the individual trials, three trials reported the primary outcome of joint bleeding, and none showed a dfference between dosing regimens (low‐certainty evidence). For the secondary outcome of total bleeding events, prophylaxis with a twice‐weekly regimen of FIX likely results in reduced total bleeds compared to a once‐a‐week regimen of the same dose, mean difference (MD) 11.2 (5.81 to 16.59) (one trial, 10 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Transient low‐titer anti‐FVIII inhibitors were reported in one of the trials. Blood‐transmitted infections were not identified. Other adverse events reported include hypersensitivity, oedema, and weight gain. These were, however, rare and unrelated to study drugs (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Comparison of prophylactic and on‐demand regimens 
Four of the trials (258 participants) had arms that compared prophylaxis to on‐demand treatment. Prophylaxis may result in a large decrease in the number of joint bleeds compared to on‐demand treatment, MD ‐30.34 (95% CI ‐46.95 to ‐13.73) (two trials, 164 participants, low‐certainty evidence). One of these trials (84 participants) also reported the long‐term effects of prophylaxis versus on‐demand therapy showing improved joint function, quality of life, and pain; but no differences between groups in joint structure when assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
In one trial (84 participants) validated measures for joint health and pain assessment showed that prophylaxis likely improves joint health compared to an on‐demand regimen with an estimated change difference of 0.94 points (95% CI 0.23 to 1.65) and improves total pain scores, MD ‐17.20 (95% CI ‐27.48 to ‐6.92 (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Two trials (131 participants) reported that prophylaxis likely results in a slight increase in adverse events, risk ratio 1.71 (1.24 to 2.37) (moderate‐certainty evidence). No inhibitor development and blood‐transmitted infections were identified. 
Overall, the certainty of the body of evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have altered the effect. 
 
Authors' conclusions
There is evidence from RCTs that prophylaxis, as compared to on‐demand treatment, may reduce bleeding frequency in previously‐treated people with hemophilia. Prophylaxis may also improve joint function, pain and quality of life, even though this does not translate into a detectable improvement of articular damage when assessed by MRI.  
When comparing two different prophylaxis regimens, no significant differences in terms of protection from bleeding were found. Dose optimization could, however, result in improved efficacy. Given the heterogeneity of the data, pooled estimates were not obtained for most comparisons.  
Well‐designed RCTs and prospective observational controlled studies with standardised definitions and measurements are needed to establish the optimal and most cost‐effective treatment regimens.

## Plain Title: Better Ways to Stop Bleeding in People with Hemophilia

### Rationale

Hemophilia is a blood problem. It means your blood does not clot well. People with severe hemophilia often have bleeding into their joints and soft body parts. This can cause a lot of pain and damage joints over time. It makes life hard for them.

Doctors often give medicine to stop bleeding when it happens. This is called ""on-demand"" treatment. But this may not be enough to prevent joint damage.

Some doctors give regular medicine to prevent bleeding before it starts. This is called ""prophylaxis."" We want to see if this regular medicine works better than on-demand treatment. We also want to know if some regular medicine plans work better than others. This study helps us learn how to best treat hemophilia.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many past studies. We searched for studies that were done on people with hemophilia A or B. These people had received blood clotting medicine before.

The studies we looked at were ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. One group might get regular medicine. Another might get medicine only when they bleed. This helps us see which treatment works best.

We looked at how these studies were set up. We checked who was in them. We also checked how well the studies were done. We wanted to make sure the results were fair and true.

### Results

We found 10 studies with 608 people.

**Comparing Regular Treatment to On-Demand Treatment:**

Four studies compared regular medicine to on-demand medicine. These studies show that regular medicine likely causes much less joint bleeding. For example, people on regular medicine had about 30 fewer joint bleeds.

One study also showed other good things. Regular medicine improved how joints worked. It made people feel better and hurt less. But it did not make a difference in how joints looked on special scans (MRI).

A few studies found that regular medicine might cause a small number of side effects. Side effects are unwanted problems from medicine. But no serious problems like new bleeding problems or infections were found.

**Comparing Different Regular Treatment Plans:**

Eight studies looked at different regular medicine plans. It was hard to combine the results from these studies. This is because the plans were very different.

Looking at each study, no big difference was found in how well different plans stopped joint bleeding. But one study showed a twice-a-week plan for factor IX likely led to less total bleeding than a once-a-week plan. People on the twice-a-week plan had about 11 fewer total bleeds.

Some rare side effects were reported. These included skin rashes and swelling. But these were not thought to be from the study medicines.

**What We Learned:**

Regular medicine likely reduces bleeding in people with hemophilia. It may also make joints work better. It can also reduce pain and improve how people live their lives. This is even if special scans do not show a change in joint damage.

When we compared different regular medicine plans, no big differences were seen. More studies are needed to find the best way to give these medicines. This includes finding the best dose and how often to give it. This will help make treatment even better for people with hemophilia.","Regular clotting factor replacement therapy to prevent joint damage in people living with severe hemophilia A or B 
Review question 
Should people, who have previously been treated for joint bleeding, be given regular preventative treatment with clotting factor concentrates to manage their condition? 
Background 
Hemophilia A and B are X‐linked inherited bleeding disorders in which bleeding  into joints is a major problem. Repeated joint bleeds can lead to affected joints (commonly referred to as 'target joints') becoming damaged and painful, with limited movement. Currently, bleeding is treated and prevented with plasma‐derived or recombinant clotting factor concentrates, and more recently non‐clotting factor formulations. This review looked at how useful and effective different clotting factor treatment strategies are for preventing joint bleeding and other outcomes in previously treated people with hemophilia A or B. 
Search date 
Date of last search: 24 February 2021.
Study characteristics 
This review includes 10 randomised controlled trials. Eight had treatment arms that compared the regular use of clotting factor concentrates to prevent joint bleeds with different dosing schemes to identify regimens that may be better; four had treatment arms that compared the regular use of factor concentrates to prevent bleeds to their 'on demand' use to treat bleeds once they occur (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). 
Key results 
In people living with hemophilia A or B previously treated for joint bleeding or with existing joint damage, preventive therapy may reduce the number of joint bleeds compared to 'on‐demand therapy'. This reduction in bleeds may lead to an improvement in joint function, pain, and quality of life. However, preventive therapy is linked to an increased use of factor concentrates and therefore higher treatment costs. Further studies are needed to establish the best preventive course of treatment in terms of starting time, frequency and dose level. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have affected the results. Future research might have an important role in changing our confidence in these results.

10.1002-14651858.CD013181.pub2,"Background
The advent of medical abortion has improved access to safe abortion procedures. Medical abortion procedures involve either administering mifepristone followed by misoprostol or a misoprostol‐only regimen. The drugs are commonly administered in the presence of clinicians, which is known as provider‐administered medical abortion. In self‐administered medical abortion, drugs are administered by the woman herself without the supervision of a healthcare provider during at least one stage of the drug protocol. Self‐administration of medical abortion has the potential to provide women with control over the abortion process. In settings where there is a shortage of healthcare providers, self‐administration may reduce the burden on the health system. However, it remains unclear whether self‐administration of medical abortion is effective and safe. It is important to understand whether women can safely and effectively terminate their own pregnancies when having access to accurate and adequate information, high‐quality drugs, and facility‐based care in case of complications. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of self‐administered versus provider‐administered medical abortion in any setting. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE in process and other non‐indexed citations, Embase, CINAHL, POPLINE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and Google Scholar from inception to 10 July 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies with a concurrent comparison group, using study designs that compared medical abortion by self‐administered versus provider‐administered methods. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently extracted the data, and we performed a meta‐analysis where appropriate using Review Manager 5. Our primary outcome was successful abortion (effectiveness), defined as complete uterine evacuation without the need for surgical intervention. Ongoing pregnancy (the presence of an intact gestational sac) was our secondary outcome measuring success or effectiveness. We assessed statistical heterogeneity with Chi2 tests and I2 statistics using a cut‐off point of P < 0.10 to indicate statistical heterogeneity. Quality assessment of the data used the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. 
Main results
We identified 18 studies (two RCTs and 16 non‐randomized studies (NRSs)) comprising 11,043 women undergoing early medical abortion (≤ 9 weeks gestation) in 10 countries. Sixteen studies took place in low‐to‐middle income resource settings and two studies were in high‐resource settings. One NRS study received analgesics from a pharmaceutical company. Five NRSs and one RCT did not report on funding; nine NRSs received all or partial funding from an anonymous donor. Five NRSs and one RCT received funding from government agencies, private foundations, or non‐profit bodies. The intervention in the evidence is predominantly from women taking mifepristone in the presence of a healthcare provider, and subsequently taking misoprostol without healthcare provider supervision (e.g. at home). 
There is no evidence of a difference in rates of successful abortions between self‐administered and provider‐administered groups: for two RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.01; 919 participants; moderate certainty of evidence. There is very low certainty of evidence from 16 NRSs: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.01; 10,124 participants. 
For the outcome of ongoing pregnancy there may be little or no difference between the two groups: for one RCT: RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.41 to 7.02; 735 participants; low certainty of evidence; and very low certainty evidence for 11 NRSs: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.49; 6691 participants. 
We are uncertain whether there are any differences in complications requiring surgical intervention, since we found no RCTs and evidence from three NRSs was of very low certainty: for three NRSs: RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.80 to 5.71; 2452 participants. 
Authors' conclusions
This review shows that self‐administering the second stage of early medical abortion procedures is as effective as provider‐administered procedures for the outcome of abortion success. There may be no difference for the outcome of ongoing pregnancy, although the evidence for this is uncertain for this outcome. There is very low‐certainty evidence for the risk of complications requiring surgical intervention. Data are limited by the scarcity of high‐quality research study designs and the presence of risks of bias. This review provides insufficient evidence to determine the safety of self‐administration when compared with administering medication in the presence of healthcare provider supervision. 
Future research should investigate the effectiveness and safety of self‐administered medical abortion in the absence of healthcare provider supervision through the entirety of the medical abortion protocol (e.g. during administration of mifepristone or as part of a misoprostol‐only regimen) and at later gestational ages (i.e. more than nine weeks). In the absence of any supervision from medical personnel, research is needed to understand how best to inform and support women who choose to self‐administer, including when to seek clinical care. 
","**Plain Title: Women Can Safely Self-Manage Part of Their Abortion**

**Rationale**

Getting an abortion can be hard for many women. Some women have trouble finding a clinic. Others may live far from a doctor. This study looks at medical abortion. This is when women use pills to end a pregnancy. The pills are called mifepristone and misoprostol.

Doctors usually give these pills. This is called ""provider-run care."" But what if women could take the pills themselves? This is called ""self-managed care."" It could give women more control. It could also help women in places with few doctors.

We wanted to see if self-managed care works as well. We also wanted to know if it is safe. We looked at how well it ended a pregnancy. We also checked for any problems.

**Trial Design**

We looked at many studies. These studies compared two ways to have an abortion. One way was when a doctor gave the pills. The other way was when a woman took the pills herself.

We looked at studies with women who were up to 9 weeks pregnant. Most of the studies were in countries where money is tight. Some studies were in richer countries.

We wanted to see if the abortion worked. This meant the pregnancy ended without surgery. We also checked if the pregnancy kept going. We looked at how often women needed surgery for problems.

**Results**

We found 18 studies. These studies looked at over 11,000 women. Most women took the first pill, mifepristone, with a doctor. Then, they took the second pill, misoprostol, at home.

The studies showed that self-managing the second pill works as well. The number of successful abortions was about the same. This means the pregnancy ended without surgery.

We also looked at if the pregnancy kept going. There was little to no change between the groups. This means self-managing the second pill did not make the pregnancy more likely to continue.

It is not clear if there were more problems. We did not find enough strong studies for this. We need more research on this point.

In short, self-managing the second abortion pill is just as good. It helps end a pregnancy. But we need to know more about safety. We need more good studies. These studies should look at all parts of self-managed abortion. They should also look at later stages of pregnancy. We also need to know how to best help women who choose this.","Self‐administered versus provider‐administered medical abortion (review)
Review question 
The aim of this review was to compare whether women taking abortion drugs on their own without healthcare provider supervision can do so as successfully and safely as women who take the drugs in the presence of trained healthcare providers. 
Background 
Medical abortion used to end pregnancies has been successful and safe when women have access to appropriate information and resources. In provider‐administered medical abortion, drugs are taken in the presence of trained healthcare providers. Access to medical abortion drugs has increased and has given women more control over their abortion procedures through self‐administration. In self‐administered medical abortion, the woman takes the drug(s) without the supervision of a healthcare provider after receiving appropriate information and resources. This is the first review of the published evidence on whether self‐administration of medical abortion is a safe and successful way to end pregnancies. We compared the success and safety of self‐administered medical abortion versus provider‐administered medical abortion. 
Study characteristics 
We included 18 studies (two randomized controlled trials and 16 prospective cohort studies) covering 11,043 women undergoing early medical abortion (up to nine weeks gestation) in 10 countries that compared self‐administered medical abortion to provider‐administered medical abortion, after an initial clinic visit. Most studies (16) were conducted in low‐to‐middle resource settings and two studies in high‐resource settings. The evidence described in this review is from studies published before 10 July 2019. 
Key results 
Women who self‐administer medical abortion drugs in early pregnancy (up to nine weeks gestational age) experience similar rates of completed abortion as women who undergo provider‐administered procedures in low‐to‐middle and high‐resource settings. Evidence about safety is uncertain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence for the success of self‐administered medical abortion compared to provider‐administered medical abortion was of moderate certainty, due to low‐certainty studies. The evidence for the safety of these interventions was very low, due to low‐certainty studies.

Children with severe global developmental delay (SGDD) have significant intellectual disability and severe motor impairment; they are extremely limited in their functional movement and are dependent upon others for all activities of daily living. SGDD does not directly cause lung dysfunction, but the combination of immobility, weakness, skeletal deformity and parenchymal damage from aspiration can lead to significant prevalence of respiratory illness. Respiratory pathology is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for children with SGDD; it can result in frequent hospital admissions and impacts upon quality of life. Although many treatment approaches are available, there currently exists no comprehensive review of the literature to inform best practice. A broad range of treatment options exist; to focus the scope of this review and allow in‐depth analysis, we have excluded pharmaceutical interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of non‐pharmaceutical treatment modalities for the management of respiratory morbidity in children with severe global developmental delay. 
Search methods
We conducted comprehensive searches of the following databases from inception to November 2013: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We searched the Web of Science and clinical trials registries for grey literature and for planned, ongoing and unpublished trials. We checked the reference lists of all primary included studies for additional relevant references. 
We updated searches in November 2019 and July 2020 and added six studies to awaiting classification, but these results have not been fully incorporated into the review. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials, controlled trials and cohort studies of children up to 18 years of age with a diagnosis of severe neurological impairment and respiratory morbidity were included. Studies of airways clearance techniques, suction, assisted coughing, non‐invasive ventilation, tracheostomy and postural management were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. As the result of heterogeneity, we could not perform meta‐analysis. We have therefore presented our results using a narrative approach. 
Main results
Fifteen studies were included in the review. Studies included children with a range of severe neurological impairments in differing settings, for example, home and critical care. Several different treatment modalities were assessed, and a wide range of outcome measures were used. Most studies used a non‐randomised design and included small sample groups. Only four randomised controlled trials were identified. Non‐randomised design, lack of information about how participants were selected and who completed outcome measures and incomplete reporting led to high or unclear risk of bias in many studies. Results from low‐quality studies suggest that use of non‐invasive ventilation, mechanically assisted coughing, high‐frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO), positive expiratory pressure and supportive seating may confer potential benefits. No serious adverse effects were reported for ventilatory support or airway clearance interventions other than one incident in a clinically unstable child following mechanically assisted coughing. Night‐time positioning equipment and spinal bracing were shown to have a potentially negative effect for some participants. However, these findings must be considered as tentative and require testing in future randomised trials. 
Authors' conclusions
This review found no high‐quality evidence for any single intervention for the management of respiratory morbidity in children with severe global developmental delay. Our search yielded data on a wide range of interventions of interest. Significant differences in study design and in outcome measures precluded the possibility of meta‐analysis. No conclusions on efficacy or safety of interventions for respiratory morbidity in children with severe global developmental delay can be made based upon the findings of this review. 
A co‐ordinated approach to future research is vital to ensure that high‐quality evidence becomes available to guide treatment for this vulnerable patient group.

### Plain Title
Helping Kids with Big Delays Breathe Better

### Rationale
Many kids have severe global developmental delay (SGDD). This means they have a hard time thinking and moving. They need help with daily tasks like eating and dressing. SGDD itself does not hurt their lungs. But not being able to move much, being weak, and having other issues can cause big lung problems.

Lung problems are a major health issue for these kids. They can lead to many trips to the hospital. These problems also make their lives harder. Doctors use many ways to treat these lung issues. But we do not have a good guide yet. This guide would tell us the best ways to help.

This study looked at ways to help kids breathe better. It focused on treatments that do not use medicine. We need to know which treatments work best. This will help doctors give the best care.

### Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies. It asked: ""How do we help kids with severe body delays breathe better without medicine?"" The study searched big health databases. It looked for studies up to November 2013. It also updated these searches in 2019 and 2020.

The study included reports on children up to 18 years old. These children had severe brain issues and breathing problems. It looked at different ways to help them. These included ways to clear airways. It also looked at using machines to help them breathe. Other methods were help with coughing or how they sit. The goal was to see what worked and what did not.

The study collected all this information. Then it looked at the facts. It did not combine the numbers from different studies. This is because the studies were too different. Instead, it told a story about what each study found. This study did not involve people directly. It reviewed other studies to learn from them.

### Results
The study found 15 other studies. These studies looked at kids with severe brain issues. They were treated in places like their homes or in the hospital. Many different treatments were used. The studies also measured many different things to see if treatment worked.

Most of these studies were not set up in the best way. Many had few kids in them. Only four studies were very well designed. This means it was hard to trust all the results fully. It was hard to know how kids were chosen for the studies. It was also hard to know who reported the results. This made many studies less clear.

Studies that were not the best quality suggested some things might help. Using machines to help breathe might be good. Helping kids cough with a machine might also help. Other ways like chest vibrations or special seats could also be helpful. No serious harms were reported from most of these treatments. One child who was already very sick had a problem after a machine helped them cough.

However, some things might be bad for some kids. Special equipment used at night or back braces might cause issues. These findings are not sure yet. We need more good studies to know for sure.

This study found no strong proof for any one treatment. We could not combine results from different studies. This is because they were all so different. So, we cannot say if any treatment is surely good or bad. We need more well-done studies. This will help doctors know the best way to help these kids.","Non‐drug management of breathing problems for children with severe physical and intellectual impairment 
Background For a variety of reasons, some children live with very severe intellectual and physical problems; they are unable to walk or talk and require a lot of care. In this study we refer to them as children with severe global developmental delay (SGDD); this is not a specific diagnosis but is rather an 'umbrella term' used to describe a group of children with similar problems. These children may have weak or stiff muscles and deformities of their skeleton; often they have problems with swallowing, resulting in food or saliva going into their lungs. Frequently they have a poor cough reflex and lack the strength required to expel secretions when they do cough. When we sleep, our breathing becomes shallower; for some children with SGDD whose breathing is already shallow when awake, falling asleep means that they do not breathe sufficiently deeply to take in enough oxygen and breathe out enough carbon dioxide. The consequence of these problems is that their respiratory system becomes weakened; they are more likely to develop chest infections, and relatively minor infections can make them very unwell. This can result in their spending a lot of time in hospital. This affects the quality of life for these children and families and is very expensive. Many types of treatment could help, but no good summary of studies has been prepared to tell healthcare professionals which treatments are best and when they should be used; this is the reason for this review. 
Review question The aim of our review was to discover how effective each type of treatment is for managing breathing problems in children with severe global developmental delay. As so many treatments are available, we decided to look only at treatments that do not involve drugs. 
Study characteristics We carried out a wide database search to look for studies of interventions for the management of breathing problems in children with severe neurological impairment. We found 15 studies of interest, which included a number of different types of treatment. 
Key results The results showed that several different treatments provided potential benefits, and for most interventions no serious adverse effects were reported. However, the quality of the studies was not good enough to inspire confidence in the findings. Night‐time positioning equipment and spinal bracing were shown to have a potentially negative effect in some participants. Although some studies looked at the same type of treatment, they used it in different ways or used different measures to assess effectiveness, so we could not put the results together. 
Quality of the evidence Of the 15 studies included here, only four used the 'gold standard' study design for health interventions. The remainder of the studies used less robust study designs, which limits the strength of the results. Further well‐designed randomised studies including larger numbers of participants are required to guide healthcare professionals to select the most effective treatments. 
This plain‐language summary is current to November 2013.  We updated searches in November 2019 and July 2020 and added six studies to awaiting classification, but these results have not been fully incorporated into the review.

10.1002-14651858.CD013483.pub2,"Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs mostly in people with chronic liver disease. Worldwide, it ranks sixth in terms of incidence of cancer, and fourth in terms of cancer‐related deaths. Contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is used as an add‐on test to confirm the presence of focal liver lesions suspected as hepatocellular carcinoma after prior diagnostic tests such as abdominal ultrasound or measurement of alpha‐foetoprotein, or both. According to guidelines, a single contrast‐enhanced imaging investigation, with either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may show the typical hepatocellular carcinoma hallmarks in people with cirrhosis, which will be sufficient to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma. However, a significant number of hepatocellular carcinomas show atypical imaging features, and therefore, are missed at imaging. 
Dynamic CEUS images are obtained similarly to CT and MRI images. CEUS differentiates between arterial and portal venous phases, in which sonographic hepatocellular carcinoma hallmarks, such as arterial hyperenhancement and subsequent washout appearance, are investigated. The advantages of CEUS over CT and MRI include real‐time imaging, use of contrast agents that do not contain iodine and are not nephrotoxic, and quick image acquisition. Despite the advantages, the use of CEUS in the diagnostic algorithm for HCC remains controversial, with disagreement on relevant guidelines. 
There is no clear evidence of the benefit of surveillance programmes in terms of overall survival as the conflicting results can be a consequence of an inaccurate detection, ineffective treatment, or both. Therefore, assessing the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS may clarify whether the absence of benefit could be related to underdiagnosis. Furthermore, an assessment of the accuracy of CEUS for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is needed for either diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma or ruling it out in people with chronic liver disease who are not included in surveillance programmes. 
Objectives
1. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and at any stage in adults with chronic liver disease, in a surveillance programme or in a clinical setting. 
2. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS for the diagnosis of resectable hepatocellular carcinoma in people with chronic liver disease and identify potential sources of heterogeneity in the results. 
Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The last date of search was 5 November 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease, with cross‐sectional designs, using one of the acceptable reference standards, such as pathology of the explanted liver, and histology of resected or biopsied focal liver lesion with at least a six‐month follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods to screen studies, extract data, and assess the risk of bias and applicability concerns, using the QUADAS‐2 checklist. We used the bivariate model and provided estimates of summary sensitivity and specificity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We presented uncertainty‐of‐the‐accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Main results
We included 23 studies with 6546 participants. Studies were published between 2001 and 2021. We judged all 23 studies at high‐risk of bias in at least one domain, and 13/23 studies at high concern for applicability. Most studies used different reference standards to exclude the presence of the target condition. The time interval between the index test and the reference standard was rarely defined. We also had major concerns on their applicability due to the characteristics of the participants. 
– CEUS for hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and stage: sensitivity 77.8% (95% CI 69.4% to 84.4%) and specificity 93.8% (95% CI 89.1% to 96.6%) (23 studies, 6546 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
– CEUS for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: sensitivity 77.5% (95% CI 62.9% to 87.6%) and specificity 92.7% (95% CI 86.8% to 96.1%) (13 studies, 1257 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
The observed heterogeneity in the results remains unexplained. The sensitivity analyses, including only studies with clearly prespecified positivity criteria and only studies in which the reference standard results were interpreted with no knowledge of the results about the index test, showed no differences in the results. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that by using CEUS, as an add‐on test following abdominal ultrasound, to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and stage, 22% of people with hepatocellular carcinoma would be missed, and 6% of people without hepatocellular carcinoma would unnecessarily undergo further testing or inappropriate treatment. As to resectable hepatocellular carcinoma, we found that 23% of people with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma would incorrectly be unresected, while 8% of people without hepatocellular carcinoma would undergo further inappropriate testing or treatment. The uncertainty resulting from the high risk of bias of the included studies, heterogeneity, and imprecision of the results and concerns on their applicability limit our ability to draw confident conclusions. 
","## Plain Title: How Well Does Special Ultrasound Find Liver Cancer?

### Rationale

Liver cancer, called hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a serious disease. It mostly affects people with ongoing liver problems. This cancer is a big problem around the world. It is the sixth most common cancer and the fourth most common cause of cancer deaths.

Doctors often use special scans to look for HCC. These scans include CT scans and MRI scans. They can sometimes find HCC if it looks typical. But many HCCs do not look typical on these scans. This means doctors might miss them.

A special type of ultrasound, called contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), can also help. This ultrasound uses a safe dye to see the liver better. It can show how blood flows in and out of a liver spot. This helps doctors tell if a spot is cancer. CEUS has some good points. It uses a dye that is safe for kidneys. It also lets doctors see things in real-time. This means they see images right away.

There is still some debate about how much CEUS helps. We do not know for sure if check-up programs for liver cancer save lives. This might be because doctors miss some cancers. Or it might be because treatments do not always work well.

This study looked at how good CEUS is at finding HCC. We wanted to see if missing cancer could be why check-up programs do not seem to help much. We also needed to know how well CEUS finds or rules out HCC. This is important for people with ongoing liver disease.

### Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This study looked at many past studies. We gathered information from 23 different studies. These studies looked at how well CEUS found liver cancer.

The studies included grown-ups. All of these people had ongoing liver disease. The studies used CEUS to look for liver cancer. Then, they compared the CEUS results to a very accurate test. This accurate test was usually looking at a piece of liver under a microscope. This way, we could see how good CEUS was at finding the cancer.

We looked at studies published from 2001 to 2021. In total, 6,546 people were part of these studies. Each person was in a study for a short time. They had a CEUS scan. Then, they had another test to confirm if they had HCC. This was often within six months.

We wanted to know how well CEUS found any size or stage of HCC. We also looked at how well it found HCC that could be removed by surgery.

### Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

We looked at 23 studies with a total of 6,546 people.

For finding liver cancer of any size and stage:
* CEUS found 78 out of 100 people who had liver cancer. This means it missed about 22 people with cancer.
* CEUS correctly said 94 out of 100 people did not have liver cancer. This means it wrongly said 6 people without cancer might have it. These people then had more tests.

For finding liver cancer that doctors could remove with surgery:
* CEUS found 78 out of 100 people who had this type of cancer. This means it missed about 23 people with cancer. These people might not get needed surgery.
* CEUS correctly said 93 out of 100 people did not have this type of cancer. This means it wrongly said 7 people without cancer might have it. These people also had more tests.

The studies we looked at had some problems. It was hard to be very sure about the results. Many studies had a high risk of bias. This means how they were done might have affected the results. Also, the studies were not always alike. This made it hard to combine all the information perfectly.

**What do these results mean for patients?**

This study shows that CEUS is a helpful tool. It can help doctors look for liver cancer. But it is not perfect. It can miss some cancers. And it can sometimes suggest cancer when there is none. This means some patients might have more tests than needed.

More research is needed to be more certain. We need studies that are done very carefully. This will help doctors know the best way to use CEUS. It will help make sure patients get the right diagnosis and treatment.","How accurate are contrast‐enhanced ultrasound scans for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma?
Key messages 
In adults with chronic liver disease, contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can miss diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma in around 22.2% of people who would not then receive timely or appropriate treatment, and would fail to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma in 6.2% of people who could receive unnecessary further testing or treatment. 
In the subset of people who are able have the hepatocellular carcinoma removed by surgery, CEUS probably misses hepatocellular carcinoma in 22.5% of people who could undergo surgery to remove part of their liver while it would erroneously find cancer in 7.3% of people who would undergo unnecessary further test or surgery. 
As there were some problems with the way the studies were conducted, CEUS to detect hepatocellular carcinoma may appear more accurate than it actually is. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma important? 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is cancer originating in the liver. It is sixth in terms of occurrences of cancer and fourth in terms of cancer‐related deaths worldwide. It occurs mostly in people with chronic liver disease regardless of the exact cause. People with blood test or ultrasound results that suggest they may have hepatocellular carcinoma may go on to have further tests, such as imaging or a biopsy (where a small piece of the liver is removed and examined). If the cancer is detected early, people may have part of the liver removed or have a liver transplant. In advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, they may need chemotherapy. If hepatocellular carcinoma is missed at diagnostic testing, people will not receive appropriate treatment. However, incorrectly diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma when it is not present means that people may undergo unnecessary testing or treatment. 
What is contrast‐enhanced ultrasound and how can it diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma? 
CEUS can detect abnormalities in the liver that might be due to cancer and, using contrast agents, confirm the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. These contrast agents are safe. CEUS is used in clinical practice to confirm the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in people in whom suspicion was raised by prior performed abdominal ultrasound or a blood test to measure alpha‐foetoprotein. 
The role of CEUS in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma remains controversial between guidelines. Previous systematic reviews have assessed the performance of CEUS in detecting hepatocellular carcinoma but they have included different studies and found different results. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if CEUS is accurate enough to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease (a progressive deterioration of liver functions for more than six months). We were interested first in hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and severity and, second, in hepatocellular carcinomas that were suitable for surgical removal (resection). 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of diagnostic tests of CEUS scans compared to the best available tests to confirm hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease. The best available test is examination of the liver, or part of it, under a microscope. 
What did we find? 
We found 23 studies with 6546 adults.
Around 690 (69%) out of 1000 adults with chronic liver disease had a confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and severity. Considering these 1000 people, CEUS: 
– correctly detected liver cancer in 537 people;
– missed liver cancer in 153 people;
– incorrectly detected cancer in 19 people;
– correctly detected no cancer in 291 people.
Around 690 (69%) out of 1000 adults with chronic liver disease had a confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma that could be removed by surgery. Considering these 1000 people, CEUS: 
– correctly detected liver cancer in 535 people;
– missed liver cancer in 155 people;
– incorrectly detected cancer in 23 people;
– correctly detected no cancer in 287 people.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited as the studies used different methods to select study participants and used different reference standards. This means that CEUS scans may be more or less accurate than what the evidence suggests. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 5 November 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013786.pub2,"Background
Many millions of people living with dementia around the world are not diagnosed, which has a negative impact both on their access to care and treatment and on rational service planning. Telehealth ‐ the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to provide health services at a distance ‐ may be a way to increase access to specialist assessment for people with suspected dementia, especially those living in remote or rural areas. It has also been much used during the COVID‐19 pandemic. It is important to know whether diagnoses made using telehealth assessment are as accurate as those made in conventional, face‐to‐face clinical settings. 
Objectives
Primary objective: to assess the diagnostic accuracy of telehealth assessment for dementia and mild cognitive impairment. 
Secondary objectives: to identify the quality and quantity of the relevant research evidence; to identify sources of heterogeneity in the test accuracy data; to identify and synthesise any data on patient or clinician satisfaction, resource use, costs or feasibility of the telehealth assessment models in the included studies. 
Search methods
We searched multiple databases and clinical trial registers on 4 November 2020 for published and 'grey' literature and registered trials. We applied no search filters and no language restrictions. We screened the retrieved citations in duplicate and assessed in duplicate the full texts of papers considered potentially relevant. 
Selection criteria
We included in the review cross‐sectional studies with 10 or more participants who had been referred to a specialist service for assessment of a suspected cognitive disorder. Within a period of one month or less, each participant had to undergo two clinical assessments designed to diagnose dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI): a telehealth assessment (the index test) and a conventional face‐to‐face assessment (the reference standard). The telehealth assessment could be informed by some data collected face‐to‐face, e.g. by nurses working in primary care, but all contact between the patient and the specialist clinician responsible for synthesising the information and making the diagnosis had to take place remotely using ICT. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies. Data extracted covered study design, setting, participants, details of index test and reference standard, and results in the form of numbers of participants given diagnoses of dementia or MCI. Data were also sought on dementia subtype diagnoses and on quantitative measures of patient or clinician satisfaction, resource use, costs and feasibility. We assessed risk of bias and applicability of each included study using QUADAS‐2. We entered the results into 2x2 tables in order to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of telehealth assessment for the diagnosis of all‐cause dementia, MCI, and any cognitive syndrome (combining dementia and MCI). We presented the results of included studies narratively because there were too few studies to derive summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity. 
Main results
Three studies with 136 participants were eligible for inclusion. Two studies (20 and 100 participants) took place in community settings in Australia and one study (16 participants) was conducted in veterans' homes in the USA. Participants were referred from primary care with undiagnosed cognitive symptoms or were identified as being at high risk of having dementia on a screening test in the care homes. Dementia and MCI were target conditions in the larger study; the other studies targeted dementia diagnosis only. Only one small study used a 'pure' telehealth model, i.e. not involving any elements of face‐to‐face assessment. 
The studies were generally well‐conducted. We considered two studies to be at high risk of incorporation bias because a substantial amount of information collected face‐to‐face by nurses was used to inform both index test and reference standard assessments. One study was at unclear risk of selection bias. 
For the diagnosis of all‐cause dementia, sensitivity of telehealth assessment ranged from 0.80 to 1.00 and specificity from 0.80 to 1.00. We considered this to be very low‐certainty evidence due to imprecision, inconsistency between studies and risk of bias. For the diagnosis of MCI, data were available from only one study (100 participants) giving a sensitivity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.84) and a specificity of 0.73 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.84). We considered this to be low‐certainty evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias. For diagnosis of any cognitive syndrome (dementia or MCI), data from the same study gave a sensitivity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.99) and a specificity of 0.22 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.60). The majority of diagnostic disagreements concerned the distinction between MCI and dementia, occurring approximately equally in either direction. There was also a tendency for patients identified as cognitively healthy at face‐to‐face assessment to be diagnosed with MCI at telehealth assessment (but numbers were small). 
There were insufficient data to make any assessment of the accuracy of dementia subtype diagnosis. 
One study provided a small amount of data indicating a good level of clinician and especially patient satisfaction with the telehealth model. There were no data on resource use, costs or feasibility. 
Authors' conclusions
We found only very few eligible studies with a small number of participants. An important difference between the studies providing data for the analyses was whether the target condition was dementia only (two studies) or dementia and MCI (one study). The data suggest that telehealth assessment may be highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of all‐cause dementia when assessed against a reference standard of conventional face‐to‐face assessment, but the estimates are imprecise due to small sample sizes and between‐study heterogeneity, and may apply mainly to telehealth models which incorporate a considerable amount of face‐to‐face contact with healthcare professionals other than the doctor responsible for making the diagnosis. For the diagnosis of MCI by telehealth assessment, best estimates of both sensitivity and specificity were somewhat lower, but were based on a single study. Errors occurred at the cognitively healthy/MCI and the MCI/dementia boundaries. However, there is no evidence that diagnostic disagreements were more frequent than would be expected due to the known variation between clinicians’ opinions when assigning a dementia diagnosis.

## Plain Title: Checking for Memory Problems Using Video Calls

### Rationale

Many people around the world have memory problems, like dementia. But they do not always get a diagnosis. This means they do not get the right care or treatment. It also makes it hard to plan health services for them.

Using video calls, or ""telehealth,"" might help more people see a doctor. This is extra true for those who live far away. Telehealth was also used a lot during the recent health crisis. We need to know if these video check-ups are as good as seeing a doctor in person. This study looked at how well video calls can find memory problems.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past research. It found studies that included at least 10 people. All of these people had new memory problems. Each person had two check-ups within one month. One check-up was by video call. The other was a regular in-person visit. The in-person visit was the main way to compare results.

The video check-up used computers and phones. This let the patient talk to the doctor from afar. Sometimes nurses helped in person before the video call. But the doctor always made the final diagnosis through the video call. This study wanted to see if the video check-ups gave the same answers as the in-person ones.

### Results

We found only three studies that fit our needs. They had a total of 136 people. Two studies were in Australia. One study was in the USA. These people either had memory issues or were at high risk for them.

The studies showed that video calls seemed very good at finding dementia. They correctly found dementia 8 to 10 times out of 10. They also correctly said when people did *not* have dementia 8 to 10 times out of 10. But there were not many studies. The results could change with more research.

For milder memory problems, called MCI, only one study gave results. Video calls found MCI 7 times out of 10. They correctly said when people did *not* have MCI 7 times out of 10. These results are from one study, so more work is needed.

Sometimes, the video check-up and the in-person visit did not fully agree. This often happened when deciding if someone had MCI or dementia. It also sometimes happened when a healthy person was thought to have MCI by video call. But these differences are often seen even with two doctors checking in person.

One study found that patients and doctors were happy with video calls. We need more studies to know about costs or how easy it is to use telehealth.

In short, video calls look promising for finding memory problems. They seem accurate for dementia. But we need more studies with more people. This will help us be sure that video check-ups are as good as seeing a doctor face-to-face.","Accuracy of telehealth assessment for diagnosing dementia and mild cognitive impairment
Background 
Dementia is an illness in which memory and other thinking skills deteriorate to the point that someone can no longer manage their daily activities without assistance. If the memory and thinking problems are milder, so that independent living is not affected, the condition is described as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Both conditions usually affect older people. It is considered important that people with dementia or MCI can get an accurate diagnosis at a time and place suitable for them so that they and their families can understand the problem and can access treatment and support. However millions of people with dementia around the world never get a diagnosis. There are many reasons for this, but one may be a lack of accessible diagnostic services, particularly for people in rural areas or those who find it difficult to travel. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, many face‐to‐face services were closed. Telehealth ‐ the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to provide health services at a distance may be a way to increase access to specialist assessment for people with suspected dementia who cannot easily get to clinics. However, it is important to be sure that increased accessibility does not come at the expense of accuracy of diagnosis. 
Review question 
We asked how accurate telehealth diagnoses of dementia and MCI were compared to diagnoses made when patients attend traditional clinics for a face‐to‐face assessment. 
What we did 
We searched databases of medical studies up to 4 November 2020 for studies in which people had two assessments for suspected dementia or MCI: one telehealth assessment and one conventional face‐to‐face assessment. Both assessments were done by specialists and took place within a month of each other. For the telehealth assessment, all contact between the patient and the diagnosing specialist had to have been done remotely, using ICT, but some of the information needed to make the diagnosis could be collected by other members of the healthcare team who saw the patient in person. We then assessed how closely the results of the telehealth assessments agreed with the face‐to‐face assessments. 
What we found 
We included three studies (136 participants) who had suspected dementia. One small study (16 participants) was conducted in veterans' homes in the USA; the other two studies were in community services in Australia. They all used videoconference systems for their telehealth assessments. All three studies aimed to make dementia diagnoses but only one also aimed to diagnose MCI. The quality of the studies was generally good. In two studies, nurses who saw the patients in person played a big role in gathering information used in both assessments, which could bias those studies towards close agreement between the assessments. 
The studies found that telehealth assessment correctly identified 80% to 100% of the people who were diagnosed with dementia at face‐to‐face assessment and also correctly identified 80% to 100% of people who did not have dementia. 
Only one study (100 participants) attempted to diagnose MCI. In this study, 71% of participants who had MCI and 73% of participants who did not have MCI were correctly identified using telehealth assessment. 
Telehealth assessment in this study correctly identified 97% of the participants who had either MCI or dementia, but correctly identified only 22% of those who did not have either, although again this result was very uncertain because of the very small number of people in this category. 
It is important to note that diagnoses of dementia and MCI made by two specialists seeing patients face‐to‐face will not show 100% agreement. Therefore perfect agreement between telehealth and face‐to‐face assessments cannot be expected. 
What we concluded 
From the evidence we found, telehealth assessment for diagnosing dementia seems to have a good level of accuracy when compared to face‐to‐face assessment, although the small number of studies and participants and differences between the included studies means that there is a lot of uncertainty about this result. Telehealth appeared to be a little less accurate for diagnosing MCI than for diagnosing dementia. Agreement between two face‐to‐face assessments is also not perfect and we cannot say that disagreements between telehealth and face‐to‐face diagnoses were any more common.

This is the second update of the review first published in the Cochrane Library (2010, Issue 2) and later updated (2014, Issue 9). 
Despite advances in chemotherapy, the prognosis of ovarian cancer remains poor. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce tumour antigen‐specific anti‐tumour immune responses as an alternative treatment for ovarian cancer. 
Objectives
Primary objective  • To assess the clinical efficacy of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer as evaluated by tumour response measured by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) and/or cancer antigen (CA)‐125 levels, response to post‐immunotherapy treatment, and survival differences 
◦ In addition, we recorded the numbers of observed antigen‐specific humoral and cellular responses Secondary objective  • To establish which combinations of immunotherapeutic strategies with tumour antigens provide the best immunological and clinical results 
Search methods
For the previous version of this review, we performed a systematic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2009, Issue 3), in the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE and Embase databases, and clinicaltrials.gov (1966 to July 2009). We also conducted handsearches of the proceedings of relevant annual meetings (1996 to July 2009). 
For the first update of this review, we extended the searches to October 2013, and for this update, we extended the searches to July 2017. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as well as non‐randomised studies (NRSs), that included participants with epithelial ovarian cancer, irrespective of disease stage, who were treated with antigen‐specific active immunotherapy, irrespective of type of vaccine, antigen used, adjuvant used, route of vaccination, treatment schedule, and reported clinical or immunological outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviews authors independently extracted the data. We evaluated the risk of bias for RCTs according to standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane, and for NRSs by using a selection of quality domains deemed best applicable to the NRS. 
Main results
We included 67 studies (representing 3632 women with epithelial ovarian cancer). The most striking observations of this review address the lack of uniformity in conduct and reporting of early‐phase immunotherapy studies. Response definitions show substantial variation between trials, which makes comparison of trial results unreliable. Information on adverse events is frequently limited. Furthermore, reports of both RCTs and NRSs frequently lack the relevant information necessary for risk of bias assessment. Therefore, we cannot rule out serious biases in most of the included trials. However, selection, attrition, and selective reporting biases are likely to have affected the studies included in this review. GRADE ratings were high only for survival; for other primary outcomes, GRADE ratings were very low. 
The largest body of evidence is currently available for CA‐125‐targeted antibody therapy (17 studies, 2347 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Non‐randomised studies of CA‐125‐targeted antibody therapy suggest improved survival among humoral and/or cellular responders, with only moderate adverse events. However, four large randomised placebo‐controlled trials did not show any clinical benefit, despite induction of immune responses in approximately 60% of participants. Time to relapse with CA‐125 monoclonal antibody versus placebo, respectively, ranged from 10.3 to 18.9 months versus 10.3 to 13 months (six RCTs, 1882 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Only one RCT provided data on overall survival, reporting rates of 80% in both treatment and placebo groups (three RCTs, 1062 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Other small studies targeting many different tumour antigens have presented promising immunological results. As these strategies have not yet been tested in RCTs, no reliable inferences about clinical efficacy can be made. Given the promising immunological results and the limited side effects and toxicity reported, exploration of clinical efficacy in large well‐designed RCTs may be worthwhile. 
Authors' conclusions
We conclude that despite promising immunological responses, no clinically effective antigen‐specific active immunotherapy is yet available for ovarian cancer. Results should be interpreted cautiously, as review authors found a significant dearth of relevant information for assessment of risk of bias in both RCTs and NRSs. 
","## Plain Language Summary: New Treatments for Ovarian Cancer

### Rationale

Ovarian cancer is a serious disease that starts in the ovaries. The ovaries are small organs that make eggs in women. This type of cancer can be hard to treat. Even with the best treatments, many women do not get better. This is a big problem for many patients.

Scientists are looking for new ways to fight ovarian cancer. One new way is called immunotherapy. This treatment helps your body's own immune system fight the cancer. The immune system is like your body's army that fights off germs and sickness.

This study looked at a type of immunotherapy called ""antigen-specific active immunotherapy."" This treatment tries to teach your immune system to find and kill cancer cells. Scientists hope this new treatment can help women live longer and feel better.

### Trial Design

This study asked, ""Can antigen-specific active immunotherapy help women with ovarian cancer?""

To answer this, researchers looked at many past studies. They reviewed all types of studies. Some were ""randomized controlled trials"" (RCTs). In these studies, some women got the new treatment and some got a sugar pill. Other studies were ""non-randomized studies"" (NRSs). These studies did not use a sugar pill.

The studies included women with ovarian cancer. This was true for women no matter how far along their cancer was. The women received different types of these new immune treatments. The studies looked at how the women responded to the treatment. They also looked at how long the women lived.

The researchers spent a lot of time looking through all the old studies. They checked how well each study was done. They wanted to make sure the results were fair and true.

### Results

The researchers looked at 67 studies. These studies included 3632 women with ovarian cancer.

What did they find? They saw that many early studies were not done in the same way. It was hard to compare results. Also, many studies did not give enough information about side effects. It was also hard to tell if some studies had mistakes or problems. This means we must be careful when we look at these results.

Some studies looked at a target called CA-125. This is a protein often found in women with ovarian cancer. Some women who got CA-125 treatments had better survival. These treatments had only small side effects. However, four large studies that compared this treatment to a sugar pill did not show a clear benefit. The time until the cancer came back was about the same. It was around 10 to 19 months for treatment and 10 to 13 months for the sugar pill. Only one study showed how long women lived overall. The survival rates were 80% for both groups.

Other small studies looked at different targets on cancer cells. They showed good immune responses. This means the treatments helped the immune system start to fight. But these studies were very small. We cannot say if these treatments truly help women yet.

In the end, this study found that these immune treatments make the immune system react. However, there is no clear proof yet that they help women with ovarian cancer live longer or get better. More good studies are needed. These new studies should be large and well-designed. They should also track side effects carefully. This will help us know if these promising treatments can really make a difference for patients.","Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer
Background  Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancers. Standard therapy consists of surgery and chemotherapy. Responses to chemotherapy are generally good; however, most women experience relapse, for which no curative treatment is available. The presence of certain immune cells in tumours is associated with longer survival. This suggests that stimulation of anti‐tumour immune responses (i.e. immunotherapy) might be a useful approach for improving outcomes among women with ovarian cancer. 
Review question This review evaluated the feasibility of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce anti‐tumour immune responses through administration of a tumour antigen ‐ a molecule that is expressed by tumour cells and is hardly expressed by healthy cells. Reviewers collected information on clinical outcomes, immunological responses, and side effects. 
Main findings We identified 67 studies, which included 3632 women with ovarian cancer and were published between 1966 and 2017. The most frequently described strategy was administration of antibodies targeting the tumour antigen CA‐125 (2347 participants in 17 studies). Most of these studies primarily evaluated safety and immunological responses. Severe flu‐like and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 7% to 30% of participants. Researchers frequently detected antibodies and immune cells recognising the tumour antigen CA‐125, albeit response rates varied between studies. Despite these promising immunological responses, four large studies reported no survival advantage for participants treated with CA‐125‐directed antibody over those given placebo. 
For strategies not relying on antibody administration, similar conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Overall, study authors report that treatment was well tolerated and inflammatory side effects at the injection site were most frequently observed. Researchers observed responses of the immune system for most strategies studied, but the clinical benefit of these strategies remains to be evaluated in large trials. 
Certainty of the evidence and conclusions Because no high‐certainty evidence of clinical benefit is currently available, antibody therapy targeting CA‐125 should not be incorporated into standard treatment in its current form. 
Based on lack of uniformity in included studies, we strongly advocate universal adoption of response definitions, guidelines for adverse events reporting, and directives for trial conduct and reporting. Furthermore, results from ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are awaited, and further RCTs should be conducted.

10.1002-14651858.CD010497.pub2,"Oral fumaric acid esters for the treatment of psoriasis
Background 
Psoriasis is a long‐term inflammatory skin condition that can markedly reduce the quality of life of affected individuals. Treatments taken by mouth (oral treatments), such as methotrexate, ciclosporin, and acitretin, are commonly prescribed to people with moderate to severe psoriasis. Oral fumaric acid esters (FAE) are licensed for the treatment of psoriasis in Germany but remain unlicensed in most other countries. This means that there are different treatment options offered to people in different countries. 
Review question 
What is the available evidence for the benefits and risks of using FAE for treating psoriasis? 
Study characteristics 
Our review included six randomised control trials (RCTs) that involved 544 participants. Five RCTs compared FAE with placebo, and one compared FAE with methotrexate. The outcomes we were interested in measuring were the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), which is a psoriasis severity score, and the proportion of participants who discontinued treatment because of adverse (side) effects that are common but sufficiently serious that the drug had to be stopped, such as severe diarrhoea, infections, or cutaneous malignancy. 
Key results 
It was difficult to pool and compare results because outcome measures differed between the studies. Three studies reported significant benefit with FAE when compared with placebo after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment, but we could not combine these results in a statistical analysis to show the overall difference. The included studies did not fully examine the chance of discontinuing FAE treatment because of adverse effects, which is uncertain. One study showed that individuals on FAE are nearly five times more likely to develop nuisance adverse effects; the most common were diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, flushing, reversible protein loss in the urine, and raised levels of eosinophil blood cells. Two RCTs were similar enough to allow the combination of their results and found that FAE were better than placebo when measured by the proportion of individuals who experienced at least a 50% improvement in their psoriasis severity score. One study reported improvement of individuals' quality of life with FAE in comparison with placebo, but the significance of this difference could not be calculated. The benefit of FAE was similar to methotrexate after 12 weeks when changes in disease severity from the start to the end of the trial were compared. The number of individuals experiencing nuisance adverse effects with these two treatments was not significantly different. The included studies, which were too small and of limited duration to provide evidence about rare or delayed effects, reported no serious adverse effects of FAE. 
Quality of the evidence 
The risk of study bias, which means any factors that may systematically deviate away from the true findings, was unclear in most studies. This may be because most of the studies were conducted decades ago or were incompletely reported. Several analyses comparing FAE with placebo and methotrexate were limited because the studies were small or did not provide enough information to establish how these treatments compare with each other. Therefore, the overall quality of the evidence was low when comparing FAE with placebo and very low when comparing FAE with methotrexate. 
Future RCTs should use standard psoriasis outcome measures, including a validated quality of life scale, to enable the comparison and combination of results. They should be longer in duration or have longer follow‐up phases to provide evidence about any delayed adverse effects.

## Plain Title
Skin Rash: How a Pill Helps and Any Risks

## Rationale
Psoriasis is a long-term skin problem. It makes skin red and flaky. This condition can make life hard for people who have it. Doctors often give pills for bad psoriasis. These pills include drugs like methotrexate.

A pill called fumaric acid esters (FAE) helps with psoriasis in Germany. But most other countries do not use this pill. This means people get different care based on where they live.

We wanted to know if FAE pills are good and safe for treating psoriasis. We need to learn more about this drug. It could give more people a way to treat their bad skin.

## Trial Design
How is this study designed?

We looked at six studies that were very fair. These studies included 544 people. These people had moderate to severe psoriasis. The studies wanted to see how well FAE worked.

Five studies gave some people FAE pills and others a sugar pill. A sugar pill looks like the real drug but does not do anything. One study compared FAE pills to another drug called methotrexate.

We looked at how much the psoriasis got better. We used a score called PASI for this. We also checked how many people stopped the pills because of bad side effects. These side effects could be bad stomach pain or skin problems.

## Results
What were the main results of the study?

It was hard to put all the study results together. The studies did not all measure things the same way.

Three studies showed that FAE pills helped a lot more than sugar pills. This was after 12 to 16 weeks. But we could not add these results up to get one clear answer.

It was not clear how often people had to stop FAE pills due to bad side effects. One study found people on FAE were almost five times more likely to get small side effects. These were mostly loose stools and belly cramps. They also got hot flashes, protein in their pee, and changes in blood cells.

Two studies were alike enough to combine. They showed that FAE was better than sugar pills. Many more people saw their psoriasis get at least 50% better with FAE. One study also found FAE made people feel better about their life.

FAE pills worked about as well as methotrexate after 12 weeks. The amount of skin clearing was about the same for both. The number of people with small side effects was also about the same.

The studies were small and short. They could not tell us about rare or late side effects. But no big bad side effects were seen with FAE in these studies.

More studies are needed. They should measure things the same way. This will help us compare drugs better. Studies should also last longer. This will help us find any late side effects.","Oral fumaric acid esters for the treatment of psoriasis

Key messages 
Anticholinergic medicines may increase the risk of death in older adults who have dementia.  However, the evidence is low certainty, and we cannot say for certain if the anticholinergic medicines cause death, or if they are simply more likely to be used by people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.  
We cannot draw firm conclusions for the risk that anticholinergic medicines pose to the development of other undesirable clinical outcomes, such as further deterioration of memory and thinking, or behavioural and psychological issues.  More research is needed to establish whether anticholinergic medicines cause unintended problems for older adults who have dementia. 
What are anticholinergic medicines? 
Medicines can be classified by their ability to block the action of a chemical signalling system in the body, called the cholinergic system. Medicines that do this are said to have anticholinergic effects, and therefore, are referred to as anticholinergic medicines. 
What did we want to find out?  
Anticholinergic medicines are commonly used to treat a number of medical conditions that people with dementia frequently experience. Typical examples are medicines used to treat urinary tract infections or episodes of agitation. However, because the cholinergic system in the brain plays an important role in learning, memory, and emotional regulation, there are theoretical reasons to believe that the use of anticholinergic medicines may unintentionally exacerbate psychological problems in this population. In this review, we investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and future occurrence of undesirable clinical outcomes in people with dementia.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the link between anticholinergic medicines and a range of clinical outcomes in people with dementia. We compared and summarised the results of identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes.  
What did we find? 
We found a total of 18 studies, involving 102,684 adults aged 50 years or more, who had issues with memory and thinking. We found that the evidence was highly inconsistent regarding the link between anticholinergic medicines and increased issues with memory and thinking in people with dementia. There were no studies that investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and frequency of behavioural disturbances. Therefore, we could not draw any conclusions about whether anticholinergic medicines cause issues with memory and thinking, or behavioural disturbances in this population. However, we did find there was a more consistent link between anticholinergic medicines and the risk of death. Those who were taking anticholinergic medicines had a 15% higher risk of dying than those who were not taking anticholinergic medicines.   
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The available evidence is very low certainty because of the inconsistency of study results, and the lack of control for health conditions that could be linked with both the clinical outcomes and the prescribing of anticholinergic medicines themselves. It is possible that anticholinergic medicines may not actually cause death, but are simply more likely to be given to people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.

## Plain Title
Medicines that Affect Brain Signals and Their Impact on People with Memory Issues

## Rationale
Many people get a condition called dementia. Dementia makes it hard to think and remember things. It also affects how people act. This can be very hard for patients and their families.

Some common medicines are called ""anticholinergic medicines."" These medicines block a special signal system in the body. This system is called the cholinergic system. It helps with learning, memory, and feelings.

People with dementia often take these medicines for other health problems. For example, they might use them for bladder problems or feeling upset.

But there is a worry. Since the cholinergic system is so important for the brain, these medicines might make dementia worse. They might cause more problems with memory, thinking, or behavior.

This study looked at this concern. We wanted to see if these medicines were linked to new problems for people with dementia. We wanted to know if they caused bad outcomes.

## Trial Design
How did we study this?
We looked for many different studies. These studies had already been done. They explored the link between anticholinergic medicines and problems in people with dementia.

We gathered all the information from these studies. Then we compared the results. We checked how strong the evidence was from each study. We looked at how the studies were done. We also looked at how many people were in each study.

The studies included adults who were 50 years old or more. All of these people had problems with their memory and thinking. This means they had dementia. We looked at how these medicines affected their health over time. We did not do a new study where people took medicines. We only looked at old studies.

## Results
What did we find in our study?
We found 18 studies in total. More than 100,000 people were in these studies. All of them were 50 or older and had memory problems.

We looked at how these medicines affected memory and thinking. The results were not clear. Some studies said there was a link, others did not. So, we cannot say if these medicines cause more problems with memory or thinking.

We also looked at how these medicines affected behavior. No studies looked at this. So, we cannot say if these medicines cause problems with behavior.

But we did find something important about dying. People taking anticholinergic medicines had a higher chance of dying. For every 100 people taking these medicines, 15 more people died. This was compared to people not taking the medicines.

It is important to know this. But we are not sure if the medicines caused the deaths. People who take these medicines might already be sicker. They might be at a higher risk of dying for other reasons.

So, more research is needed. We need to find out for sure if these medicines cause problems. We need to know if they cause problems with memory, thinking, behavior, or even death. This will help doctors give the best care to people with dementia.","The impact of cumulative medications with anticholinergic effects on future adverse clinical outcomes in people with dementia

10.1002-14651858.CD007263.pub3,"Background
Preterm infants have fewer nutrient reserves at birth than full‐term infants and often receive artificial formula feeds in the absence of expressed breast milk. Although it is generally agreed that feeding must be initiated slowly and advanced with much greater deliberation than in a healthy, full‐term infant, the way in which feeds are introduced and advanced in preterm infants varies widely. This review focuses on whether dilute or full‐strength formula is the preferable mode of introducing feeds in preterm infants for whom expressed breast milk is unavailable. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of dilute versus full‐strength formula on the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis, feeding intolerance, weight gain, length of stay in hospital and time to achieve full calorie intake in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants. A secondary objective was to assess the effects of different dilution strategies. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to update the search in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 1 October 2018), Embase (1980 to 1 October 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 1 October 2018). 
We searched clinical trials' registries for ongoing or recently completed trials (clinicaltrials.gov; the World Health Organization’s International Trials Registry and Platform; and the ISRCTN Registry). 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised trials comparing strengths of formula milk in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants. We excluded studies if infants received formula as a supplement to breast milk. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently assessed studies for inclusion. We collected data using the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal, with independent assessment of risk of bias and data extraction. We synthesised mean differences using a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included three studies involving 102 preterm or low birth weight infants in the review. The studies compared dilute (double‐volume, half‐strength) formula with full‐strength (20 kcal/oz (~ 68 to 70 kcal/100 mL)) formula. We assessed all three studies as having unclear risk of bias due to the likely absence of blinding of study personnel and the potential for selection bias in the largest trial. Data for the primary outcome of necrotising enterocolitis were not reported in any of the studies. We could combine two of the studies (88 infants) in the meta‐analysis. The evidence suggests that dilute formula with double‐volume (half‐strength) may lead to fewer episodes of gastric residuals per day (one study; mean difference (MD) −1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.20 to −0.20; low‐certainty evidence), fewer episodes of gastric residuals per baby until attaining 100 kcal/kg (one study; MD −0.80, 95% CI −1.32 to −0.28; low‐certainty evidence), fewer episodes of vomiting per day (one study; MD −0.04, 95% CI −0.07 to −0.01; low‐certainty evidence) and fewer occurrences of abdominal distension greater than 2 cm (two studies; MD −0.16, 95% CI −0.19 to −0.13; low‐certainty evidence). For the secondary outcomes, data suggest that infants in the dilute formula with double‐volume (half‐strength) group may have attained an adequate energy intake earlier than infants in the full‐strength group (two studies; MD −2.26, 95% CI −2.85 to −1.67; low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups for weight gain one week after commencement of intragastric feeds (one study; MD 0.05 kg, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.15; low‐certainty evidence). Data were not reported for length of hospital stay.

There is low‐certainty evidence from three small, old trials that use of dilute formula in preterm or low birth weight formula‐fed infants may lead to an important reduction in the time taken for preterm infants to attain an adequate energy intake. 
However, our confidence in this result is limited due to uncertainty over risk of bias and sparsity of available data. Dilute formula may reduce incidence of feeding intolerance, but the clinical significance of the reduction is uncertain. The impact on serious gastrointestinal problems, including necrotising enterocolitis, was not reported in any of the trials. Further randomised trials are needed to confirm these results. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title

Giving very small babies watered-down formula may help them eat more easily.

### Rationale

Babies born too early, called preterm infants, have less stored food in their bodies. They often need formula milk if their mother’s milk is not available. Giving food to these tiny babies must be done slowly and with great care. But how doctors do this can vary a lot.

This study looked at how to start feeding these babies. We wanted to know if giving them watered-down formula or full-strength formula was better. We needed to know what choice was best for these very small babies. Watered-down formula might be easier for their tummies to handle.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past research. It gathered facts from studies that compared different types of formula. The studies included babies born early or babies who weighed very little at birth. All babies in these studies only had formula milk. They did not drink breast milk.

We wanted to see how the two types of formula affected certain things. We looked at serious gut problems, how well babies tolerated food, how much weight they gained, and how long they stayed in the hospital. We also checked how fast they reached a full feeding amount. Each baby in these studies was followed to see these changes.

### Results

We found three studies that included 102 tiny babies. These studies looked at watered-down formula versus full-strength formula. Watered-down means the formula was half as strong but given in twice the amount.

The results suggest that watered-down formula might help babies in several ways. Babies given watered-down formula had less tummy upset. They had less undigested food in their tummies. They also threw up less often. Their tummies were not as swollen.

These babies might also have reached their full food intake sooner. This means they could get enough food faster. This is important for their growth. There was no clear proof that one type of formula made babies gain more weight. We also do not know if it changed how long they stayed in the hospital.

More studies are needed to be sure. We also need to know if it helps with serious gut issues. The results so far show that watered-down formula could be a good choice for these fragile babies. It might help them eat and grow better.","Dilute versus full‐strength formula in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants 
Review questionIs dilute formula milk (e.g. half the strength at double the volume) better tolerated than full‐strength formula milk in the initial feeding of preterm babies for whom breast milk is not available?  
BackgroundBabies born preterm (at less than 37 weeks' gestation) or with a low birth weight (less than 2500 grams) have special feeding requirements. Expressed breast milk is preferred, but preterm babies are often fed with formula milk because breast milk is not always available. The provision of artificial feeds varies considerably in preterm babies and there is concern that introducing full‐strength formulas too early may lead to the retention of feed in the stomach, which is associated with feeding intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis, a severe bowel disorder. 
Study characteristicsThe evidence for this review is current as of 1 October 2018. We included three trials that compared dilute formula milk (half‐strength, double‐volume) with full‐strength formula milk. The trials involved 102 preterm or low birth weight infants; two were conducted in the USA and one in India. The trials were small (14, 38 and 50 infants, respectively) and conducted between 25 and 30 years ago. The quality of two trials was judged to be poor due to insufficient information being provided in the trial publications, but judged to be moderate in the third trial (of 38 infants). None of the trials assessed necrotising enterocolitis as an outcome. 
Key resultsInfants receiving dilute formula (half‐strength, double‐volume) experienced fewer episodes of feeding intolerance and achieved full energy intake earlier than infants receiving full‐strength formula (20 kcal/oz (~ 68 to 70 kcal/100 mL)). 
Feeding intoleranceTwo measures of feeding intolerance (abdominal distension and episodes of gastric residuals) were reported across the trials. Two trials (88 infants) provided data for abdominal distension and gastric residuals. Infants fed dilute formula experienced 19% (CI 16% to 23%) fewer episodes of abdominal distension (> 2 cm), equivalent to 0.67 episodes per infant in the half‐strength group compared to 0.83 episodes in the full‐strength group. It was not possible to combine data on gastric residuals but both trials reported fewer episodes of gastric residuals in the dilute formula group. The third trial (14 infants) only reported that there was no difference between the groups with respect to these two outcomes. 
Time to establish full enteral feedingIn two trials (88 infants) infants receiving dilute formula experienced a 22% (CI 16% to 28%) reduction in the number of days required to reach an adequate energy intake (420 joules/kilogram), equivalent to 8 days in the half‐strength group compared to 10.3 days in the full‐strength group. 
Certainty of evidenceIn exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants, low‐certainty evidence shows that diluted formula may lead to an important reduction in the time taken to attain adequate enteral fluid and energy requirements, without increasing indicators of feeding intolerance. The clinical importance of the reduction in episodes of feeding intolerance is unclear. These findings are based on three small, old trials that may be of less relevance to current practice. A lack of data on other important outcomes, such as the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and weight gain, limits the usefulness of the studies.

10.1002-14651858.CD015085.pub2,"Background
Starting in late 2019, COVID‐19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2, spread around the world. Long‐term care facilities are at particularly high risk of outbreaks, and the burden of morbidity and mortality is very high among residents living in these facilities. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological measures implemented in long‐term care facilities to prevent or reduce the transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection among residents, staff, and visitors. 
Search methods
On 22 January 2021, we searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, Web of Science, and CINAHL. 
We also conducted backward citation searches of existing reviews.
Selection criteria
We considered experimental, quasi‐experimental, observational and modelling studies that assessed the effects of the measures implemented in long‐term care facilities to protect residents and staff against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Primary outcomes were infections, hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID‐19, contaminations of and outbreaks in long‐term care facilities, and adverse health effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author performed data extractions, risk of bias assessments and quality appraisals, and at least one other author checked their accuracy. Risk of bias and quality assessments were conducted using the ROBINS‐I tool for cohort and interrupted‐time‐series studies, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for case‐control studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively, focusing on the direction of effect. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, with the author team critically discussing the ratings. 
Main results
We included 11 observational studies and 11 modelling studies in the analysis. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. 
Most studies compared outcomes in long‐term care facilities that implemented the measures with predicted or observed control scenarios without the measure (but often with baseline infection control measures also in place). Several modelling studies assessed additional comparator scenarios, such as comparing higher with lower rates of testing. 
There were serious concerns regarding risk of bias in almost all observational studies and major or critical concerns regarding the quality of many modelling studies. Most observational studies did not adequately control for confounding. Many modelling studies used inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of the models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. 
Overall, we identified five intervention domains, each including a number of specific measures. 
Entry regulation measures (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies)Self‐confinement of staff with residents may reduce the number of infections, probability of facility contamination, and number of deaths. Quarantine for new admissions may reduce the number of infections. Testing of new admissions and intensified testing of residents and of staff after holidays may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain regarding whether restricting admissions of new residents reduces the number of infections, but the measure may reduce the probability of facility contamination. Visiting restrictions may reduce the number of infections and deaths. Furthermore, it may increase the probability of facility contamination, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is very uncertain how visiting restrictions may adversely affect the mental health of residents. 
Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies)Barrier nursing may increase the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent cleaning and environmental hygiene measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear how contact reduction measures affect the probability of outbreaks. These measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. Personal hygiene measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Mask and personal protective equipment usage may reduce the number of infections, the probability of outbreaks, and the number of deaths, but the evidence is very uncertain. Cohorting residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, although evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent contact ‐regulating and transmission ‐reducing measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
Surveillance measures (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies)Routine testing of residents and staff independent of symptoms may reduce the number of infections. It may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Evidence from one observational study suggests that the measure may reduce, while the evidence from one modelling study suggests that it probably reduces hospitalisations. The measure may reduce the number of deaths among residents, but the evidence on deaths among staff is unclear. Symptom‐based surveillance testing may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
Outbreak control measures (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies)Separating infected and non‐infected residents or staff caring for them may reduce the number of infections. The measure may reduce the probability of outbreaks and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. Isolation of cases may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
Multicomponent measures (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study)A combination of multiple infection‐control measures, including various combinations of the above categories, may reduce the number of infections and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides a comprehensive framework and synthesis of a range of non‐pharmacological measures implemented in long‐term care facilities. These may prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infections and their consequences. However, the certainty of evidence is predominantly low to very low, due to the limited availability of evidence and the design and quality of available studies. Therefore, true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. 
Overall, more studies producing stronger evidence on the effects of non‐pharmacological measures are needed, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries and on possible unintended consequences of these measures. Future research should explore the reasons behind the paucity of evidence to guide pandemic research priority setting in the future. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Keeping Nursing Home Residents Safe from COVID-19

### Rationale

In late 2019, a new sickness called COVID-19 began to spread. This sickness comes from a bug called SARS-CoV-2. It spread all over the world very fast.

Nursing homes and long-term care homes were hit hard. Many people who lived there got sick and many died. This was a big problem for these homes.

This study looked at ways to stop the bug from spreading in these homes. We wanted to see if simple actions, not medicines, could help. We looked at actions that protect residents, staff, and visitors.

We needed this study because we wanted to know what works best. We hoped to find clear ways to keep people safe.

### Trial Design

This study asked: ""How can we stop COVID-19 in nursing homes?"" We looked at many different past studies. These studies checked actions taken in long-term care homes.

We looked at studies that kept track of infections. They also looked at hospital stays and deaths due to COVID-19. We checked if homes got the bug and how many people got sick there. We also looked at any bad effects from these actions.

We looked at studies of all types. Some watched what happened. Others used computer models to guess what would happen. We looked at studies that focused on protecting residents and staff.

Two people checked each study to make sure it fit. One person pulled out the main facts. Another person checked that the facts were right. We made sure to note any weak points in the studies.

We used special tools to check how good each study was. This helped us see if the results were strong or not. We then put all the findings together to see what we learned.

### Results

We looked at 22 studies in total. These studies were mostly from rich countries.

Many studies compared homes that took steps to homes that did not. Some studies also looked at different levels of testing. For example, more testing versus less testing.

We found some weak spots in the studies. Many studies did not fully account for all factors. Many computer models used guesses that might not be right. This means some results may not be as sure.

We found five main types of actions that homes took:

**1. Rules for people coming in:**

*   If staff stayed with residents, it might mean fewer people got sick. It might also stop the bug from getting into the home. It might lead to fewer deaths.
*   Making new residents stay apart first might lower infections.
*   Testing new residents and staff after holidays might lower infections. But we are not very sure about this.
*   Stopping new residents from coming in might lower infections. But we are not very sure. It might also stop the bug from getting into the home.
*   Stopping visitors might lower infections and deaths. But it might also let the bug get in, and we are not very sure about this. It is also not clear how this might hurt residents' minds.

**2. Ways to limit contact and stop spread:**

*   Special nursing care might raise infections or outbreaks. But we are not very sure.
*   Better cleaning might lower infections. But we are not very sure.
*   Limiting contact might lower infections. But we are not very sure. It is not clear how it affects outbreaks.
*   Washing hands often might lower outbreaks. But we are not very sure.
*   Wearing masks and other gear might lower infections and outbreaks. It might also lower deaths. But we are not very sure.
*   Keeping groups of residents and staff together might lower infections. But we are not very sure.
*   Using many of these steps together might lower outbreaks. But we are not very sure.

**3. Ways to watch for the bug:**

*   Testing residents and staff often, even if they seem fine, might lower infections. It might also lower outbreaks. But we are not very sure.
*   It might also mean fewer hospital stays and deaths for residents. But it is not clear for staff deaths.
*   Testing people who have symptoms might lower infections and outbreaks. But we are not very sure.

**4. Steps to take during an outbreak:**

*   Keeping sick residents and staff separate might lower infections. It might also lower outbreaks. It might lower deaths. But we are not very sure about deaths.
*   Keeping sick people by themselves might lower infections and outbreaks. But we are not very sure.

**5. Using many steps at once:**

*   Doing many of these steps together might lower infections. It might also lower deaths. But we are not very sure about deaths.

This study gave us a big picture of many actions. These actions might help stop COVID-19 and its bad effects in nursing homes.

But we are not very sure about most of these results. This is because there were not many studies. Also, the studies were not always very strong. So, what really happens might be very different from what we found.

We need more good studies to be sure about what works. We also need to look at poorer countries. We need to see if these actions have any bad effects we did not expect. Future studies should find out why we do not have enough strong proof. This will help us be ready for future sicknesses.","Can non‐medicinal measures prevent or reduce SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in long term care facilities? 
Key messages 
• Non‐medicinal measures (e.g. visiting restrictions or regular testing) may prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (causing COVID‐19 disease) in residents and staff in long term care facilities, but we have concerns about the reliability of the findings. 
• More high‐quality studies on real‐world experiences are needed, in particular.
• More research is also needed on measures in facilities where most residents and staff are vaccinated, as well as regions other than North America and Europe. 
What are non‐medicinal measures? 
Non‐medicinal measures are ways of preventing or reducing disease without using medicine, such as vaccines. These include controlling people's movements and contacts, using personal protective equipment (PPE), or regular testing for infection. 
SARS‐CoV‐2 is very infectious. Elderly or disabled people, who live in care homes (long‐term care facilities), are vulnerable to infection because they live in close contact with other people, with carers and visitors entering and leaving the facility. Due to age and underlying health conditions, care home residents have an increased risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID‐19 and dying from the disease. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how effective non‐medicinal measures are in preventing residents and staff in long‐term care facilities from becoming infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and in reducing the spread of the infection. We focused on all types of long‐term care facilities for adults, such as nursing homes for the elderly and skilled nursing facilities for people living with disabilities. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated the effects of non‐medicinal measures in long‐term care facilities. To be included, studies had to report how many infections, hospitalisations or deaths the measures prevented in residents or staff, or whether the measures prevented the introduction of the virus into the facilities or prevented outbreaks within facilities. We included any type of study, including observational studies that used ‘real‐world’ data, or modelling studies based on assumed data from computer‐generated simulations. 
What did we find? 
We found 22 studies, 11 observational and 11 modelling studies. All studies were conducted in North America or Europe. 
There were four main types of measures.
1.Entry regulation measures to prevent residents, staff or visitors introducing the virus into the facility. Measures included staff confining themselves with residents, quarantine for newly‐admitted residents, testing new admissions, not allowing the admission of new residents, and preventing visitors from entering facilities. 
2. Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures to prevent people passing on the virus. Measures included wearing masks or PPE, social distancing, extra cleaning, reducing contact between residents and among staff, and placing residents and staff in care groups and limiting contact between groups. 
3. Surveillance measures designed to identify an outbreak early. Measures included regular testing of residents or staff regardless of symptoms, and symptom‐based testing. 
4. Outbreak control measures to reduce the consequences of an outbreak. Measures included isolation of infected residents, and separating infected and non‐infected residents or staff caring for them. 
Some studies used a combination of these measures.
Main results 
Entry regulation measures  (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies) 
Most studies showed that such measures were beneficial, but some studies found no effects or unwanted effects, such as depression and delirium among residents in the context of visiting restrictions. 
Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures  (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies) 
Some measures may be beneficial, but often the evidence is very uncertain.
Surveillance measures  (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies) 
Routine testing of residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, hospitalisations and deaths among residents, although the evidence on the number of deaths among staff was less clear. Testing more often, getting test results faster, and using more accurate tests were predicted to have more beneficial effects. 
Outbreak control measures  (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies) 
These measures may reduce the number of infections and the risk of outbreaks in facilities, but often the evidence is very uncertain. 
Combination measures  (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study) 
A combination of different measures may be effective in reducing the number of infections and deaths. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in these results is limited. Many studies used mathematical prediction rather than real‐world data, and we cannot be confident that the model assumptions are accurate. Most observational studies did not use the most reliable methods. This means we cannot be confident that the measure caused the effect, for example, that testing of residents reduced the number of deaths. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
This review includes studies published up to 22 January 2021.
"
10.1002-14651858.CD013479,"Background
Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in many countries, although the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines given as a three‐dose schedule are effective in the prevention of precancerous lesions of the cervix in women. Simpler immunisation schedules, such as those with fewer doses, might reduce barriers to vaccination, as may programmes that include males. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of different dose schedules and different types of HPV vaccines in females and males. 
Search methods
We conducted electronic searches on 27 September 2018 in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library), and Ovid Embase. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov (both 27 September 2018), vaccine manufacturer websites, and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restriction. We considered studies if they enrolled HIV‐negative males or females aged 9 to 26 years, or HIV‐positive males or females of any age. 
Data collection and analysis
We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products containing an adjuvant or active vaccine and 'placebo' to refer to products that contain no adjuvant or active vaccine. Most primary outcomes in this review were clinical outcomes. However, for comparisons comparing dose schedules, the included RCTs were designed to measure antibody responses (i.e. immunogenicity) as the primary outcome, rather than clinical outcomes, since it is unethical to collect cervical samples from girls under 16 years of age. We analysed immunogenicity outcomes (i.e. geometric mean titres) with ratios of means, clinical outcomes (e.g. cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia) with risk ratios or rate ratios and, for serious adverse events and deaths, we calculated odds ratios. We rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE. 
Main results
We included 20 RCTs with 31,940 participants. The length of follow‐up in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years. 
Two doses versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 15‐year‐old females 
Antibody responses after two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules were similar after up to five years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected clinical outcome data. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing dose schedules was of very low‐certainty owing to imprecision and indirectness (three doses 35/1159; two doses 36/1158; 4 RCTs). One death was reported in the three‐dose group (1/898) and none in the two‐dose group (0/899) (low‐certainty evidence). 
Interval between doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 14‐year‐old females and males 
Antibody responses were stronger with a longer interval (6 or 12 months) between the first two doses of HPV vaccine than a shorter interval (2 or 6 months) at up to three years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected data about clinical outcomes. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing intervals was of very low‐certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. No deaths were reported in any of the studies (0/1898, 3 RCTs, low‐certainty evidence). 
HPV vaccination of 10‐ to 26‐year‐old males 
In one RCT there was moderate‐certainty evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control, reduced the incidence of external genital lesions (control 36 per 3081 person‐years; quadrivalent 6 per 3173 person‐years; rate ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 6254 person‐years) and anogenital warts (control 28 per 2814 person‐years; quadrivalent 3 per 2831 person‐years; rate ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; 5645 person‐years). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection‐site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (537 versus 601 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18, 3895 participants, high‐certainty evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence from two RCTs about serious adverse events with quadrivalent vaccine (control 12/2588; quadrivalent 8/2574), and about deaths (control 11/2591; quadrivalent 3/2582), owing to imprecision and indirectness. 
Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9‐ to 26‐year‐old females and males 
Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9‐ to 15‐years (n = 600), one in females aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 500). The RCT in 16‐ to 26‐year‐old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high‐grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high‐certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Comparative evidence about serious adverse events in the three RCTs (nonavalent 243/8234, quadrivalent 192/7629; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.61) was of low certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. 
HPV vaccination for people living with HIV 
Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low‐certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness. 
Authors' conclusions
The immunogenicity of two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules, measured using antibody responses in young females, is comparable. The quadrivalent vaccine probably reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males compared with control. The nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines offer similar protection against a combined outcome of cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions or cancer. In people living with HIV, both the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in high antibody responses. For all comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, the certainty of the body of evidence about serious adverse events reported during the study periods was low or very low, either because the number of events was low, or the evidence was indirect, or both. Post‐marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms that might be associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and this evidence will be incorporated in future updates of this review. Long‐term observational studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of reduced‐dose schedules against HPV‐related cancer endpoints, and whether adopting these schedules improves vaccine coverage rates. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title
**HPV Vaccine: How Many Shots Do We Need?**

### Rationale
The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine helps stop cancer. This includes cancer in the cervix, which is part of a woman’s womb. But not many people get the full vaccine. This might be because it needs three shots.

Doctors wonder if fewer shots could work just as well. If so, more people might get the vaccine. This study also looks at giving the vaccine to boys and men. This is important because HPV can cause other health problems in men.

This study aims to find out if fewer shots are safe and work well. It also checks if different types of HPV vaccines are safe and work well. We want to know if these changes can help more people get protected from cancer.

### Trial Design
This study looks at many past research studies. These studies are called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people in the studies were put into groups by chance. Some groups got the vaccine, and some got a dummy shot.

The studies included boys and girls, men and women. They were mostly 9 to 26 years old. Some studies also included people with HIV.

Researchers looked at how well the vaccine worked. They checked how many shots people got. They also checked how much protection the vaccine gave. The studies watched people for up to five years. This helped them see long-term effects.

### Results
We looked at 20 past studies with 31,940 people.

**Fewer Shots for Girls:**
Girls aged 9 to 15 got either two or three HPV shots. Both groups showed the same strong protection for up to five years. This means two shots might be enough. Very few serious health problems happened in either group.

**Timing of Shots:**
Young girls and boys who had more time between their first two shots showed better protection. This means waiting a bit longer between shots might make the vaccine work better.

**Vaccine for Boys and Men:**
The HPV vaccine helped protect boys and men. It greatly lowered their risk of getting skin growths and warts. These growths can be caused by HPV. More boys and men had mild pain or redness where they got the shot. This is a common side effect of vaccines.

**Newer Vaccines:**
There are different types of HPV vaccines. We looked at a newer type and an older type. Both types gave similar protection against problems that can lead to cervical cancer. The newer vaccine caused slightly more mild side effects like pain at the shot site.

**Vaccine for People with HIV:**
People with HIV also showed good protection after getting the HPV vaccine. They made a lot of defense cells in their body. This protection lasted up to two years. More research is needed to fully understand the effects in this group.

**Our Conclusion:**
Getting two shots of the HPV vaccine gives similar protection to three shots in young girls. Waiting longer between the first two shots might give better protection. The vaccine also works well for boys and men. Newer vaccines offer similar protection to older ones.

We need to keep watching people after they get the vaccine. This helps us learn more about any rare side effects. We also need to see if fewer shots lead to more people getting vaccinated.","Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines and the number of doses administered to prevent HPV‐related disease in females and males 
Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a group of viruses that infect the skin and mucous membranes. Some types of HPV are sexually transmitted and are common in young people. Most infections will be cleared by the immune system, but some people will experience persistent infection with certain HPV types that go on to cause abnormalities in infected cells. These changes are called 'precancerous' because they can develop into cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anal canal, penis, and head and neck. Infection with other HPV types causes warts in the genital area or around the anus. 
Vaccination aims to prevent future HPV infections. Three HPV vaccines are in use – a bivalent one (protects against two HPV types), a quadrivalent one (protects against four HPV types), and a nonavalent one (protects against nine HPV types). In women, three doses of the bivalent or the quadrivalent HPV vaccines protect against precancer of the cervix caused by the HPV types contained in the vaccine. Evidence about the nonavalent vaccine, about the effects of the quadrivalent vaccine in males, and about the effects of HPV vaccines in people with HIV infection, has not yet been reviewed thoroughly. Uptake of HPV vaccines remains low in many countries. Simpler vaccine schedules, or giving the vaccine to both girls and boys, could increase the number of people being vaccinated. 
Trials of HPV vaccines are not always designed to collect data about precancer and cancer, for several reasons. Firstly, HPV vaccine is routinely given before girls become sexually active, and it is not ethical to take specimens from the cervix of girls who have not had sex. Secondly, HPV‐related precancer and cancer are rare and do not develop until years after HPV infection has occurred. Thirdly, participants in a trial will be offered treatment if precancer develops, so progression to cervical cancer would be even rarer, even without vaccination. An international committee of experts states that, in some circumstances, antibody levels (i.e. showing a strong immune system response), can be used to demonstrate protection against cervical and anal cancer. The antibody levels following vaccination in a trial should not be lower than those found in other studies on adults in whom the vaccine has been shown to protect against severe HPV‐related cervical or anal disease. 
Review question(s) 
How effective or harmful are different HPV vaccine schedules (i.e. number and timing of doses) and different HPV vaccines in females and males? 
Main results 
These results are based on research evidence to 27 September 2018. We analysed 20 studies involving 31,940 people. 
Studies comparing two doses of HPV vaccine to three doses, or comparing the time interval between doses, focus on immune system responses rather than infection or disease outcomes. Two doses of HPV vaccine result in similar immune system responses to three doses, and a longer interval (up to 12 months) between doses gives a stronger immune system response than a shorter interval. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the vaccine schedules for serious adverse events and death. 
In 16‐ to 26‐year‐old men, one study showed evidence of moderate certainty that a quadrivalent HPV vaccine provides better protection against external genital lesions and genital warts than a dummy treatment (control). In 16‐ to 26‐year‐old women, one study showed that the nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines provide the same levels of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer (high‐certainty evidence). 
There was evidence that the quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more local adverse events (such as pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site) than a control treatment in males, and that the nonavalent vaccine resulted in more local adverse events than the quadrivalent vaccine in males and females. Evidence about serious adverse events and deaths from studies comparing different HPV vaccine types or dose schedules was of low or very low‐certainty. 
In people living with HIV, HPV vaccines result in reasonable levels of immune system response, but evidence about their effects on persistent HPV infection or HPV‐related disease outcomes and harms is limited. 
Certainty of the evidence 
No major issues were identified with the methodological quality of the studies for the measurements of infection and disease outcomes, or for immune system responses. Our certainty in the evidence about serious harms and deaths across all the studies comparing different HPV vaccines and vaccine schedules is low, either because of their low frequency, or because the evidence is indirect, or both. Evidence graded as high certainty means that we were confident that further research is unlikely to change our findings. Moderate‐certainty evidence means that there is a possibility that further research may have an important effect on our findings, whilst low‐certainty evidence means that our confidence was limited and further research may have an important impact on our findings. Very low‐certainty evidence means that we were uncertain about the result. 
Conclusion 
A two‐dose schedule of HPV vaccines in young females results in immune system responses that are comparable with a three‐dose schedule. In males, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine appears to be effective in the prevention of external genital lesions and genital warts. Quadrivalent and nonavalent HPV vaccines in young women result in similar levels of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer. Evidence about the efficacy and harms in people living with HIV is limited. Further long‐term population‐level studies are needed to continue monitoring safety of these vaccines, to determine for how long two doses of vaccine can provide protection against HPV‐related disease, the effect against HPV‐related cancer, and whether a two‐dose immunisation schedule will increase vaccine coverage.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about how long intravenous antibiotic treatment (antibiotics given directly into the blood stream) is needed to clear flare ups of chest symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Flare ups of symptoms (exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis are treated aggressively to prevent further damage to the lungs. This practice has led to better survival rates for people with cystic fibrosis in recent years. However, there are no clear guidelines on how long treatment with intravenous antibiotics should be to treat these flare ups. Different centres tend to use different treatment regimens. Most centres use 10 or 14 days, extending this to 21 days if there is no improvement in a person's symptoms. This is an update of previously published reviews. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 30 May 2019.
Study characteristics 
No completed studies have compared different lengths of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, but there is one study under way looking at this question. When the results are published, we plan to include the study in this review. 
Key results 
Further research is needed to find the best duration of treatment for exacerbations. A shorter duration of treatment may be better as these courses of treatment are easier for people to complete. They are also less expensive and cause fewer drug reactions than longer treatments. However, it is not clear if shorter treatment is enough to treat infections adequately. It is also not clear whether shorter treatment results in early recurrence or increased frequency of chest infections. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title
How Long Should People with Cystic Fibrosis Take IV Antibiotics for Chest Infections?

### Rationale
Cystic fibrosis is a disease that affects the lungs. It can make it hard to breathe. People with cystic fibrosis often get chest infections. These infections are called ""flare-ups."" These flare-ups can cause more lung damage. To help, doctors give strong medicines called antibiotics. They give these directly into the blood. This helps people live longer and better lives.

But doctors are not sure how long people need these medicines. Some doctors give them for 10 days. Others give them for 14 or 21 days. There are no clear rules. We need to find the best length of time. This study looks at if shorter treatments work just as well. Shorter treatments are easier to finish. They cost less money. They also cause fewer side effects.

### Trial Design
This study looks at past medical research. It asks: ""How long should people take IV antibiotics for chest infections?"" The study looks for facts up to May 30, 2019. It checks if different lengths of IV antibiotic treatment work.

We looked at studies that compared different treatment times. But we found no completed studies. One study is happening now. It is looking into this question. We will add its results when they are ready. This study does not directly involve patients. It reviews information from other studies.

### Results
We need more research to find the best treatment time. Shorter treatments might be better. They are easier for patients. They also cost less. And they cause fewer problems with the medicine.

But we do not know if short treatments work well enough. We also do not know if short treatments cause new infections sooner. We need to learn more to help people with cystic fibrosis. Doctors need clear rules to give the best care.","Length of time needed for antibiotic treatment given directly into the blood stream to clear acute chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis

10.1002-14651858.CD013870.pub2,"Background
Atopic eczema (AE), also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that causes significant burden. Phototherapy is sometimes used to treat AE when topical treatments, such as corticosteroids, are insufficient or poorly tolerated. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of phototherapy for treating AE. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov to January 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials in adults or children with any subtype or severity of clinically diagnosed AE. Eligible comparisons were any type of phototherapy versus other forms of phototherapy or any other treatment, including placebo or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology. For key findings, we used RoB 2.0 to assess bias, and GRADE to assess certainty of the evidence. Primary outcomes were physician‐assessed signs and patient‐reported symptoms. Secondary outcomes were Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), safety (measured as withdrawals due to adverse events), and long‐term control. 
Main results
We included 32 trials with 1219 randomised participants, aged 5 to 83 years (mean: 28 years), with an equal number of males and females. Participants were recruited mainly from secondary care dermatology clinics, and study duration was, on average, 13 weeks (range: 10 days to one year). We assessed risk of bias for all key outcomes as having some concerns or high risk, due to missing data, inappropriate analysis, or insufficient information to assess selective reporting. 
Assessed interventions included: narrowband ultraviolet B (NB‐UVB; 13 trials), ultraviolet A1 (UVA1; 6 trials), broadband ultraviolet B (BB‐UVB; 5 trials), ultraviolet AB (UVAB; 2 trials), psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA; 2 trials), ultraviolet A (UVA; 1 trial), unspecified ultraviolet B (UVB; 1 trial), full spectrum light (1 trial), Saalmann selective ultraviolet phototherapy (SUP) cabin (1 trial), saltwater bath plus UVB (balneophototherapy; 1 trial), and excimer laser (1 trial). Comparators included placebo, no treatment, another phototherapy, topical treatment, or alternative doses of the same treatment. 
Results for key comparisons are summarised (for scales, lower scores are better):
NB‐UVB versus placebo/no treatment 
There may be a larger reduction in physician‐assessed signs with NB‐UVB compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment (mean difference (MD) ‐9.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.62 to ‐15.18; 1 trial, 41 participants; scale: 0 to 90). Two trials reported little difference between NB‐UVB and no treatment (37 participants, four to six weeks of treatment); another reported improved signs with NB‐UVB versus no treatment (11 participants, nine weeks of treatment). 
NB‐UVB may increase the number of people reporting reduced itch after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.72, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.69; 1 trial, 40 participants). Another trial reported very little difference in itch severity with NB‐UVB (25 participants, four weeks of treatment). 
The number of participants with moderate to greater global improvement may be higher with NB‐UVB than placebo after 12 weeks of treatment (RR 2.81, 95% CI 1.10 to 7.17; 1 trial, 41 participants). 
NB‐UVB may not affect rates of withdrawal due to adverse events. No withdrawals were reported in one trial of NB‐UVB versus placebo (18 participants, nine weeks of treatment). In two trials of NB‐UVB versus no treatment, each reported one withdrawal per group (71 participants, 8 to 12 weeks of treatment). 
We judged that all reported outcomes were supported with low‐certainty evidence, due to risk of bias and imprecision. No trials reported HRQoL. 
NB‐UVB versus UVA1 
We judged the evidence for NB‐UVB compared to UVA1 to be very low certainty for all outcomes, due to risk of bias and imprecision. There was no evidence of a difference in physician‐assessed signs after six weeks (MD ‐2.00, 95% CI ‐8.41 to 4.41; 1 trial, 46 participants; scale: 0 to 108), or patient‐reported itch after six weeks (MD 0.3, 95% CI ‐1.07 to 1.67; 1 trial, 46 participants; scale: 0 to 10). Two split‐body trials (20 participants, 40 sides) also measured these outcomes, using different scales at seven to eight weeks; they reported lower scores with NB‐UVB. One trial reported HRQoL at six weeks (MD 2.9, 95% CI ‐9.57 to 15.37; 1 trial, 46 participants; scale: 30 to 150). One split‐body trial reported no withdrawals due to adverse events over 12 weeks (13 participants). No trials reported IGA. 
NB‐UVB versus PUVA 
We judged the evidence for NB‐UVB compared to PUVA (8‐methoxypsoralen in bath plus UVA) to be very low certainty for all reported outcomes, due to risk of bias and imprecision. There was no evidence of a difference in physician‐assessed signs after six weeks (64.1% reduction with NB‐UVB versus 65.7% reduction with PUVA; 1 trial, 10 participants, 20 sides). There was no evidence of a difference in marked improvement or complete remission after six weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 7.89; 1 trial, 9/10 participants with both treatments). One split‐body trial reported no withdrawals due to adverse events in 10 participants over six weeks. The trials did not report patient‐reported symptoms or HRQoL. 
UVA1 versus PUVA 
There was very low‐certainty evidence, due to serious risk of bias and imprecision, that PUVA (oral 5‐methoxypsoralen plus UVA) reduced physician‐assessed signs more than UVA1 after three weeks (MD 11.3, 95% CI ‐0.21 to 22.81; 1 trial, 40 participants; scale: 0 to 103). The trial did not report patient‐reported symptoms, IGA, HRQoL, or withdrawals due to adverse events. 
There were no eligible trials for the key comparisons of UVA1 or PUVA compared with no treatment. 
Adverse events 
Reported adverse events included low rates of phototoxic reaction, severe irritation, UV burn, bacterial superinfection, disease exacerbation, and eczema herpeticum. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared to placebo or no treatment, NB‐UVB may improve physician‐rated signs, patient‐reported symptoms, and IGA after 12 weeks, without a difference in withdrawal due to adverse events. Evidence for UVA1 compared to NB‐UVB or PUVA, and NB‐UVB compared to PUVA was very low certainty. More information is needed on the safety and effectiveness of all aspects of phototherapy for treating AE. 
","## Simple Talk About Light Therapy for Eczema

### Rationale

Many people suffer from a skin problem called eczema. Eczema makes your skin red, itchy, and dry. It can be very hard to live with. Some creams and medicines help, but they don't always work well.

Doctors sometimes use light therapy for eczema. Light therapy uses special kinds of light to help calm the skin. This study looked at how well light therapy works for eczema. We wanted to see if it helps people feel better. We also wanted to know if it is safe.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies about light therapy. We looked at 32 studies. These studies included 1,219 people with eczema. The people were adults and children. Their ages ranged from 5 to 83 years old. About half were men and half were women.

Most people in these studies went to skin clinics. The studies lasted about 3 months. Some studies were shorter, some were longer.

Doctors used different types of light therapy in these studies. They compared them to fake light therapy or no treatment. They also compared different light therapies to each other.

### Results

The main thing we found is that a type of light therapy called NB-UVB might help. It might make skin signs better after 12 weeks. It might also make itching less severe. More people felt much better with NB-UVB. This therapy did not seem to cause more people to stop treatment due to bad side effects.

However, we need more studies to be sure. The evidence we have is not very strong. This is because some studies did not share enough details. Also, some studies were very small.

We looked at other types of light therapy too. But we did not find strong evidence that one was better than another. This means we need more research on light therapy. We need to learn more about how safe it is. We also need to learn how well it works for all kinds of eczema.

Some people had side effects from light therapy. These included sunburns and skin irritation. But these problems were rare.","What are the benefits and risks of light therapy for treating atopic eczema (also known as eczema or atopic dermatitis)? 
Key messages 
Narrowband (NB) ultraviolet B (UVB), compared to placebo (a sham treatment), may improve eczema severity (including itch) and may not affect the number of people leaving a study because of unwanted effects. 
We were unable to confidently draw conclusions for other phototherapy (light therapy) treatments. 
Future research needs to assess longer term effectiveness and safety of NB‐UVB and other forms of phototherapy for eczema. 
What is eczema? 
Eczema is a condition that results in dry, itchy patches of inflamed skin. Eczema typically starts in childhood, but can improve with age. Eczema is caused by a combination of genetics and environmental factors, which lead to skin barrier dysfunction. Eczema can negatively impact quality of life, and the societal cost is significant. 
How is eczema treated? 
Eczema treatments are often creams or ointments that reduce itch and redness, applied directly to the skin. If these are unsuccessful, systemic medicines that affect the whole body, or phototherapy are options. Phototherapy can be UVB, ultraviolet A (UVA), or photochemotherapy (PUVA), where phototherapy is given alongside substances that increase sensitivity to UV light. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out whether phototherapy was better than no treatment or other types of treatment for treating eczema, and whether it caused unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated phototherapy compared with no treatment, placebo, other forms of phototherapy, or another type of eczema treatment. Studies could include people of all ages, who had eczema diagnosed by a healthcare professional. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence. 
What did we find? 
We found 32 studies, involving 1219 people with eczema (average age: 28 years), who were recruited from dermatology clinics. Most studies assessed people with skin type II to III (which is classed as white to medium skin colour), and moderate to severe eczema, with which they had lived for many years. Studies included similar numbers of males and females. 
The studies were conducted in Europe, Asia, and Egypt (setting was not reported by seven studies), and lasted, on average, for 13 weeks. Almost half of the studies reported their source of funding; two were linked to commercial sponsors. 
Our included studies mostly assessed NB‐UVB, followed by UVA1, then broadband ultraviolet B; fewer studies investigated other types of phototherapy. The studies compared these treatments to placebo, or no treatment, another type of phototherapy, different doses of the same sort of phototherapy, or other eczema treatments applied to the skin or taken by tablet. 
None of the studies investigated excimer lamp (a source of UV radiation) or heliotherapy (the use of natural sunlight), that were other light therapies in which we were interested. 
What are the main results of our review? 
When compared to placebo, NB‐UVB may:
‐ improve signs of eczema assessed by a healthcare professional (1 study, 41 people);
‐ increase the number of people reporting less severe itching (1 study, 41 people);
‐ increase the number of people reporting moderate or greater improvement of eczema, measured by the Investigator Global Assessment scale (IGA), a 5‐point scale that measures improvement in eczema symptoms (1 study, 40 people); and 
‐ have no effect on the rate of people withdrawing from treatment due to unwanted effects (3 studies, 89 people). 
None of the studies assessing NB‐UVB against placebo measured health‐related quality of life. 
We do not know if NB‐UVB (compared with UVA1 or PUVA) or UVA1 (compared with PUVA) has an effect on the following: 
‐ signs of eczema assessed by a healthcare professional;
‐ patient‐reported eczema symptoms;
‐ IGA;
‐ health‐related quality of life; and
‐ withdrawals due to unwanted effects.
This is because either we are not confident in the evidence, or they were not reported.
We did not identify any studies that investigated UVA1 or PUVA compared with no treatment.
Some studies reported that phototherapy caused some unwanted effects, including skin reactions or irritation, UV burn, worsening of eczema, and skin infections. However, these did not occur in most people. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited, mainly because only a few studies could be included in each comparison, and the studies generally involved only small numbers of people. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to January 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013264.pub2,"Background
Postoperative administration of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces patient opioid requirements and, in turn, may reduce the incidence and severity of opioid‐induced adverse events (AEs). 
Objectives
To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single‐dose intravenous (IV) ibuprofen, compared with placebo or an active comparator, for moderate‐to‐severe postoperative pain in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases without language restrictions: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS on 10 June 2021. We checked clinical trials registers and reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials that compared a single postoperative dose of intravenous (IV) ibuprofen with placebo or another active treatment, for treating acute postoperative pain in adults following any surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for review inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data.Our primary outcome was the number of participants in each arm achieving at least 50% pain relief over a 4‐ and 6‐hour period. 
Our secondary outcomes were time to, and number of participants using rescue medication; withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and for any other cause; and number of participants reporting or experiencing any AE, serious AEs (SAEs), and specific NSAID‐related or opioid‐related AEs. 
We were not able to carry out any planned meta‐analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Only one study met our inclusion criteria, involving 201 total participants, mostly female (mean age 42 years), undergoing primary, unilateral, distal, first metatarsal bunionectomy (with osteotomy and internal fixation). Ibuprofen 300 mg, placebo or acetaminophen 1000 mg was administered intravenously to participants reporting moderate pain intensity the day after surgery. Since we identified only one study for inclusion, we did not perform any quantitative analyses. The study was at low risk of bias for most domains. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to serious study limitations, indirectness and imprecision. 
Ibuprofen versus placebo 
Findings of the single study found that at both the 4‐hour and 6‐hour assessment period, the proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief was 32% (24/76) for those assigned to ibuprofen and 22% (11/50) for those assigned to placebo. These findings produced a risk ratio (RR) of 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 2.66 versus placebo for at least 50% of maximum pain relief over the 4‐hour and 6‐hour period (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Median time to rescue medication was 101 minutes for ibuprofen and 71 minutes for placebo (1 study, 126 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The number of participants using rescue medication was not reported within the included study. 
During the study (1 study, 126 participants), 58/76 (76%) of participants assigned to ibuprofen and 39/50 (78%) assigned to placebo reported or experienced any adverse event (AE), (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19; low‐certainty evidence). 
No serious AEs (SAEs) were experienced (1 study, 126 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Ibuprofen versus active comparators 
Ibuprofen (300 mg) was similar to the active comparator, IV acetaminophen (1000 mg) at 4 hours and 6 hours (1 study, 126 participants). For those assigned to active control (acetaminophen), the proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief was 35% (26/75) at 4 hours and 31% (23/75) at 6 hours. At 4 hours, these findings produced a RR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.43; very low‐certainty evidence) versus active comparator (acetaminophen). At 6 hours, these findings produced a RR of 1.03 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.66; very low‐certainty evidence) versus active comparator (acetaminophen). 
Median time to rescue medication was 101 minutes for ibuprofen and 125 minutes for the active comparator, acetaminophen (1 study, 151 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The number of participants using rescue medication was not reported within the included study. 
During the study, 58/76 (76%) of participants assigned to ibuprofen and 45/75 (60%) assigned to active control (acetaminophen) reported or experienced any AE, (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.59; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No SAEs were experienced (1 study, 151 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the suggestion that IV ibuprofen is effective and safe for acute postoperative pain in adults.  
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study abstract:

**1. Plain Title: How well does IV ibuprofen treat pain after surgery?**

**2. Rationale**

After surgery, many people feel pain. Doctors often give strong pain medicines called opioids for this pain. Opioids work well, but they can cause problems. These problems include feeling sick, dizzy, or very sleepy. Opioids can also be addictive.

Doctors want to find other ways to help with pain after surgery. This can lower the need for opioids. Ibuprofen is a common pain medicine. It can help with many types of pain. Giving ibuprofen right into the vein (IV) might help people after surgery. This could mean they need less opioid medicine. This study looked at how well IV ibuprofen works for pain after surgery. It also looked at any side effects.

**3. Trial Design: How is this study designed?**

This study was a ""review"" of other studies. The goal was to find all studies that looked at IV ibuprofen for pain after surgery. The studies had to be ""randomized."" This means people were put into groups by chance. One group got IV ibuprofen. Other groups got a fake medicine (placebo) or another pain medicine.

The review looked for studies in adults. These adults had pain that was ""moderate to severe"" after surgery. The studies needed to look at a single dose of IV ibuprofen. We looked at how much pain relief people got. We also looked at how many people had side effects.

Only one study met our needs. It had 201 people in total. Most of these people were women. Their average age was 42 years old. They had a specific foot surgery for a bunion. People in this study got IV ibuprofen (300 mg), a fake medicine, or IV acetaminophen (1000 mg). They got the medicine the day after surgery if their pain was moderate. The study looked at pain relief over 4 and 6 hours.

**4. Results: What were the main results of the study?**

Only one study was found that fit the review. Because of this, we could not combine results from many studies. This makes the results less clear.

**Ibuprofen versus Fake Medicine:**

*   After 4 hours, 32 out of 100 people who got ibuprofen had good pain relief. This was 24 out of 76 people.
*   After 4 hours, 22 out of 100 people who got fake medicine had good pain relief. This was 11 out of 50 people.
*   The results were similar after 6 hours.
*   People who got ibuprofen waited longer to ask for more pain medicine. They waited about 101 minutes. People who got fake medicine waited about 71 minutes.
*   About 76 out of 100 people on ibuprofen had some side effect. This was 58 out of 76 people.
*   About 78 out of 100 people on fake medicine had some side effect. This was 39 out of 50 people.
*   No one had very serious side effects in this study.

**Ibuprofen versus Acetaminophen:**

*   Ibuprofen worked about the same as IV acetaminophen.
*   After 4 hours, 35 out of 100 people on acetaminophen had good pain relief. This was 26 out of 75 people.
*   After 6 hours, 31 out of 100 people on acetaminophen had good pain relief. This was 23 out of 75 people.
*   People who got ibuprofen waited about 101 minutes to ask for more pain medicine. People who got acetaminophen waited about 125 minutes.
*   About 76 out of 100 people on ibuprofen had some side effect. This was 58 out of 76 people.
*   About 60 out of 100 people on acetaminophen had some side effect. This was 45 out of 75 people.
*   No one had very serious side effects in this study.

**Conclusion:**

This study found that we do not have enough clear proof. We cannot say for sure if IV ibuprofen works well or is safe for pain after surgery in adults. More studies are needed to get a clearer answer.","What are the benefits and risks of a single injection of ibuprofen (an anti‐inflammation medicine) for relieving short‐term pain after surgery in adults?  
Key messages 
‐ There is not enough evidence to determine whether intravenous (injection into a vein) ibuprofen is an effective treatment for adults with pain after surgery or if it can harm them.  
‐ It would be beneficial if future studies on this topic were well‐designed with a large number of patients to determine if ibuprofen is an effective treatment for the management of pain after surgery. 
‐ More evidence is required to establish if ibuprofen causes serious unwanted effects.
Treating short‐term pain after surgery 
Pain is common in the short term (within 6 hours) after surgery (postoperative pain). 
Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, aspirin‐like drugs) are often delivered along with opioids (such as morphine) to treat this type of pain. However, NSAIDs can have side effects. NSAIDS (such as ibuprofen) may result in bleeding (e.g. at the site of an incision or wound) and may result in injury to the kidneys and gut.  
Patients need more and better treatment options to help manage short‐term pain after surgery. There is a lot of concern about using opioids to treat short‐term pain because of the risk that patients can develop unpleasant side effects or opioid over‐use disorder. It is therefore important to weigh the benefits and risks of NSAIDs when considering using them to reduce pain shortly after surgery. 
What did we want to find out? 
Ibuprofen is a NSAID that can be delivered intravenously. We wanted to know if intravenous ibuprofen (delivered by injection or drip) is a helpful treatment option to manage moderate‐to‐severe pain when patients cannot take medicines by mouth.  
What did we do? 
To make the comparison fair, patients in the studies must all have had the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive the ibuprofen or the other treatment.  
We searched the medical literature (clinical studies) up to June 2021, where intravenous ibuprofen was used to treat pain after surgery in adults (aged over 18) and compared against: 
‐ a placebo (a control treatment, such as a bag of saline administered into a vein); or 
‐ another medicine.
What did we find? 
We found only one study which was suitable to include in our review. The study looked at the management of pain after bunionectomy. Bunionectomy is a surgery to remove a bunion at the base of the big toe. This study evaluated 201 people, mostly females. The study compared intravenous ibuprofen to: 
‐ a placebo; or
‐ another medicine, acetaminophen (paracetamol).
We were most interested in learning how many people had their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery.  
Pain reduction 
The study showed that:
‐ more people who received ibuprofen had their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery as compared to those who received placebo; and  
‐ there was little to no difference when ibuprofen was compared to another medicine, acetaminophen, i.e. the numbers of people with pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery  
Need for extra pain medicines (rescue medication) 
Rescue medicine is an extra pain medication if the study medication is not treating the patient's pain well enough. The time (in minutes) to needing rescue medication was longer (delayed) with use of ibuprofen or acetaminophen than for those who received placebo.  
Adverse events 
There was not enough information in this study to assess side effects, but the rate at which they occurred appeared to be similar among all treatments. Very few patients dropped out because of side effects. This is usually the case in studies where patients are only in a study for a short period of time.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We only had results from one relatively small study. This limited our confidence in the evidence. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to June 2021.

Review question 
We investigated the effects of stopping antipsychotic drugs in older people with dementia who had been taking them for three months or longer. 
Background 
People with dementia may have symptoms and behavioural problems that can be distressing and difficult for carers to manage. Such symptoms (often described as neuropsychiatric symptoms, or NPS) include anxiety, apathy, depression, psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), wandering, repeating words or sounds, shouting, and behaving in agitated or aggressive ways, or both. 
Antipsychotic drugs are often prescribed with the aim of controlling these symptoms and behaviours, although most current guidance suggests these drugs should only be used for short periods of time for the most challenging behaviours. This is largely because these drugs are thought to have risks of side effects (including some that are serious), and because many behavioural problems improve without treatment. However, many people with dementia continue to take antipsychotic drugs over long periods of time. 
This review investigated whether it is feasible for older people with dementia and NPS to stop antipsychotic drugs which they have been taking for at least three months. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013. 
Methods 
We searched up to 11 January 2018 for any study that randomly allocated some people with dementia who were taking antipsychotic drugs to continue this treatment and others to stop taking antipsychotic drugs. Study participants were followed up over a period of time to see what happened. 
Results 
We included 10 studies with a total of 632 participants in our review. We added one new study with 19 participants for this update. Most participants lived in nursing homes. The studies varied considerably with regard to the people they included, the methods they used and the outcomes they measured. 
Because the studies were so diverse, it was not possible to combine all the data numerically. We found low‐quality evidence that older people with dementia may be able to stop long‐term antipsychotics without their behavioural problems getting worse. However, in some people who had psychosis, agitation or aggression and who had improved significantly when they first started antipsychotic treatment, we found that stopping the drugs may increase the risk of the behavioural problems getting worse again. On the other hand, agitation decreased after stopping the drugs in some participants whose NPS at the beginning of the studies was relatively mild. 
We did not find enough evidence to know whether stopping antipsychotics has beneficial effects on quality of life, thinking and remembering, or the ability to carry out daily tasks, nor if the risk of harmful events ‐ such as falls ‐ is reduced. We are uncertain whether stopping antipsychotics leads to people living longer. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, evidence was low‐ or very low‐quality. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and that it is possible that other similar research could find something different. The main reasons for this assessment were that there were few studies that included few people, and a risk that results were not fully reported. All included studies had problems recruiting enough participants, making it more difficult for them to detect effects of stopping antipsychotics. 
Conclusions 
Limited evidence suggests that stopping long‐term antipsychotic drug use in older people with dementia and NPS may be done without making their behaviour worse. There may be benefits especially for those with milder NPS. There may be people with more severe symptoms who benefit from continuing treatment, but more research in people with both milder and more severe NPS is needed to be sure about this. The overall conclusions have not changed since the last version of this review and the number of included trials is still low. 
","## Taking Older People with Dementia Off Long-Term Antipsychotic Drugs

### Rationale

Many older people with dementia have hard-to-manage behaviors. These issues include feeling anxious or sad. They also include anger or seeing things that are not there. These problems can be very hard for family and caregivers.

Doctors often give drugs called antipsychotics for these issues. The drugs help calm these behaviors. But most doctors say these drugs should only be used for a short time. This is because these drugs can have bad side effects. Some side effects are very serious. Also, many behavior problems get better without drugs.

Yet, many people with dementia take these drugs for a long time. We wanted to see if it was safe to stop these drugs. We looked at older people who had taken these drugs for at least three months. We wanted to know if stopping the drugs would make their behavior worse.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past research. We wanted to see how studies were designed. We looked for studies that randomly chose people. Some people kept taking their antipsychotic drugs. Others stopped taking them. Randomly choosing helps make sure groups are alike.

The studies looked at people with dementia. These people were older adults. They had been taking antipsychotic drugs for at least three months. Most of them lived in nursing homes. The studies watched these people over time. They wanted to see what happened when they stopped or kept taking the drugs.

### Results

We looked at 10 studies. A total of 632 people were in these studies. We added one new study with 19 people. The studies were quite different. The people in them were different. The ways they studied things were different. The things they measured were also different.

Because the studies were so different, we could not combine all the numbers. We found some evidence that older people with dementia can stop these drugs. Their behavior problems may not get worse. But this evidence was not very strong.

For some people, stopping the drugs may be risky. These were people who had severe issues. This included seeing things that were not there. It also included being angry or agitated. These people had gotten much better when they first started the drugs. Stopping the drugs might make these problems come back.

However, some people with milder problems felt better. Their agitation went down after stopping the drugs.

We did not find enough proof about other things. We do not know if stopping the drugs helps their quality of life. We do not know if it helps their memory or thinking. We also do not know if it lowers the risk of falls. We are also not sure if stopping the drugs helps people live longer.

The overall proof was not very strong. This means we are not very sure about these results. Other studies might find different things. This is because there were few studies. Also, few people were in each study. The studies also had trouble finding enough people. This made it hard to see clear effects.

### Conclusions

Small bits of proof suggest it may be okay to stop long-term antipsychotic drugs. This is for older people with dementia. Their behavior may not get worse. Stopping the drugs may be good for those with milder problems.

Some people with worse problems might need to keep taking the drugs. We need more study for both groups. This will help us know for sure. Our main ideas have not changed. We still need more studies on this topic.","Stopping or continuing long‐term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia

10.1002-14651858.CD014545,"Background
The detection and diagnosis of caries at the earliest opportunity is fundamental to the preservation of tooth tissue and maintenance of oral health. Radiographs have traditionally been used to supplement the conventional visual‐tactile clinical examination. Accurate, timely detection and diagnosis of early signs of disease could afford patients the opportunity of less invasive treatment with less destruction of tooth tissue, reduce the need for treatment with aerosol‐generating procedures, and potentially result in a reduced cost of care to the patient and to healthcare services. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of different dental imaging methods to inform the detection and diagnosis of non‐cavitated enamel only coronal dental caries. 
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist undertook a search of the following databases: MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 31 December 2018); Embase Ovid (1980 to 31 December 2018); US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov, to 31 December 2018); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 31 December 2018). We studied reference lists as well as published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
We included diagnostic accuracy study designs that compared a dental imaging method with a reference standard (histology, excavation, enhanced visual examination), studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of single index tests, and studies that directly compared two or more index tests. Studies reporting at both the patient or tooth surface level were included. In vitro and in vivo studies were eligible for inclusion. Studies that explicitly recruited participants with more advanced lesions that were obviously into dentine or frankly cavitated were excluded. We also excluded studies that artificially created carious lesions and those that used an index test during the excavation of dental caries to ascertain the optimum depth of excavation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data independently and in duplicate using a standardised data extraction form and quality assessment based on QUADAS‐2 specific to the clinical context. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy were determined using the bivariate hierarchical method to produce summary points of sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence regions. Comparative accuracy of different radiograph methods was conducted based on indirect and direct comparisons between methods. Potential sources of heterogeneity were pre‐specified and explored visually and more formally through meta‐regression. 
Main results
We included 104 datasets from 77 studies reporting a total of 15,518 tooth sites or surfaces. The most frequently reported imaging methods were analogue radiographs (55 datasets from 51 studies) and digital radiographs (42 datasets from 40 studies) followed by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) (7 datasets from 7 studies). Only 17 studies were of an in vivo study design, carried out in a clinical setting. No studies were considered to be at low risk of bias across all four domains but 16 studies were judged to have low concern for applicability across all domains. The patient selection domain had the largest number of studies judged to be at high risk of bias (43 studies); the index test, reference standard, and flow and timing domains were judged to be at high risk of bias in 30, 12, and 7 studies respectively. 
Studies were synthesised using a hierarchical bivariate method for meta‐analysis. There was substantial variability in the results of the individual studies, with sensitivities that ranged from 0 to 0.96 and specificities from 0 to 1.00. For all imaging methods the estimated summary sensitivity and specificity point was 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.53) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.92), respectively. In a cohort of 1000 tooth surfaces with a prevalence of enamel caries of 63%, this would result in 337 tooth surfaces being classified as disease free when enamel caries was truly present (false negatives), and 43 tooth surfaces being classified as diseased in the absence of enamel caries (false positives). Meta‐regression indicated that measures of accuracy differed according to the imaging method (Chi2(4) = 32.44, P < 0.001), with the highest sensitivity observed for CBCT, and the highest specificity observed for analogue radiographs. None of the specified potential sources of heterogeneity were able to explain the variability in results. No studies included restored teeth in their sample or reported the inclusion of sealants. 
We rated the certainty of the evidence as low for sensitivity and specificity and downgraded two levels in total for risk of bias due to limitations in the design and conduct of the included studies, indirectness arising from the in vitro studies, and the observed inconsistency of the results. 
Authors' conclusions
The design and conduct of studies to determine the diagnostic accuracy of methods to detect and diagnose caries in situ are particularly challenging. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that imaging for the detection or diagnosis of early caries may have poor sensitivity but acceptable specificity, resulting in a relatively high number of false‐negative results with the potential for early disease to progress. If left untreated, the opportunity to provide professional or self‐care practices to arrest or reverse early caries lesions will be missed. The specificity of lesion detection is however relatively high, and one could argue that initiation of non‐invasive management (such as the use of topical fluoride), is probably of low risk. 
CBCT showed superior sensitivity to analogue or digital radiographs but has very limited applicability to the general dental practitioner. However, given the high‐radiation dose, and potential for caries‐like artefacts from existing restorations, its use cannot be justified in routine caries detection. Nonetheless, if early incidental carious lesions are detected in CBCT scans taken for other purposes, these should be reported. CBCT has the potential to be used as a reference standard in diagnostic studies of this type. 
Despite the robust methodology applied in this comprehensive review, the results should be interpreted with some caution due to shortcomings in the design and execution of many of the included studies. Future research should evaluate the comparative accuracy of different methods, be undertaken in a clinical setting, and focus on minimising bias arising from the use of imperfect reference standards in clinical studies. 
","## Simple Ways to Find Early Tooth Decay

### Rationale

Tooth decay, also known as cavities, harms your teeth. It can cause pain and lead to bigger dental problems. Finding decay early helps save your tooth. It means you need less painful treatment. Early treatment also costs less money.

Dentists often use X-rays to find decay. They also look at your teeth. This study looked at different ways to find early decay. We wanted to see how well these methods work. We focused on decay that is only in the outer layer of the tooth.

We hoped to find a better way to spot these early problems. This could help people get quick, gentle care. It could stop small problems from becoming big ones.

### Trial Design

This study asked, ""How well do different pictures find early tooth decay?"" We looked at many past studies. These studies compared dental imaging methods to a very clear diagnosis. This clear diagnosis was like looking at the tooth under a microscope. It also included digging out the decay or a very close look.

We included studies that looked at teeth inside a person's mouth. We also looked at studies done on teeth outside the mouth. We did not include studies where decay was already very deep. We also did not include studies that made decay in a lab.

We gathered information from studies until the end of 2018. Two people checked all the data. They made sure it was correct. This helped us see how good each method was at finding decay. It also showed how good it was at not finding decay when it was not there.

### Results

We looked at 104 groups of data from 77 studies. This included over 15,000 tooth spots. Most studies used old-style X-rays or new digital X-rays. A few studies used a special 3D X-ray called CBCT. Only 17 studies were done on people in a dental office.

Many studies had some flaws in how they were done. This made it harder to be sure of their results. For all imaging methods, they found about half of the actual decay. They were very good at saying no decay was there when it truly was not.

Let's say 1,000 teeth had early decay. The methods missed decay in 337 teeth. This means decay could get worse without anyone knowing. The methods said decay was present in 43 teeth when it was not. This might lead to unneeded treatments.

The special 3D X-ray (CBCT) was best at finding decay. But it uses a lot of radiation. It also costs a lot. So, dentists cannot use it for every check-up. Old-style X-rays were best at not saying decay was there when it was not.

We could not fully explain why the results varied so much. We think more research is needed. This research should be done in real dental offices. It should also be designed better to give clearer answers.

This study shows finding early decay is hard. Imaging methods can miss a lot of early decay. This means small problems could get worse. But these methods are good at not saying decay is present when it is not. This is important to avoid extra treatment.","Dental imaging methods for the detection of early tooth decay
Why is it important to improve the detection of dental caries (tooth decay)? Dentists often aim to identify tooth decay that has already advanced to a level which needs a filling. If dentists were able to find tooth decay when it has only affected the outer layer of the tooth (enamel) then it is possible to stop the decay from spreading any further and prevent the need for fillings. It is also important to avoid a false‐positive result, when treatment may be given when caries is absent. 
What is the aim of this review?This Cochrane Review aimed to find out how accurate X‐ray images and other types of dental imaging are for detecting early tooth decay as part of the dental 'check‐up' for children and adults who visit their general dentist. Researchers in Cochrane included 77 studies published between 1986 and 2018 to answer this question. 
What was studied in the review?Three main types of dental imaging were studied in this review: analogue or digital radiographs (X‐rays) and three‐dimensional (3D) imaging (cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)). We studied decay on the occlusal surfaces (biting surfaces of the back teeth), the proximal surfaces (tooth surfaces that are next to each other), and smooth surfaces. 
What are the main results of the review?Researchers in Cochrane included 77 studies with a total of 15,518 tooth sites or surfaces, where typically 63% of tooth sites or surfaces had enamel caries. Some of these studies reported on more than one type of imaging, on both the permanent and primary ('milk') teeth or different tooth surfaces, and this gave us 104 sets of data to use. If these methods were to be used by a dentist for a routine dental examination, out of 1000 tooth sites or surfaces seen:• the use of these methods will indicate that 336 tooth sites or surfaces will have early tooth decay, and of these, 43 (13%) will have no disease (incorrect diagnosis ‐ false positive);• of the 664 tooth sites with a result indicating that early tooth decay is absent, 337 (51%) will have early tooth decay (incorrect diagnosis ‐ false negative).This high proportion of false‐negative results means that early signs of decay will be missed. We found evidence that 3D imaging methods were better than analogue or digital radiographs at identifying early disease but that analogue radiographs were better at identifying disease‐free tooth surfaces. 
Please see oralhealth.cochrane.org/imaging-modalities-inform-detection-and-diagnosis-early-caries. 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review?We only included studies that assessed healthy teeth or those that were thought to have early tooth decay. This is because teeth with deep tooth decay would be easier to identify. However, there were some problems with how the studies were conducted. This may result in these methods appearing more accurate than they are, increasing the number of correct results. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low due to how the studies selected their participants and the large number of studies that were carried out in a laboratory setting on extracted teeth, and the variation in the results. 
Who do the results of this review apply to?Studies included in the review were carried out in South America, Europe, Asia, and the US. A large number of studies examined extracted teeth, while clinical studies were completed in dental hospitals or general dental practices. 
What are the implications of this review?Low‐certainty evidence suggests that imaging for the detection or diagnosis of early tooth decay may result in a relatively high proportion of false‐negative results, with the potential for early disease to become more advanced. If left untreated, the opportunity to provide professional or self‐care practices to arrest or reverse early tooth decay will be missed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The electronic searches retrieved used studies published up to 31 December 2018.

10.1002-14651858.CD013485.pub2,"Background
Asthma is a respiratory disease characterised by variable airflow limitation and the presence of respiratory symptoms including wheeze, chest tightness, cough and/or dyspnoea. Exercise training is beneficial for people with asthma; however, the response to conventional models of pulmonary rehabilitation is less clear. 
Objectives
To evaluate, in adults with asthma, the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care on exercise performance, asthma control, and quality of life (co‐primary outcomes), incidence of severe asthma exacerbations/hospitalisations, mental health, muscle strength, physical activity levels, inflammatory biomarkers, and adverse events. 
Search methods
We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, from their inception to May 2021, as well as the reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials in which pulmonary rehabilitation was compared to usual care in adults with asthma. Pulmonary rehabilitation must have included a minimum of four weeks (or eight sessions) aerobic training and education or self‐management. Co‐interventions were permitted; however, exercise training alone was not.  
Data collection and analysis
Following the use of Cochrane's Screen4Me workflow, two review authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, extracted study characteristics and outcome data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We contacted study authors to retrieve missing data. We calculated between‐group effects via mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) using a random‐effects model. We evaluated the certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology. 
Main results
We included 10 studies involving 894 participants (range 24 to 412 participants (n = 2 studies involving n > 100, one contributing to meta‐analysis), mean age range 27 to 54 years). We identified one ongoing study and three studies awaiting classification. One study was synthesised narratively, and another involved participants specifically with asthma‐COPD overlap. Most programmes were outpatient‐based, lasting from three to four weeks (inpatient) or eight to 12 weeks (outpatient). Education or self‐management components included breathing retraining and relaxation, nutritional advice and psychological counselling. One programme was specifically tailored for people with severe asthma.  
Pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care may increase maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) after programme completion, but the evidence is very uncertain for data derived using mL/kg/min (MD between groups of 3.63 mL/kg/min, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48 to 5.77; 3 studies; n = 129) and uncertain for data derived from % predicted VO2 max (MD 14.88%, 95% CI 9.66 to 20.1%; 2 studies; n = 60). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care on incremental shuttle walk test distance (MD between groups 74.0 metres, 95% CI 26.4 to 121.4; 1 study; n = 30). Pulmonary rehabilitation may have little to no effect on VO2 max at longer‐term follow up (9 to 12 months), but the evidence is very uncertain (MD −0.69 mL/kg/min, 95% CI −4.79 to 3.42; I2 = 49%; 3 studies; n = 66). 
Pulmonary rehabilitation likely improves functional exercise capacity as measured by 6‐minute walk distance, with MD between groups after programme completion of 79.8 metres (95% CI 66.5 to 93.1; 5 studies; n = 529; moderate certainty evidence). This magnitude of mean change exceeds the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) threshold for people with chronic respiratory disease. The evidence is very uncertain about the longer‐term effects one year after pulmonary rehabilitation for this outcome (MD 52.29 metres, 95% CI 0.7 to 103.88; 2 studies; n = 42). 
Pulmonary rehabilitation may result in a small improvement in asthma control compared to usual care as measured by Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), with an MD between groups of −0.46 (95% CI −0.76 to −0.17; 2 studies; n = 93; low certainty evidence); however, data derived from the Asthma Control Test were very uncertain (MD between groups 3.34, 95% CI −2.32 to 9.01; 2 studies; n = 442). The ACQ finding approximates the MCID of 0.5 points. Pulmonary rehabilitation results in little to no difference in asthma control as measured by ACQ at nine to 12 months follow‐up (MD 0.09, 95% CI −0.35 to 0.53; 2 studies; n = 48; low certainty evidence). 
Pulmonary rehabilitation likely results in a large improvement in quality of life as assessed by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (MD −18.51, 95% CI −20.77 to −16.25; 2 studies; n = 440; moderate certainty evidence), with this magnitude of change exceeding the MCID. However, pulmonary rehabilitation may have little to no effect on Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) total scores, with the evidence being very uncertain (MD 0.87, 95% CI −0.13 to 1.86; 2 studies; n = 442). Longer‐term follow‐up data suggested improvements in quality of life may occur as measured by SGRQ (MD −13.4, 95% CI −15.93 to −10.88; 2 studies; n = 430) but not AQLQ (MD 0.58, 95% CI −0.23 to 1.38; 2 studies; n = 435); however, the evidence is very uncertain. 
One study reported no difference between groups in the proportion of participants who experienced an asthma exacerbation during the intervention period. Data from one study suggest adverse events attributable to the intervention are rare.  
Overall risk of bias was most commonly impacted by performance bias attributed to a lack of participant blinding to knowledge of the intervention. This is inherently challenging to overcome in rehabilitation studies.  
Authors' conclusions
Moderate certainty evidence shows that pulmonary rehabilitation is probably associated with clinically meaningful improvements in functional exercise capacity and quality of life upon programme completion in adults with asthma. The certainty of evidence relating to maximal exercise capacity was very low to low. Pulmonary rehabilitation appears to confer minimal effect on asthma control, although the certainty of evidence is very low to low. Unclear reporting of study methods and small sample sizes limits our certainty in the overall body of evidence, whilst heterogenous study designs and interventions likely contribute to inconsistent findings across clinical outcomes and studies. There remains considerable scope for future research. 
","## Plain Title
Better Breathing for Adults with Asthma

## Rationale
Asthma makes it hard to breathe. People with asthma often cough, wheeze, and feel chest tightness. This can make daily life tough. Exercise can help people with asthma. But we do not know if special breathing programs help enough.

This study looked at these programs. They are called pulmonary rehabilitation. We wanted to see if these programs are better than usual care. Usual care means what doctors normally suggest. We think these programs can make a big difference. They could help people breathe and live better.

## Trial Design
This study asked: ""How can we help adults with asthma?"" We looked at past studies. These studies compared two groups of people. One group did a special breathing program. The other group got usual care.

The people in the studies were adults with asthma. Their ages were from 27 to 54 years old. The special program lasted at least 4 weeks. It included exercise and learning about asthma. People learned how to manage their asthma. This study checked how well people could exercise. It also looked at how they felt.

## Results
We looked at 10 studies. These studies included 894 people. Most programs took place outside of a hospital. They lasted 8 to 12 weeks. Some programs taught breathing and ways to relax. Some gave advice on food. Some offered talks to help with feelings.

The special breathing programs likely helped people walk further. They could walk about 80 meters more. This is a big improvement. These programs also made people feel much better. They had a better quality of life.

The programs may help with asthma control a little. But this was less clear. The study did not find big changes in how often asthma attacks happened. Very few people had bad side effects.

This study shows that these programs help adults with asthma. They can help people move better. They can also help people feel better about their lives. But we need more research. We need to learn more about how these programs help with breathing itself.","What are the benefits of supervised programmes of exercise and education (known as pulmonary rehabilitation) compared with usual care for adults with asthma? 
Key messages  
‐ We found that people with asthma who take part in supervised programmes of exercise and education (known as pulmonary rehabilitation) are likely to get fitter (can walk further) and have better wellbeing immediately after completing these programmes compared to those who receive usual care. However, we are not certain if these benefits persist up to one year later. 
‐ Due to a lack of evidence, the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on outcomes such as rates of asthma attacks or hospitalisations, anxiety and depression, or physical activity levels is unclear.  
‐ Larger, well‐designed studies are needed to better estimate the true benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation for adults with asthma. 
What is asthma? 
Asthma is a common lung disease where the breathing tubes can become inflamed and narrowed and may produce extra mucus. People with asthma can experience cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and breathlessness, with those most severely affected experiencing difficulty going about their everyday lives.  
Asthma cannot be cured, but symptoms can be controlled. Different medications can help keep symptoms under control, whilst physical exercise can also help. However, some people with asthma may find it challenging to undertake comprehensive exercise programmes. 
What is pulmonary rehabilitation? 
Supervised programmes of exercise and education (called pulmonary rehabilitation) are commonly used for people with chronic lung conditions and help improve breathing, fitness, and wellbeing. These programmes may be based at hospitals, outpatient clinics, or even at home.  
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a recommended standard of care for many chronic lung conditions; however, its effects in adults with asthma are less clear. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to see how pulmonary rehabilitation affects physical fitness, control of asthma symptoms, and wellbeing of adults with asthma compared to usual clinical care involving no pulmonary rehabilitation. We also wanted to learn how it affects the rate of severe asthma attacks/hospitalisations, mental health (anxiety and depression), muscle strength, physical activity levels, and markers of inflammation (in sputum or blood). Finally, we wanted to see whether it is associated with any unwanted effects.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared pulmonary rehabilitation to usual care in adults with asthma. Treatment must have lasted at least four weeks (or eight or more sessions) and must have included aerobic exercises (such as walking or cycling) and education or self‐management.  
We compared and summarised findings across all eligible studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and size. 
What did we find? 
‐ We found 10 studies involving 894 adults with asthma. 
‐ The studies ranged in size from 24 to 412 people. 
‐ Most studies were conducted in Europe. 
‐ Where reported, most study participants were female, with the average age ranging from 27 to 54 years.  
‐ One study specifically included people with severe forms of asthma. Another study specifically included people who had a condition involving overlapping features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
‐ The way pulmonary rehabilitation was delivered varied across studies. Inpatient programmes lasted 3 to 4 weeks, whilst outpatient programmes lasted 8 to 12 weeks. 
‐ The specific nature of exercise or education components amongst the included studies varied widely. 
Main results 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation probably causes a large increase in physical fitness immediately after completion of the programme, resulting in an ability to walk an average of 80 metres further in 6 minutes than in people who receive usual care. There may be little to no effect on physical fitness measured up to one year later. 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation may result in small improvements in or little to no impact on asthma control immediately after completion of the programme or up to one year later compared to usual care.  
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation probably causes a large improvement in wellbeing as measured by the St George’s Respiratory Disease Questionnaire immediately after completion of the programme. Results may differ slightly according to different quality of life instruments. The effects potentially last up to one year, but results are very uncertain. 
‐ Little to no effect on wellbeing was observed after programme completion or up to nine months follow‐up when the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire was used.  
‐ There was very limited evidence to determine the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on rates of asthma attacks/hospitalisations, measures of anxiety and depression, limb muscle strength, levels of physical activity, or markers of inflammation in the blood or sputum.  
‐ Data from one study suggested pulmonary rehabilitation resulted in no direct unwanted or harmful effects. 
Limitations of the evidence  
Our confidence in the evidence relating to outcomes such as physical fitness, wellbeing, and asthma control is limited due to concerns regarding unclear methods in some studies, the potential for participants or assessors (or both) to have influenced outcomes due to the awareness of assigned treatments, and the varied ways in which pulmonary rehabilitation was delivered. 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to May 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD004019.pub4,"Osteotomy for treating knee osteoarthritis
Researchers from The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effects of an osteotomy in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Upon searching for all relevant studies until November 2013, they found 21 studies that included up to 1065 people. Their findings are summarised below. 
This review shows that in people with osteoarthritis of the knee:
• osteotomy can improve pain and function, but this is based on changes within a treatment group. No studies compared osteotomy versus conservative treatment; and • no evidence can be found for a preferred osteotomy technique. 
What is osteoarthritis of the knee, and what is an osteotomy?  Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as the knee or the hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen, and this can make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect physical function or ability to use the knee. Two main types of surgery are used to treat patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: knee replacement and osteotomy. 
Osteotomy is surgery in which the bones are cut and realigned. Osteotomy around the knee changes the alignment of the knee. Weight bearing will be shifted from the diseased part to a healthy part of the knee. By 'unloading' the damaged cartilage of the knee, osteotomy may decrease pain, improve function, slow knee deterioration and possibly delay the need for (partial or) total knee replacement surgery. 
What happens to people after an osteotomy for knee osteoarthritis?  Follow‐up of all studies was too short to allow scoring of treatment failure; this refers to a revision to a knee replacement. 
In all studies, people reported less pain and improved knee function and quality of life after any type of high tibial osteotomy. However this comparison is based on differences before and after an osteotomy, not on comparison with non‐operative treatment. Probably no differences in pain and function scores are noted between different osteotomy techniques. 
Rare complications may include thromboembolism and lesions to nerves and vascular structures. 
The most important reasons for reoperation include hardware removal resulting from pain and pin track infection due to the external fixator. This reoperation rate may be higher in patients undergoing another high tibial osteotomy technique compared with those treated with the closing wedge technique. 
Two studies compared high tibial osteotomy versus partial knee replacement. Benefits did not differ between these types of surgery.

### Plain Title
Knee Surgery for Arthritis Pain

### Rationale
Our knees can hurt a lot when they have ""wear and tear."" This is called osteoarthritis. It happens when the cushion in your knee, called cartilage, wears away. Then, your bones rub together. Your body tries to fix this, but the bone grows in the wrong way. This can make your knee hurt and feel wobbly. It can also make it hard to walk or do daily tasks.

Doctors can do surgery to help. One surgery is called a knee replacement. Another is called an osteotomy. In an osteotomy, the doctor cuts and moves your bones. This surgery helps shift your body weight to a healthy part of your knee. This can take pressure off the worn-out part. We think this may ease pain, help you move better, and slow down damage. It might even mean you need a knee replacement later or not at all. This study looked at how well osteotomy works for people with knee arthritis.

### Trial Design
This study was a review of past studies. Researchers looked at many studies about osteotomy for knee arthritis. They looked for all studies up to November 2013. They found 21 studies. These studies included up to 1065 people. These people had knee osteoarthritis. The studies did not say how old the people were or if they were men or women. We do not know how long each person was in these past studies.

### Results
The studies showed that people felt less pain after an osteotomy. They could also move their knees better. People also said their lives were better. But this was based on how people felt before and after the surgery. No studies compared osteotomy to not having surgery.

We also looked at different ways doctors do osteotomy. We did not find that one way was better than another. People had similar pain and movement no matter the technique.

Some problems can happen with this surgery. These problems are rare. They include blood clots or damage to nerves or blood vessels. Sometimes, people need another surgery to remove metal parts. This can happen if the parts cause pain or get infected. This might happen more with certain osteotomy methods.

Two studies compared osteotomy to a partial knee replacement. Both surgeries helped people the same amount.

The studies did not follow people long enough to see if they needed a knee replacement later. This study helps us know that osteotomy can help with pain and movement for people with knee arthritis.","Osteotomy for treating knee osteoarthritis

10.1002-14651858.CD013207.pub2,"Background
The standard method of diagnosing HIV in infants and children less than 18 months is with a nucleic acid amplification test reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test (NAT RT‐PCR) detecting viral ribonucleic acid (RNA). Laboratory testing using the RT‐PCR platform for HIV infection is limited by poor access, logistical support, and delays in relaying test results and initiating therapy in low‐resource settings. The use of rapid diagnostic tests at or near the point‐of‐care (POC) can increase access to early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants and children less than 18 months of age and timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). 
Objectives
To summarize the diagnostic accuracy of point‐of‐care nucleic acid‐based testing (POC NAT) to detect HIV‐1/HIV‐2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less exposed to HIV infection. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (until 2 February 2021), MEDLINE and Embase (until 1 February 2021), and LILACS and Web of Science (until 2 February 2021) with no language or publication status restriction. We also searched conference websites and clinical trial registries, tracked reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and consulted experts for potentially eligible studies. 
Selection criteria
We defined POC tests as rapid diagnostic tests conducted at or near the patient site. We included any primary study that compared the results of a POC NAT to a reference standard of laboratory NAT RT‐PCR or total nucleic acid testing to detect the presence or absence of HIV infection denoted by HIV viral nucleic acids in infants and children aged 18 months or less who were exposed to HIV‐1/HIV‐2 infection. We included cross‐sectional, prospective, and retrospective study designs and those that provided sufficient data to create the 2 × 2 table to calculate sensitivity and specificity. We excluded diagnostic case control studies with healthy controls. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted information on study characteristics using a pretested standardized data extraction form. We used the QUADAS‐2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool to assess the risk of bias and applicability concerns of the included studies. Two review authors independently selected and assessed the included studies, resolving any disagreements by consensus. The unit of analysis was the participant. We first conducted preliminary exploratory analyses by plotting estimates of sensitivity and specificity from each study on forest plots and in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space. For the overall meta‐analyses, we pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity using the bivariate meta‐analysis model at a common threshold (presence or absence of infection). 
Main results
We identified a total of 12 studies (15 evaluations, 15,120 participants). All studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa. The ages of included infants and children in the evaluations were as follows: at birth (n = 6), ≤ 12 months (n = 3), ≤ 18 months (n = 5), and ≤ 24 months (n = 1). Ten evaluations were field evaluations of the POC NAT test at the point of care, and five were laboratory evaluations of the POC NAT tests.The POC NAT tests evaluated included Alere q HIV‐1/2 Detect qualitative test (recently renamed m‐PIMA q HIV‐1/2 Detect qualitative test) (n = 6), Xpert HIV‐1 qualitative test (n = 6), and SAMBA HIV‐1 qualitative test (n = 3). 
POC NAT pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval (CI)) against laboratory reference standard tests were 98.6% (96.1 to 99.5) (15 evaluations, 1728 participants) and 99.9% (99.7 to 99.9) (15 evaluations, 13,392 participants) in infants and children ≤ 18 months. 
Risk of bias in the included studies was mostly low or unclear due to poor reporting. Five evaluations had some concerns for applicability for the index test, as they were POC tests evaluated in a laboratory setting, but there was no difference detected between settings in sensitivity (−1.3% (95% CI −4.1 to 1.5)); and specificity results were similar. 
Authors' conclusions
For the diagnosis of HIV‐1/HIV‐2 infection, we found the sensitivity and specificity of POC NAT tests to be high in infants and children aged 18 months or less who were exposed to HIV infection.

## Quick HIV Test for Babies

### Why This Study Matters

HIV is a serious sickness. It can pass from mothers to their babies. If a baby has HIV, they need medicine right away. This medicine helps them stay healthy.

Finding HIV in babies is hard. Current tests take a long time. They need special labs. These labs are not everywhere. This means many babies wait too long for results. Delays can make babies sicker.

We need a faster way to test babies. A quick test could help doctors start treatment sooner. This study looked at new, fast tests. These tests can be done where the baby is. They could help many babies get help faster.

### How This Study Was Done

This study looked at many other studies. We searched for research about quick HIV tests. These quick tests are called ""point-of-care"" tests. This means they are done near the patient.

We looked for studies that tested babies 18 months old or younger. These babies were born to mothers with HIV. The studies compared the quick tests to the standard lab tests. We wanted to see how well the quick tests worked. Did they correctly find HIV? Did they correctly show no HIV?

We reviewed studies that included many different babies. We looked at how accurate the quick tests were. We wanted to make sure they were very good.

### What We Found

We found 12 studies to look at. These studies included over 15,000 babies. All of the studies were in Africa. This is where many babies get HIV.

The quick tests worked very well. They found HIV in almost all babies who had it. They also correctly showed no HIV in almost all babies who did not have it.

Specifically, these quick tests correctly found HIV 98 times out of 100. They correctly said a baby did not have HIV 99 times out of 100.

Some quick tests were done in labs. Some were done where patients are seen. Both ways worked just as well. This shows the quick tests are good to use outside of a lab.

This means these fast tests are very good. They can find HIV in babies quickly. This is good news for babies and their families.

### What This Means for Babies

These fast tests are very good at finding HIV in babies. They can help doctors know quickly if a baby has HIV. This means babies can get medicine much faster. Getting medicine fast can save lives. It can help babies grow up strong and healthy.

These tests could be a big help in places with few labs. They make it easier to test babies. This study shows these tests are safe and work well. They are a big step forward.","Point‐of‐care tests for detecting HIV viral molecules in infants and children aged 18 months or less 
Why is improving the diagnosis of HIV infection important? 
It is estimated that 1.5 million infants are still exposed to HIV every year. If left untreated, about 50% to 60% of HIV‐infected infants will die by the age of two years. Children infected before birth are especially at high risk of death. HIV is incurable; however, there are medications that suppress HIV, known as antiretroviral drugs (ART). When HIV is detected early, severe illness and death from HIV‐related infections can be prevented by taking this medication. A test that detects HIV viral genetic molecules quickly and accurately at or near the patient's side (point‐of‐care) therefore can increase access to early appropriate treatment and minimize missing treatments in those whose HIV remains undetected. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of molecular point‐of‐care tests for detecting the main types of HIV infection (HIV‐1/HIV‐2) in infants and children aged 18 months or less. 
What was studied in this review? 
Published reports of molecular point‐of‐care tests with results measured against laboratory viral‐based tests (benchmark). 
What are the main results of this review? 
Twelve studies which completed 15 evaluations involving 15,120 participants compared molecular point‐of‐care tests for diagnosing HIV infection. 
What are the strengths and limitations of this review? 
The review included sufficient studies and participants. All studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa, making the results highly applicable for use in communities where the disease is regularly found and where disease control programmes are often targeted. However, one in three included evaluations of the molecular point‐of‐care tests were conducted in a laboratory setting and not near the patient but there was no difference in the test accuracy between settings. 
To whom do the results of this review apply? 
Infants and children aged 18 months or less who were exposed to HIV infection.
What are the implications of this review? 
In theory, for a population of 1000 children aged 18 months or less where 100 have HIV infection, 100 children will be positive with the molecular point‐of‐care test, of which one will not have the infection (false‐positive result), and 900 will be negative with the molecular point‐of‐care test, of which one will indeed have the infection (false‐negative result). 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 2 February 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013381.pub2,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung condition characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and limited lung airflow, dyspnoea and recurrent exacerbations. Suboptimal therapy or non‐adherence may result in limited effectiveness of pharmacological treatments and subsequently poor health outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of interventions intended to improve adherence to single or combined pharmacological treatments compared with usual care or interventions that are not intended to improve adherence in people with COPD. 
Search methods
We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase (search date 1 May 2020). We also searched web‐based clinical trial registers. 
Selection criteria
RCTs included adults with COPD diagnosed by established criteria (e.g. Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease). Interventions included change to pharmacological treatment regimens, adherence aids, education, behavioural or psychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy), communication or follow‐up by a health professional (e.g. telephone, text message or face‐to‐face), multi‐component interventions, and interventions to improve inhaler technique. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Working in pairs, four review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We assessed confidence in the evidence for each primary outcome using GRADE. Primary outcomes were adherence, quality of life and hospital service utilisation. Adherence measures included the Adherence among Patients with Chronic Disease questionnaire (APCD). Quality of life measures included the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ). 
Main results
We included 14 trials (2191 participants) in the analysis with follow‐up ranging from six to 52 weeks. Age ranged from 54 to 75 years, and COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. Trials were conducted in the USA, Spain, Germany, Japan, Jordan, Northern Ireland, Iran, South Korea, China and Belgium. Risk of bias was high due to lack of blinding. Evidence certainty was downgraded due to imprecision and small participant numbers. 
Single component interventions 
Six studies (55 to 212 participants) reported single component interventions including changes to pharmacological treatment (different roflumilast doses or different inhaler types), adherence aids (Bluetooth inhaler reminder device), educational (comprehensive verbal instruction), behavioural or psychological (motivational interview). 
Change in dose of roflumilast may result in little to no difference in adherence (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.99; studies = 1, participants = 55; low certainty). A Bluetooth inhaler reminder device did not improve adherence, but comprehensive verbal instruction from a health professional did improve mean adherence (prescription refills) (mean difference (MD) 1.00, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.54). Motivational interview improved mean adherence scores on the APCD scale (MD 22.22, 95% CI 8.42 to 36.02). 
Use of a single inhaler compared to two separate inhalers may have little to no impact on quality of life (SGRQ; MD 0.80, 95% CI –3.12 to 4.72; very low certainty). A Bluetooth inhaler monitoring device may provide a small improvement in quality of life on the CCQ (MD 0.40, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.73; very low certainty). 
Single inhaler use may have little to no impact on the number of people admitted to hospital compared to two separate inhalers (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.90; very low certainty). Single component interventions may have little to no impact on the number of people expereincing adverse events (very low certainty evidence from studies of a change in pharmacotherapy or use of adherence aids). A change in pharmacotherapy may have little to no impact on exacerbations or deaths (very low certainty). 
Multi‐component interventions 
Eight studies (30 to 734 participants) reported multi‐component interventions including tailored care package that included adherence support as a key component or included inhaler technique as a component. 
A multi‐component intervention may result in more people adhering to pharmacotherapy compared to control at 40.5 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.37, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.59; studies = 4, participants = 446; I2 = 0%; low certainty). 
There may be little to no impact on quality of life (SGRQ, Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire, CAT) (studies = 3; low to very low certainty). 
Multi‐component interventions may help to reduce the number of people admitted to hospital for any cause (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.63; studies = 2, participants = 877; low certainty), or COPD‐related hospitalisations (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.34; studies = 2, participants = 220; moderate certainty). There may be a small benefit on people experiencing severe exacerbations. 
There may be little to no effect on adverse events, serious adverse events or deaths, but events were infrequently reported and were rare (low to very low certainty). 
Authors' conclusions
Single component interventions (e.g. education or motivational interviewing provided by a health professional) can help to improve adherence to pharmacotherapy (low to very low certainty). There were slight improvements in quality of life with a Bluetooth inhaler device, but evidence is from one study and very low certainty. Change to pharmacotherapy (e.g. single inhaler instead of two, or different doses of roflumilast) has little impact on hospitalisations or exacerbations (very low certainty). There is no difference in people experiencing adverse events (all‐cause or COPD‐related), or deaths (very low certainty). 
Multi‐component interventions may improve adherence with education, motivational or behavioural components delivered by health professionals (low certainty). There is little to no impact on quality of life (low to very low certainty). They may help reduce the number of people admitted to hospital overall (specifically pharmacist‐led approaches) (low certainty), and fewer people may have COPD‐related hospital admissions (moderately certainty). There may be a small reduction in people experiencing severe exacerbations, but evidence is from one study (low certainty). Limited evidence found no difference in people experiencing adverse events, serious adverse events or deaths (low to very low certainty). 
The evidence presented should be interpreted with caution. Larger studies with more intervention types, especially single interventions, are needed. It is unclear which specific COPD subgroups would benefit, therefore discussions between health professionals and patients may help to determine whether they will help to improve health outcomes. 
","## A Fresh Look at COPD Treatment: How We Can Breathe Better

### Rationale

COPD is a chronic lung disease. It makes it hard to breathe. People with COPD often have coughing and shortness of breath. They may also have sudden flare-ups of their symptoms. These problems can make life very difficult.

Some people may not take their medicine as they should. This can make their treatment less helpful. It can also lead to worse health. This study looked at ways to help people take their COPD medicine better. We want to see if this helps them feel better. We also want to see if it keeps them out of the hospital.

### Trial Design

This study gathered information from many other studies. These studies were called randomized controlled trials. They are a good way to test new treatments. The studies included adults with COPD. Their age was from 54 to 75 years old. Their COPD ranged from mild to very severe.

The studies looked at different ways to help people. Some ways were simple, like:
* Changes to medicine types or doses.
* Devices to help remember medicine.
* Teaching how to use inhalers.
* Talking to a nurse or doctor.

Other ways were more complex. These included many types of help together. People were in the studies for 6 to 52 weeks.

### Results

We looked at 14 studies. They included 2191 people in total. The studies were from many countries.

**Simple Ways to Help**

* **Teaching and Talking:** Learning from a health worker or having a talk with them helped people take their medicine more often.
* **Bluetooth Inhaler:** A device that reminds you to use your inhaler did not make people take their medicine more often. But it did make a small change in how they felt.
* **Medicine Changes:** Changing the dose of a medicine or using one inhaler instead of two did not help much. It did not change how often people went to the hospital. It also did not change how many people had bad reactions.

**Complex Ways to Help (Many types of help together)**

* **Taking Medicine:** These plans made more people take their medicine as they should.
* **Hospital Stays:** These plans helped fewer people go to the hospital. This was true for any reason. It was also true for COPD-related visits.
* **Flare-ups:** These plans also helped fewer people have bad flare-ups.
* **Feeling Better:** These plans did not make a big change in how people felt.
* **Bad Reactions:** These plans did not cause more bad reactions.

**What We Learned**

Simple things like teaching or talking with a health worker can help people take their medicine. These small changes might make a difference. Using many types of help together works even better. These combined efforts can help people take their medicine more often. They may also keep people out of the hospital.

More studies are needed to be sure. We also need to find out which people with COPD benefit most. It's a good idea for you and your doctor to talk about what might work best for you.","Which approaches help people with COPD to maintain taking medication as prescribed?
Review question 
Which approaches help people maintain taking prescribed medication(s), improve quality of life and reduce hospital admissions in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? 
Background 
COPD is a lung condition that can cause long‐term breathing problems and includes symptoms such as shortness of breath. Medications do exist that can help but sometimes people do not take them as prescribed. Different approaches could help people to take their medication as prescribed and help improve symptoms or quality of life and reduce hospital admissions. 
We wanted to find out if any approaches could help people with COPD take their medication(s) as prescribed. 
Studies identified and selected 
We searched databases to find the studies. Four people working in pairs looked at the lists of studies separately and agreed on which ones were included. The latest search for studies was conducted in May 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We included studies comparing simple ways to help improve medication use (e.g. different medication doses or single inhalers instead of two separate inhalers) to usual COPD care. We also included studies that tested combination approaches (e.g. information or training from nurses or pharmacists and monitoring medication use). 
What were the key results? 
We included 14 studies (2191 people) in our analysis. No studies were masked (people knew whether they were receiving an approach to help them with adherence or the alternative). Six studies used simple approaches (e.g. change to medication dosage, change to type of inhaler, or a Bluetooth inhaler reminder device), and eight studies used combined approaches (e.g. nurses or pharmacists giving advice or information about how to improve medication use). 
We were uncertain about the effects of a different medication dose on people adhering to medication because it was no different to usual care (one study). Two separate studies found that a Bluetooth inhaler reminder device or a change in oral medication dose did not help to improve adherence. Health professionals involved in giving information may help to improve adherence (one study). This was measured by prescription refills. Motivating people to change their behaviour could help to improve adherence their medication (one study). This was measured by people completing a questionnaire about adherence to their medication. 
One study found that a Bluetooth inhaler device might help to improve quality of life. There may be little to no difference between those using single inhalers in the number of people admitted to hospital compared to those using two separate inhalers (one study). We found no difference between single approaches and usual care on the number of people who had side effects. 
Combined approaches may help to improve the number of people taking their medication, but we were not confident of this finding (four studies). They may have little to no impact on quality of life (three studies). Combined approaches could be beneficial in reducing the number of people with COPD admitted to hospital for any reason or because of COPD symptoms (two studies). 
There was no difference between combined approaches and in the number of people who had adverse events. 
Take home message 
We could not say for certain that simple approaches are useful to help people with COPD to improve medication use because of very limited information. Combined approaches may help people to take their medication(s) as prescribed and can help to reduce the number of people admitted to hospital, however, more information is needed to help answer this question with confidence.

10.1002-14651858.CD009567.pub2,"Treatments for high altitude (mountain) illness
Background 
Acute high altitude illness, also known as acute mountain sickness, may present with a variety of symptoms. It is caused by the decreasing level of oxygen at increasingly high altitudes; and it can be experienced when reaching a high altitude when travelling, hiking or climbing mountains or other elevated areas. People going to altitudes over 4000 metres, females, people younger than mid‐adulthood , and people with a history of migraine are at greater risk of suffering from altitude sickness. The most common symptoms are headache, loss of appetite , insomnia, and nausea. However, severe forms can include confusion, difficulty walking, progressive cough, shortness of breath, and even death. 
Review question 
What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for people suffering from high altitude illness? 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 studies with a total of 468 participants. Most studies included participants with mild or moderate forms of mountain sickness, and only one study included the severe neurological (disorder of the nervous system) form. Follow‐up was usually less than one day. We also identified two ongoing studies. 
Key results 
We found studies evaluating the following interventions: simulated descent with a hyperbaric chamber (medical use of oxygen in a special chamber at greater than atmospheric pressure to increase the availability of oxygen in the body); oxygen; medicines: acetazolamide, dexamethasone, ibuprofen, paracetamol, gabapentin, sumatriptan, nitric oxide, and magnesium sulphate. None of the studies reported the effects of these interventions on all‐cause mortality. The report of complete relief from acute mountain sickness symptoms, and adverse events was infrequent. Studies related to simulated descent with the use of a hyperbaric chamber did not find additional benefits or harms related to this intervention (3 studies, 124 participants). In addition, studies related to administration of medicines found some benefits in terms of reduction of symptoms with the use of acetazolamide (2 studies, 25 participants), and dexamethasone (1 study, 35 participants), without an increase in side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence we found was low, and thus our certainty in the findings is limited. There was insufficient information on how the studies were conducted, and in some cases there was evidence of tampering at some stages of the trials. Furthermore, the number of persons in each study was very small (< 30 participants), and therefore the results were not clear (imprecise). Some studies were not blinded (that is, participants knew what experimental treatment they were receiving), and this could have affected how the participants evaluated their own symptoms. 
","## A Look at Treatments for Mountain Sickness

### Rationale

Going to high places can make people sick. This is called mountain sickness. It happens when there is less air to breathe. This can cause headaches, upset stomachs, and trouble sleeping. In bad cases, it can cause confusion or even death.

Some people get sick more easily. These include young people and women. People who get migraines also have a higher risk. This sickness makes trips to mountains hard for many.

This study wanted to find good ways to treat mountain sickness. It looked at different ways to help people feel better. The goal was to find treatments that work well and are safe.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies that were already done. It asked, ""What helps people with mountain sickness?"" The study brought together facts from 13 past studies. A total of 468 people were in these studies.

Most people in these studies had mild or medium mountain sickness. Only one study looked at very bad cases. The studies usually watched people for less than one day. The study also found two new studies that are still going on.

### Results

The study looked at different ways to treat mountain sickness. These included extra air, special beds, and many medicines. The medicines were things like acetazolamide, dexamethasone, and ibuprofen.

No studies said if these treatments stopped people from dying. It was also hard to tell if treatments made all sickness go away. Most studies did not say much about side effects.

Special beds that give extra air did not help much. Three studies with 124 people showed this. These beds did not add benefits or cause harm.

Some medicines did show promise. Acetazolamide helped reduce symptoms. Two studies with 25 people found this. Dexamethasone also helped reduce symptoms. One study with 35 people found this. These medicines did not cause more side effects.

The findings from these studies were not very strong. This is because the studies were small. Many studies had less than 30 people. It was also hard to tell how some studies were done. Some studies also had problems with how they were set up. Because of this, we are not fully sure about these results. More studies are needed to learn more.","Treatments for high altitude (mountain) illness
Background 
Acute high altitude illness, also known as acute mountain sickness, may present with a variety of symptoms. It is caused by the decreasing level of oxygen at increasingly high altitudes; and it can be experienced when reaching a high altitude when travelling, hiking or climbing mountains or other elevated areas. People going to altitudes over 4000 metres, females, people younger than mid‐adulthood , and people with a history of migraine are at greater risk of suffering from altitude sickness. The most common symptoms are headache, loss of appetite , insomnia, and nausea. However, severe forms can include confusion, difficulty walking, progressive cough, shortness of breath, and even death. 
Review question 
What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for people suffering from high altitude illness? 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 studies with a total of 468 participants. Most studies included participants with mild or moderate forms of mountain sickness, and only one study included the severe neurological (disorder of the nervous system) form.

10.1002-14651858.CD013790.pub2,"Background
Heated tobacco products (HTPs) are designed to heat tobacco to a high enough temperature to release aerosol, without burning it or producing smoke. They differ from e‐cigarettes because they heat tobacco leaf/sheet rather than a liquid. Companies who make HTPs claim they produce fewer harmful chemicals than conventional cigarettes. Some people report stopping smoking cigarettes entirely by switching to using HTPs, so clinicians need to know whether they are effective for this purpose and relatively safe. Also, to regulate HTPs appropriately, policymakers should understand their impact on health and on cigarette smoking prevalence. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of HTPs for smoking cessation and the impact of HTPs on smoking prevalence.  
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and six other databases for relevant records to January 2021, together with reference‐checking and contact with study authors and relevant groups. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which people who smoked cigarettes were randomised to switch to exclusive HTP use or a control condition. Eligible outcomes were smoking cessation, adverse events, and selected biomarkers.  RCTs conducted in clinic or in an ambulatory setting were deemed eligible when assessing safety, including those randomising participants to exclusively use HTPs, smoke cigarettes, or attempt abstinence from all tobacco. Time‐series studies were also eligible for inclusion if they examined the population‐level impact of heated tobacco on smoking prevalence or cigarette sales as an indirect measure. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our primary outcome measures were abstinence from smoking at the longest follow‐up point available, adverse events, serious adverse events, and changes in smoking prevalence or cigarette sales. Other outcomes included biomarkers of harm and exposure to toxicants/carcinogens (e.g. NNAL and carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb)). We used a random‐effects Mantel‐Haenszel model to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences on the log‐transformed scale (LMD) with 95% CIs. We pooled data across studies using meta‐analysis where possible. 
Main results
We included 13 completed studies, of which 11 were RCTs assessing safety (2666 participants) and two were time‐series studies. We judged eight RCTs to be at unclear risk of bias and three at high risk. All RCTs were funded by tobacco companies. Median length of follow‐up was 13 weeks. 
No studies reported smoking cessation outcomes. 
There was insufficient evidence for a difference in risk of adverse events between smokers randomised to switch to heated tobacco or continue smoking cigarettes, limited by imprecision and risk of bias (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.15; I2 = 0%; 6 studies, 1713 participants). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether risk of serious adverse events differed between groups due to very serious imprecision and risk of bias (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.94; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 1472 participants). There was moderate‐certainty evidence for lower NNAL and COHb at follow‐up in heated tobacco than cigarette smoking groups, limited by risk of bias (NNAL: LMD −0.81, 95% CI −1.07 to −0.55; I2 = 92%; 10 studies, 1959 participants; COHb: LMD −0.74, 95% CI −0.92 to −0.52; I2 = 96%; 9 studies, 1807 participants). Evidence for additional biomarkers of exposure are reported in the main body of the review. 
There was insufficient evidence for a difference in risk of adverse events in smokers randomised to switch to heated tobacco or attempt abstinence from all tobacco, limited by risk of bias and imprecision (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.46; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 237 participants). Five studies reported that no serious adverse events occurred in either group (533 participants). There was moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, that urine concentrations of NNAL at follow‐up were higher in the heated tobacco use compared with abstinence group (LMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 382 participants). In addition, there was very low‐certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, for higher COHb in the heated tobacco use compared with abstinence group for intention‐to‐treat analyses (LMD 0.69, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.31; 3 studies, 212 participants), but lower COHb in per‐protocol analyses (LMD −0.32, 95% CI −1.04 to 0.39; 2 studies, 170 participants). Evidence concerning additional biomarkers is reported in the main body of the review. 
Data from two time‐series studies showed that the rate of decline in cigarette sales accelerated following the introduction of heated tobacco to market in Japan. This evidence was of very low‐certainty as there was risk of bias, including possible confounding, and cigarette sales are an indirect measure of smoking prevalence. 
Authors' conclusions
No studies reported on cigarette smoking cessation, so the effectiveness of heated tobacco for this purpose remains uncertain. There was insufficient evidence for differences in risk of adverse or serious adverse events between people randomised to switch to heated tobacco, smoke cigarettes, or attempt tobacco abstinence in the short‐term. There was moderate‐certainty evidence that heated tobacco users have lower exposure to toxicants/carcinogens than cigarette smokers and very low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence of higher exposure than those attempting abstinence from  all tobacco. Independently funded research on the effectiveness and safety of HTPs is needed.  
The rate of decline in cigarette sales accelerated after the introduction of heated tobacco to market in Japan but, as data were observational, it is possible other factors caused these changes. Moreover, falls in cigarette sales may not translate to declining smoking prevalence, and changes in Japan may not generalise elsewhere. To clarify the impact of rising heated tobacco use on smoking prevalence, there is a need for time‐series studies that examine this association. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study abstract:

## Plain Title
What Do We Know About Heated Tobacco Products?

## Rationale
Smoking cigarettes can make people very sick. It can cause heart disease, lung disease, and cancer. Many people want to quit smoking but find it very hard.

Heated tobacco products, or HTPs, are a new type of product. They heat tobacco without burning it. This makes a mist, not smoke. The companies that make HTPs say they have fewer bad chemicals than regular cigarettes.

Some people who use HTPs say it helps them stop smoking cigarettes for good. Doctors and health groups want to know if HTPs really help people quit. They also want to know if HTPs are safe to use. This study looked at what we know about HTPs to help people and policymakers.

## Trial Design
This study looked at other studies that were already done. It asked: “How well do HTPs help people stop smoking?” and “How safe are HTPs?”

The study gathered information from two main types of past research:
*   **Controlled Trials:** These studies had people who smoked cigarettes. Some were told to switch to HTPs. Others kept smoking or tried to quit all tobacco. These studies checked for bad health events and chemical levels in the body.
*   **Time-Series Studies:** These studies looked at how many cigarettes were sold over time. They wanted to see if HTPs changed how many cigarettes people bought.

The studies included people who smoked cigarettes. The length of time people were followed in these studies was usually about three months. All the studies that looked at safety were paid for by tobacco companies.

## Results
This study found 13 past studies to look at.

**Helping People Quit Smoking:**
No studies gave clear answers about whether HTPs help people stop smoking cigarettes. We still do not know if they are useful for quitting.

**Safety:**
*   **Compared to Smoking Cigarettes:** We did not find clear proof that HTPs cause more or fewer bad health events than smoking regular cigarettes in the short term. However, people who used HTPs had lower levels of some harmful chemicals in their bodies than those who smoked cigarettes. These chemicals are linked to serious health problems.
*   **Compared to Quitting All Tobacco:** People who used HTPs had higher levels of some harmful chemicals in their bodies than those who tried to quit all tobacco. This means quitting all tobacco is better for your health.
*   More studies are needed to understand the long-term safety of HTPs.

**Impact on Cigarette Sales:**
In Japan, fewer cigarettes were sold after HTPs became available. However, this study could not say for sure that HTPs caused this change. Other things might have also played a role. Also, fewer sales might not mean fewer people are smoking.

**What We Learned:**
This study shows we need more research on HTPs. We need studies that are not paid for by tobacco companies. These studies should look at how well HTPs help people quit smoking. They should also look at the safety of HTPs over a longer time. We also need to study if HTPs really make fewer people smoke overall.","Do heated tobacco products help people to quit smoking, are they safe for this purpose, and have they led to falls in smoking rates? 
Key messages 
Heated tobacco probably exposes people to fewer toxins than cigarettes, but possibly more than not using any tobacco. Falls in cigarette sales appeared to speed up following the launch of heated tobacco in Japan, but we are uncertain whether this is caused by people switching from cigarettes to heated tobacco. 
We need more independently funded research into whether heated tobacco helps people stop smoking, whether it results in unwanted effects, and the impact of rising heated tobacco use on smoking rates.  
What are heated tobacco products?  
Heated tobacco products are designed to heat tobacco to a high enough temperature to release vapour, without burning it or producing smoke. They differ from e‐cigarettes because they heat tobacco leaf/sheet rather than a liquid. Many of the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke are created by burning tobacco. So heating not burning tobacco could reduce the amount of chemicals a user ingests. Some people report stopping smoking cigarettes entirely by switching to using heated tobacco. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review  
Because cigarette smoking is addictive, many people find it difficult to stop despite the harm it causes. We aimed to find out whether trying to switch to heated tobacco helps people stop smoking cigarettes, and whether it results in unwanted effects. We also wanted to find out whether rising heated tobacco use has affected smoking rates or cigarette sales. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that reported on the use of heated tobacco for stopping smoking, and on unwanted effects and toxin exposure in people asked to use heated tobacco. Here we only included randomised controlled trials, where treatments were given to people at random. This type of study is considered the most reliable way of determining if a treatment works. Finally, we searched for studies looking at changes in smoking rates and cigarette sales following the launch of heated tobacco to market. We included studies published up to January 2021. 
What we found 
Our search found 13 relevant studies. No studies reported whether heated tobacco helps people stop smoking cigarettes. Eleven trials, all funded by tobacco companies and with 2666 adult smokers, compared unwanted effects and toxin levels in people randomly assigned to use heated tobacco or to continue smoking cigarettes or abstain from tobacco use. 
Two studies looked at how trends in cigarette sales changed following the launch of heated tobacco in Japan. 
What are the results of our review?  
We do not know whether using heated tobacco helps people to stop smoking cigarettes (no studies measured this). 
We are uncertain whether the chances of getting unwanted symptoms from being asked to use heated tobacco are different compared with cigarettes (6 studies, 1713 participants) or no tobacco (2 studies, 237 participants). Serious unwanted symptoms in the short time period studied (average 13 weeks) were rare in all groups, which means we are uncertain about any differences. Toxin levels were probably lower in people using heated tobacco than those smoking cigarettes (10 studies, 1959 participants), but may be higher than in people not using any tobacco products (5 studies, 382 participants). 
The launch of heated tobacco products in Japan may have caused the decline in cigarette sales to speed up over time (two studies), but it is unclear whether the fall in the percentage of people who smoke also sped up because no studies looked at this.  
How reliable are these results? 
Results are based on data from a small number of studies, most of which were funded by tobacco companies.  
Results on unwanted effects are likely to change as more evidence becomes available. However, we are moderately confident that levels of measured toxins are lower in people using heated tobacco than smoking cigarettes, but less confident that levels were higher than in people not using any tobacco. We are also less confident that the launch of heated tobacco caused the fall in cigarette sales to speed up, as results came from a single country.

10.1002-14651858.CD013458.pub2,"An overview of systematic reviews on mental health interventions for involuntary migrants
Refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons are involuntary migrants, who have often experienced distress when forced to leave their home, on the journey, and in the process of settling in a host country or new environment. Mental health promotion, prevention, and treatments for mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and post‐traumatic stress disorder may work differently in these groups of people than for the general population. This overview of systematic reviews summarises the characteristics of reviews available on this topic, to help us determine which research questions are the most important to address in future Cochrane reviews. 
We searched for systematic reviews and protocols of systematic reviews on mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental health problems for refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Mental health promotion may, for example, involve a classroom‐based well‐being intervention for children. An example of prevention is trauma‐focused therapy to prevent post‐traumatic stress disorder. Treatment may, for example, include psychological therapy for depression. We found 23 systematic reviews and 15 protocols of reviews in progress. Together the 23 published systematic reviews included 336 references, 175 of which were unique studies. Reviews more commonly included refugees and asylum seekers than internally displaced persons, and were more frequently focused on adults than children. There was more attention on the treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder than there was for mental health promotion or prevention, or for the treatment of depression or anxiety. Studies of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, and integrative and interpersonal therapies were most likely to be included in reviews. 
The quality of reviews was limited by a range of issues, many of which related to poor reporting of the review methodology. 
The evidence available from systematic reviews may not match the need for evidence‐based interventions for the mental health of involuntary migrants. Review authors should consider relevant groups such as internally displaced persons, children, and people with depression or anxiety, and relevant interventions such as those for mental health promotion or prevention, and treatments other than psychological therapy.

Helping People Who Are Forced to Move Feel Better

### Rationale

Many people must leave their homes. They are called involuntary migrants. This includes refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. They often feel very upset. This stress happens when they leave home. It also happens on their journey. And it happens when they try to settle in a new place.

These groups of people often face big mental health challenges. They can have sadness, worry, or feel afraid after a bad event. We want to help them feel better. But what works for most people might not work for them. We need to find the best ways to help these groups.

This study looks at past research. It helps us find what we know. It also shows what we still need to learn. We want to find the best ways to promote good mental health. We want to stop problems before they start. And we want to treat existing problems. We need to know which new studies will be most helpful. This will guide future work.

### Trial Design

This study is a look at other studies. It is called an ""overview of systematic reviews."" We looked for many studies already done. These past studies are called ""systematic reviews."" We also looked for plans for studies. These are called ""protocols.""

We searched for studies about mental health. We looked at promoting good mental health. We also looked at stopping mental health problems. And we looked at treating mental health issues. These studies focused on refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons.

One example of promoting mental health is teaching kids in a classroom. This helps them feel good. Stopping problems could be therapy to prevent fear after a bad event. Treating problems could be talking to someone for sadness.

We wanted to see what kind of research is out there. We looked at how these studies were designed. We also looked at who was in them. We wanted to see what parts of mental health were studied most. And we wanted to know what treatments were looked at. This study does not involve patients directly. It reviews existing research.

### Results

We found many past studies. We found 23 completed studies. We also found 15 plans for studies. These 23 studies used 336 other papers. Out of these, 175 were new and unique studies.

Most studies looked at refugees and asylum seekers. Fewer looked at people who moved within their own country. Most studies focused on grown-ups. Fewer focused on children.

We saw that many studies looked at treating fear after a bad event. Fewer studies looked at promoting mental health. Fewer looked at stopping problems from starting. And fewer looked at treating sadness or worry.

The types of talking therapies studied most were:
*   Thinking and feeling therapy
*   Story-telling therapy
*   Other combined therapies

We found that the quality of these past studies was not always good. Many did not clearly explain how they did their work. This makes it harder to trust the results fully.

What does this mean for patients? We need more research. The studies we have might not cover all the needs. We need more studies on:
*   People who move within their own country
*   Children
*   People with sadness or worry

We also need more studies on:
*   How to promote good mental health
*   How to stop problems early
*   Other ways to treat problems, not just talking therapy

This study shows us where to focus our efforts. Future studies should look at these gaps. This will help us find the best care for people forced to move.","An overview of systematic reviews on mental health interventions for involuntary migrants

10.1002-14651858.CD013359.pub2,"Background
Every year, at least one million children become ill with tuberculosis and around 200,000 children die. Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended rapid molecular tests that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and children with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, at lower health system levels. To inform updated WHO guidelines on molecular assays, we performed a systematic review on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests in children presumed to have active tuberculosis. 
Objectives
Primary objectives 
• To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for (a) pulmonary tuberculosis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; (b) tuberculous meningitis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; (c) lymph node tuberculosis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; and (d) rifampicin resistance in children presumed to have tuberculosis 
‐ For tuberculosis detection, index tests were used as the initial test, replacing standard practice (i.e. smear microscopy or culture) 
‐ For detection of rifampicin resistance, index tests replaced culture‐based drug susceptibility testing as the initial test 
Secondary objectives 
• To compare the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for each of the four target conditions 
• To investigate potential sources of heterogeneity in accuracy estimates
‐ For tuberculosis detection, we considered age, disease severity, smear‐test status, HIV status, clinical setting, specimen type, high tuberculosis burden, and high tuberculosis/HIV burden 
‐ For detection of rifampicin resistance, we considered multi‐drug‐resistant tuberculosis burden 
• To compare multiple Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra results (repeated testing) with the initial Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra result 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) Registry up to 29 April 2019, without language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomized trials, cross‐sectional trials, and cohort studies evaluating Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra in HIV‐positive and HIV‐negative children younger than 15 years. Reference standards comprised culture or a composite reference standard for tuberculosis and drug susceptibility testing or MTBDRplus (molecular assay for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and drug resistance) for rifampicin resistance. We included studies evaluating sputum, gastric aspirate, stool, nasopharyngeal or bronchial lavage specimens (pulmonary tuberculosis), cerebrospinal fluid (tuberculous meningitis), fine needle aspirates, or surgical biopsy tissue (lymph node tuberculosis). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy ‐ Revised (QUADAS‐2). For each target condition, we used the bivariate model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We stratified all analyses by type of reference standard. We assessed certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
For pulmonary tuberculosis, 299 data sets (68,544 participants) were available for analysis; for tuberculous meningitis, 10 data sets (423 participants) were available; for lymph node tuberculosis, 10 data sets (318 participants) were available; and for rifampicin resistance, 14 data sets (326 participants) were available. Thirty‐nine studies (80%) took place in countries with high tuberculosis burden. Risk of bias was low except for the reference standard domain, for which risk of bias was unclear because many studies collected only one specimen for culture. 
Detection of pulmonary tuberculosis 
For sputum specimens, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) verified by culture were 64.6% (55.3% to 72.9%) (23 studies, 493 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and 99.0% (98.1% to 99.5%) (23 studies, 6119 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). For other specimen types (nasopharyngeal aspirate, 4 studies; gastric aspirate, 14 studies; stool, 11 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity ranged between 45.7% and 73.0%, and pooled specificity ranged between 98.1% and 99.6%. 
For sputum specimens, Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) verified by culture were 72.8% (64.7% to 79.6%) (3 studies, 136 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and 97.5% (95.8% to 98.5%) (3 studies, 551 participants; high‐certainty evidence). For nasopharyngeal specimens, Xpert Ultra sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) were 45.7% (28.9% to 63.3%) and 97.5% (93.7% to 99.3%) (1 study, 195 participants). 
For all specimen types, Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra sensitivity were lower against a composite reference standard than against culture. 
Detection of tuberculous meningitis 
For cerebrospinal fluid, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity, verified by culture, were 54.0% (95% CI 27.8% to 78.2%) (6 studies, 28 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 93.8% (95% CI 84.5% to 97.6%) (6 studies, 213 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Detection of lymph node tuberculosis 
For lymph node aspirates or biopsies, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity, verified by culture, were 90.4% (95% CI 55.7% to 98.6%) (6 studies, 68 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 89.8% (95% CI 71.5% to 96.8%) (6 studies, 142 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Detection of rifampicin resistance 
Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 90.0% (67.6% to 97.5%) (6 studies, 20 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and 98.3% (87.7% to 99.8%) (6 studies, 203 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We found Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity to vary by specimen type, with gastric aspirate specimens having the highest sensitivity followed by sputum and stool, and nasopharyngeal specimens the lowest; specificity in all specimens was > 98%. Compared with Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra sensitivity in sputum was higher and specificity slightly lower. Xpert MTB/RIF was accurate for detection of rifampicin resistance. Xpert MTB/RIF was sensitive for diagnosing lymph node tuberculosis. For children with presumed tuberculous meningitis, treatment decisions should be based on the entirety of clinical information and treatment should not be withheld based solely on an Xpert MTB/RIF result. The small numbers of studies and participants, particularly for Xpert Ultra, limits our confidence in the precision of these estimates. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Better Tests for Kids with TB

### Rationale

Tuberculosis, or TB, is a serious sickness. Each year, over one million children get TB. About 200,000 children die from it. TB can make kids very sick and cause many problems.

Doctors need good ways to find TB fast. They also need to know if the TB germ is resistant to common medicines. If a germ is resistant, some drugs will not work.

Two tests, Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra, find TB and drug resistance. These tests are quick. They can be used in many places, even small clinics. This study wanted to see how well these tests work for children.

We wanted to know if these tests can help doctors treat children better and faster. This could save many lives.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. It was a ""systematic review."" This means we gathered all good studies on these tests. We looked for studies that used Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra.

The studies looked at children under 15 years old. Some children had HIV, some did not. These children were thought to have active TB. This means they had signs of being sick with TB.

We looked at how well the tests found TB in the lungs. We also looked at TB in the brain (tuberculous meningitis). And we checked TB in the lymph nodes. We also wanted to know if the tests found TB germs that resist medicine.

We looked at different body fluids. These included spit, stomach fluid, stool, and fluid from the nose or lungs. For brain TB, we looked at fluid around the brain. For lymph node TB, we looked at fluid from the nodes.

We compared the test results to other reliable ways to find TB. These include growing the germ in a lab. Or using other tests for drug resistance.

We looked at a lot of information. For lung TB, we had data from almost 68,000 children. For brain TB, we had data from over 400 children. For lymph node TB, we had data from over 300 children. For drug resistance, we had data from over 300 children.

This study did not test new patients. It gathered and reviewed existing data. The time a person would be in a study varied. But our review covers many years of past studies.

### Results

The tests showed good results for finding TB and drug resistance in children.

**For lung TB:**

*   Xpert MTB/RIF found TB in about 6 or 7 out of 10 children. It was correct about not finding TB in 99 out of 100 children who did not have it.
*   Xpert Ultra found TB in about 7 out of 10 children. It was correct about not finding TB in 98 out of 100 children who did not have it.
*   The tests worked better with some body fluids. Stomach fluid showed the best results.

**For brain TB:**

*   Xpert MTB/RIF found brain TB in about 5 out of 10 children. It was correct about not finding TB in 94 out of 100 children who did not have it.
*   This test is useful, but doctors should use all patient info. They should not rely only on this test to decide on treatment.

**For lymph node TB:**

*   Xpert MTB/RIF found lymph node TB in about 9 out of 10 children. It was correct about not finding TB in 9 out of 10 children who did not have it. This test worked very well for this type of TB.

**For drug resistance:**

*   Xpert MTB/RIF found drug resistance in 9 out of 10 children who had it. It was correct about not finding resistance in 98 out of 100 children who did not have it. This test is very good at finding if the TB germ resists medicine.

These tests are a big step forward. They help doctors find TB faster in children. They also help find drug resistance. This means kids can get the right medicine sooner. This can help them get better and may save lives.

We need more studies, especially for Xpert Ultra. But overall, these quick tests are helpful tools for finding TB in children.","Xpert tests for active tuberculosis in children
Why is improving the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis important? 
In 2018, at least one million children became ill with tuberculosis and around 200,000 died. When detected early and effectively treated, tuberculosis is largely curable. Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are World Health Organization‐recommended tests that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and children with tuberculosis symptoms. Rifampicin is an important anti‐tuberculosis drug. Not recognizing tuberculosis early may result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, severe illness, and death. A false tuberculosis diagnosis may result in anxiety and unnecessary treatment. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of tests in symptomatic children for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance. 
What was studied in this review? 
Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra, with results measured against culture and a composite reference standard (benchmarks), recognizing that neither reference is perfect in children. 
What are the main results in this review? 
A total of 49 studies were included. For pulmonary tuberculosis, we analysed 299 data sets including information describing nearly 70,000 children. 
For a population of 1000 children:
Xpert MTB/RIF 
‐ where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum (by culture), 74 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 (12%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 926 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 35 (4%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 have tuberculous meningitis (by culture), 86 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 59 (69%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 914 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 23 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 people have lymph node tuberculosis (by culture), 142 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 97 (68%) would not have lymph node tuberculosis (false‐positives); 858 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 5 (1%) would have lymph node TB (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 have rifampicin resistance, 108 would have Xpert MTB/RIF‐rifampicin resistance detected, of whom 18 (17%) would not have rifampicin resistance (false‐positives); 892 would have Xpert MTB/RIF‐rifampicin resistance NOT detected; and 10 (1%) would have rifampicin resistance (false‐negatives) 
Xpert Ultra 
‐ where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum (by culture), 100 would be Xpert Ultra‐positive, of whom 27 (27%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 900 would be Xpert Ultra‐negative; and 27 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
How confident are we in the results of this review? 
We are confident. We included many studies from different countries and settings and used two reference standards. Some studies included only children at referral centres or did not report the setting. Therefore, we could not assess how the tests would work in a primary care setting. 
What children do the results of this review apply to? 
Children with presumed pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, or rifampicin resistance. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The results of the review suggest Xpert tests have the potential to be used to detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. 
‐ The risk of missing a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis confirmed by culture with Xpert MTB/RIF (in sputum) is low (4% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF suggests they do not have tuberculosis) suggesting that only a small number of children with tuberculosis confirmed by culture will not receive treatment. The risk of wrongly diagnosing a child as having tuberculosis is slightly higher (12% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF test suggests they do have tuberculosis). This may result in some of these children receiving unnecessary treatment. 
‐ The risk of missing a diagnosis of rifampicin resistance with Xpert MTB/RIF is low (1% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF suggests they do not have rifampicin resistance) suggesting that only a small number of children with tuberculosis will not receive the appropriate treatment. The risk of wrongly diagnosing a child as rifampicin resistance tuberculosis is higher (17% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF test suggests they do have rifampicin resistance). This may result in some of these children receiving unnecessary treatment.

10.1002-14651858.CD013309.pub3,"Background
Preterm infants are susceptible to hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, which may lead to adverse neurodevelopment. The use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices might help in keeping glucose levels in the normal range, and reduce the need for blood sampling. However, the use of CGM might be associated with harms in the preterm infant. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of CGM versus intermittent modalities to measure glycaemia in preterm infants 1. at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia; 2. with proven hypoglycaemia; or 3. with proven hyperglycaemia. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2021, Issue 4); PubMed; Embase; and CINAHL in April 2021. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs and quasi‐RCTs comparing the use of CGM versus intermittent modalities to measure glycaemia in preterm infants at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia; with proven hypoglycaemia; or with proven hyperglycaemia. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed the methodological quality of included trials using Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) criteria (assessing randomization, blinding, loss to follow‐up, and handling of outcome data). We evaluated treatment effects using a fixed‐effect model with risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical data and mean, standard deviation (SD), and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included four trials enrolling 300 infants in our updated review. We included one new study and excluded another previously included study (because the inclusion criteria of the review have been narrowed). We compared the use of CGM to intermittent modalities in preterm infants at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia; however, one of these trials was analyzed separately because CGM was used as a standalone device, without being coupled to a control algorithm as in the other trials. We identified no studies in preterm infants with proven hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia.  
None of the four included trials reported the neurodevelopmental outcome (i.e. the primary outcome of this review), or seizures. The effect of the use of CGM on mortality during hospitalization is uncertain (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.13; RD −0.02, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.03; 230 participants; 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes because of limitations in study design, and imprecision of estimates. One study is ongoing (estimated sample size 60 infants) and planned to be completed in 2022. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to determine if CGM affects preterm infant mortality or morbidities.  We are very uncertain of the safety of CGM and the available management algorithms, and many morbidities remain unreported. Preterm infants at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia were enrolled in all four included studies. No studies have been conducted in preterm infants with proven hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. Long‐term outcomes were not reported. Events of necrotizing enterocolitis, reported in the study published in 2021, were lower in the CGM group. However, the effect of CGM on this outcome remains very uncertain. Clinical trials are required to determine the most effective CGM and glycaemic management regimens in preterm infants before larger studies can be performed to assess the efficacy of CGM for reducing mortality, morbidity, and long‐term neurodevelopmental impairments.

### Plain Title
Checking Sugar Levels in Tiny Babies: What We Know About Continuous Monitors

### Rationale
Tiny babies born too early, called preterm infants, often have problems with their blood sugar. Their sugar can go too low (hypoglycemia) or too high (hyperglycemia). Both of these can harm their brain growth. This can cause long-term problems.

Doctors usually check blood sugar by taking small blood samples. This can be stressful for babies. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a new way to check sugar. A small sensor on the skin checks sugar all the time. This might help keep sugar levels normal. It also might mean fewer needle pokes for the babies.

But we do not know if CGM is safe for these very tiny babies. We also do not know if it works better than the usual way of checking sugar. This study looked at what we know about CGM for preterm infants. We wanted to see if CGM helps these babies and if it causes any harm.

### Trial Design
This study looked at other studies that had already been done. It is called a review. We looked for studies that compared CGM to the usual ways of checking blood sugar. The babies in these studies were born too early. They were either at risk of having their sugar go too low or too high. Some had already been diagnosed with low or high sugar.

We searched many medical databases. We looked for studies up to April 2021. We looked for studies that randomly put babies into groups. One group used CGM. The other group used the usual methods. This helps us see if the new method makes a real difference.

We included four studies with 300 babies. The babies were preterm infants. They were at risk of blood sugar problems. Some studies used CGM by itself. Other studies used CGM with a system that helps manage sugar. We wanted to see how CGM affected things like if babies lived or died. We also looked for any bad side effects. We checked how well these studies were designed. This helps us know how much we can trust their results.

### Results
We included four studies with 300 babies in our review. These studies looked at preterm infants at risk of sugar problems. No studies were found for babies who already had proven low or high sugar.

None of the studies looked at how CGM affected brain growth. This was a main thing we wanted to know. They also did not report if babies had seizures.

We are very unsure if CGM changed how many babies lived or died. There was not enough strong evidence to say for sure. The studies had some issues in their design. The results were also not very clear. This makes us very unsure about the safety of CGM. We do not know if the systems that help manage sugar with CGM are safe either. Many bad effects were not reported in the studies.

One study did report fewer bowel problems (necrotizing enterocolitis) in the CGM group. But we are still very unsure if CGM really caused this benefit.

More studies are needed to find the best way to use CGM. We need to know if CGM is safe and works well for these tiny babies. Then, larger studies can be done. These larger studies can see if CGM helps save lives. They can also see if it reduces other health problems and helps with brain growth in the long run.","Devices to continuously monitor sugar (glucose) levels in the blood in newborns born preterm 
Review questions 
What are the benefits and harms of the use of subcutaneous (under the skin) sensors for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with or without an algorithm (a set of mathematical rules) to correct too high or too low ​​​​​ levels of blood glucose versus intermittent modalities to measure blood glucose with or without an algorithm to guide the correction of too high or too low blood glucose in preterm infants 1. at risk of too high or too low ​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose; 2. with proven too low ​​​​​​levels of blood glucose; and 3. with proven too high​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose? 
Background 
Newborns born too early ('preterm') are susceptible to levels of blood glucose that are too high or too low. Most preterm babies with these abnormal concentrations  have a full recovery, or only mild problems. For some preterm babies with extremely high or low (or more prolonged) blood glucose, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. 
The aim of this updated review was to assess whether the use of CGM could improve the long‐term development or reduce deaths in preterm newborns. CGM devices are inserted subcutaneously, and provide data on blood glucose in real time. The standard method of measuring blood glucose consists of measuring blood glucose concentrations intermittently by  withdrawing small amounts of blood, often by heel pricks.  
Study characteristicsWe collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer the review question, and found four studies enrolling 300 babies. These studies compared the use of CGM to intermittent measurements in infants at risk of too high or too low ​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose. 
Key results 
None of the four included studies reported on the long‐term neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants. The studies were too small to determine if CGM has an effect on survival. One study is ongoing. Although one study published in 2021 reported the incidence of serious intestinal injury (necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious inflammation of the intestines that can be life threatening) was lower in the CGM group, this finding is very uncertain because the results were very imprecise.  Further research is needed. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was very low due to the overall limited number of studies, with few babies enrolled.

10.1002-14651858.CD012595.pub4,"School dental screening programmes for improving oral health of children
What was the aim of this review? 
Oral health means the condition of the mouth, throat, teeth and gums. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if school dental screening improves oral health of children; and if it does, which screening method works best. We found eight relevant studies to answer this question. This is the second update of a review that was published in December 2017 and first updated in August 2019. 
Key message 
There is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about whether traditional school dental screening can improve dental attendance (can lead to children visiting the dentist more often). Moreover, it is not clear if improvement in dental attendance leads to better oral health. We still need high‐quality studies that measure the impact of screening on oral health over longer periods of time. 
What did this review study? 
Oral diseases, especially tooth decay (called 'dental caries' by dentists), affect children worldwide. If untreated, oral health can deteriorate and negatively impact children's general well‐being. It also has a financial cost for families and society as a whole. 
School dental screening involves a dental professional examining children's mouths and teeth at school and letting parents know about their child's oral condition and treatment needs. It aims to identify oral health concerns at an early stage and prompt parents to seek treatment where required. Whether this actually improves children's oral health is the question we wanted to answer in this review. 
What were the main results of this review? 
Our updated search identified one new study to be included since the last version of the review was published. In total, the review includes eight studies that presented results for 21,290 children. Four studies took place in the UK, two in India, one in the USA and one in Saudi Arabia. The children were 4 to 15 years old. Studies looked at the oral health and dental attendance of children who were screened in school compared to children who did not have screening. Some studies also compared different ways of screening and different forms of follow‐up (e.g. advice letter or referral). 
We do not know whether traditional school dental screening improves dental attendance. Studies looking at screening based on specific criteria (e.g. targeted at children not registered with a dentist) suggested it may be slightly more effective than no screening for improving attendance at the dentist. There may be no difference between criteria‐based screening and universal screening for improving dental attendance, but we are very unsure about the results. 
A personalised or specific referral letter to parents may improve dental attendance more than a non‐specific letter, but we are very unsure about the results. 
Screening with added motivation (health education and offer of free treatment) may improve dental attendance compared to screening alone, but we are very unsure about the results. 
One study comparing different referral letters (with more or less information about dental diseases) found that neither was better than the other for improving dental treatment in children. 
A specific referral letter did not encourage more parents to take their children to the dentist when compared to a letter with generic advice to visit the dentist. 
The eight studies followed up children for 3 to 11 months after they received screening. Therefore, we do not know the effects of screening over a longer period of time. 
None of the studies checked whether there were any negative effects of screening programmes or how much they cost.

## Plain Title
Checking Kids' Teeth at School: Does it Help?

## Rationale
Good mouth health means healthy teeth and gums. When kids have poor mouth health, like tooth decay, it can make them feel bad. It can also cost families and the whole town money.

Checking kids' teeth at school means a dentist or nurse looks at their mouths. They then tell parents if their child needs to see a dentist. This check-up aims to find problems early. It hopes to get parents to take their child to the dentist for care.

We want to know if these school checks really help kids have better mouth health. This study looks at if these checks work. It also looks at which way of checking works best.

## Trial Design
This study looks at other studies that have already been done. It is a review of what we know. We looked at eight studies. These studies included over 21,000 children. The children were from 4 to 15 years old.

These studies compared children who had their teeth checked at school to children who did not. Some studies also looked at different ways to check teeth. They also looked at different ways to tell parents about their child's teeth. These ways included simple letters or special letters. Some studies also gave kids extra help, like free care.

The studies checked on the children for 3 to 11 months after the dental check. This helped us see if they went to the dentist more often.

## Results
We do not know for sure if school dental checks make kids go to the dentist more often. It is also not clear if going to the dentist more often makes their mouth health better.

Some studies looked at checking only kids who needed it most. For example, kids not signed up with a dentist. These checks might help them go to the dentist a little more. But we are not sure about these results.

Sending a special letter to parents might make kids go to the dentist more. This is compared to sending a general letter. But again, we are not very sure.

If kids got help, like free care, it might make them go to the dentist more. This is compared to just a check-up alone. We are not very sure about this either.

One study looked at different types of letters to parents. It found that no one letter was better than another. A special letter did not make more parents take their kids to the dentist.

These studies only watched kids for a short time, less than a year. So, we do not know the long-term effects of these checks. No studies looked at any bad effects of the checks. They also did not check how much the checks cost.

We need more good studies. These studies need to watch kids for a longer time. They also need to see if mouth health really gets better.","School dental screening programmes for improving oral health of children

10.1002-14651858.CD013669.pub2,"Background
Self‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury regardless of degree of suicidal intent or other types of motivation) is a growing problem in most countries, often repeated, and associated with suicide. Evidence assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological agents and/or natural products in the treatment of SH is lacking, especially when compared with the evidence for psychosocial interventions. This review therefore updates a previous Cochrane Review (last published in 2015) on the role of pharmacological interventions for SH in adults. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of pharmacological agents or natural products for SH compared to comparison types of treatment (e.g. placebo or alternative pharmacological treatment) for adults (aged 18 years or older) who engage in SH. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL] and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [CDSR]), together with MEDLINE. Ovid Embase and PsycINFO (to 4 July 2020). 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmacological agents or natural products with placebo/alternative pharmacological treatment in individuals with a recent (within six months of trial entry) episode of SH resulting in presentation to hospital or clinical services. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a repeated episode of SH over a maximum follow‐up period of two years. Secondary outcomes included treatment acceptability, treatment adherence, depression, hopelessness, general functioning, social functioning, suicidal ideation, and suicide. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised trial quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence internals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI. The overall certainty of evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. repetition of SH at post‐intervention) was appraised for each intervention using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included data from seven trials with a total of 574 participants. Participants in these trials were predominately female (63.5%) with a mean age of 35.3 years (standard deviation (SD) 3.1 years). It is uncertain if newer generation antidepressants reduce repetition of SH compared to placebo (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.19; N = 129; k = 2; very low‐certainty evidence). There may be a lower rate of SH repetition for antipsychotics (21%) as compared to placebo (75%) (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.50; N = 30; k = 1; low‐certainty evidence). However, there was no evidence of a difference between antipsychotics compared to another comparator drug/dose for repetition of SH (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.58; N = 53; k = 1; low‐certainty evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference for mood stabilisers compared to placebo for repetition of SH (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.95; N = 167; k = 1; very low‐certainty evidence), or for natural products compared to placebo for repetition of SH (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.62; N = 49; k = 1; lo‐ certainty) evidence. 
Authors' conclusions
Given the low or very low quality of the available evidence, and the small number of trials identified, there is only uncertain evidence regarding pharmacological interventions in patients who engage in SH. More and larger trials of pharmacotherapy are required, preferably using newer agents. These might include evaluation of newer atypical antipsychotics. Further work should also include evaluation of adverse effects of pharmacological agents. Other research could include evaluation of combined pharmacotherapy and psychological treatment.

## Plain Title: Finding the Right Medicines to Help Stop Self-Harm

### Rationale

Many people hurt themselves on purpose. This is called self-harm. It means they might poison themselves or cut themselves. This can happen more than once. It can also lead to very sad outcomes.

Doctors have learned a lot about talking therapies for self-harm. But we do not know much about how medicines can help. We need more clear answers here.

This study looked at different medicines. We wanted to see if they could help stop self-harm. We hoped to find treatments that could make a real difference.

### Trial Design

How did we do this study? We looked at many past studies. These studies tested medicines for adults who self-harm. An adult is 18 years old or older.

These studies checked people who had self-harmed recently. Recently means in the last six months. They had gone to a hospital or clinic for help.

We looked at how often people self-harmed again. This was the main thing we wanted to know. We followed people for up to two years. We also looked at other things. This included how well people took their medicine. We also checked if they felt better or more hopeful.

### Results

We found seven studies. These studies included 574 people. Most people were women. Their average age was about 35 years old.

We looked at newer mood medicines for feeling sad. We are not sure if they stop self-harm. The proof for this is not strong.

One medicine group was called antipsychotics. People who took these medicines may have self-harmed less often. For example, 21 people out of 100 on antipsychotics self-harmed again. But 75 people out of 100 on a dummy pill self-harmed again. This proof is not strong either.

We did not find a clear difference between antipsychotics and other medicines. We also did not see a clear benefit for mood-calming medicines. The same was true for natural products. They did not seem to stop self-harm better than a dummy pill.

Our findings show that we need more research. The studies we found were small. The information was not very clear. We need bigger and better studies. These studies should test new medicines. They should also look at bad side effects. Combining medicines with talking therapies might also be a good idea.","Drugs and natural products for self‐harm in adults
We have reviewed the international literature regarding pharmacological (drug) and natural product (dietary supplementation) treatment trials in the field. A total of seven trials meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. There is little evidence of beneficial effects of either pharmacological or natural product treatments. However, few trials have been conducted and those that have are small, meaning that possible beneficial effects of some therapies cannot be ruled out. 
Why is this review important? 
Self‐harm (SH), which includes intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is strongly linked with suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed. Whilst there has been an increase in the use of psychosocial interventions for SH in adults (which is the focus of a separate review), drug treatments are frequently used in clinical practice. It is therefore important to assess the evidence for their effectiveness. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Hospital administrators (e.g. service providers), health policy officers and third party payers (e.g. health insurers), clinicians working with patients who engage in SH, patients themselves, and their relatives. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review is an update of a previous Cochrane Review from 2015 which found little evidence of beneficial effects of drug treatments on repetition of SH. This updated aims to further evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of drugs and natural products for patients who engage in SH with a broader range of outcomes. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of drug treatments for adults who had recently engaged in SH. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There is currently no clear evidence for the effectiveness of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, or natural products in preventing repetition of SH. 
What should happen next? 
We recommend further trials of drugs for SH patients, possibly in combination with psychological treatment.

Exercise training is commonly recommended for individuals with fibromyalgia. This review is one of a series of reviews about exercise training for fibromyalgia that will replace the review titled ""Exercise for treating fibromyalgia syndrome"", which was first published in 2002. 
Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of mixed exercise training protocols that include two or more types of exercise (aerobic, resistance, flexibility) for adults with fibromyalgia against control (treatment as usual, wait list control), non exercise (e.g. biofeedback), or other exercise (e.g. mixed versus flexibility) interventions. Specific comparisons involving mixed exercise versus other exercises (e.g. resistance, aquatic, aerobic, flexibility, and whole body vibration exercises) were not assessed. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Thesis and Dissertations Abstracts, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Physiotherapy Evidence Databese (PEDro), Current Controlled Trials (to 2013), WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to December 2017, unrestricted by language, to identify all potentially relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia that compared mixed exercise interventions with other or no exercise interventions. Major outcomes were health‐related quality of life (HRQL), pain, stiffness, fatigue, physical function, withdrawals, and adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the quality of evidence for major outcomes using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 29 RCTs (2088 participants; 98% female; average age 51 years) that compared mixed exercise interventions (including at least two of the following: aerobic or cardiorespiratory, resistance or muscle strengthening exercise, and flexibility exercise) versus control (e.g. wait list), non‐exercise (e.g. biofeedback), and other exercise interventions. Design flaws across studies led to selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting biases. We prioritised the findings of mixed exercise compared to control and present them fully here. 
Twenty‐one trials (1253 participants) provided moderate‐quality evidence for all major outcomes but stiffness (low quality). With the exception of withdrawals and adverse events, major outcome measures were self‐reported and expressed on a 0 to 100 scale (lower values are best, negative mean differences (MDs) indicate improvement; we used a clinically important difference between groups of 15% relative difference). Results for mixed exercise versus control show that mean HRQL was 56 and 49 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (13 studies; 610 participants) with absolute improvement of 7% (3% better to 11% better) and relative improvement of 12% (6% better to 18% better). Mean pain was 58.6 and 53 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (15 studies; 832 participants) with absolute improvement of 5% (1% better to 9% better) and relative improvement of 9% (3% better to 15% better). Mean fatigue was 72 and 59 points in the control and exercise groups, respectively (1 study; 493 participants) with absolute improvement of 13% (8% better to 18% better) and relative improvement of 18% (11% better to 24% better). Mean stiffness was 68 and 61 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (5 studies; 261 participants) with absolute improvement of 7% (1% better to 12% better) and relative improvement of 9% (1% better to 17% better). Mean physical function was 49 and 38 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (9 studies; 477 participants) with absolute improvement of 11% (7% better to 15% better) and relative improvement of 22% (14% better to 30% better). Pooled analysis resulted in a moderate‐quality risk ratio for all‐cause withdrawals with similar rates across groups (11 per 100 and 12 per 100 in the control and intervention groups, respectively) (19 studies; 1065 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.51) with an absolute change of 1% (3% fewer to 5% more) and a relative change of 11% (28% fewer to 47% more). Across all 21 studies, no injuries or other adverse events were reported; however some participants experienced increased fibromyalgia symptoms (pain, soreness, or tiredness) during or after exercise. However due to low event rates, we are uncertain of the precise risks with exercise. Mixed exercise may improve HRQL and physical function and may decrease pain and fatigue; all‐cause withdrawal was similar across groups, and mixed exercises may slightly reduce stiffness. For fatigue, physical function, HRQL, and stiffness, we cannot rule in or out a clinically relevant change, as the confidence intervals include both clinically important and unimportant effects. 
We found very low‐quality evidence on long‐term effects. In eight trials, HRQL, fatigue, and physical function improvement persisted at 6 to 52 or more weeks post intervention but improvements in stiffness and pain did not persist. Withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. 
It is uncertain whether mixed versus other non‐exercise or other exercise interventions improve HRQL and physical function or decrease symptoms because the quality of evidence was very low. The interventions were heterogeneous, and results were often based on small single studies. Adverse events with these interventions were not measured, and thus uncertainty surrounds the risk of adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared to control, moderate‐quality evidence indicates that mixed exercise probably improves HRQL, physical function, and fatigue, but this improvement may be small and clinically unimportant for some participants; physical function shows improvement in all participants. Withdrawal was similar across groups. Low‐quality evidence suggests that mixed exercise may slightly improve stiffness. Very low‐quality evidence indicates that we are 'uncertain' whether the long‐term effects of mixed exercise are maintained for all outcomes; all‐cause withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. Compared to other exercise or non‐exercise interventions, we are uncertain about the effects of mixed exercise because we found only very low‐quality evidence obtained from small, very heterogeneous trials. Although mixed exercise appears to be well tolerated (similar withdrawal rates across groups), evidence on adverse events is scarce, so we are uncertain about its safety. We downgraded the evidence from these trials due to imprecision (small trials), selection bias (e.g. allocation), blinding of participants and care providers or outcome assessors, and selective reporting. 
","## Moving Better with Fibromyalgia: Does Exercise Help?

**Rationale**

Fibromyalgia is a condition that causes pain all over your body. It can also make you feel tired and stiff. This makes it hard to do daily tasks. Patients often struggle with this pain and tiredness.

Doctors often tell people with fibromyalgia to exercise. But what kind of exercise works best? This study looked at different types of exercise. It wanted to see if mixing exercises helped more. We want to find good ways to help people feel better.

We looked at a mix of exercises. This mix includes heart-pumping exercise. It also includes strength training. And it includes stretching. These types of exercise may ease pain. They may also help with tiredness and stiffness.

**Trial Design**

This study asked, ""How does mixed exercise help people with fibromyalgia?"" We looked at many past studies. These studies were called randomized controlled trials.

The studies included adults with fibromyalgia. Most were women, about 51 years old. They compared mixed exercise to no exercise. Some compared it to other types of exercise. People in the studies did different exercise programs.

We looked for changes in their health. This included how they felt. It also looked at their pain and energy. We checked how well they could move. We also noted if people dropped out. And if they had bad side effects. We reviewed data up to December 2017.

**Results**

We looked at 29 studies. These studies had 2088 people. About 98 out of 100 people were women. Their average age was 51 years.

Mixed exercise likely helps how you feel. It also helps with daily activities. Mixed exercise may make you less tired. It may also lessen pain.

People in the exercise groups felt better. Their overall health score went up by 7 points. Pain went down by 5 points. Tiredness went down by 13 points. Stiffness went down by 7 points. Doing daily tasks got better by 11 points.

About 11 out of 100 people in the control group quit. About 12 out of 100 people in the exercise group quit. The number of people who quit was about the same.

No serious injuries were reported. Some people had more pain or tiredness during exercise. But these were often minor.

We found that mixed exercise probably helps. It makes daily life easier. It also boosts energy. It likely helps with how well people can move. The benefits for pain and tiredness may be small for some. But everyone saw some help with physical function.

It is not clear if these benefits last a long time. Some studies showed benefits for months. But others did not. We need more research to know this for sure.

We are not sure about mixed exercise versus other exercises. There was not enough strong proof. More studies are needed here.","Mixed exercise programmes for adults with fibromyalgia
What is fibromyalgia and what is mixed exercise? 
Fibromyalgia is a condition causing chronic pain and soreness throughout the body. People with this condition often feel depressed, tired, and stiff, and have difficulty sleeping. Mixed exercise is defined as regular sessions of two or more types of exercise including aerobic (walking or cycling), strengthening (lifting weights or pulling against resistance bands), or flexibility (stretching) exercise. 
Study characteristics 
Reviewers searched for studies until December 2017, and found 29 studies (2088 people) conducted in 12 different countries. The average age of study participants was 51 years, and 98% were female. The average exercise programme was 14 weeks long with three sessions of 50 to 60 minutes per week. All exercise programmes were fully or partially supervised. Reviewers were most interested in comparing mixed exercise groups to control groups (19 studies; 1065 people). People in control groups either received no treatment or continued their usual care. 
Key results – mixed exercise vs control 
Each outcome below is measured on a scale that goes from 0 to 100, where lower scores are better. 
Health‐related quality of life (HRQL)  
After 5 to 26 weeks, people who exercised were 7% better (3% better to 11% better) or improved by 7 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their HRQL at 49 points.
People in the control group rated their HRQL at 56 points.
Pain  
After 5 to 26 weeks, people who exercised had 5% less pain (1% better to 9% better) or improved by 5 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their pain at 53 points.
People in the control group rated their pain at 58.6 points.
Tiredness  
After 14 to 24 weeks, people who exercised were 13% less tired (8% better to 18% better) or improved by 13 points on a 100 point scale 
People who exercised rated their tiredness at 59 points.
People in the control group rated their tiredness at 72 points.
Stiffness  
After 16 weeks, people who exercised were 7% less stiff (1% better 1 to 12% better) or improved by 7 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their stiffness at 61 points.
People in the control group rated their stiffness at 68 points.
Ability to do daily activities (physical function)  
After 8 to 24 weeks, people who exercised were 11% better (7% to 15%) or improved by 11 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their physical function at 38 points.
People in the control group rated their physical function at 49 points.
Harms ‐ Some participants experienced increased pain, soreness, or tiredness during or after exercise. Studies reported no injuries or other harms. However, reporting of harms was missing or incomplete in many studies. We are uncertain whether risk is increased with exercise. 
Leaving the study early – 11% of control participants left the study early compared with 12% of exercisers. 
Long‐term effects ‐ Analysis of long‐term effects of HRQL showed maintenance of mixed exercise effects at 6 to 12 weeks and at 13 to 26 weeks but not at 27 to 52 weeks. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that it is uncertain whether mixed exercises improve HRQL in the long term. Withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. 
Other ‐ Reviewers found no evidence that the benefits and harms of mixed exercise were any different from education programmes, cognitive‐behavioural training, biofeedback, medication, or other types of exercise. 
Conclusions and quality of evidence 
Mixed exercise may improve HRQL and the ability to do daily activities, may decrease pain and tiredness, and may be acceptable to individuals with fibromyalgia. Low‐quality evidence suggests that mixed exercise may slightly improve stiffness. When compared to other exercise or non‐exercise interventions, we are uncertain about the effects of mixed exercise. Although mixed exercise appears to be well tolerated (similar numbers of people leaving the study across groups), evidence on harms was scarce, so we are uncertain about its safety. Reviewers considered the quality of evidence to be low to moderate because of small numbers of people in the studies, some issues involving study design, and the low quality of results.

10.1002-14651858.CD012129.pub3,"Background
Perineal trauma, due to spontaneous tears, surgical incision (episiotomy), or in association with operative vaginal birth, is common after vaginal birth, and is often associated with postpartum perineal pain. Birth over an intact perineum may also lead to perineal pain. There are adverse health consequences associated with perineal pain for the women and their babies in the short‐ and long‐term, and the pain may interfere with newborn care and the establishment of breastfeeding. Aspirin has been used in the management of postpartum perineal pain, and its effectiveness and safety should be assessed. This is an update of the review, last published in 2017. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of a single dose of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), including at different doses, in the relief of acute postpartum perineal pain. 
Search methods
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (4 October 2019), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (4 October 2019) and screened reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), assessing single dose aspirin compared with placebo, no treatment, a different dose of aspirin, or single dose paracetamol or acetaminophen, for women with perineal pain in the early postpartum period. We planned to include cluster‐RCTs, but none were identified. We excluded quasi‐RCTs and cross‐over studies. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included RCTs. Data were checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence for the main comparison (aspirin versus placebo) was assessed using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 17 RCTs, 16 of which randomised 1132 women to aspirin or placebo; one RCT did not report numbers of women. Two RCTs (of 16) did not contribute data to meta‐analyses. All women had perineal pain post‐episiotomy, and were not breastfeeding. Studies were published between 1967 and 1997, and the risk of bias was often unclear, due to poor reporting. 
We included four comparisons: aspirin versus placebo (15 RCTs); 300 mg versus 600 mg aspirin (1 RCT); 600 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (2 RCTs); and 300 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (1 RCT). 
Aspirin versus placebo 
Aspirin may result in more women reporting adequate pain relief four to eight hours after administration compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.69 to 2.42; 13 RCTs, 1001 women; low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether aspirin compared with placebo has an effect on the need for additional pain relief (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.37; 10 RCTs, 744 women; very low‐certainty evidence), or maternal adverse effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.06; 14 RCTs, 1067 women; very low‐certainty evidence), four to eight hours after administration. Analyses based on dose did not reveal any clear subgroup differences. 
300 mg versus 600 mg aspirin 
It is uncertain whether over four hours after administration, 300 mg compared with 600 mg aspirin has an effect on adequate pain relief (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.86; 1 RCT, 81 women) or the need for additional pain relief (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.88; 1 RCT, 81 women). There were no maternal adverse effects in either aspirin group. 
600 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin 
It is uncertain whether over four to eight hours after administration, 600 mg compared with 1200 mg aspirin has an effect on adequate pain relief (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.39; 2 RCTs, 121 women), the need for additional pain relief (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.68; 2 RCTs, 121 women), or maternal adverse effects (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52; 2 RCTs, 121 women). 
300 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin 
It is uncertain whether over four hours after administration, 300 mg compared with 1200 mg aspirin has an effect on adequate pain relief (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.32; 1 RCT, 80 women) or need for additional pain relief (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.18; 1 RCT, 80 women). There were no maternal adverse effects in either aspirin group. 
None of the included RCTs reported on neonatal adverse effects.
No RCTs reported on secondary review outcomes of: prolonged hospitalisation due to perineal pain; re‐hospitalisation due to perineal pain; fully breastfeeding at discharge; mixed feeding at discharge; fully breastfeeding at six weeks; mixed feeding at six weeks; perineal pain at six weeks; maternal views; or maternal postpartum depression. 
Authors' conclusions
Single dose aspirin may increase adequate pain relief in women with perineal pain post‐episiotomy compared with placebo. It is uncertain whether aspirin has an effect on the need for additional analgesia, or on maternal adverse effects, compared with placebo. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of study limitations (risk of bias), imprecision, and publication bias. 
Aspirin may be considered for use in non‐breastfeeding women with post‐episiotomy perineal pain. Included RCTs excluded breastfeeding women, so there was no evidence to assess the effects of aspirin on neonatal adverse effects or breastfeeding. 
Future RCTs should be designed to ensure low risk of bias, and address gaps in the evidence, such as the secondary outcomes established for this review. Current research has focused on women with post‐episiotomy pain; future RCTs could be extended to include women with perineal pain associated with spontaneous tears or operative birth. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study:

### **Plain Title: Aspirin for Pain After Childbirth**

**Rationale**

Many women feel pain after giving birth. This pain often comes from the area between the vagina and the back passage. This area is called the perineum. This pain can happen from tears during birth. It can also happen if a doctor makes a cut to help the baby come out. This cut is called an episiotomy. Even without tears or cuts, some women have pain in this area.

This pain can be bad for new mothers and their babies. It can make it hard to care for the baby. It can also make it hard to start breastfeeding. Doctors have used aspirin to help with this pain. We need to know if aspirin really works. We also need to know if it is safe for new mothers. This study looked at past research on aspirin for this pain.

**Trial Design**

This study asked, ""How does aspirin help with pain after childbirth?"" It looked at past studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means women were put into groups by chance. Some got aspirin. Others got a sugar pill, called a placebo. Some got no treatment. Others got different doses of aspirin. Some got a different pain medicine called paracetamol.

The studies looked at women who had pain in the perineum soon after giving birth. All the women in these studies had an episiotomy. This is a cut made during birth. The studies did not include women who were breastfeeding. The studies were done a long time ago, between 1967 and 1997. We do not know how long women stayed in each study.

**Results**

We looked at 17 past studies. Most of these studies compared aspirin to a sugar pill. About 1000 women were in these studies.

Aspirin may help more women feel better. They had less pain 4 to 8 hours after taking aspirin. This was true when compared to women who took a sugar pill. But we are not very sure about this finding.

We are not sure if aspirin means women need less extra pain medicine. We are also not sure if aspirin causes more side effects in mothers. Side effects are unwanted problems from a medicine.

We also looked at different doses of aspirin. We compared 300 mg to 600 mg. We compared 600 mg to 1200 mg. We compared 300 mg to 1200 mg. We could not tell if one dose was better than another. We could not tell if different doses changed the need for more pain relief. We also could not tell if they caused more side effects.

None of the studies looked at problems for babies. None looked at how aspirin affects breastfeeding. They also did not look at how pain affected how long women stayed in the hospital. Or if they had to go back to the hospital. They did not look at how women felt about their pain. They also did not look at if women got sad after birth. This is called postpartum depression.

Our study shows that a single dose of aspirin may help women with pain from an episiotomy. This is true for women who are not breastfeeding. But we need more and better studies to be sure. Future studies should include women with different types of pain after birth. They should also look at how aspirin affects babies and breastfeeding.","Aspirin (single dose) for relief of perineal pain after childbirth
What is the issue? 
Can aspirin be given to women who experience perineal pain following childbirth to relieve the pain, without causing side effects for either the women or their babies? 
Why is this important? 
Many women experience pain in the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus) following childbirth. The perineum may be bruised or torn during childbirth, or have a cut made to help the baby to be born (an episiotomy). After childbirth, perineal pain can interfere with women's ability to care for their newborns and establish breastfeeding. If perineal pain is not relieved effectively, longer‐term problems for women may include painful sexual intercourse, pelvic floor problems resulting in incontinence, prolapse, or chronic perineal pain. Aspirin may be given to women who have perineal pain after childbirth, but its effectiveness and safety had not been assessed in a systematic review. This is an update of a review last published in 2017. This is part of a series of reviews looking at drugs to help relieve perineal pain in first few weeks after childbirth. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in October 2019, and included 17 randomised controlled studies, involving 1132 women, published between 1967 and 1997. All women had perineal pain following an episiotomy (usually within 48 hours after birth), and were not breastfeeding. The women received either aspirin (doses ranging from 300 mg to 1200 mg) or fake pills (placebo), by mouth. The methodological quality of the studies was often unclear. Two studies did not contribute any data for analyses. 
Aspirin compared with placebo may increase adequate pain relief for mothers four to eight hours after administration (low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether aspirin compared with placebo has an effect on the need for additional pain relief, or on adverse effects for mothers, in the four to eight hours after administration (both very low‐certainty evidence). 
The effects of administering 300 mg versus 600 mg aspirin (1 study), 600 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (2 studies), or 300 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (1 study) are uncertain for adequate pain relief, the need for additional pain relief, or adverse effects for the mother. 
No studies reported on adverse effects of aspirin for the baby, or other outcomes we planned to assess: prolonged hospital stay, or readmission to hospital due to perineal pain; perineal pain six weeks after childbirth, women's views, or postpartum depression. 
What does this mean? 
A single dose of aspirin may help with perineal pain following episiotomy for women who are not breastfeeding, when measured four to eight hours after administration. 
We found no information to assess the effects of aspirin for women who are breastfeeding.

10.1002-14651858.CD013447,"Background
Governments and health systems are increasingly using mobile devices to communicate with patients and the public. Targeted digital client communication is when the health system transmits information to particular individuals or groups of people, based on their health or demographic status. Common types of targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or take their medicines. Other types include phone calls, interactive voice response, or multimedia messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. 
Objectives
To explore clients' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile devices on topics related to reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, or adolescent health (RMNCAH). 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (OvidSP), Embase (Ovid), World Health Organization Global Health Library, and POPLINE databases for eligible studies from inception to 3‐6 July 2017 dependant on the database (See appendix 2). 
Selection criteria
We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; that explored clients' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile device in the areas of RMNCAH; and were from any setting globally. 
Data collection and analysis
We used maximum variation purposive sampling for data synthesis, employing a three‐step sampling frame. We conducted a framework thematic analysis using the Supporting the Use of Research Evidence (SURE) framework as our starting point. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach. We used a matrix approach to explore whether potential implementation barriers identified in our synthesis had been addressed in the trials included in the related Cochrane Reviews of effectiveness. 
Main results
We included 35 studies, from a wide range of countries on six continents. Nineteen studies were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income settings and sixteen in high‐income settings. Some of the studies explored the views of people who had experienced the interventions, whereas others were hypothetical in nature, asking what people felt they would like from a digital health intervention. The studies covered a range of digital targeted client communication, for example medication or appointment reminders, prenatal health information, support for smoking cessation while pregnant, or general sexual health information. 
Our synthesis showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence). They also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence). 
However, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes. Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence). Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence). Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence). The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence). Language issues as well as skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence). 
Clients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were also concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence). Some clients suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence). 
Clients wanted messages at a time and frequency that was convenient for them (moderate confidence). They had preferences for different delivery channels (e.g. short message service (SMS) or interactive voice response) (moderate confidence). They also had preferences about message content, including new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (moderate confidence). Clients' views about who sent the digital health communication could influence their views of the programme (moderate confidence). 
For an overview of the findings and our confidence in the evidence, please see the 'Summary of qualitative findings' tables. 
Our matrix shows that many of the trials assessing these types of programmes did not try to address the problems we identified, although this may have been a reporting issue. 
Authors' conclusions
Our synthesis identified several factors that can influence the successful implementation of targeted client communication programmes using mobile devices. These include barriers to use that have equity implications. Programme planners should take these factors into account when designing and implementing programmes. Future trial authors also need to actively address these factors and to report their efforts in their trial publications. 
","## Plain Title: How People Feel About Health Messages on Phones

### Rationale

Governments and health groups now use cell phones a lot. They send health messages to people. These messages help with things like making sure you go to doctor visits. They also remind you to take your medicine. This is called targeted digital talk. It means sending special messages to certain people. It is based on their health or other facts about them. This study looked at how people feel about these messages. It focused on messages about family planning, having babies, and kids' health.

This study was needed. We wanted to know what people like and dislike. We wanted to see what problems they face. This helps make better health programs. If we know what people want, we can send messages that truly help them. We can also make sure more people can get these important health tips.

### Trial Design

This study looked at how people felt about health messages on phones. We searched for studies that asked people about their real-life experiences. We found these studies in big health databases. These studies used interviews and group talks. They asked people what they thought and how they felt.

We looked at studies from all over the world. They included people of all ages. They talked about things like planning families, getting pregnant, having babies, and taking care of kids and teens. We gathered all this information. Then, we looked for common ideas and feelings. We wanted to see what was the same across many different studies.

### Results

We found 35 studies from many countries. Some studies were from rich places. Others were from places with less money. Some people in the studies had used these phone health programs. Others just thought about what they would want. The messages covered many topics. These included reminders for medicine or doctor visits. They also gave advice on health during pregnancy. Some helped people stop smoking while pregnant. Others gave general sex health tips.

People had mixed feelings about these programs. Some felt good about them. They felt supported and connected. They liked that someone took time to send them messages. They also shared these messages with friends and family. This made them feel more connected to others.

But people also found problems. Some had bad cell service. They could not get online easily. Others had no phone. Some lost their phone or broke it. Airtime cost money for some. They often changed their phone number too. Some people, like women and teens, had others control their phone use. The cost of messages was a big deal. Many felt messages should be free. Language was also a problem for some. Others had trouble reading, writing, or using their phone.

People with private health issues had worries. These included HIV, family planning, or abortion care. They were worried about who would see their messages. They did not want their private health known. They had ideas to fix this. They said messages should use simple words. Also, messages should be sent at the right time. The number of messages should be right too.

People wanted messages when it was good for them. They liked to get them at a certain time. They also liked different ways to get messages. Some liked text messages. Others liked phone calls. They also had ideas for what messages should say. They wanted new facts. They wanted reminders. They also wanted solutions and tips for health problems. Who sent the messages also mattered to people. This changed how they felt about the program.

Many of the studies we looked at did not fix these problems. They did not try to make messages better for people.

This study showed many things. These things can help make phone health programs work better. We learned about things that stop people from using them. These problems can make it unfair for some people. People who plan these programs should think about these things. They should make sure their programs work for everyone. Future studies also need to fix these problems. They need to write about how they fix them too.","What are clients' experiences and perceptions of receiving health information via their mobile phones? 
What is the aim of this synthesis? 
The aim of this Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore clients' views and experiences of being communicated with by the health system through their mobile phone. Our synthesis looked at communication about pregnancy, newborn, and child health, sexual health, and family planning. By synthesis we mean the bringing together and synthesising of results from primary qualitative studies into a larger whole. We collected all relevant studies and included 35 studies in the synthesis. 
This synthesis links to other Cochrane Reviews that assess the effectiveness of this type of targeted digital health communication. 
Key messages 
Many clients like receiving messages from the health services by mobile phone. However, some clients have problems receiving messages due to lack of network access, internet, or phone, or language, reading, or privacy issues. Clients' experiences are also influenced by message timing, frequency, content, and sender. 
What did we study in the synthesis? 
Governments and health systems are starting to use mobile phones to communicate with clients. When the information is targeted at particular people or groups of people, and when the health system decides when and what to communicate, this is called 'digital targeted client communication.' Common types of digital targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or to take their medicines. Other types include phone calls or video messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. 
We looked for studies of clients' views and experiences of targeted communication by mobile phone. We focused on communication with pregnant women and parents of young children, and with adults and teenagers about sexual health and family planning. 
What are the main findings of the synthesis? 
We included 35 studies from around the world. These studies showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence). Others also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence). 
However, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes. Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence). Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence). Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence). The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence). Languages issues as well as clients' skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence). 
Clients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence). Some suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence). 
Clients wanted messages at a time and frequency that was convenient for them (moderate confidence). They had preferences for different delivery channels (e.g. short message service (SMS) or interactive voice response) (moderate confidence). They also had preferences about message content, including new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (moderate confidence). Clients' views about who sent the digital health communication could influence their views of the programme, and many people wanted a sender that they knew and trusted (moderate confidence). 
How up‐to‐date is the synthesis? 
We searched for studies published before July 2017.

10.1002-14651858.CD012080.pub2,"Accuracy of different non‐invasive methods for identifying Helicobacter pylori 
Why is it important to know whether someone has Helicobacter pylori? 
Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) is a type of bacteria which may be present in the stomach of some people. H pylori is believed to cause a number of cancers, including stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, and throat cancer. H pylori is also linked with other diseases including stomach ulcers, heart burn, and a bloated feeling. If H pylori is found in an individual, appropriate treatment can be started. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To compare the accuracy of three different types of test for H pylori. These are: urea breath tests, blood tests (the specific blood test is called serology), and stool tests (in faeces). 
What was studied in this review? 
There are two types of urea breath test which use two different forms of carbon known as 13C and 14C, as well as multiple versions of serology and stool tests. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 101 studies which included 11,003 people who were tested for H pylori. Of these 11,003 participants, 5839 (53.1%) had H pylori infection. All the studies used one of the three tests listed above and compared these test results with the diagnosis given by endoscopic biopsy. Endoscopic biopsy involves obtaining tissue from the stomach using a thin flexible tube introduced through the mouth and testing for the presence of H pylori under the microscope. It is currently the most accurate available test, however it causes physical discomfort to the patient, with associated risks for harm. This is in contrast to the alternative non‐invasive tests in this review which are significantly less uncomfortable and have minimal or no risk of harm, making them desirable alternatives if they can be shown to be as accurate at diagnosing H pylori as endoscopic biopsy. Most of the studies included participants with heart burn or similar problems in the stomach and excluded participants who had previously undergone partial removal of the stomach and those having treatment for H pylori. 
Thirty‐four studies (4242 participants) used serology; 29 studies (2988 participants) used stool antigen test; 34 studies (3139 participants) used urea breath test‐13C; 21 studies (1810 participants) used urea breath test‐14C; and two studies (127 participants) used urea breath test but did not report the type of carbon used. Studies varied in the limit they used before saying a test was positive for H pylori infection and the type of stains used to examine the biopsy material. When we looked at all the data we found that urea breath tests were more accurate than blood and stool tests. The results mean that, on average, if 1000 people are tested, there will be 46 people without H pylori who will be misdiagnosed as having H pylori. Also, there will be 30, 42, 86, and 89 people with H pylori infection for whom the diagnosis of H pylori infection will be missed by urea breath test‐13C, urea breath test‐14C, serology, and stool antigen test, respectively. When we looked at the seven studies which compared urea breath test‐13C and serology, or urea breath test‐13C and stool antigen tests in the same participants, the results were uncertain and we cannot tell which test is more accurate. 
How reliable are the results of the studies? 
Except for one study, all the studies were of poor methodological quality, which makes their results unreliable. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
These results apply to children and adults with suspected H pylori infection, but only in those who have not previously undergone stomach operations and those who have not recently had antibiotics or treatment for H pylori infection. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Urea breath tests, blood tests, and stool tests may be suitable for identifying whether someone has H pylori infection. However, the level of the result of urea breath test, blood test, or stool test which should be used to make a diagnosis of H pylori infection remains unclear. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
We performed a thorough literature search for studies reporting the accuracy of these different tests until 4 March 2016.

Easy Ways to Test for a Stomach Bug

## Rationale

Some people have a germ called *Helicobacter pylori*, or *H. pylori*, in their stomach. This germ can cause big problems. It can lead to cancers of the stomach, gut, and throat. It also causes stomach problems like ulcers, heartburn, and bloating.

Finding *H. pylori* early is key. If we find it, we can give medicine to get rid of it. This study looked at easy tests to find *H. pylori*. We want tests that work well and do not hurt patients.

The best test we have now takes a piece of your stomach. This test works well. But it is not nice. It can be painful. It also has risks. So, we need better ways to test for *H. pylori*. We want tests that are safe and easy. We need them to work as well as the old test.

## Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. We wanted to see how well three simple tests work. These tests look for *H. pylori*. The tests are:

*   **Breath tests:** You drink a special liquid. Then you breathe into a bag.
*   **Blood tests:** A nurse takes a small amount of blood from your arm.
*   **Stool tests:** You give a sample of your poop.

We looked at studies with people of all ages. They had signs of a stomach problem. People who had stomach surgery were not in the studies. People taking medicine for *H. pylori* were also left out.

All studies checked the simple tests against the old, painful stomach tissue test. This old test is the best way to know if *H. pylori* is there. We wanted to see if the new tests were as good.

## Results

We found 101 studies. They looked at 11,003 people. More than half of these people had *H. pylori*.

We found that breath tests worked better than blood and stool tests. For every 1000 people tested, the breath test missed *H. pylori* in about 30 to 42 people. Blood tests missed it in about 86 people. Stool tests missed it in about 89 people.

The breath test also wrongly said *H. pylori* was there in about 46 people out of 1000. These people did not have the germ.

The studies showed that breath tests are a good choice. They are much easier than the old stomach tissue test. They are also safer. But many studies were not done very well. This means the results may not be perfect. We need more good studies to be sure.

These easy tests can help many people. They can help kids and grown-ups. They help find *H. pylori* without a painful test. This means more people can get treatment sooner.","Accuracy of different non‐invasive methods for identifying Helicobacter pylori

10.1002-14651858.CD013453.pub2,"Background
Targeted therapies directed at specific driver oncogenes have improved outcomes for individuals with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 5% of lung adenocarcinomas, the most common histologic subtype of NSCLC, harbour rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene leading to constitutive activity of the ALK kinase. Crizotinib was the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) demonstrated to be effective in advanced NSCLC. Next‐generation ALK TKIs have since been developed including ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib, and have been compared with crizotinib or chemotherapy in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). These ALK‐targeted therapies are currently used in clinical practice and are endorsed in multiple clinical oncology guidelines. 
Objectives
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALK inhibitors given as monotherapy to treat advanced ALK‐rearranged NSCLC. 
Search methods
We conducted electronic searches in the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched conference proceedings from the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), and International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) World Conference on Lung Cancer, as well as the reference lists of retrieved articles. All searches were conducted from 2007 until 7 January 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing ALK inhibitors with cytotoxic chemotherapy or another ALK inhibitor in individuals with incurable locally advanced or metastatic pathologically confirmed ALK‐rearranged NSCLC. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, extracted study characteristics and outcome data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for each included study. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Primary outcomes were progression‐free survival (PFS) and adverse events (AE); secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), OS at one year, overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) criteria, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). We performed a meta‐analysis for all outcomes, where appropriate, using the fixed‐effect model. We reported hazard ratios (HR) for PFS, OS, and a composite HRQoL of life outcome (time to deterioration), and risk ratios (RR) for AE, ORR, and one‐year OS. We presented 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and used the I² statistic to investigate heterogeneity. We planned comparisons of 'ALK inhibitor versus chemotherapy' and 'next‐generation ALK inhibitor versus crizotinib’ with subgroup analysis by type of ALK inhibitor, line of treatment, and baseline central nervous system involvement. 
Main results
Eleven studies (2874 participants) met our inclusion criteria: six studies compared an ALK inhibitor (crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib) to chemotherapy, and five studies compared a next‐generation ALK inhibitor (alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib) to crizotinib. We assessed the evidence for most outcomes as of moderate to high certainty. Most studies were at low risk for selection, attrition, and reporting bias; however, no RCTs were blinded, resulting in a high risk of performance and detection bias for outcomes reliant on subjective measurement. 
ALK inhibitor versus chemotherapy 
Treatment with ALK inhibitors resulted in a large increase in PFS compared to chemotherapy (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.52, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, high‐certainty evidence). This was found regardless of line of treatment. 
ALK inhibitors may result in no difference in overall AE rate when compared to chemotherapy (RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.03, 5 RCTs, 1404 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
ALK inhibitors slightly improved OS (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, high‐certainty evidence), despite most included studies having a significant number of participants crossing over from chemotherapy to receive an ALK inhibitor after the study period. 
ALK inhibitors likely increase ORR (RR 2.43, 95% CI 2.16 to 2.75, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) including in measurable baseline brain metastases (RR 4.88, 95% CI 2.18 to 10.95, 3 RCTs, 108 participants) when compared to chemotherapy. ALK inhibitors result in a large increase in the HRQoL measure, time to deterioration (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.60, 5 RCTs, 1504 participants, high‐certainty evidence) when compared to chemotherapy. 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitor versus crizotinib 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors resulted in a large increase in PFS (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.46, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, high‐certainty evidence), particularly in participants with baseline brain metastases. 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors likely result in no difference in overall AE (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) when compared to crizotinib. 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors likely increase OS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and slightly increase ORR (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.25, 5 RCTs, 1229 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) including a response in measurable brain metastases (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.54, 4 RCTs, 138 participants) when compared to crizotinib. 
Studies comparing ALK inhibitors were conducted exclusively or partly in the first‐line setting. 
Authors' conclusions
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors including alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib are the preferred first systemic treatment for individuals with advanced ALK‐rearranged NSCLC. Further trials are ongoing including investigation of first‐line ensartinib. Next‐generation inhibitors have not been compared to each other, and it is unknown which should be used first and what subsequent treatment sequence is optimal.

Better Pills for Lung Cancer

## Rationale
Lung cancer is a serious illness. It can spread and be hard to treat. A common type is called non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. About 5 out of 100 people with NSCLC have a special change in their cancer. This change is in a gene called ALK. This ALK change makes the cancer grow.

Doctors found new drugs called ALK inhibitors. These pills target the ALK change. They aim to stop the cancer from growing. The first ALK pill was crizotinib. Later, newer ALK pills were made. These include ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib.

This study looked at how well these ALK pills work. It also checked if they are safe. We wanted to see if they help people with this type of lung cancer. These pills could give patients a better chance.

## Trial Design
We wanted to know how these ALK pills work. We looked at past studies. These studies were called randomized controlled trials. This means people in the studies were put into groups by chance. One group got an ALK pill. Another group got chemo or a different ALK pill.

We looked for studies from 2007 to early 2021. The people in these studies had advanced lung cancer. Their cancer had the ALK gene change. They were too sick for a cure.

We focused on a few key things. We checked how long people lived without their cancer growing. This is called progression-free survival. We also checked for side effects. We looked at how long people lived overall. We saw how many people’s tumors shrank. We also checked their quality of life. This means how they felt each day.

## Results
We found 11 studies. They included 2,874 people. Six studies looked at ALK pills versus chemo. Five studies looked at newer ALK pills versus crizotinib.

**ALK Pills vs. Chemo**

*   ALK pills worked much better than chemo. People lived longer without their cancer growing.
*   The number of side effects was about the same for both.
*   People who took ALK pills lived a little longer.
*   More people’s tumors shrank with ALK pills. This was true even for cancer in the brain.
*   People felt much better on ALK pills. Their quality of life was higher.

**Newer ALK Pills vs. Crizotinib**

*   Newer ALK pills worked much better than crizotinib. People lived longer without their cancer growing. This was very true for cancer in the brain.
*   The number of side effects was about the same for both.
*   People who took newer ALK pills lived longer.
*   More people’s tumors shrank with newer ALK pills. This was also true for cancer in the brain.

Our main finding is important. Newer ALK pills are the best first choice. They help people with advanced ALK lung cancer. They work better than chemo. They also work better than the older ALK pill, crizotinib. These pills help people live longer. They also improve quality of life. Doctors should use these newer ALK pills first. More studies are still going on. They will help us know which newer ALK pill is best. And what to do after that.","Targeted treatment of non‐small cell lung cancer with an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene mutation 
Background 
The most common type of lung cancer is non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). About 5% of NSCLC will be driven by a gene mutation known as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Targeted treatments for those with advanced (not curable) ALK‐mutated NSCLC cancer have been developed and found to be more effective than chemotherapy. The first ALK inhibitor to be developed was crizotinib. Newer ALK‐targeted drugs have also been developed and include ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib. In this review we looked at treatments that target ALK‐mutated NSCLC to find out how well they work. 
Objectives  
The primary objective of this review was to find out whether people with ALK‐mutated NSCLC given treatments targeted towards ALK live longer without recurrence and have fewer side effects than those treated with chemotherapy. We also planned to evaluate whether newer ALK‐targeted drugs achieve this better than crizotinib.  
Study characteristics 
We searched the main medical databases and records of conferences up to 7 January 2021. We found 11 studies (2874 participants): six studies compared an ALK‐targeted drug to chemotherapy, and five studies compared a newer ALK‐targeted drug to crizotinib. The studies were conducted in people with advanced ALK‐mutated NSCLC using these drugs as their first or later treatment. A total of five different ALK inhibitors were used across studies: alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, and lorlatinib. 
Results 
People treated with ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those on chemotherapy. These improvements were also seen in people with cancer that had spread to the brain. People receiving ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer overall, even when some had received chemotherapy first. ALK‐targeted drugs cause a similar number of side effects as chemotherapy. ALK‐targeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size and resulted in a longer time until worsening of symptoms when compared to chemotherapy.  
People treated with newer ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those receiving crizotinib, including in people with cancer involving the brain. People treated with newer ALK‐targeted drugs as first treatment were likely to live longer overall with a similar number of overall side effects. Newer ALK‐targeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size when compared to crizotinib. 
The evidence for most reported measures was of moderate or high certainty.
Conclusions 
The best first treatment for people with incurable ALK‐mutated lung cancer is a newer ALK inhibitor such as alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, or lorlatinib. More studies are needed to determine which of these options is best and what treatment should be used when the cancer grows after these medicines have been given.

Conventionally used soybean oil‐based lipid emulsion (S‐LE) have high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and phytosterols that may contribute to adverse effects in preterm infants. The newer lipid emulsions (LE) from different lipid sources are currently available for use in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To compare the safety and efficacy of all LE for parenteral nutrition (PN) in preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation) including preterm infants with surgical conditions or parenteral nutrition‐associated liver disease (PNALD)/cholestasis using direct comparisons and pair‐wise meta‐analyses. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to 18 June 2018), Embase (1974 to 18 July 2018), CINAHL (1982 to 18 June 2018), MIDRIS (1971 to 31 May 2018), conference proceedings, trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO's Trials Registry and Platform), and reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled studies in preterm infants with or without surgical conditions or PNALD within the first six months of life. 
Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis conformed to the methods of Cochrane Neonatal. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence for important outcomes in addition to reporting statistical significance of results. 
Main results
We included 29 studies (n = 2037) in this review. LE were classified in three broad groups: 1. all fish oil‐containing LE including pure fish oil‐LE (F‐LE) and multisource LE (e.g. medium‐chain triglycerides (MCT)‐olive‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (MOFS‐LE), MCT‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (MFS‐LE) and olive‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (OFS‐LE); 2. conventional S‐LE; 3. alternative‐LE (e.g. MCT‐soybean oil‐LE (MS‐LE), olive‐soybean oil‐LE and borage oil‐based LE). 
We considered the following broad comparisons: fish oil LE versus non‐fish oil LE; fish oil LE versus another fish oil LE; alternative‐LE versus S‐LE; alternative‐LE versus another alternative‐LE in preterm infants less than 37 weeks' gestation, preterm infants with surgical conditions and preterm infants with PNALD/cholestasis. Separate subgroup comparisons of each LE preparation were included within these broader groups. 
Most studies in preterm infants used PN for mean duration of four weeks or less and for longer duration in infants with cholestasis or surgical conditions. 
We defined the primary outcome of PNALD/cholestasis as conjugated bilirubin (Cbil) 2 mg/dL or greater and resolution of PNALD/cholestasis as Cbil less than 2 mg/dL. There was heterogeneity in definitions used by the included studies with Cbil cut‐offs ranging from 17.1 μmol/L (1 mg/dL) up to 50 μmol/L (about 3 mg/dL). 
In preterm infants, meta‐analysis found no evidence of a difference in the incidence of PNALD/cholestasis (Cbil cut‐off: 2 mg/dl) between fish oil‐LEs and all non‐fish oil LEs (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 1.56; typical risk difference (RD) –0.03, 95% CI –0.08 to 0.02; 4 studies; n = 328; low‐quality evidence). 
We also considered an outcome allowing for any definition of PNALD (different Cbil cutoffs). In the meta‐analysis for PNALD/cholestasis, using any definition and restricted to low or unclear risk of bias studies, there was no evidence of a difference between fish oil LE and all non‐fish oil LE for incidence of cholestasis (typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.21; typical RD –0.02, 95% CI –0.05 to 0.02; 10 studies; n = 1024; low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of difference in subgroup meta‐analyses of individual LE types in any comparison. 
In preterm infants with surgical conditions or cholestasis, there was only one small study each reporting no evidence of a difference in incidence or resolution of cholestasis respectively with use of a pure F‐LE versus S‐LE (using a Cbil cut‐off of 2 mg/dL). 
In preterm infants with PNALD/cholestasis (using any definition), the meta‐analysis showed significantly less cholestasis with the use of fish oil‐LE compared to S‐LE (typical RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.91; typical RD –0.39, 95% CI –0.65 to –0.12; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3, 95% CI 2 to 9; 2 studies; n = 40; very low‐quality evidence). However, this outcome had a very low number of participants from two small studies with methodological differences, one of which was terminated early, increasing the uncertainty about effect estimates. 
There were no differences between LE types in pair‐wise meta‐analyses for growth in preterm infants. There was paucity of studies in preterm infants with surgical conditions or cholestasis to perform meta‐analyses for growth and most other outcomes. 
In the secondary outcomes for preterm infants, there was no difference between fish‐oil LE and non‐fish oil LE in meta‐analysis for severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (stage 3 or greater, or requiring surgery: typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.16; typical RD –0.03, 95% CI –0.07 to 0.02; 7 studies; n = 731; very low‐quality evidence). There were no differences in the LE types in pair‐wise meta‐analyses for death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), ventilation duration, patent ductus arteriosus, sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, jaundice, hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, intrahepatocellular lipid content and conjugated bilirubin levels in any comparison. 
In surgical infants, one study (n = 19) reported no differences in death, sepsis rates, Cbil and neurodevelopmental outcomes with pure F‐LE versus S‐LE. 
In infants with cholestasis, there were no evidence of differences in death or sepsis in meta‐analyses between fish oil‐LE and S‐LE; (2 studies; n = 40; very low‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
In the current review, we did not find any particular LE with or without fish oil to be better than another LE in preterm infants for prevention of PNALD/cholestasis, growth, mortality, ROP, BPD and other neonatal outcomes. 
In preterm infants with surgical conditions or cholestasis, there is currently insufficient evidence from randomised studies to determine with any certainty if fish oil LEs offer advantage in prevention or resolution of cholestasis or in any other clinical outcome. 
Further research, with larger well‐designed trials, is warranted to evaluate the ideal composition of LE in preterm infants and the role of fish oil‐containing and other LEs in the prevention and resolution of PNALD, ROP and other clinical outcomes. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Better Fats for Tiny Babies

### Rationale

**Why is this study important?**

Babies born too early, called preterm infants, often need special feeding. They get food through a vein, called parenteral nutrition (PN). This food has fats, known as lipid emulsions (LE).

**What is the problem?**

The old fat mixes, made from soybean oil, had a lot of certain fats. These fats might cause problems for tiny babies. They could hurt the liver. This problem is called liver disease from PN. It makes babies sick and is a big worry for doctors and parents.

**What is new?**

New fat mixes use different oils. These new mixes might be safer. They might not harm the liver as much.

**What did this study want to find out?**

We wanted to see if these new fat mixes are better. Are they safer for tiny babies? Do they help babies grow well? We looked at all the different fat mixes. We wanted to see which ones worked best.

### Trial Design

**How was this study done?**

This study looked at many other studies. We gathered all the good studies we could find. These studies involved tiny babies. All babies were born before 37 weeks. Some babies had surgery. Some had liver problems.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included babies who were less than six months old. They were all preterm infants. Both boys and girls were included.

**What kind of studies did we look at?**

We looked for studies that compared different fat mixes. These studies were set up to give some babies one mix and other babies a different mix. This helps us see which mix works better.

**How long did babies get the fat mixes?**

Most babies got the special feeding for about four weeks or less. Babies with liver problems or who had surgery got it for a longer time.

### Results

**What did we find out?**

We looked at 29 studies. A total of 2037 babies were in these studies.

**Did any fat mix prevent liver problems better?**

We looked closely at liver problems. This is when a baby's liver doesn't work right. We found no clear proof that one fat mix was better than another. This was true for most babies.

**What about babies with existing liver problems?**

For babies who *already had* liver problems, fish oil mixes seemed to help. They had fewer liver problems. But, this was from only two small studies. We need more research to be sure.

**Did fat mixes help babies grow?**

We found no major differences in how babies grew. All the fat mixes seemed to help babies grow the same way.

**What about other health issues?**

We also looked at other problems. These included eye problems, breathing problems, and infections. We found no clear proof that one fat mix was better than another for these issues.

**What is the main takeaway?**

Right now, we cannot say one fat mix is much better than another. This is for most tiny babies. We need more large, well-done studies. These studies will help us find the best fat mix for tiny babies. This is especially true for babies with surgery or liver problems.","Systematic review of lipid emulsions for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants.
Review question: which lipid (fat) emulsions (LE) have the best outcomes in preterm infants with and without liver disease and surgical conditions? 
Background: preterm infants who need nutrition (feeding) through intravenous (into a vein; called parenteral nutrition) lines have been conventionally given pure soybean oil‐based fat emulsions. However, high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and phytosterols in pure soybean oil‐based emulsions may be harmful and contribute to parenteral nutrition‐associated liver disease (PNALD). The newer lipid emulsions (LE) from alternative lipid sources, including fish oil, may potentially improve clinical outcomes in preterm infants by decreasing PUFA content and providing lipid source‐specific benefits. 
Study characteristics: we searched the medical literature and identified 29 studies (including 2037 preterm infants). The evidence is up to date as of 18 June 2018. 
Key findings: in the population of preterm infants, without liver disease or surgical conditions, no particular LE was better than another for growth, liver disease, death, retinopathy (eye disease), infection and chronic lung disease. 
While there was very low quality and limited evidence to suggest that fish oil‐based LE may improve liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease, this evidence was based on a limited number of infants from two small studies, one of which was terminated early, and no certain conclusions can be drawn. 
Conclusions: based on this review, no particular LE is better than another for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants. There currently exists insufficient evidence from well‐designed studies about the benefit of fish oil‐LE for improving liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease or surgical conditions. Further research is required to establish the role of fish oil‐LE for liver disease outcomes in preterm infants and the ideal composition of LE for preterm infants.

10.1002-14651858.CD014653,"Background
Dialysis treatments weigh heavily on patients' physical and psychosocial health. Multiple studies have assessed the potential for exercise training to improve outcomes in adults undergoing dialysis. However, uncertainties exist in its relevance and sustainable benefits for patient‐important outcomes. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and safety of regular structured exercise training in adults undergoing dialysis on patient‐important outcomes including death, cardiovascular events, fatigue, functional capacity, pain, and depression. We also aimed to define the optimal prescription of exercise in adults undergoing dialysis. 
Search methods
In this update, we conducted a systematic search of the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 23 December 2020. The Register includes studies identified from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov as well as kidney‐related journals and the proceedings of major kidney conferences. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of any structured exercise programs of eight weeks or more in adults undergoing maintenance dialysis compared to no exercise or sham exercise. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the search results for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Whenever appropriate, we performed random‐effects meta‐analyses of the mean difference in outcomes. The primary outcomes were death (any cause), cardiovascular events and fatigue. Secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), depression, pain, functional capacity, blood pressure, adherence to the exercise program, and intervention‐related adverse events. 
Main results
We identified 89 studies involving 4291 randomised participants, of which 77 studies (3846 participants) contributed to the meta‐analyses. Seven studies included adults undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Fifty‐six studies reported aerobic exercise interventions, 21 resistance exercise interventions and 19 combined aerobic and resistance training within the same study arm. The interventions lasted from eight weeks to two years and most often took place thrice weekly during dialysis treatments. A single study reported death and no study reported long‐term cardiovascular events. Five studies directly assessed fatigue, 46 reported HRQoL and 16 reported fatigue or pain through their assessment of HRQoL. Thirty‐five studies assessed functional capacity, and 21 reported resting peripheral blood pressure. Twelve studies reported adherence to exercise sessions, and nine reported exercise‐related adverse events. Overall, the quality of the included studies was low and blinding of the participants was generally not feasible due to the nature of the intervention. 
Exercise had uncertain effects on death, cardiovascular events, and the mental component of HRQoL due to the very low certainty of evidence. Compared with sham or no exercise, exercise training for two to 12 months may improve fatigue in adults undergoing dialysis, however, a meta‐analysis could not be conducted. Any exercise training for two to 12 months may improve the physical component of HRQoL (17 studies, 656 participants: MD 4.12, 95% CI 1.88 to 6.37 points on 100 points‐scale; I² = 49%; low certainty evidence). Any exercise training for two to 12 months probably improves depressive symptoms (10 studies, 441 participants: SMD ‐0.65, 95% CI ‐1.07 to ‐0.22; I² = 77%; moderate certainty evidence) and the magnitude of the effect may be greater when maintaining the exercise beyond four months (6 studies, 311 participants: SMD ‐0.30, 95% CI 0.14 to ‐0.74; I² = 71%). Any exercise training for three to 12 months may improve pain (15 studies, 872 participants: MD 5.28 95% CI ‐0.12 to 10.69 points on 100 points‐scale; I² = 63%: low certainty evidence) however, the 95% CI indicates that exercise training may make little or no difference in the level of pain. Any exercise training for two to six months probably improves functional capacity as it increased the distance reached during six minutes of walking (19 studies, 827 participants: MD 49.91 metres, 95% CI 37.22 to 62.59; I² = 34%; moderate certainty evidence) and the number of sit‐to‐stand cycles performed in 30 seconds (MD 2.33 cycles, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.96; moderate certainty evidence). There was insufficient evidence to assess the safety of exercise training for adults undergoing maintenance dialysis. The results were similar for aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and a combination of both aerobic and resistance exercise. 
Authors' conclusions
It is uncertain whether exercise training improves death, cardiovascular events, or the mental component of HRQoL in adults undergoing maintenance dialysis. Exercise training probably improves depressive symptoms, particularly when the intervention is maintained beyond four months. Exercise training is also likely to improve functional capacity. Low certainty evidence suggested that exercise training may improve fatigue, the physical component of quality of life, and pain. The safety of exercise training for adults undergoing dialysis remains uncertain. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the abstract:

## Staying Active While on Dialysis

### Rationale

Kidney disease is a serious health problem. When kidneys stop working well, people need dialysis. Dialysis is a treatment that cleans the blood. It helps people live longer.

But dialysis can make people feel very tired. It can cause heart problems. It can also make people feel sad or in pain. These problems make life hard for patients.

Many studies have looked at exercise for people on dialysis. We want to know if exercise helps these patients. We also want to find the best way to exercise. Exercise may help people on dialysis feel better. It might help them live a better life.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. It searched for studies that tested exercise for adults on dialysis. These adults were getting regular dialysis.

The studies compared exercise to no exercise. Or they compared it to fake exercise. The exercise programs lasted at least eight weeks. Some lasted up to two years.

The people in the studies were adults. They had kidney disease and were on dialysis. The studies looked at important things. These included how long people lived. They also looked at heart problems, tiredness, pain, and sadness.

### Results

We found 89 studies. These studies included over 4000 people. Most of the studies had people doing exercise during dialysis. This often happened three times a week.

One study looked at how long people lived. No study looked at long-term heart problems.

Exercise might make people feel less tired. This was for exercise lasting two to twelve months.

Exercise might also make people feel better physically. This means their bodies felt better. This was seen after two to twelve months of exercise.

Exercise likely helped with sadness. This was especially true if people kept exercising for more than four months.

Exercise might help with pain. This was for exercise lasting three to twelve months. But the effect on pain was small.

Exercise likely made people stronger and more active. They could walk farther in six minutes. They could also stand up more times in 30 seconds. This was after two to six months of exercise.

We are not sure if exercise helps people live longer. We also do not know if it prevents heart problems. We also don't know for sure if exercise is safe for everyone on dialysis.

In short, exercise likely helps people on dialysis feel less sad. It also likely helps them be more active. It might help with tiredness and pain. More studies are needed to know for sure about other benefits and safety.","Exercise training for adults receiving dialysis treatments
What is the issue? 
People undergoing dialysis treatments are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and depression, have a lower quality of life and limited survival than the general population. Furthermore, many people undergoing dialysis have difficulty performing daily activities because they lack the physical capacity and strength to do so. Multiple trials have assessed the potential for exercise training to improve the condition of adults undergoing dialysis, but no consensus has been reached. 
What did we do? 
We searched the medical literature for all randomised trials that assessed structured exercise programs in people undergoing dialysis. We then assessed the quality of those studies and combined their results to draw conclusions regarding the effect of exercise training to improve aspects of physical and mental health that are important to patients undergoing dialysis. 
What did we find? 
We found 89 studies involving 4291 participants. The exercise training programs lasted from eight weeks to two years and most often took place three times a week during the dialysis treatment. We could not determine the impact of exercise training on death, cardiovascular events (such as a heart attack) or mental well‐being. Moderate certainty evidence suggested that exercise training of any type is likely to improve depressive symptoms in adults undergoing dialysis, particularly when the exercise was maintained for longer than four months. Moderate quality evidence also suggested that exercise training may improve people's capacity to perform activities and tasks through the improvement of their capacity to walk and the strength and endurance of their legs. Exercise training may also improve fatigue and the physical aspects of quality of life, but the quality of the evidence was low. We could not conclude on the effect of exercise training on a person's mental well‐being. 
ConclusionsExercise training for people undergoing maintenance dialysis is likely to improve depression and their capacity to perform activities and tasks. Exercise training may also improve fatigue and pain sightly. Exercise training may improve the physical aspects of quality of life, but it is unclear whether it improves a person's mental well‐being. It is unclear whether exercise training reduces the number of deaths or cardiovascular events.

10.1002-14651858.CD004314.pub3,"A comparison of botulinum toxin type A versus botulinum toxin type B for involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia 
The review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of botulinum toxin type A (BtA) compared to botulinum toxin type B (BtB) in people with involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia. This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review and we assessed the effectiveness (reduction in severity, disability and pain) and safety of BtA versus BtB in cervical dystonia. 
Background 
Cervical dystonia, also called spasmodic torticollis, is a disease that causes undesired, uncontrollable, often painful, abnormal placement of the head. It is a relatively uncommon condition (affecting 57 to 280 people per million) that can be very disabling and can affect a person's quality of life negatively. In most cases the cause is unknown and no cure exists. Since cervical dystonia is normally a long‐term disease it requires long‐term treatment. 
Botulinum toxin (Bt) is a powerful, natural chemical that can cause severe paralysis (an inability to move in the part of the body where it is applied) in animals and humans. It can also be used to treat many conditions, in particular those with involuntary muscle contractions, such as cervical dystonia. Bt is delivered by injections into the muscles that contract to produce the disease. There are different types of Bt, not all are available for treating health conditions. BtA is typically the first‐used treatment in cervical dystonia, but botulinum toxin type B (BtB) is an alternative option. The relative strength of each Bt formulation is variable, and the cost for 200 units varies from GBP 198 to GBP 308. 
Study characteristics 
We performed a rigorous search of the medical literature in October 2016 and found three studies that compared a single treatment session of BtA with BtB. These studies included a total of 270 participants, with on average a moderate disease impairment. The participants remained in the studies for a short period of time ‐ between 16 and 20 weeks after the treatment. The average age of people in the studies was 53.3 years, and they had had cervical dystonia for an average of 6.6 to 7.9 years before taking part in the trials. Most, 63.3%, of the people in the studies were women. All three of the studies were funded by drug manufacturers with possible interests in the results of the studies. 
Key results 
The results show little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the main measures of overall improvement and safety, including the total number of adverse (unwanted or harmful) events. There was also little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the self‐evaluations reported by the study participants. Based on the results we would expect that, out of 1000 people with cervical dystonia treated with BtB, there would be 362 more people who experience dry mouth/sore throat compared to 1000 people treated with BtA. The studies which looked at the duration of effect showed little or no difference between BtA and BtB. None of the studies examined the impact of either Bt on quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
All of the studies included participants that were different to the average person who suffers from cervical dystonia. To be included participants had to have a history of successful treatment with Bt. People with certain types of cervical dystonia, in particular the forms that make the head turn backward or forward, were not allowed to participate in the studies. 
Not enough participants were included across the studies for us to be completely confident in the results for the total number of adverse events, the self‐reported evaluations by participants or the pain assessment. 
The quality of the evidence for overall improvement and total number of adverse events was low. The quality of the evidence for more sore throat/dry mouth in people receiving BtB is moderate. The quality of the evidence where participants gave their self‐assessments is low. 
No definite conclusions can be drawn regarding overall safety and long‐term utility of BtA compared to BtB in cervical dystonia. 
","**Plain Title: Comparing Two Medicines for Neck Muscle Twitches**

**Rationale**
Cervical dystonia is a health problem. It causes your head to move in ways you cannot control. These movements can be painful. They can make it hard to do daily tasks. This can make life very difficult for people.

This condition is not common. But it often lasts a long time. There is no cure for it yet. So, people need ongoing treatment to help.

Botulinum toxin is a strong natural chemical. Doctors can use it as a medicine. They inject it into muscles that twitch. This can help muscles relax. There are different types of this medicine. Botulinum toxin type A (BtA) is often used first. Botulinum toxin type B (BtB) is another choice.

This study wanted to see if BtA or BtB works better. We looked at how well they helped people. We also looked at how safe they were. Knowing which one works best can help doctors choose. It can help people with cervical dystonia feel better.

**Trial Design**
We wanted to know how these medicines compare. We searched medical studies up to October 2016. We found three studies that looked at BtA versus BtB.

These studies included 270 people in total. The average age of these people was about 53 years. They had cervical dystonia for around 7 years. Most of the people, about 6 in 10, were women. All people in these studies had some muscle problems in their neck.

Each study looked at one dose of medicine. Participants stayed in the studies for a short time. This was usually between 16 and 20 weeks. This helped us see how the medicine worked right after the shot.

It is important to know who paid for these studies. Drug makers funded all three studies. They might want to see certain results.

**Results**
We looked at how well BtA and BtB worked. We also checked for any problems. The results showed that both medicines were much alike. There was little to no difference in how much they helped. This included how much pain people felt. It also included how many bad effects happened.

People in the studies also said how they felt. Their reports were also very similar for both medicines.

One small difference was found. More people who got BtB had a dry mouth or sore throat. For every 1000 people, about 362 more had these problems with BtB. This was compared to people who got BtA.

The studies also checked how long the good effects lasted. Both BtA and BtB seemed to work for about the same amount of time. None of the studies looked at how these medicines affected daily life. They did not check how the medicines changed a person's quality of life.

The studies had some limits. They only included people who had used these medicines before. Also, certain types of neck problems were not included. This means the results may not be true for everyone with cervical dystonia.

We also felt that there were not enough people in the studies. This means we cannot be fully sure of all the results. We need more studies to be very sure. For now, we cannot say for certain which medicine is safer long-term.","A comparison of botulinum toxin type A versus botulinum toxin type B for involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia

10.1002-14651858.MR000006.pub3,"Background
The tendency for authors to submit, and of journals to accept, manuscripts for publication based on the direction or strength of the study findings has been termed publication bias. 
Objectives
To assess the extent to which publication of a cohort of clinical trials is influenced by the statistical significance, perceived importance, or direction of their results. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Methodology Register (The Cochrane Library [Online] Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to March Week 2 2007), EMBASE (1980 to Week 11 2007) and Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (March 21 2007). We also searched the Science Citation Index (April 2007), checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted researchers to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Studies containing analyses of the association between publication and the statistical significance or direction of the results (trial findings), for a cohort of registered clinical trials. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data. We classified findings as either positive (defined as results classified by the investigators as statistically significant (P < 0.05), or perceived as striking or important, or showing a positive direction of effect) or negative (findings that were not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05), or perceived as unimportant, or showing a negative or null direction in effect). We extracted information on other potential risk factors for failure to publish, when these data were available. 
Main results
Five studies were included. Trials with positive findings were more likely to be published than trials with negative or null findings (odds ratio 3.90; 95% confidence interval 2.68 to 5.68). This corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.78 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.95), assuming that 41% of negative trials are published (the median among the included studies, range = 11% to 85%). In absolute terms, this means that if 41% of negative trials are published, we would expect that 73% of positive trials would be published. 
Two studies assessed time to publication and showed that trials with positive findings tended to be published after four to five years compared to those with negative findings, which were published after six to eight years. Three studies found no statistically significant association between sample size and publication. One study found no significant association between either funding mechanism, investigator rank, or sex and publication. 
Authors' conclusions
Trials with positive findings are published more often, and more quickly, than trials with negative findings. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the provided abstract:

## 1. Plain Title: Why Some Study Results Get Published More Often

## 2. Rationale

Sometimes, when doctors do studies, they get results that are good. These good results might show a new medicine works well. Other times, the results might not show much change. Or, they might show the medicine does not work as hoped.

When studies have good results, they often get put in special books. These books are called journals. This lets other doctors learn about the new findings. But what if studies with results that are not as good are not put in these books?

This could be a problem. Doctors might not get all the facts. They might only hear about studies that show a good outcome. They might miss out on studies that show no change or a poor outcome. This could make it hard for them to pick the best care for their patients.

This study looked at this issue. We wanted to see if studies with ""good"" results are more likely to be published. We also checked if they are published faster. We thought this might be true. We felt it was important to find out. This helps us ensure all study results are shared.

## 3. Trial Design

How did we design this study? We looked at other studies that had already been done. These studies looked at a group of clinical trials. Clinical trials are studies where new treatments are tested on people.

We searched special online libraries. These libraries store lots of health research. We looked for studies up to March 2007. We checked different places to make sure we found all key studies. We also asked other researchers for help.

We picked studies that checked two things. First, if a study's results made a big difference. Second, if the results pointed to a positive outcome. We wanted to see if these factors changed if a study got published.

Two of us checked all the data. We decided if results were ""positive"" or ""negative."" Positive meant the results showed a strong effect. Or, they were seen as very important. Negative meant the results did not show a strong effect. Or, they were seen as not important. We also looked for other reasons why a study might not get published.

## 4. Results

What did our study find? We looked at five main studies. These studies showed us something important.

Studies with ""positive"" results were much more likely to be published. They were about four times more likely to get published. This is compared to studies with ""negative"" or ""no change"" results.

Let's make this simple. Imagine out of every 10 studies with negative results, about 4 get published. If that is true, then out of every 10 studies with positive results, about 7 will get published. This is a big difference.

We also looked at how fast studies got published. Studies with ""positive"" results got published quicker. They often came out in about four or five years. Studies with ""negative"" results took longer. They often came out in about six to eight years.

Our study also checked other things. We looked to see if the size of the study changed how often it was published. We found no link there. We also found no link between who paid for the study or the researchers' jobs and if the study got published.

So, what did we learn? Studies that have good news or strong results are published more often. They also get published faster. This tells us that not all research gets shared equally. We need to make sure all study results are shared. This helps doctors and patients make the best choices.","Publication bias in clinical trials due to statistical significance or direction of trial results 
The validity of a systematic review depends on the methods used to conduct the review. If there is a systematic bias, such that studies with statistically significant or positive findings are more likely to be published and included in systematic reviews than trials with non‐significant findings, then the validity of a review's conclusions can be threatened. 
This methodology review identified five studies that investigated the extent to which the publication of clinical trials (such as those approved by an ethics review board) is influenced by the statistical significance or direction of a trial's results. These studies showed that trials with positive findings (defined either as those that were statistically significant (P < 0.05), or those findings perceived to be important or striking, or those indicating a positive direction of treatment effect), had nearly four times the odds of being published compared to findings that were not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05), or perceived as unimportant, or showing a negative or null direction of treatment effect. This corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.78 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.95), assuming that 41% of negative trials are published.Two studies found that trials with positive findings also tended to be published more quickly than trials with negative findings. The size of the trial (assessed in three studies) and the source of funding, academic rank, and sex of the principal investigator (assessed in one study) did not appear to influence whether a trial was published. 
These results provide support for mandating that clinical trials are registered before recruiting participants so that review authors know about all potentially eligible studies, regardless of their findings. Those carrying out systematic reviews should ensure they assess the potential problems of publication bias in their review and consider methods for addressing this issue by ensuring a comprehensive search for both published and unpublished trials.

10.1002-14651858.CD013376.pub2,"Background
Aflatoxins are carcinogenic mycotoxins that contaminate many food crops. Maize and groundnuts are prone to aflatoxin contamination, and are the major sources of human exposure to aflatoxins, due to their high intake as staple foods, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). Observational studies suggest an association between dietary exposure to aflatoxins during pregnancy and early childhood and linear growth in infants and young children. 
Objectives
To assess the effects on pre‐ and postnatal growth outcomes when agricultural and nutritional education interventions during the post‐harvest period that aim to reduce aflatoxin exposure are compared to usual support or no intervention. We assessed this in infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women at the household or community level in LMICs. 
Search methods
In July and August 2019, we searched: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, Africa‐Wide, LILACS, CAB Abstracts, Agricola, and two trials registers. We also checked the bibliographies of the included studies and contacted relevant mycotoxin organisations and researchers for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs of agricultural education and nutritional education interventions of any duration, at the household or community level, aimed at reducing aflatoxin intake by infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women, in LMICs during the post‐harvest period, compared to no intervention or usual support. We excluded studies that followed participants for less than four weeks. We assessed prespecified prenatal (at birth) and postnatal growth outcomes (during infancy, childhood, and adolescence), with linear growth (as the primary outcome), infectious disease morbidity, and unintended consequences. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed study eligibility using prespecified criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included RCTs. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE, and presented the main results in a 'Summary of findings' table. 
Main results
We included three recent cluster‐RCTs reporting the effects of agricultural education plus post‐harvest technologies, compared to usual agricultural support or no intervention. The participants were pregnant women and their children, lactating women and their infants (< 6 months), women of childbearing age, and young children (< 59 months), from rural, subsistence maize‐farming communities in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. 
Two trials randomised villages to the intervention and control groups, including a total of at least 979 mother‐child pairs from 60 villages. The third trial randomised 420 households, including 189 mother‐child pairs and 231 women of childbearing age. Duration of the intervention and follow‐up ranged between five and nine months. Due to risk of attrition bias, the overall risk of bias was unclear in one trial, and high in the other two trials. 
None of the included studies addressed the effects of nutritional education on pre‐ and postnatal growth. 
One trial reported outcomes not prespecified in our review, and we were unable to obtain unpublished growth data from the second trial, even after contacting the authors. The third trial, in lactating women and their infants in Tanzania, reported on the infants' weight‐for‐age z‐score (WAZ) after six months. This trial found that providing agricultural education aimed at changing farmers' post‐harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure, by using demonstrations (e.g. handsorting, de‐hulling of maize, drying sheets, and insecticides), may improve WAZ in infants from these farmers' households, on average, by 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.98; 1 study; 249 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), compared to infants from households where the farmers received routine agricultural extension services. 
Another way of reporting the effect on WAZ is to compare the proportion of underweight infants (WAZ > 2 SD below the reference median value) per group. This trial found that the intervention may reduce the proportion of underweight infants in the intervention households by 6.7% (95% CI ‐12.6 to ‐1.4; 249 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) compared to control households. 
No studies reported on unintended effects of agricultural and nutritional education.
Authors' conclusions
Evidence on the effects on child growth in LMICs of agricultural or nutritional education interventions that reduce aflatoxin exposure was very limited; no included study reported on linear growth. Very low‐certainty evidence suggested that agricultural education aimed at changing farmers' post‐harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure by using demonstrations, may result in an increase in WAZ, when compared to usual or no education. 
","## A Simple Look at Keeping Kids Healthy from Bad Foods

### Rationale

Many foods, like corn and peanuts, can have bad stuff called aflatoxins. These aflatoxins can make people sick. This is a big problem in poorer countries where people eat a lot of these foods.

Some studies suggest that if moms eat aflatoxins when they are pregnant, or if young children eat them, it can stop children from growing well. We want to help kids grow strong and healthy.

This study looked at ways to teach people how to store food better. We hoped that by doing this, we could stop aflatoxins from getting into food. This could help babies and children grow better.

### Trial Design

We wanted to see if teaching people about food safety could help kids grow. We looked for studies that taught farmers and families about handling food. These studies were in poorer countries.

We looked for studies that had two groups. One group learned new ways to keep food safe. The other group got the usual help or no help at all. We watched babies, children, and pregnant women.

We looked for studies that lasted at least four weeks. We wanted to see if the children grew taller. We also looked for any other sicknesses or problems that might happen.

### Results

We found three studies that looked at teaching farmers new ways to handle crops. These studies were in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. The people in the studies were pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. They lived in small farming towns.

Two studies put whole villages into groups. One group learned about new ways to farm. The other group did not. These studies looked at over 979 moms and their kids.

The third study looked at 420 homes. It included 189 moms and their kids, and 231 other women. The studies lasted for five to nine months.

None of the studies looked at teaching people about healthy eating. One study in Tanzania looked at how much infants gained weight. It found that teaching farmers new ways to store corn helped. These new ways included sorting corn and drying it.

Infants in these families gained more weight. They had a weight score that was higher by 0.57 points. This means fewer babies were underweight. The number of underweight babies went down by about 6.7 percent.

No studies reported any bad effects from this teaching.

This means that teaching farmers simple ways to handle their crops may help babies grow better. However, we need more studies to be sure.","Reducing aflatoxin intake with agricultural and nutritional education to improve growth of infants and children in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
Review question 
Does providing agricultural and nutritional education about how to reduce the intake of aflatoxins (from contaminated food crops) in households and communities in low and middle‐income countries (LMICs) improve the growth of infants and children compared to usual or no education? 
Background 
Aflatoxins are toxins produced by moulds that contaminate food crops. Maize and groundnuts are the major dietary sources of aflatoxins, as they are eaten in large amounts by many people living in LMICs. Some research from LMICs suggests that there may be a link between aflatoxin intake during pregnancy and early childhood, and growth in infants and young children. 
Study Characteristics 
We included three trials, conducted in pregnant and breastfeeding women (1168 mother‐child pairs), women of childbearing age (N = 231), and infants and young children (< 59 months old), from rural, subsistence maize‐farming communities in Kenya, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. One trial in Tanzania, at unclear risk of bias overall, provided data for this review, since one trial did not report any outcomes relevant to this review, and we were unable to obtain unpublished growth data for another, even after contacting the study authors. 
The trial, conducted in breastfeeding women and their babies, studied the effects of agricultural education (demonstrations to change farmers' practices after harvesting their maize crops to reduce aflatoxins (for example, by handsorting and de‐hulling the maize, using drying sheets and insecticides) on the babies' weight, standardised for age (weight‐for‐age z‐score (WAZ)), after six months (the z‐score measures the difference between these babies and the median of a population of similar babies). Farmers in the control group received routine services from agriculture extension workers. 
Key results 
Very low‐certainty evidence from one trial suggested that the WAZ of 128 children from farmers' households who received agricultural education may improve by a z‐score of 0.57, compared to 121 children from households where farmers only received routine services. This means that a baby girl in the intervention group, with a healthy weight, would gain about 450 to 690 grams more weight between three to nine months, compared to a baby girl in the control group. This is a meaningful difference. 
Another way of measuring the effect is to compare the proportion of underweight infants (WAZ ≥ 2 standard deviations below the reference median value) per group, after the intervention. In this case, agricultural education may reduce the proportion of underweight children, on average, by 6.7% (very low‐certainty evidence), compared to routine services. 
None of the included studies addressed the effects of nutritional education on length of height, or on unintended effects of agricultural or nutritional education. 
Evidence about the effects on child growth of agricultural or nutritional education interventions that reduce aflatoxin exposure in LMICs was very limited. Data from one trial suggested that agricultural education, aimed at changing farmers' post‐harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure, may result in the babies' increased weight‐for‐age, compared to usual or no education. 
The literature was searched to August 2019.
Quality of the evidence 
We have very little confidence in the results. The true effect may be substantially different. 
"
10.1002-14651858.CD013218.pub2,"Background
Plasmodium vivax (P vivax) is a focus of malaria elimination. It is important because P vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection are co‐endemic in some areas. There are asymptomatic carriers of P vivax, and the treatment for P vivax and Plasmodium ovale malaria differs from that used in other types of malaria. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) will help distinguish P vivax from other malaria species to help treatment and elimination. There are RDTs available that detect P vivax parasitaemia through the detection of P vivax‐specific lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) antigens. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for detecting P vivax malaria infection in people living in malaria‐endemic areas who present to ambulatory healthcare facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria; and to identify which types and brands of commercial tests best detect P vivax malaria. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases up to 30 July 2019: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S), both in the Web of Science. 
Selection criteria
Studies comparing RDTs with a reference standard (microscopy or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) in blood samples from patients attending ambulatory health facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria in P vivax‐endemic areas. 
Data collection and analysis
For each included study, two review authors independently extracted data using a pre‐piloted data extraction form. The methodological quality of the studies were assessed using a tailored Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 (QUADAS‐2) tool. We grouped studies according to commercial brand of the RDT and performed meta‐analysis when appropriate. The results given by the index tests were based on the antibody affinity (referred to as the strength of the bond between an antibody and an antigen) and avidity (referred to as the strength of the overall bond between a multivalent antibody and multiple antigens). All analyses were stratified by the type of reference standard. The bivariate model was used to estimate the pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), this model was simplified when studies were few. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 10 studies that assessed the accuracy of six different RDT brands (CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test, Falcivax Device Rapid test, Immuno‐Rapid Malaria Pf/Pv test, SD Bioline Malaria Ag Pf/Pv test, OnSite Pf/Pv test and Test Malaria Pf/Pv rapid test) for detecting P vivax malaria. One study directly compared the accuracy of two RDT brands. Of the 10 studies, six used microscopy, one used PCR, two used both microscopy and PCR separately and one used microscopy corrected by PCR as the reference standard. Four of the studies were conducted in Ethiopia, two in India, and one each in Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia and Sudan. 
The studies often did not report how patients were selected. In the patient selection domain, we judged the risk of bias as unclear for nine studies. We judged all studies to be of unclear applicability concern. In the index test domain, we judged most studies to be at low risk of bias, but we judged nine studies to be of unclear applicability concern. There was poor reporting on lot testing, how the RDTs were stored, and background parasitaemia density (a key variable determining diagnostic accuracy of RDTs). Only half of the included studies were judged to be at low risk of bias in the reference standard domain, Studies often did not report whether the results of the reference standard could classify the target condition or whether investigators knew the results of the RDT when interpreting the results of the reference standard. All 10 studies were judged to be at low risk of bias in the flow and timing domain. 
Only two brands were evaluated by more than one study. Four studies evaluated the CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test against microscopy and two studies evaluated the Falcivax Device Rapid test against microscopy. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 99% (95% CI 94% to 100%; 251 patients, moderate‐certainty evidence) and 99% (95% CI 99% to 100%; 2147 patients, moderate‐certainty evidence) for CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test. 
For a prevalence of 20%, about 206 people will have a positive CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test result and the remaining 794 people will have a negative result. Of the 206 people with positive results, eight will be incorrect (false positives), and of the 794 people with a negative result, two would be incorrect (false negative). 
For the Falcivax Device Rapid test, the pooled sensitivity was 77% (95% CI: 53% to 91%, 89 patients, low‐certainty evidence) and the pooled specificity was 99% (95% CI: 98% to 100%, 621 patients, moderate‐certainty evidence), respectively. For a prevalence of 20%, about 162 people will have a positive Falcivax Device Rapid test result and the remaining 838 people will have a negative result. Of the 162 people with positive results, eight will be incorrect (false positives), and of the 838 people with a negative result, 46 would be incorrect (false negative). 
Authors' conclusions
The CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test was found to be highly sensitive and specific in comparison to microscopy for detecting P vivax in ambulatory healthcare in endemic settings, with moderate‐certainty evidence. The number of studies included in this review was limited to 10 studies and we were able to estimate the accuracy of 2 out of 6 RDT brands included, the CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test and the Falcivax Device Rapid test. Thus, the differences in sensitivity and specificity between all the RDT brands could not be assessed. More high‐quality studies in endemic field settings are needed to assess and compare the accuracy of RDTs designed to detect P vivax. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study:

### Plain Title: Quick Tests for a Type of Malaria

### Rationale

Malaria is a sickness caused by tiny germs. One type of malaria is called *P vivax*. This type of malaria is a big problem in many places. People can have *P vivax* and not feel sick. But they can still spread the sickness.

It is vital to know if someone has *P vivax* malaria. This is because the medicine for *P vivax* is different from other types of malaria. If we use the wrong medicine, it will not work well. Also, knowing who has *P vivax* helps us stop the spread.

We need fast and easy tests to tell if someone has *P vivax*. These tests are called RDTs, or rapid diagnostic tests. They find a special marker from the *P vivax* germ. These tests could help doctors give the right medicine. They could also help get rid of *P vivax* malaria for good.

### Trial Design

This study looked at how well RDTs find *P vivax* malaria. We searched many science papers. We looked for studies that used these quick tests.

The studies we picked compared RDTs to very good lab tests. These lab tests are called microscopy or PCR. Microscopy uses a strong microscope to see the germs. PCR finds the germ's DNA.

The people in these studies felt sick. They went to a clinic in places where *P vivax* is common. We looked at blood samples from these people. We wanted to see if the RDTs gave the same answer as the lab tests.

We wanted to find the best RDTs for *P vivax* malaria. This study did not involve new patients. Instead, we gathered and checked information from past studies. This helps us learn from many different studies at once.

### Results

We found 10 studies that tested 6 different RDT brands. These brands included CareStart, Falcivax, Immuno-Rapid, SD Bioline, OnSite, and Test Malaria. The studies were in places like Ethiopia, India, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, and Sudan.

Many studies did not clearly say how they picked their patients. This made it hard to be sure about some of their findings. Also, some studies did not report how they stored the tests. Or how many germs were in the patient's blood. These things can change how well a test works.

Only 2 of the 6 RDT brands were studied enough times. These were the CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test and the Falcivax Device Rapid test. We could not fully compare all the brands.

The CareStart test worked very well. It found *P vivax* almost all the time. It also rarely said someone had *P vivax* when they did not.

Let's imagine 1000 people have *P vivax* malaria in an area. About 200 of them would have *P vivax*.
* If all 1000 people used the CareStart test:
    * About 206 people would test positive. Only 8 of these 206 tests would be wrong.
    * About 794 people would test negative. Only 2 of these 794 tests would be wrong.
This means the CareStart test is very good at finding *P vivax*. It rarely misses it or gives a wrong positive.

The Falcivax test found *P vivax* less often than CareStart. But it was still very good at not saying someone had *P vivax* when they did not.
* If all 1000 people used the Falcivax test:
    * About 162 people would test positive. Only 8 of these 162 tests would be wrong.
    * About 838 people would test negative. But 46 of these 838 tests would be wrong.
This means the Falcivax test might miss *P vivax* in more people.

The CareStart test seems to be a very good quick test for *P vivax* malaria. It is very likely to be correct. We need more good studies on all the RDT brands. This will help us choose the best tests to fight *P vivax* malaria.","Rapid tests for diagnosing malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax in people living in areas where malaria is very common 
What is the aim of the review? 
Malaria infection is caused mainly by two species of malaria parasite: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The aim of this review was to evaluate rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to diagnose P vivax infection. 
Why are rapid tests for P vivax malaria important? 
For clinical management, knowing which parasite species is causing the malaria is important as the drug treatments differ. For P vivax infection, an additional drug is required to eliminate the infection from the liver. For public health control of malaria, we know that P falciparum is declining over the previous 15 years, and infections from P vivax have therefore increased in importance. 
What was studied in this review? 
RDTs provide results quickly and are often as a dipstick. We studied RDTs that specifically test for P vivax malaria. RDTs are simple to use, point‐of‐care tests. They are suitable for use in rural settings by primary healthcare workers, using drop of blood on the dipstick that causes colour change and a distinct line that indicates a positive test result. Healthcare workers in rural areas can perform RDTs for P vivax without needing a laboratory or special equipment. We wanted to find out which brands of RDTs were the most accurate for diagnosing P vivax malaria. We compared the new tests against the standard form of diagnosis with microscopy, and also more recent methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR): a molecular method to identify P vivax DNA in blood samples. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We included 10 studies that looked at the accuracy of six diagnostic test brands for detecting P vivax malaria in people with suspected malaria symptoms. The studies were conducted in Ethiopia (four studies), India (two studies) and Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, and Sudan (one study each). 
Compared with microscopy, the Care Start Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test performed well with 99% sensitivity and specificity (four studies). This means that: 
• for every 100 people tested who have P vivax malaria, one person will have a negative test result, and might not receive the right treatment soon enough; 
• for every 100 people tested who do not have P vivax malaria, one will have a positive result, and might receive unnecessary treatment. 
Compared with microscopy, the Falcivax Device Rapid test had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 99% (two studies). This means that: 
• For every 100 people tested who have P vivax malaria, 23 people will have a negative test result; and, 
• for every 100 people tested who do not have P vivax malaria, one person will have a positive result. 
We are moderately confident (certain) in the accuracy results for the Care Start Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test. The results are from a small number of studies (four), so our findings may change when results from further studies become available. 
We are less confident in the accuracy results for the Falcivax Device Rapid test, because these came from only two studies. Our findings for this test will probably change when results from further studies become available. 
Our results are based on a small number of studies, so we could not reliably assess all six brands of antibody test or compare their accuracy. Most studies included in this review had limitations: it was not clear how people were selected for testing, or how the study results were assessed and checked, which could have affected the results. Some rapid antibody tests were investigated by only one study. Some studies did not report clearly how common P malaria was in the area where the study was done. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies published up to 30 July 2019.

Inability to communicate in a manner that can be understood causes extreme distress for people requiring an artificial airway and has implications for care quality and patient safety. Options for aided communication include non‐vocal, speech‐generating, and voice‐enabling aids. 
Objectives
To assess effectiveness of communication aids for people requiring an artificial airway (endotracheal or tracheostomy tube), defined as the proportion of people able to: use a non‐vocal communication aid to communicate at least one symptom, need, or preference; or use a voice‐enabling communication aid to phonate to produce at least one intelligible word. 
To assess time to communication/phonation; perceptions of communication; communication quality/success; quality of life; psychological distress; length of stay and costs; and adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (Wiley version), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), three other databases, and grey literature from inception to 30 July 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs, controlled non‐randomised parallel group, and before‐after studies evaluating communication aids used in adults with an artificial airway. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 11 studies (1931 participants) conducted in intensive care units (ICUs). Eight evaluated non‐vocal communication aids and three voice‐enabling aids. Usual care was the comparator for all. For six studies, this comprised no aid; usual care in the remaining five studies comprised use of various communication aids. 
Overall, our confidence in results regarding effectiveness of communication interventions was very low due to imprecision, measurement heterogeneity, inconsistency in results, and most studies at high or unclear risk of bias across multiple domains. 
No non‐vocal aid studies reported our primary outcome. We are uncertain of the effects of early use of a voice‐enabling aid compared to routine use on ability to phonate at least one intelligible word (risk ratio (RR) 3.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 50.08; 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Compared to usual care without aids, we are uncertain about effects of a non‐vocal aid (communication board) on patient satisfaction (standardised mean difference (SMD) 2.92, 95% CI 1.52 to 4.33; 4 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No studies of non‐vocal aids reported quality of life. Low‐certainty evidence from two studies suggests early use of a voice‐enabling aid may have no effect on quality of life (MD 2.27, 95% CI –7.21 to 11.75). Conceptual differences in measures of psychological distress precluded data pooling; however, intervention arm participants reported less distress suggesting there might be benefit, but our certainty in the evidence is very low. 
Low‐certainty evidence suggest voice‐enabling aids have little or no effect on ICU length of stay; we were unable to determine effects of non‐vocal aids. Three studies reported different adverse events (physical restraint use, bleeding following tracheostomy, and respiratory parameters indicating respiratory decompensation). Adverse event rates were similar between arms in all three studies. However, uncertainty remains as to any harm associated with communication aids. 
Authors' conclusions
Due to a lack of high‐quality studies, imprecision, inconsistency of results, and measurement heterogeneity,  the evidence provides insufficient information to guide practice as to which communication aid is more appropriate and when to use them. Understanding effectiveness of communication aids would benefit from development of a core outcome measurement set.

## Plain Title
Helping Patients Talk When They Have a Breathing Tube

## Rationale
People who need a breathing tube, either through their mouth (endotracheal) or neck (tracheostomy), often cannot talk. This can be very upsetting for them. It also makes it hard for doctors and nurses to know what they need. Patients might not be able to tell staff if they are in pain or need help.

This problem makes it harder to give good care. It can also be unsafe for patients. There are tools that can help people talk. Some tools do not use a voice. Others help patients make sounds.

This study looked at how well these tools work. We wanted to see if these tools help people with breathing tubes talk better. We wanted to find out which tools work best and when to use them.

## Trial Design
This study reviewed many past studies. We looked at how these studies were set up. We wanted to see how they tested talking tools. We included studies that compared a talking tool to usual care. Usual care means the normal way things are done, sometimes with no tool at all.

We looked at studies with adults who had a breathing tube. These people were in the intensive care unit (ICU). We wanted to see if they could use a tool to tell someone about a problem or a need. We also checked if voice tools helped them say at least one clear word.

We also looked at other things. These included how long it took to talk, how happy people were with talking, and their quality of life. We also checked if the tools caused any bad side effects. We looked at studies that lasted for different amounts of time, but all focused on patients in the ICU.

## Results
We looked at 11 studies with 1931 patients. All these patients were in the ICU. Eight studies looked at tools that did not use a voice. Three studies looked at tools that helped patients use their voice. All studies compared these tools to what is normally done in the hospital. For some studies, normal care meant no talking tool. For others, normal care meant using different talking tools.

It was hard to be sure about the results. The studies were not always clear. They measured things in different ways. Also, many studies had problems in how they were done. This means we cannot be very sure about what we found.

None of the studies about non-voice tools clearly showed if patients could tell staff a need or a problem. For voice tools, we are not sure if using them early helps patients say a clear word more often.

Some studies looked at how happy patients were. One study looked at a non-voice tool (a communication board). It said patients might be happier with this tool than with no tool. But again, we are not very sure about this.

No studies about non-voice tools looked at how the tools affected a person’s quality of life. Two studies looked at voice tools. They suggest that using voice tools early might not change a person's quality of life.

Some studies looked at how stressed people felt. It seemed like patients using the tools felt less stressed. But we could not combine the results from these studies. So, we are not very sure about this benefit either.

Voice tools seemed to have little or no effect on how long people stayed in the ICU. We could not tell if non-voice tools changed how long people stayed. Three studies noted some problems, like needing physical restraints, bleeding, or breathing issues. The number of problems was about the same whether patients used a tool or not. So, we cannot say for sure if these tools cause harm.

In the end, there is not enough strong information to tell doctors which talking tool is best. We also do not know the best time to use these tools. We need more good studies to understand how these tools can help patients.","Strategies to help adults with a breathing tube to communicate
What is the issue? 
Patients needing a machine to support breathing cannot speak due to a tube delivering gas to the lungs bypassing their voice box. Patients mouth words, gesture, and use facial expressions. However, these are very difficult to understand. Weakened muscles and difficulty concentrating, which are common in critical illness, makes using aids such as writing equipment or communication boards difficult. Consistent evidence on which communication aids are effective is lacking. 
Why is this important? 
Difficulty communicating places people at increased risk of harm, causes distress to patients and family, and causes stress for healthcare staff. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies (to 30 July 2020) exploring aids used to help people with a breathing tube to communicate. We found 11 studies involving 1931 participants admitted to intensive care units. We also looked for studies involving people needing a breathing tube and living at home or in long‐term care, but found none. Eight studies used communication boards or apps. Three studies used aids that help a patient to speak with the breathing tube in place. All studies compared the communication aid to routine communication practices. For six studies, routine practice did not include use of any type of communication aid. For the remaining five studies, usual care comprised a range of communication aids routinely used in the participating intensive care units including a communication board, paper notepad, and routine timing of the use of speech aids. We are unsure about whether the early use of aids to help with speaking may increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood or shorten the time to be able to speak. The evidence was of very low quality. 
Similarly, compared to routine care in which an aid is not used, we are uncertain about the effects of communication boards on patient satisfaction. We are not sure about the effect on psychological distress and quality of life due to uncertainty in the evidence. Communication aids that help people to speak may have little or no effect on intensive care unit length of stay (low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of possible harms  with use of communication aids as only three studies reported this, and all measured different adverse events, and two were very small studies. 
What does this mean? 
We are unsure whether using speaking aids in intensive care might increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood. Use of communication boards may increase patient satisfaction, but we are not sure of these findings because of very low‐quality evidence. This means further studies are likely to change our understanding of the effects of communication aids. More studies are needed to understand the effects of communication aids, particularly effects on psychological well‐being and people's ability to communicate.

Joint replacements are common procedures and treatment of choice for those with intractable joint pain and disability arising from arthropathy of the hip or knee. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is considered integral to the outcome of joint replacement. 
Objectives
To assess the evidence for effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation on activity and participation in adults following hip or knee joint replacement for chronic arthropathy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL up to September 2006. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared organised multidisciplinary rehabilitation with routine services following hip or knee replacement, and included outcome measures of activity and participation in accordance with the International Classification of Functioning, Health and Disability (ICF). 
Data collection and analysis
Four authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality of included trials. 
Main results
Five trials (619 participants) met the inclusion criteria; two addressed inpatient rehabilitation (261 participants) and three (358 participants) home‐based settings. There were no trials addressing outpatient centre‐based programmes. Pooling of data was not possible due to differences in study design and outcomes used. Methodological assessment showed all trials were of low quality. For inpatient settings early commencement of rehabilitation and clinical pathways led to more rapid attainment of functional milestones (disability) (Functional Independence Measure (FIM) transfer WMD 0.5, 95% CI 0.15, 0.85, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 6, FIM ambulation WMD 1.55 (95%CI 0.96, 2.14), NNTB = 3), shorter hospital stay, fewer post‐operative complications and reduced costs in the first three to four months. Home‐based multidisciplinary care improved functional gain (Oxford Hip Score (OHS) WMD at 6 months ‐7.00 (95%CI ‐10.36, ‐3.64), NNT = 2 and quality of life (QoL) and reduced hospital stay in the medium term (six months). No trials addressed longer‐term outcomes following hip replacement only. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the heterogeneity and the low quality of the included trials that precluded pooled meta‐analysis, there is silver level evidence that following hip or knee joint replacement, early multidisciplinary rehabilitation can improve outcomes at the level of activity and participation. The optimal intensity, frequency and effects of rehabilitation over a longer period and associated social costs need further study. Future research should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials, and use of standardised outcome measures, so that results can be pooled for statistical analysis.

## Plain Title
Better recovery after new hip or knee joints.

## Rationale
Many people get new hip or knee joints. This is a common surgery. It helps when joint pain is very bad. It helps when you cannot move well.

After surgery, people need help to get better. This help is called rehabilitation. It means working with different health experts. These experts help you move better. They help you get back to your daily life.

This study wanted to see if this special help works. We wanted to know if it helps people move more. We wanted to know if it helps them do more things. We thought this special help would make a big difference. It could make your recovery much better.

## Trial Design
We looked at past studies. These studies compared special rehab to usual care. Usual care is what most people get. We looked for studies on adults. They had new hip or knee joints. They had ongoing joint problems.

These studies had to be well-designed. They were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. One group got special rehab. The other group got usual care.

We looked at how people moved. We looked at what they could do. This included things like walking and bathing. We gathered all the information we could find.

## Results
We found five studies. These studies included 619 people. Two studies looked at rehab in the hospital. Three studies looked at rehab at home. No studies looked at rehab in an outpatient center.

The studies were not all alike. We could not combine their results. But we learned some important things.

For rehab in the hospital:
* Starting rehab early helped a lot.
* People got better faster.
* They could do things like move and walk more easily.
* People needed less time in the hospital.
* They had fewer problems after surgery.
* It even cost less money in the first few months.
* For every 6 people, 1 person got much better at moving from place to place.
* For every 3 people, 1 person got much better at walking.

For rehab at home:
* People got much better at moving.
* Their life quality improved.
* They spent less time in the hospital over six months.
* For every 2 people, 1 person felt much better in their hip.

We need more studies. These studies need to be better designed. We need to know how long the benefits last. We also need to know the full cost. But this special help can make a real difference. It can help people recover better and faster.","Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes following joint replacement at the hip and knee in chronic arthropathy

Dementia is a chronic condition which progressively affects memory and other cognitive functions, social behaviour, and ability to carry out daily activities. To date, no treatment is clearly effective in preventing progression of the disease, and most treatments are symptomatic, often aiming to improve people's psychological symptoms or behaviours which are challenging for carers. A range of new therapeutic strategies has been evaluated in research, and the use of trained animals in therapy sessions, termed animal‐assisted therapy (AAT), is receiving increasing attention. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of animal‐assisted therapy for people with dementia.
Search methods
We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register on 5 September 2019. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of major healthcare databases, trial registries, and grey literature sources. We also searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), ISI Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO's trial registry portal. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials, and randomised cross‐over trials that compared AAT versus no AAT, AAT using live animals versus alternatives such as robots or toys, or AAT versus any other active intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data using the standard methods of Cochrane Dementia. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the retrieved records. We expressed our results using mean difference (MD), standardised mean difference (SMD), and risk ratio (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) where appropriate. 
Main results
We included nine RCTs from 10 reports. All nine studies were conducted in Europe and the US. Six studies were parallel‐group, individually randomised RCTs; one was a randomised cross‐over trial; and two were cluster‐RCTs that were possibly related where randomisation took place at the level of the day care and nursing home. We identified two ongoing trials from trial registries. 
There were three comparisons: AAT versus no AAT (standard care or various non‐animal‐related activities), AAT using live animals versus robotic animals, and AAT using live animals versus the use of a soft animal toy. The studies evaluated 305 participants with dementia. One study used horses and the remainder used dogs as the therapy animal. The duration of the intervention ranged from six weeks to six months, and the therapy sessions lasted between 10 and 90 minutes each, with a frequency ranging from one session every two weeks to two sessions per week. There was a wide variety of instruments used to measure the outcomes. All studies were at high risk of performance bias and unclear risk of selection bias. Our certainty about the results for all major outcomes was very low to moderate. 
Comparing AAT versus no AAT, participants who received AAT may be slightly less depressed after the intervention (MD –2.87, 95% CI –5.24 to –0.50; 2 studies, 83 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but they did not appear to have improved quality of life (MD 0.45, 95% CI –1.28 to 2.18; 3 studies, 164 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no clear differences in all other major outcomes, including social functioning (MD –0.40, 95% CI –3.41 to 2.61; 1 study, 58 participants; low‐certainty evidence), problematic behaviour (SMD –0.34, 95% CI –0.98 to 0.30; 3 studies, 142 participants; very‐low‐certainty evidence), agitation (SMD –0.39, 95% CI –0.89 to 0.10; 3 studies, 143 participants; very‐low‐certainty evidence), activities of daily living (MD 4.65, 95% CI –16.05 to 25.35; 1 study, 37 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and self‐care ability (MD 2.20, 95% CI –1.23 to 5.63; 1 study, 58 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There were no data on adverse events. 
Comparing AAT using live animals versus robotic animals, one study (68 participants) found mixed effects on social function, with longer duration of physical contact but shorter duration of talking in participants who received AAT using live animals versus robotic animals (median: 93 seconds with live versus 28 seconds with robotic for physical contact; 164 seconds with live versus 206 seconds with robotic for talk directed at a person; 263 seconds with live versus 307 seconds with robotic for talk in total). Another study showed no clear differences between groups in behaviour measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MD –6.96, 95% CI –14.58 to 0.66; 78 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or quality of life (MD –2.42, 95% CI –5.71 to 0.87; 78 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There were no data on the other outcomes. 
Comparing AAT using live animals versus a soft toy cat, one study (64 participants) evaluated only social functioning, in the form of duration of contact and talking. The data were expressed as median and interquartile ranges. Duration of contact was slightly longer in participants in the AAT group and duration of talking slightly longer in those exposed to the toy cat. This was low‐certainty evidence. 
Authors' conclusions
We found low‐certainty evidence that AAT may slightly reduce depressive symptoms in people with dementia. We found no clear evidence that AAT affects other outcomes in this population, with our certainty in the evidence ranging from very‐low to moderate depending on the outcome. We found no evidence on safety or effects on the animals. Therefore, clear conclusions cannot yet be drawn about the overall benefits and risks of AAT in people with dementia. Further well‐conducted RCTs are needed to improve the certainty of the evidence. In view of the difficulty in achieving blinding of participants and personnel in such trials, future RCTs should work on blinding outcome assessors, document allocation methods clearly, and include major patient‐important outcomes such as affect, emotional and social functioning, quality of life, adverse events, and outcomes for animals.

## Plain Title
Does Spending Time With Animals Help People With Memory Loss?

## Rationale
Many people get a disease called dementia. This disease makes it hard to remember things. It also changes how people act and how well they do daily tasks. Right now, there is no cure for dementia. Most helpers try to make people feel better or cope with hard behaviors.

Scientists are looking for new ways to help. One idea is called animal-assisted therapy (AAT). This means people spend time with trained animals. Some people think animals might help those with dementia feel better. We wanted to see if AAT really works and if it is safe for people with dementia.

## Trial Design
We wanted to know how this study was set up. We looked at many past studies. These studies were called randomized controlled trials. This means some people got AAT, and others did not. Or some got AAT with live animals, and others used fake animals or toys.

The studies looked at people with dementia. They included a mix of ages and health issues. The studies lasted from six weeks to six months. Each time with an animal lasted from 10 to 90 minutes. People met with animals from once every two weeks to twice a week.

## Results
We looked at nine studies. All these studies were in Europe or the US. In total, 305 people with dementia took part. Most studies used dogs. One study used horses.

When people spent time with animals versus no animals:
* People might feel a little less sad. This was seen in two studies with 83 people.
* We did not see clear changes in their quality of life. This was seen in three studies with 164 people.
* There were no clear changes in how people socialized.
* There were no clear changes in hard behaviors or being upset.
* We also did not see clear changes in daily tasks like self-care.
* The studies did not talk about any bad things that happened.

When people spent time with live animals versus robot animals:
* One study with 68 people found mixed results. People touched live animals more. But they talked more to people when they had robot animals.
* Another study with 78 people did not find clear changes in behavior or quality of life.

When people spent time with live animals versus a soft toy cat:
* One study with 64 people looked at how much people touched or talked. People touched live animals a bit more. They talked a bit more when they had the toy cat.

What we found means that spending time with animals might make people with dementia a little less sad. But we do not have clear proof that it helps with other things. We also do not know if it is truly safe or if it affects the animals. More good studies are needed to be sure.","Animal‐assisted therapy for people with dementia
Review question 
Do therapy sessions that involve live animals help people with dementia?
Background 
Dementia is an increasingly common condition across the world. People with dementia have progressive loss of the ability to think, remember, and communicate; to manage their daily activities; and to mix successfully with other people. Many people with dementia also develop depression and related problems. To date, no treatment has proven able to cure the disease or stop it from getting worse. However, many treatments are in use which aim to improve the well‐being of people with dementia and the people who look after them. Animal‐assisted therapy (AAT) is one of the types of treatment that has been studied. It is thought that animals could help people with dementia by providing companionship and support in daily activities and that this might lead to improvements in physical and mental health, including better mood and fewer problematic behaviours. 
Search date 
We searched medical databases to September 2019.
Key characteristics of included studies 
We included nine randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), involving 305 people with dementia, which compared AAT to a control treatment (either usual care or an alternative treatment). All studies took place in Europe or the US. Seven studies compared AAT to usual care or to another activity which had nothing to do with animals. Two studies compared AAT (using live animals) to the use of robotic animals. One study compared AAT to the use of a soft toy cat. There were some features of the studies which could have biased the results. Study participants and care staff knew what treatment a person was receiving and this might have affected some results. Also, it was not always clear that the randomisation to treatments had been done as well as possible. 
Funding sources 
The studies received funding from various sources, including research grants (four studies), personal donation (one study), and support from an institute that promotes AAT (two studies). Two studies did not describe how they were funded. 
Key results 
We found evidence from two studies with 83 participants that people with dementia who had AAT were possibly slightly less depressed at the end of treatment than people who had standard care or other interventions not related to animals. We also found evidence from three studies with 164 participants that people who received AAT had no clear difference in their quality of life compared to those who did not. However, we found no evidence of an effect on social functioning (interactions with their environment and families), behaviour, agitation, activities of daily living, self‐care ability or balance. There were no clear differences when AAT was compared with the use of a robotic animal in two studies with 156 participants (in social functioning, behaviour, and quality of life), or with the use of a soft toy cat in one study with 64 participants (in social functioning). There were no data on harmful effects of the treatment on the participants and nothing was reported about the effect on the animals in any study. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We took several factors into account when deciding how certain we could be of our results. In this review, two main factors reduced our level of certainty. First, for all the outcomes we looked at, there was only a small number of studies and participants. Second, we thought there was a significant risk that all of the results could have been biased by the way the studies were designed or conducted. For a few outcomes, our confidence was also reduced by inconsistent results between studies. Overall, our certainty about the results ranged from very low to moderate. 
Conclusions 
AAT may slightly reduce depressive symptoms. Otherwise, no conclusions can yet be drawn on whether AAT is beneficial or safe for people with dementia. The small size of the included studies, and the diversity of outcomes and outcome measures, were major issues. We recommend further well‐conducted studies with the inclusion of important outcomes such as emotional and social well‐being, quality of life, side effects, and effects on the animals.

Work disability such as sickness absence is common in people with depression.
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing work disability in employees with depressive disorders. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO until April 4th 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs of work‐directed and clinical interventions for depressed people that included sickness absence days or being off work as an outcome. We also analysed the effects on depression and work functioning. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted the data and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) or risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to pool study results in studies we judged to be sufficiently similar.  
Main results
In this update, we added 23 new studies. In total, we included 45 studies with 88 study arms, involving 12,109 participants with either a major depressive disorder or a high level of depressive symptoms. 
Risk of bias 
The most common types of bias risk were detection bias (27 studies) and attrition bias (22 studies), both for the outcome of sickness absence. 
Work‐directed interventions 
Work‐directed interventionscombined with clinical interventions 
A combination of a work‐directed intervention and a clinical intervention probably reduces sickness absence days within the first year of follow‐up (SMD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.38 to ‐0.12; 9 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). This translates back to 0.5 fewer (95% CI ‐0.7 to ‐0.2) sick leave days in the past two weeks or 25 fewer days during one year (95% CI ‐37.5 to ‐11.8). The intervention does not lead to fewer persons being off work beyond one year follow‐up (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.83; 2 studies, high‐certainty evidence). The intervention may reduce depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.01; 8 studies, low‐certainty evidence) and probably has a small effect on work functioning (SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.06; 5 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence) within the first year of follow‐up.  
Stand alone work‐directed interventions 
A specific work‐directed intervention alone may increase the number of sickness absence days compared with work‐directed care as usual (SMD 0.39, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.74; 2 studies, low‐certainty evidence) but probably does not lead to more people being off work within the first year of follow‐up (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.11; 1 study, moderate‐certainty evidence) or beyond (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; 2 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence). There is probably no effect on depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.10, 95% ‐0.30 CI to 0.10; 4 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence) within the first year of follow‐up and there may be no effect on depressive symptoms beyond that time (SMD 0.18, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.49; 1 study, low‐certainty evidence). The intervention may also not lead to better work functioning (SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.90 to 0.26; 1 study, low‐certainty evidence) within the first year of follow‐up.   
Psychological interventions 
A psychological intervention, either face‐to‐face, or an E‐mental health intervention, with or without professional guidance, may reduce the number of sickness absence days, compared with care as usual (SMD ‐0.15, 95% CI ‐0.28 to ‐0.03; 9 studies, low‐certainty evidence). It may also reduce depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐0.45 to ‐0.15, 8 studies, low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether these psychological interventions improve work ability (SMD ‐0.15 95% CI ‐0.46 to 0.57; 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Psychological interventioncombined with antidepressant medication 
Two studies compared the effect of a psychological intervention combined with antidepressants to antidepressants alone. One study combined psychodynamic therapy with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) medication and another combined telephone‐administered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). We are uncertain if this intervention reduces the number of sickness absence days (SMD ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐0.99 to 0.24; 2 studies, very low‐certainty evidence) but found that there may be no effect on depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.50 to 0.12; 2 studies, low‐certainty evidence). 
Antidepressant medication only 
Three studies compared the effectiveness of SSRI to selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medication on reducing sickness absence and yielded highly inconsistent results. 
Improved care 
Overall, interventions to improve care did not lead to fewer sickness absence days, compared to care as usual (SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.06; 7 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence). However, in studies with a low risk of bias, the intervention probably leads to fewer sickness absence days in the first year of follow‐up (SMD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.35 to ‐0.05; 2 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). Improved care probably leads to fewer depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.35 to ‐0.07; 7 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence) but may possibly lead to a decrease in work‐functioning (SMD 0.5, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66; 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Exercise 
Supervised strength exercise may reduce sickness absence, compared to relaxation (SMD ‐1.11; 95% CI ‐1.68 to ‐0.54; one study, low‐certainty evidence). However, aerobic exercise probably is not more effective than relaxation or stretching (SMD ‐0.06; 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.24; 2 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence). Both studies found no differences between the two conditions in depressive symptoms. 
Authors' conclusions
A combination of a work‐directed intervention and a clinical intervention probably reduces the number of sickness absence days, but at the end of one year or longer follow‐up, this does not lead to more people in the intervention group being at work. The intervention may also reduce depressive symptoms and probably increases work functioning more than care as usual. Specific work‐directed interventions may not be more effective than usual work‐directed care alone. Psychological interventions may reduce the number of sickness absence days, compared with care as usual. Interventions to improve clinical care probably lead to lower sickness absence and lower levels of depression, compared with care as usual. There was no evidence of a difference in effect on sickness absence of one antidepressant medication compared to another. Further research is needed to assess which combination of work‐directed and clinical interventions works best. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Helping People with Depression Stay at Work

### Rationale

Depression is a common illness. It can make people feel sad, tired, and lose interest in things. This can make it hard to go to work. Many people with depression miss a lot of work. This can be a big problem for them. It can affect their money and their health.

We wanted to find out what treatments help people with depression stay at work. We looked at different ways to help. Some ways focused on work. Others focused on treating depression itself. We also looked at combining these approaches. We thought some treatments might help people feel better and miss less work. This study is important to find the best ways to help people.

### Trial Design

We did a big review of many studies. We looked for studies that compared different treatments. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. One group got a new treatment. Another group got usual care.

We looked at studies with people who had depression. They could have severe depression or just many sad feelings. We wanted to see how many days they missed work. We also looked at how they felt. We looked at their depression symptoms. We also checked how well they could do their job.

We searched many health databases for studies. We looked at studies published up to April 4th, 2020. Two people checked all the studies. They made sure the studies were good enough to use. They also gathered the facts from each study. This way, we could combine the results from many studies. This helped us get a clear picture.

### Results

We found 45 studies to include in our review. These studies looked at 12,109 people. All these people had depression. We looked at many different ways to help them.

**Work-focused help combined with depression treatment:**

When people got help for their work and help for their depression, it seemed to work well. They probably missed fewer days of work in the first year. For example, they might miss 0.5 fewer sick days in two weeks. Or they might miss 25 fewer days in a whole year. This combined help might also make their depression symptoms better. It probably also helped them do better at work. But, after one year, this help did not make more people stay at work for good.

**Work-focused help alone:**

Getting only work-focused help might not be better than usual care. It might even lead to more sick days. It probably did not help people stay at work more. It also did not seem to help their depression symptoms much. It might not help them do better at work either.

**Counseling (psychological interventions):**

Counseling, like talking to a therapist, might help. This could be in person or online. It might reduce the number of sick days people take. It also might make depression symptoms better. We are not sure if it helps them do better at work.

**Counseling combined with medicine:**

We looked at studies where people got counseling and antidepressant medicine. We are not sure if this reduced sick days. It probably did not make depression symptoms better than medicine alone.

**Antidepressant medicine only:**

We looked at studies about different antidepressant medicines. We could not find a clear answer. It was hard to say if one medicine was better than another for sick days.

**Better standard care:**

Improving the regular care people get also helped. It probably led to fewer sick days. It also probably helped reduce depression symptoms. However, it might make work functioning a little worse.

**Exercise:**

Supervised strength exercise might reduce sick days. This was compared to just doing relaxation. But, other types of exercise like walking or running were not better than relaxation or stretching. Exercise did not seem to change depression symptoms much.

In conclusion, combining work-focused help with depression treatment probably works best. It helps reduce sick days and improves how people feel and work in the short term. Counseling also helps. Improving regular care helps with sick days and depression. We need more studies to find the very best ways to combine treatments.","What are the best ways to help people with depression go back to work?
What is depression? 
Depression is a common mental health problem that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in people, activities, and things that were once enjoyable. A person with depression may feel tearful, irritable, or tired most of the time, and may have problems with sleep, concentration, and memory. 
Depression may affect people's ability to work. People with depression may be absent from work (off sick), or feel less able to cope with working. 
Going back to work 
Reducing depressive symptoms may help people with depression to go back to work. Treatments include medications and psychological (talking) therapies, or a combination of both. Changes at the workplace could also help, such as: 
changing a person's tasks or working hours;
supporting them in a gradual return to work; or
helping them to cope better with certain work situations.
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
Work can improve a person's physical and mental well‑being; it helps build confidence and self‐esteem, allows people to socialise, and provides money. We wanted to find out if workplace changes and clinical programmes could help people with depression to return to work. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at whether workplace changes and clinical programmes affected the amount of sick leave taken by people with depression. Clinical programmes included: medicines (anti‐depressants); psychological therapies; improved healthcare by doctors; and other programmes such as exercise and diet.  
Search date: we included evidence published up to 4 April 2020. 
What we found 
We found 45 studies in 12,109 people with depression. The studies took place in Europe (34 studies), the USA (8), Australia (2) and Canada (1). 
The effects of 'care as usual' were compared with those of workplace changes and clinical programmes to find out: 
how many days people with depression were on sick leave
how many people with depression were off work;
people's symptoms of depression; and
how well people with depression could cope with their work.
What are the results of our review? 
Our main findings within the first year of follow‐up, for workplace changes or treatments compared with usual care, are listed below. 
Workplace changes combined with a clinical programme:
probably reduce the number of days on sick leave (on average, by 25 days for each person over one year; 9 studies; 1292 participants); 
do not reduce the number of people off work (2 studies; 1025 participants);
may reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1091 participants); and
may improve ability to cope with work (5 studies; 926 participants).
Workplace changes alone:
may increase the number of days on sick leave (2 studies, 130 participants);
probably do not lead to more people off work (1 study; 226 participants);
probably do not affect symptoms of depression (4 studies; 390 participants); and
may not improve ability to cope with work (1 study; 48 participants).
Improved healthcare alone:
probably reduces the number of days on sick leave, by 20 days (in two, well‐conducted studies in 692 participants, although not in all 7 studies, in 1912 participants); 
probably reduces symptoms of depression (7 studies; 1808 participants); and
may reduce ability to cope with work (1 study; 604 participants).
Psychological therapies alone:
may reduce the number of days off work, by 15 days (9 studies; 1649 participants); and 
may reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1255 participants).
We are uncertain if psychological therapies alone affect people's ability to cope with work (1 study; 58 participants). 
How reliable are these results? 
Our confidence in these results is mostly moderate to low. Some findings are based on small numbers of studies, in small numbers of participants. We also found limitations in the ways some studies were designed, conducted and reported. 
Key messages 
Combining workplace changes with a clinical programme probably helps people with depression to return to work more quickly and to take fewer days off sick. We need more evidence to assess which combination of workplace changes and clinical programmes works best. 
Improved healthcare probably also helps people with depression to take fewer days off sick.

Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is important to guide appropriate management and improve morbidity and survival. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually a localised skin cancer but with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue, whereas cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma are higher risk skin cancers with the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death. When used in conjunction with clinical or dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, or both, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) may help to identify cancers eligible for non‐surgical treatment without the need for a diagnostic biopsy, particularly in people with suspected BCC. Any potential benefit must be balanced against the risk of any misdiagnoses. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of RCM for the detection of BCC, cSCC, or any skin cancer in adults with any suspicious lesion and lesions that are difficult to diagnose (equivocal); and to compare its accuracy with that of usual practice (visual inspection or dermoscopy, or both). 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design that evaluated the accuracy of RCM alone, or RCM in comparison to visual inspection or dermoscopy, or both, in adults with lesions suspicious for skin cancer compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up, or both. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. For computation of likely numbers of true‐positive, false‐positive, false‐negative, and true‐negative findings in the 'Summary of findings' tables, we applied summary sensitivity and specificity estimates to lower quartile, median and upper quartiles of the prevalence observed in the study groups. We also investigated the impact of observer experience. 
Main results
The review included 10 studies reporting on 11 study cohorts. All 11 cohorts reported data for the detection of BCC, including 2037 lesions (464 with BCC); and four cohorts reported data for the detection of cSCC, including 834 lesions (71 with cSCC). Only one study also reported data for the detection of BCC or cSCC using dermoscopy, limiting comparisons between RCM and dermoscopy. Studies were at high or unclear risk of bias across almost all methodological quality domains, and were of high or unclear concern regarding applicability of the evidence. Selective participant recruitment, unclear blinding of the reference test, and exclusions due to image quality or technical difficulties were observed. It was unclear whether studies were representative of populations eligible for testing with RCM, and test interpretation was often undertaken using images, remotely from the participant and the interpreter blinded to clinical information that would normally be available in practice. 
Meta‐analysis found RCM to be more sensitive but less specific for the detection of BCC in studies of participants with equivocal lesions (sensitivity 94%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 79% to 98%; specificity 85%, 95% CI 72% to 92%; 3 studies) compared to studies that included any suspicious lesion (sensitivity 76%, 95% CI 45% to 92%; specificity 95%, 95% CI 66% to 99%; 4 studies), although CIs were wide. At the median prevalence of disease of 12.5% observed in studies including any suspicious lesion, applying these results to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions results in 30 BCCs missed with 44 false‐positive results (lesions misdiagnosed as BCCs). At the median prevalence of disease of 15% observed in studies of equivocal lesions, nine BCCs would be missed with 128 false‐positive results in a population of 1000 lesions. Across both sets of studies, up to 15% of these false‐positive lesions were observed to be melanomas mistaken for BCCs. There was some suggestion of higher sensitivities in studies with more experienced observers. Summary sensitivity and specificity could not be estimated for the detection of cSCC due to paucity of data. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence for the use of RCM for the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC in either population group. A possible role for RCM in clinical practice is as a tool to avoid diagnostic biopsies in lesions with a relatively high clinical suspicion of BCC. The potential for, and consequences of, misclassification of other skin cancers such as melanoma as BCCs requires further research. Importantly, data are lacking that compare RCM to standard clinical practice (with or without dermoscopy). 
","## Better Ways to Spot Skin Cancer

### Rationale

Skin cancer is a common problem. There are different types. Some are less serious, like Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC). BCC often stays in one spot. But it can still cause damage nearby. Other types are more serious. These include Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma. These can spread to other body parts. They can even cause death.

Finding skin cancer early is very important. It helps doctors choose the right treatment. This can make a big difference for patients. It can help them get better and live longer.

Some tools help doctors look at skin. One tool is called Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM). It helps doctors see skin more clearly. This tool might help find BCC without needing a biopsy. A biopsy means taking a small piece of skin for testing. Not needing a biopsy can be good for patients. But it's also important not to miss a cancer. Or to mistake one type of cancer for another.

This study looked at how well RCM works. We wanted to see if it could find skin cancers. We also wanted to see if it was as good as what doctors usually do.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many past studies. We gathered information from these studies. We wanted to know if RCM correctly finds skin cancer. We looked at studies where doctors used RCM. They used it on adults with skin spots. These spots either looked suspicious. Or they were hard to tell what they were.

We then compared RCM results. We looked at what doctors usually do. This is often just looking at the spot. Or using a special magnifying tool called a dermoscope. To know if RCM was right, we looked at two things. One was if a biopsy confirmed cancer. The other was if doctors watched the spot over time.

We searched many health databases. We looked for studies up to August 2016. Two people checked all the information. They made sure the data was correct. They also checked for any problems with how the studies were done.

We wanted to see how many cancers RCM found. We also wanted to see how often it said there was cancer when there wasn't. We looked at how much experience the doctors had with RCM. This could change the results.

### Results

We found 10 studies for our review. These studies included over 2000 skin spots. About 460 of these spots were BCC. Some studies also looked at cSCC. About 70 of those spots were cSCC.

Many studies had problems. We found that the way they chose patients was sometimes unclear. Doctors also often looked at pictures of the spots. They did not see the actual patient. This is not how it works in real life. Also, some studies did not hide the results of other tests. This could make the RCM results look better.

When we put all the results together, RCM seemed to find BCC well. This was especially true for spots that were hard to diagnose. In these cases, RCM found about 94 out of 100 BCCs. But it also said there was cancer when there wasn't in 15 out of 100 cases. For spots that just looked suspicious, RCM found fewer BCCs. It found about 76 out of 100. But it was more accurate about not saying there was cancer when there wasn't. It was wrong in only 5 out of 100 cases.

Let's think about 1000 spots that are just suspicious. RCM might miss 30 BCCs. It might also say 44 spots are BCCs when they are not. Some of these 44 spots might even be melanoma. Melanoma is a very serious skin cancer.

If we look at 1000 hard-to-diagnose spots, RCM might miss 9 BCCs. But it might say 128 spots are BCCs when they are not. Again, some of these could be melanoma.

We also saw that more experienced doctors might find cancers better with RCM. There was not enough data to say how well RCM finds cSCC.

So, there is not enough clear proof. We cannot say for sure that RCM is good enough. It might help avoid some biopsies for BCC. But we need more research. It is very important to know if RCM can mistake other cancers, like melanoma, for BCC. We also need to compare RCM to what doctors usually do. This includes using a dermoscope.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of reflectance confocal microscopy for the detection of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in adults? 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is on its own or compared to inspection of a skin lesion with the naked eye alone or using a hand‐held microscope called dermoscopy for diagnosing two common forms of keratinocyte skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in adults. Review authors in Cochrane included 10 studies to answer this question. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer. BCC and cSCC are usually localised skin cancers. Making the correct diagnosis is important because mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. A missed diagnosis of BCC (known as a false‐negative result) can result in the missed BCC growing and causing disfigurement. A missed diagnosis of cSCC is more serious as it could spread to other parts of the body. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary biopsy or treatment and can cause discomfort and worry to patients. 
What was studied in the review? 
Microscopic techniques are used by skin cancer specialists to provide a more detailed, magnified examination of suspicious skin lesions than can be achieved using the naked eye alone. Currently, dermoscopy is used by doctors as part of the examination of suspicious skin lesions. RCM is a new microscopic technique to increase the magnification. It is a hand‐held device or static unit using infrared light that can visualise deeper layers of the skin when compared with dermoscopy. Both techniques are painless procedures, but RCM is more expensive, time consuming, and requires additional specialised training. Dermoscopy can be used by general practitioners (GP) whereas RCM is likely to only be used by hospital specialists for people who have been referred with a skin lesion that is suspected to be a skin cancer. We wanted to see if RCM should be used instead of, or as well as, inspection of a skin lesion with the naked eye alone or using dermoscopy to diagnose BCC or cSCC. The accuracy of the test was looked at when used on people with any suspicious skin lesion and also in people with skin lesions that were tricky to diagnose. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 10 studies that included information on 11 groups of people with lesions suspicious for skin cancer. The main results were based on seven of the 11 sets of data: four in any lesion suspicious for skin cancer and three in particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions. 
For the comparison of RCM versus dermoscopy, we found four sets of data that included 912 suspicious skin lesions. The results suggested that in a group of 1000 people with any suspicious lesion, of whom 125 (12.5%) really do have BCC: 
‐ an estimated 139 people will have an RCM result indicating BCC is present;
‐ of these, 44 (32%) people will not have BCC (false‐positive results) including one person with a melanoma mistaken for a BCC; 
‐ of the 861 people with an RCM result indicating that BCC is not present, 30 (3%) will actually have BCC. 
The review also included three sets of data on people that had 668 particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions, one comparing RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that if RCM was to be used by skin specialists in a group of 1000 people, of whom 150 (15%) really do have BCC: 
‐ an estimated 269 people will have an RCM result indicating BCC is present;
‐ of these, 128 (48%) people will not have a BCC (known as a false‐positive result), including as many as 19 people with melanomas mistaken for BCCs; 
‐ of the 732 people with an RCM result indicating that BCC is not present, nine (1%) will actually have BCC. 
There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of RCM for the detection of cSCC in either population group. 
How reliable are the results of this review? 
There was a lot of variation in the results of the studies in this review. Poor reporting of study conduct made assessment of the reliability of studies difficult. It was unclear whether studies were representative of populations eligible for testing with RCM, and test interpretation was often undertaken using images, remotely from the patient and the interpreter blinded to clinical information that would normally be available in practice. Only one study compared the accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM. Most studies were conducted by specialist research teams with high levels of training and experience with RCM, meaning that RCM may appear better than it would be when used in everyday practice. Most studies reported diagnosis based on observers' subjective views, which might not be the same for people using the technique in everyday practice. In nine studies, the diagnosis of skin cancer was made by a skin biopsy or by following up those people over time to make sure they remained negative for skin cancer*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had skin cancer. In one study, the absence of skin cancer was made by experts looking at the skin, a method that may be less reliable for deciding whether patients really had skin cancer. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Five studies were carried out in Europe (61%), and the rest in Asia, Oceania, North America, or more than one continent. The average ages of people who took part ranged from 41 to 65 years. The percentage of people with BCC in these studies ranged from 6% to 83% (a middle value of 12% for any suspicious lesion and 15% for difficult to diagnose skin lesions). For studies of RCM used for cSCC, the percentage of people with cSCC ranged between 4% and 13%. In many studies it was not clear what tests people taking part had received before RCM. 
What are the implications of this review? 
There was not enough good evidence to support the use of RCM for the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC outside of research studies. There was a lot of variation and uncertainty in results and in the ways studies were carried out, reducing the reliability of findings. Using RCM might avoid the need for a diagnostic biopsy in people who see a doctor with a high suspicion of a BCC lesion, but more research is needed to confirm this. Such research should compare RCM to dermoscopy in well‐described groups of people with suspicious skin lesions and they must say whether other skin cancers end up being missed or being wrongly classified as BCC. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses).

Mechanical ventilation is a potentially painful and discomforting intervention that is widely used in neonatal intensive care. Newborn infants demonstrate increased sensitivity to pain, which may affect clinical and neurodevelopmental outcomes. The use of drugs that reduce pain might be important in improving survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of opioid analgesics for neonates (term or preterm) receiving mechanical ventilation compared to placebo or no drug, other opioids, or other analgesics or sedatives. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 9), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 29 September 2020); Embase (1980 to 29 September 2020); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 29 September 2020). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing opioids to placebo or no drug, to other opioids, or to other analgesics or sedatives in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. We excluded cross‐over trials. We included term (≥ 37 weeks' gestational age) and preterm (< 37 weeks' gestational age) newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. We included any duration of drug treatment and any dosage given continuously or as bolus; we excluded studies that gave opioids to ventilated infants for procedures. 
Data collection and analysis
For each of the included trials, we independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, types of opioids) using Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) criteria and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomisation, blinding, completeness of follow‐up). We evaluated treatment effects using a fixed‐effect model with risk ratio (RR) for categorical data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included 23 studies (enrolling 2023 infants) published between 1992 and 2019. Fifteen studies (1632 infants) compared the use of morphine or fentanyl versus placebo or no intervention. Four studies included both term and preterm infants, and one study only term infants; all other studies included only preterm infants, with five studies including only very preterm infants. We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) Scale in the first 12 hours after infusion (MD ‐5.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐6.88 to ‐4.59; 50 participants, 2 studies) and between 12 and 48 hours after infusion (MD ‐0.98, 95% CI ‐1.35 to ‐0.61; 963 participants, 3 studies) because of limitations in study design, high heterogeneity (inconsistency), and imprecision of estimates (very low‐certainty evidence ‐ GRADE). The use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing duration of mechanical ventilation (MD 0.23 days, 95% CI ‐0.38 to 0.83; 1259 participants, 7 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence because of unclear risk of bias in most studies) and neonatal mortality (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.55; 1189 participants, 5 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence because of imprecision of estimates). We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.39 to 10.29; 78 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence because of serious imprecision of the estimates and indirectness). Limited data were available for the other comparisons (i.e. two studies (54 infants) on morphine versus midazolam, three (222 infants) on morphine versus fentanyl, and one each on morphine versus diamorphine (88 infants), morphine versus remifentanil (20 infants), fentanyl versus sufentanil (20 infants), and fentanyl versus remifentanil (24 infants)). For these comparisons, no meta‐analysis was conducted because outcomes were reported by one study. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on pain and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months; the use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and neonatal mortality. Data on the other comparisons planned in this review (opioids versus analgesics; opioids versus other opioids) are extremely limited and do not allow any conclusions. In the absence of firm evidence to support a routine policy, opioids should be used selectively ‐ based on clinical judgement and evaluation of pain indicators ‐ although pain measurement in newborns has limitations.

## Plain Title: Pain Medicine for Babies on Breathing Machines

### Rationale

Being on a breathing machine can hurt and be uncomfortable for newborn babies. Babies feel pain more strongly than adults. This pain might affect how well they grow and develop. It could also impact if they survive.

Doctors wondered if pain medicines could help babies on breathing machines. These medicines might make them feel better. They might also help babies grow and develop well. This study looked at different pain medicines. It wanted to see if they helped babies.

### Trial Design

This study asked: ""How do pain medicines help babies on breathing machines?"" We looked at past studies that compared pain medicines. Some studies compared a pain medicine to no medicine. Other studies compared different pain medicines.

The babies in these studies were newborn infants. Some were born early (preterm). Others were born at full-term. They all needed a breathing machine. We looked at how long babies got the medicine. We also looked at the amount of medicine they got. We did not look at studies where babies got medicine only for a quick procedure.

### Results

We looked at 23 studies in total. These studies included over 2,000 babies. Most studies compared a pain medicine like morphine or fentanyl to no medicine.

We are not sure if pain medicines helped reduce pain scores in the first two days. This is because the studies had some problems. The results were not clear.

Morphine or fentanyl likely did not make babies spend less time on the breathing machine. It also likely did not change how many babies died. We are somewhat sure about these results.

We are also not sure if pain medicines helped with how babies developed later. This is because there was very little information on this.

We found very little information on other pain medicines. It was hard to compare them.

Overall, we are not sure if pain medicines help with pain or how babies develop. Morphine or fentanyl likely do not help babies come off breathing machines sooner. They also likely do not affect how many babies survive.

Doctors should use pain medicines carefully. They should decide based on each baby's needs. They should also look for signs of pain, even though it can be hard to measure pain in babies.","Opioids for newborns receiving mechanical ventilation
Review question 
Do drugs such as morphine and fentanyl (opioids) save lives, reduce pain, or improve the long‐term development of newborns needing breathing machines (mechanical ventilators)?Background 
Breathing machines are widely used for newborn full‐term (≥ 37 weeks' gestational age) and preterm (< 37 weeks' gestational age) babies with breathing problems. Breathing machines may cause babies pain. Moreover, their use requires the presence and suctioning of a tube placed in the baby's trachea (which connects the larynx to the bronchi of the lungs), thus causing additional pain and distress. Since newborn babies are very sensitive to pain, which may have a bad effect on future development, pain reduction with drugs (including opioids such as morphine and fentanyl) might be very important. Pain in babies is assessed by adults by using different scales, which focus on the baby's appearance and behaviour, and on other parameters. Study characteristicsWe collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found 23 studies enrolling 2023 babies. In most studies, babies were born before the due date (before 37 weeks' gestational age). Eight studies compared the use of morphine versus placebo (a substance with no therapeutic value) or no intervention, and seven versus fentanyl. We analysed the other studies separately because researchers compared the use of these two drugs with other opioids or other analgesics. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on pain and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months; use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and neonatal mortality. Further research is needed. 
Certainty of evidence 
The certainty of evidence is very low to moderate because overall only a small number of studies have looked at this intervention, few babies were included in these studies, and some studies could have been better designed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to 29 September 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013469.pub2,"Background
Abdominal aortic graft infections are a major complication following abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery, with high morbidity and mortality rates. They can be treated surgically or conservatively using medical management. The two most common surgical techniques are in situ replacement of the graft and extra‐anatomical bypass. Medical management most commonly consists of a course of long‐term antibiotics. There is currently no consensus on which intervention (extra‐anatomical bypass, in situ replacement, or medical) is the most effective in managing abdominal aortic graft infections. Whilst in emergency or complex situations such as graft rupture surgical management is the only option, in non‐emergency situations it is often personal preference that influences the clinician's decision‐making. 
Objectives
To assess and compare the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 2 December 2019. We also reviewed the bibliographies of the studies identified by the search and contacted specialists in the field and study authors to request information on any possible unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We aimed to include all randomised controlled trials that used surgical or medical interventions to treat abdominal aortic graft infections. The definitions of abdominal aortic graft infections were accepted as presented in the individual studies, and included secondary infection due to aortoenteric fistula. We excluded studies presenting data on prosthetic graft infections in general, unless data specific to abdominal aortic graft infections could be isolated. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed all studies identified by the search. We planned to independently assess risk of bias of the included trials and to evaluate the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our main outcomes were overall mortality, amputation, graft re‐infection, overall graft‐related complications, graft‐related mortality, acute limb ischaemia, and re‐intervention. 
Main results
We identified no randomised controlled trials to conduct meta‐analysis.
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions to support any treatment over the other. Multicentre clinical trials are required to compare different treatments for the condition.

## Plain Title: Better Treatment for Infected Aorta Grafts

### Rationale

Your aorta is a large blood vessel. It carries blood from your heart to your body. Sometimes, a part of the aorta can swell up. This is called an aneurysm. Doctors fix this with surgery. They put in a man-made tube, called a graft. This graft helps blood flow well.

But sometimes, this graft can get infected. This is a very serious problem. It can make people very sick. It can even cause death. Doctors want to know the best way to treat these infections.

Right now, doctors use two main ways to treat an infected graft. One way is more surgery. Doctors can replace the infected graft. Or they can make a new path for blood flow. The other way is medicine. Patients take strong medicine, often for a long time.

Doctors do not agree on which treatment works best. If the graft bursts, surgery is the only choice. But often, it's not an emergency. Then, doctors pick what they like best. This study wants to find out which treatment is truly better. This will help doctors make the best choice for patients.

### Trial Design

This study looked for all good research. We wanted to find studies that tested treatments for infected grafts. These studies needed to compare different treatments. We looked for studies where people were put into treatment groups by chance. This helps make sure the groups are fair.

We searched many health databases. These are like big libraries of medical papers. We looked for studies up to December 2, 2019. We also checked other study lists. We even asked experts and study authors for any hidden facts.

We wanted studies that treated infected grafts in the belly. We included studies where the infection caused other problems. We did not include studies about all graft infections. We only wanted studies about the aorta in the belly.

Two people checked all the studies we found. They made sure the studies fit our rules. If a study was good, we planned to check how well it was done. We would also look at how strong the results were.

We planned to look at many things. We wanted to see how many people died. We looked at if people lost a limb. We also looked at if the graft got infected again. We checked for other problems with the graft. We looked at if the graft caused death. We also checked for blood flow problems in the leg. And we looked if more surgery was needed.

### Results

We looked for all studies that met our rules. We wanted studies that compared treatments. But we did not find any such studies. We found no studies where people were put into treatment groups by chance.

This means we could not compare the different treatments. We could not say if one treatment was better than another.

Because of this, we cannot say which treatment is best right now. We need more research. Doctors need to do big studies with many patients. These studies need to compare the different treatments. This will help us find the best way to help people with infected aorta grafts.","Surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections
Background 
Abdominal aortic graft infections are a serious complication following aortic aneurysm surgery. They can be managed in two ways: either with surgery or medical management. Surgery is currently the mainstay of treatment and is usually performed by two methods, one of which involves removing and replacing the infected graft, and the other bypassing the infected graft. Medical management commonly involves a long‐term course of antibiotics. Medical management avoids the risk of potential complications of surgery, but requires use of antibiotics for several months, or even lifelong. There is currently no agreement on which intervention (surgical or medical) is the most effective in managing abdominal aortic graft infections. In emergency or complex situations such as graft rupture, surgical management is the only option, whilst for those unfit for surgery, medical management is the preferred option. However, in non‐emergency situations, it is often personal preference that influences the healthcare provider's decision‐making. This review aimed to assess and compare the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) to December 2019. We found no trials that met our inclusion criteria. Hence there is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions relating to the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. 
Conclusion 
Multicentre randomised controlled trials are required to identify the most effective method of treating aortic graft infection. By doing this, 'gold standard' guidelines can be formulated so that all patients can receive the same level of treatment without regard for where they are being treated.

Severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The definitive management for severe AS is aortic valve replacement (AVR). The choice of transcatheter approach versus open‐heart surgery for AVR in people with severe AS and low surgical risk remains a matter of debate. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in people with severe AS and low surgical risk. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 29 April 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We searched all databases from inception to present and imposed no restriction on language or date of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs that compared TAVI and SAVR in adults (18 years of age or older) with severe AS and low surgical risk. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias in the studies included. We analysed dichotomous data using the risk ratio (RR) and continuous data using the mean difference (MD), with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Our outcomes of interest were assessed in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow‐up). Primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, stroke, and rehospitalisation. Secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac death, length of hospital stay (LOS), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, new‐onset atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury (AKI), and any bleeding. 
Main results
We identified four studies (13 reports), with 2818 participants, and one ongoing study. Overall certainty of evidence ranged from high to very low. 
There is probably little or no difference between TAVI and SAVR for the following short‐term outcomes: all‐cause mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.44; SAVR 11 deaths per 1000, TAVI 8 deaths per 1000 (95% CI 4 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25; SAVR 21 strokes per 1000, TAVI 16 strokes per 1000 (95% CI 9 to 27); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); MI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.58; SAVR 14 MI per 1000, TAVI 11 MI per 1000 (95% CI 6 to 21); 2748 participants; 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); and cardiac death (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.56; SAVR 10 cardiac deaths per 1000, TAVI 7 cardiac deaths per 1000 (95% CI 3 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
TAVI may reduce the risk of short‐term rehospitalisation, although the confidence interval also includes the possibility of no difference in risk between groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06; SAVR 30 cases per 1000, TAVI 19 cases per 1000 (95% CI 12 to 32); 2468 participants; 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
TAVI, compared with SAVR, probably increases the risk of PPM implantation (RR 3.65, 95% CI 1.50 to 8.87; SAVR 47 per 1000, TAVI 170 cases per 1000 (95% CI 70 to 413); number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 7; 2683 participants; 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the LOS in days, although it appears to be associated with shorter LOS. 
TAVI, compared with SAVR, reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.30; 2683 participants; 3 studies), AKI (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.58; 2753 participants; 4 studies), and bleeding (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62; 2753 participants; 4 studies) (all high‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Our meta‐analysis indicates that, in the short term, TAVI probably has little or no mortality difference compared to SAVR for severe AS in individuals with low surgical risk. Similarly, there is probably little or no difference in risk of stroke, MI, and cardiac death between the two approaches. TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation, but we are uncertain about the effects on LOS. TAVI reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation, AKI, and bleeding. However, this benefit is offset by the increased risk of PPM implantation. Long‐term follow‐up data are needed to further assess and validate these outcomes, especially durability, in the low surgical risk population. 
","**Plain Title: Heart Valve Fix: Key Choices for Low-Risk Patients**

**Rationale**

Your heart has valves that help blood flow the right way. Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a serious problem. It happens when the aortic valve gets stiff and narrow. This makes it hard for blood to flow out of your heart. It can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and feeling tired. It can even be deadly if not treated.

Doctors can fix this with a new valve. This is called aortic valve replacement (AVR). There are two main ways to do this. One way is open-heart surgery (SAVR). The other is a less invasive method (TAVI). This method uses a thin tube to put in the new valve.

For people who are very sick, TAVI is often the better choice. But for people who are not at high risk for surgery, it's not clear which method is best. This study wanted to find out. It looked at the good and bad points of TAVI versus SAVR. We want to help patients and doctors make the best choice.

**Trial Design**

This study looked at other studies that were done before. These studies were called randomized controlled trials (RCTs). That means people were put into groups by chance. One group got TAVI. The other group got SAVR. This helps us see if one method is better than the other.

We looked at studies with adults. These were people 18 years and older. They all had severe aortic valve stenosis. They were also healthy enough for surgery. This means they had a low surgical risk.

The studies looked at what happened to people in the short term. This was during their hospital stay and up to 30 days after the procedure. We wanted to see how many people died or had problems. We also looked at things like how long people stayed in the hospital. We checked for new heart issues or if they needed to come back to the hospital.

**Results**

We found four main studies to look at. These studies included over 2800 people. We also found one study that is still going on.

For a short time after the procedure, both TAVI and SAVR seemed much the same for some serious things. This includes:

*   **Death:** About 8 out of 1000 people who had TAVI died. About 11 out of 1000 people who had SAVR died. This is a very small difference.
*   **Stroke:** About 16 out of 1000 people who had TAVI had a stroke. About 21 out of 1000 people who had SAVR had a stroke. This difference is also small.
*   **Heart Attack:** About 11 out of 1000 people who had TAVI had a heart attack. About 14 out of 1000 people who had SAVR had a heart attack. Again, this is a small difference.
*   **Heart-related Death:** About 7 out of 1000 people who had TAVI died from heart problems. About 10 out of 1000 people who had SAVR died from heart problems. This is also very close.

TAVI might help people stay out of the hospital. Out of 1000 people, about 19 who had TAVI came back to the hospital. About 30 who had SAVR came back.

But TAVI also has some downsides. People who had TAVI were more likely to need a pacemaker. A pacemaker helps your heart beat steady. For every 1000 people, about 170 who had TAVI needed a pacemaker. Only about 47 who had SAVR needed one.

On the good side, TAVI greatly reduced other risks. It lowered the chance of:

*   **Irregular Heartbeat:** This is when your heart beats too fast or too slow.
*   **Kidney Problems:** This is when your kidneys don't work well.
*   **Bleeding:** This is when you lose too much blood.

We are not sure if TAVI makes your hospital stay shorter. But it looks like it might.

In short, for people with low surgical risk, both TAVI and SAVR are safe options. They have similar risks for death, stroke, and heart attack in the short term. TAVI can help avoid some issues like bleeding or an irregular heartbeat. But it does raise the chance of needing a pacemaker. More studies are needed to see how these methods work over many years.","Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement in people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk 
Review question 
Does transcatheter approach, compared to open‐heart surgery, for aortic valve replacement improve outcomes in people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk? 
Background 
Aortic stenosis (AS) is the narrowing of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins). It typically gets worse over time. Its severity can be divided into mild, moderate, severe, and very severe; and it is distinguishable by ultrasound scan of the heart and other clinical features. Once it has become severe, treatment primarily involves surgery to replace the valve. An alternative approach is to use transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This approach improves outcomes in individuals who are inoperable or at a high to intermediate risk for surgery. However, it remains unclear if TAVI is beneficial to those who have severe AS and are at a low surgical risk. 
Search Date 
The evidence is current to April 2019. We searched the literature and found a total of 3092 citations that were potentially relevant. After reviewing each of these, we found 13 published articles describing four clinical trials that could help us answer our question. 
Study characteristics 
The four clinical trials included 2818 participants who were randomly allocated to undergo either TAVI or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The trials were multicentre and took place in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the USA, Denmark, and Sweden. 
Key Results 
Moderate‐certainty evidence from clinical trials shows that, in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow‐up), there is probably little or no difference between TAVI compared with SAVR in risk of death due to any cause, stroke (insult to the brain), myocardial infarction (injury or death of heart muscle), or death due to cardiac causes (e.g. myocardial infarction or failure of the heart muscle pump). Low‐certainty evidence shows that TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation compared with SAVR. We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the length of hospital stay, although it appears to be associated with shorter duration of hospitalisation. High‐certainty evidence shows that fewer people had atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heart rhythm), acute kidney injury (insult to the kidney), and bleeding when they underwent TAVI, compared with SAVR. However, moderate‐certainty evidence shows that TAVI probably increases the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (a device that is placed to artificially set the heart rhythm), compared with SAVR. 
Quality of the evidence 
We consider the overall quality of evidence to be moderate for most relevant outcomes (death, stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and risk of permanent pacemaker implantation), with the exception of rehospitalisation (low‐quality evidence) and length of hospital stay (very low quality evidence). The evidence for atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and bleeding was of high quality.

Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease. People with asthma have inflammation of their airways that causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness and chest tightness, with or without a cough. Statins possess multiple therapeutic effects, including lowering lipid levels in the blood. Statins are reported to have a potential role as an adjunct treatment in asthma. However, comprehensive evidence of the benefits and harms of using statins is required to facilitate decision making. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of statins as an adjunct therapy for asthma in adults and children. 
Search methods
We searched for studies in the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid SP and Embase Ovid SP, from their inception dates We handsearched the proceedings of major respiratory conferences. We also searched clinical trials registries for completed, ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews to identify additional studies. 
The search is current to 7 February 2020.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel‐group design that assessed statins for at least 12 weeks' duration. We considered all participants with a clinical diagnosis of asthma to be eligible, regardless of age, sex, disease severity and previous or current treatment. We planned to include studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened and selected the studies, extracted outcome data and intervention characteristics from included studies, and assessed risk of bias according to standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We resolved any disagreement through discussion. 
Main results
We found only one trial involving a total of 60 people living with asthma. The trial compared the effect of atorvastatin with a placebo (dummy treatment containing lactose) in treating people with chronic asthma. The trial did not report data for the primary outcomes or adverse events. There was uncertainty about the relative effect on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in the atorvastatin group compared with the placebo group. The study did not report serious adverse effects for the interventions. The included study had internal discrepancies in its reported data. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence was of very low certainty, so we are unable to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of statins to treat asthma. High‐quality RCTs are needed to assess the effect of statins on people with asthma. Well‐designed multicentre trials with larger samples and longer duration of treatment are required, which assess outcomes such as adverse events, hospital utilisation and costs, to provide better quality evidence. Future studies that include subgroups of obese people with asthma are also required. 
","## A New Look at Statins for Asthma

### Rationale

Asthma is a common lung problem. It causes swelling in the air tubes that makes breathing hard. People with asthma often cough, wheeze, and feel tight in their chest. This can make daily life hard for them.

Statins are a type of medicine. They are known for lowering fats in the blood. Some people think statins might also help with asthma. We wanted to see if statins could be a useful extra treatment for asthma.

We needed clear proof about how statins help or harm people with asthma. This study aimed to find that proof.

### Trial Design

This study looked at how studies were designed. We searched for studies that compared statins to a dummy pill. These studies had to be well-designed, called ""randomized controlled trials.""

We looked for studies that gave statins for at least 12 weeks. People of all ages could be in these studies. This included children and adults. We looked at people with asthma, no matter how bad their asthma was.

We wanted to find out if statins helped asthma. We also wanted to know if they caused any bad effects. We planned to include any study we could find, even if it was just an abstract.

### Results

We found only one study. This study included 60 people with asthma. It tested atorvastatin against a sugar pill.

The study did not tell us key facts. It did not say if statins helped main asthma symptoms. It also did not report any bad side effects. We could not tell if statins made breathing better. We did not know if statins caused any serious problems. The study also had some parts that did not add up.

We cannot say if statins work for asthma. We also cannot say if they are safe. We need more and better studies. Future studies should be bigger and last longer. They should also look at things like hospital visits and costs. We also need to study people with asthma who are overweight.","Statins for asthma
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of statins in people with asthma.
Background 
Asthma is a common chronic (persistent) airway disease. Asthma is caused by inflammation in the lungs and bronchoconstriction (tightening of the small tubes in the lungs in response to a trigger such as pollen or cold air). Inflammation and bronchoconstriction cause airflow obstruction (narrowing and blockage). People with asthma experience recurrent attacks of wheezing, difficultly in breathing, and chest tightness, with or without a cough. 
Statins are anti‐inflammatory medicines. We wanted to review the evidence for statins because the theory is that their anti‐inflammatory properties will help people with asthma. We wanted to discover whether using statin therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care alone or different types of statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin). 
Study characteristics 
We found only one trial that assessed atorvastatin (a type of statin drug) and placebo (dummy treatment) in 60 adults with asthma over a period of 12 weeks. These people had chronic asthma (persistent airway disease) when they started treatment. 
Key results 
We found that the statin (atorvastatin) did not result in any clear improvement in lung function in people with asthma, but may be better in asthma control than the dummy drug. However, because there is only one trial, we cannot draw firm conclusions. 
The trial did not report on adverse effects or severe adverse effects (harms). We are uncertain whether statins may  have beneficial effects on relieving asthma or whether they may increase the risk of adverse events or non‐serious adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low certainty, so we cannot draw firm conclusions about whether statins are helpful and safe to be used by people with asthma. 
The evidence is current to 7 February 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD007077.pub4,"Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer
What is the issue? 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer that women get.
Women with early breast cancer who choose to keep their breast need to have radiotherapy (RT) as well as surgery to remove the cancer to make sure it does not regrow in the breast. RT is treatment with high energy x‐rays. Having RT for breast cancer usually means 15 to 30 visits to the RT department, five times per week. 
If breast cancer does regrow in the same breast (called local recurrence), it tends to come back in the area it was removed from. Women can also grow a new cancer (new 'elsewhere primary') in another part of the same breast. We are not sure if the RT given to stop cancer regrowth where the first cancer was, stops the growth of 'elsewhere primaries.' 
Why does it matter? 
We always want to treat the smallest area we can with RT because this means fewer side effects. Treating only part of the breast could mean that RT might be able to be used again in another part of the same breast if needed. New ways of giving RT mean that treating part of the breast can be done with fewer treatments. This is likely to be easier for women and cost less money. 
What did we compare? 
We asked if giving RT to part of the breast (called partial breast irradiation (PBI)) is as good as giving RT to the whole breast. PBI can be given with a shortened treatment duration (called accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)). 
For this treatment to be acceptable, it would need to control the cancer as well as giving RT to the whole breast does. It would also be important that the PBI gives about the same side effects and breast appearance as treating the whole breast. 
What did we find? 
We found nine studies, which involved 15,187 women. Our evidence is current to 27 August 2020. Local recurrence is probably slightly more common with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence) and the breast appearance (scored by doctors and nurses) was probably worse with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence). There is probably little difference in survival (high‐quality evidence). Late radiation fibrosis (change in breast appearance and feel) is probably increased with APBI/PBI. There are probably few differences in breast cancer‐related deaths and spread of breast cancer around the body with the use of APBI/PBI. The use of APBI/PBI makes little difference to how many women need mastectomy (removal of the whole breast) because of unacceptable late side effects or local recurrence. 
What do our findings mean? 
This means that at the moment, PBI does not give the same cancer control in the breast as treating the whole breast, but the difference is small. It may cause worse side effects. There are seven big ongoing studies that will be important to answer this question. We hope to have a clearer answer in the next update of this review.

## Plain Title
New Ways to Treat Breast Cancer with X-rays

## Rationale
Breast cancer is a very common type of cancer for women. After surgery to take out the cancer, women often get x-ray treatment. This is to stop the cancer from growing back in the breast.

X-ray treatment often means many visits to the hospital. This can be hard for women. It also takes a lot of time.

Doctors want to treat only the part of the breast that needs it. This can mean fewer trips to the hospital. It also means fewer side effects. This study looked at new ways to do x-ray treatment. We wanted to see if treating part of the breast works as well as treating the whole breast.

## Trial Design
This study looked at other studies that were already done. These studies compared two ways of giving x-ray treatment. One way treats the whole breast. The other way treats only a part of the breast. This is called partial breast x-ray treatment (PBI). A faster way to give PBI is called accelerated partial breast x-ray treatment (APBI).

We wanted to know if PBI/APBI works as well as treating the whole breast. We looked at how well it stopped the cancer. We also looked at side effects. And we checked how the breast looked after treatment.

We looked at studies with many women. All women had early breast cancer. The studies looked at what happened to them after treatment. We checked studies up to August 27, 2020.

## Results
We found nine studies to look at. These studies included 15,187 women. We learned a few things from these studies.

Cancer growing back in the same spot was a bit more common with PBI/APBI. Also, doctors and nurses said the breast might look worse with PBI/APBI. But how long women lived was about the same for both types of treatment. This is good news.

PBI/APBI might cause more changes to how the breast feels or looks later on. This is called fibrosis. But cancer spreading to other parts of the body was about the same. Also, the number of women who needed to have their whole breast removed was about the same.

Right now, treating only part of the breast may not stop the cancer quite as well as treating the whole breast. But the difference is small. It might also cause a few more side effects. There are more studies being done now. They will give us a clearer answer soon.","Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer

Hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a leading cause of mortality and long‐term neurological sequelae, affecting thousands of children worldwide. Current therapies to treat HIE are limited to cooling. Stem cell‐based therapies offer a potential therapeutic approach to repair or regenerate injured brain tissue. These preclinical findings have now culminated in ongoing human neonatal trials. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of stem cell‐based interventions for the treatment of hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in newborn infants. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 8 June 2020), Embase (1980 to 8 June 2020), and CINAHL (1982 to 8 June 2020). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials and cluster trials comparing 1) stem cell‐based interventions (any type) compared to control (placebo or no treatment); 2) use of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) of type (e.g. number of doses or passages) or source (e.g. autologous versus allogeneic, or bone marrow versus cord) versus MSCs of other type or source; 3) use of stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of type (e.g. mononuclear cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, neural stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and inducible pluripotent stem cells) or source (e.g. autologous versus allogeneic, or bone marrow versus cord) versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of other type or source; or 4) MSCs versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs. 
Data collection and analysis
For each of the included trials, two authors independently planned to extract data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, type and source of MSCs or other stem cell‐based interventions) and assess the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomisation, blinding, completeness of follow‐up). The primary outcomes considered in this review are all‐cause neonatal mortality, major neurodevelopmental disability, death or major neurodevelopmental disability assessed at 18 to 24 months of age. We planned to use the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
Our search strategy yielded 616 references. Two review authors independently assessed all references for inclusion. We did not find any completed studies for inclusion. Fifteen RCTs are currently registered and ongoing. We describe the three studies we excluded. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently no evidence from randomised trials that assesses the benefit or harms of stem cell‐based interventions for the prevention of morbidity and mortality following hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy in newborn infants.

### Plain Title
Studying Stem Cells for Brain Injury in Babies

### Rationale
Some babies have a brain injury at birth. This injury is called HIE. It happens when their brain does not get enough oxygen. This can cause very serious problems. Some babies may not live. Others may have problems with their brain. These problems can last their whole life.

Right now, doctors can cool the baby down. This helps protect the brain. But we need better ways to treat HIE. Scientists are looking at stem cells. Stem cells are special cells. They can grow into many kinds of cells. They might help fix injured brain tissue. They could also help new brain tissue grow. This study wants to see if stem cells can help babies with HIE.

### Trial Design
This study looked at other studies. We wanted to find studies about stem cells. These studies would be for babies with HIE. We looked for studies that randomly put babies into groups. Some babies would get stem cells. Other babies would not.

We looked for studies that compared different kinds of stem cells. We also looked at how they were given. We wanted to see if stem cells are safe. We also wanted to see if they work. We planned to look at certain things. This included if babies lived. We also looked at how their brains developed. We checked this when they were 1.5 to 2 years old.

### Results
We looked at over 600 studies. But we did not find any finished studies. No studies had results yet. There are 15 studies happening now. These studies are looking at stem cells for HIE. But their results are not ready.

So, we cannot say yet. We do not know if stem cells help babies with HIE. We also do not know if they are safe. More research is needed. We need to wait for the results of these new studies. This will help us learn more.","Stem cell‐based therapies following poor brain oxygenation at birth (hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy) in newborns 
Review question 
Do stem cell‐based therapies save the lives, or improve the long‐term development, of newborns who have poor brain oxygenation at birth ('hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy')? 
Background 
Lack of oxygen at birth may damage the brain of the newborn. Babies with less severe brain damage may make a full recovery or only have mild problems. For other babies with more serious damage, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. For instance, some of these babies develop cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, or other problems. We currently have  only cooling as an approach to treat this condition. The aim of this review was to assess if stem cell‐based therapies could reduce death and improve the long‐term development of newborns with poor brain oxygenation at birth. During stem cell‐based therapy, stem cells are given to the baby, for instance through injections. These stem cells may have come from humans or animals and may have been taken from cord blood, bone marrow or other parts of the body. These cells then repair the brain cells that the lack of oxygen has damaged. 
Key results 
We were not able to include any studies in our review. We identified three potential studies, but we excluded them due to the way they were designed which meant that their results could not answer our review question (phase 1 studies). Fifteen studies are ongoing. 
How up to date is this review? 
We searched for studies that were available up to June 2020.

Melanoma accounts for a small proportion of all skin cancer cases but is responsible for most skin cancer‐related deaths. Early detection and treatment can improve survival. Smartphone applications are readily accessible and potentially offer an instant risk assessment of the likelihood of malignancy so that the right people seek further medical attention from a clinician for more detailed assessment of the lesion. There is, however, a risk that melanomas will be missed and treatment delayed if the application reassures the user that their lesion is low risk. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone applications to rule out cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in adults with concerns about suspicious skin lesions. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design evaluating smartphone applications intended for use by individuals in a community setting who have lesions that might be suspicious for melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants versus a reference standard of histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up and expert opinion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). Due to scarcity of data and poor quality of studies, we did not perform a meta‐analysis for this review. For illustrative purposes, we plotted estimates of sensitivity and specificity on coupled forest plots for each application under consideration. 
Main results
This review reports on two cohorts of lesions published in two studies. Both studies were at high risk of bias from selective participant recruitment and high rates of non‐evaluable images. Concerns about applicability of findings were high due to inclusion only of lesions already selected for excision in a dermatology clinic setting, and image acquisition by clinicians rather than by smartphone app users. 
We report data for five mobile phone applications and 332 suspicious skin lesions with 86 melanomas across the two studies. Across the four artificial intelligence‐based applications that classified lesion images (photographs) as melanomas (one application) or as high risk or 'problematic' lesions (three applications) using a pre‐programmed algorithm, sensitivities ranged from 7% (95% CI 2% to 16%) to 73% (95% CI 52% to 88%) and specificities from 37% (95% CI 29% to 46%) to 94% (95% CI 87% to 97%). The single application using store‐and‐forward review of lesion images by a dermatologist had a sensitivity of 98% (95% CI 90% to 100%) and specificity of 30% (95% CI 22% to 40%). 
The number of test failures (lesion images analysed by the applications but classed as 'unevaluable' and excluded by the study authors) ranged from 3 to 31 (or 2% to 18% of lesions analysed). The store‐and‐forward application had one of the highest rates of test failure (15%). At least one melanoma was classed as unevaluable in three of the four application evaluations. 
Authors' conclusions
Smartphone applications using artificial intelligence‐based analysis have not yet demonstrated sufficient promise in terms of accuracy, and they are associated with a high likelihood of missing melanomas. Applications based on store‐and‐forward images could have a potential role in the timely presentation of people with potentially malignant lesions by facilitating active self‐management health practices and early engagement of those with suspicious skin lesions; however, they may incur a significant increase in resource and workload. Given the paucity of evidence and low methodological quality of existing studies, it is not possible to draw any implications for practice. Nevertheless, this is a rapidly advancing field, and new and better applications with robust reporting of studies could change these conclusions substantially.

## Plain Title: Do Phone Apps Help Find Skin Cancer?

### Rationale

Skin cancer is a big worry for many people. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer. It is not common, but it causes most deaths from skin cancer. Finding melanoma early can save lives.

Many people use phone apps. Some apps say they can check moles or skin spots. They might tell you if a spot is risky. This could help you see a doctor faster.

But there is a risk. What if the app says your spot is safe, but it is actually melanoma? This could cause a big delay in getting help. It is very important to get a correct answer.

This study looked at how well phone apps find melanoma. We wanted to see if these apps are good enough to help people. We wanted to know if they miss dangerous spots.

### Trial Design

This study asked: ""How good are phone apps at finding melanoma?""

We looked at many research studies. We searched large medical databases. We looked for studies about phone apps. These apps were for people worried about skin spots. The studies checked the apps against a doctor's diagnosis. This diagnosis was based on lab tests or a doctor's expert opinion.

We looked at how these apps worked. We checked if they could tell bad spots from safe ones. We focused on apps used by regular people. We did not just look at apps used by doctors. We wanted to see if the apps could help people decide to see a doctor.

### Results

We found two studies. These studies looked at five different phone apps. They checked a total of 332 skin spots. Among these spots, 86 were melanoma.

Four of these apps used ""artificial intelligence."" This means a computer program checked the pictures of skin spots. These apps did not do well. They missed many melanomas. Some apps found as few as 7 out of 100 melanomas. Even the best one found only 73 out of 100. This means many melanomas were missed. They also often said a safe spot was risky.

One app worked differently. You sent a picture of your spot to a skin doctor. The doctor then looked at it. This app found almost all melanomas (98 out of 100). But it also said many safe spots were risky. This could make many people go to the doctor when they do not need to.

Many times, the apps could not even read the pictures. They called these ""unevaluable."" This happened for up to 18 out of 100 spots. Even some melanomas were called ""unevaluable.""

In short, the computer-based apps are not good enough yet. They miss too many melanomas. This could be dangerous. The app where a doctor checks the picture is better. But it might make doctors too busy.

We need more good studies. This field is changing fast. Better apps might come out soon. But right now, we cannot say these apps are safe to use for checking skin spots.","How accurate are smartphone applications ('apps') for detecting melanoma in adults?
What is the aim of the review? 
We wanted to find out how well smartphone applications can help the general public understand whether their skin lesions might be melanoma. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of malignant melanoma skin cancer important? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. Not recognising a melanoma (a false negative test result) could delay seeking appropriate advice and surgery to remove it. This increases the risk of the cancer spreading to other organs in the body and possibly causing death. Diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not present (a false positive result) may cause anxiety and lead to unnecessary surgery and further investigations. 
What was studied in the review? 
Specialised applications ('apps') that provide advice on skin lesions or moles that might cause people concern are widely available for smartphones. Some apps allow people to photograph any skin lesion they might be worried about and then receive guidance on whether to get medical advice. Apps may automatically classify lesions as high or low risk, while others can act as store‐and‐forward devices where images are sent to an experienced professional, such as a dermatologist, who then makes a risk assessment based on the photo. Cochrane researchers found two studies, evaluating five apps that used automated analysis of images and one that used a store‐and‐forward approach, to evaluate suspicious skin lesions. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included two studies with 332 lesions, including 86 melanomas, analysed by at least one smartphone application. Both studies used photographs of moles or skin lesions that were about to be removed because doctors had already decided they could be melanomas. The photographs were taken by doctors instead of people taking pictures of their lesions with their own smartphones. For these reasons, we are not able to make a reliable estimate about how well the apps actually work. 
Four apps that produce an immediate (automated) assessment of a skin lesion or mole that has been photographed by the smartphone missed between 7 and 55 melanomas. 
One app that sends the photograph of a mole or skin lesion to a dermatologist for assessment missed only one melanoma. Another 6 melanomas examined by the dermatologist via the application were not classified as high risk; instead the dermatologist was not able to classify the lesion as either 'atypical' (possibly a melanoma) or 'typical' (definitely not a melanoma). 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The small number and poor quality of included studies reduces the reliability of findings. The people included were not typical of those who would use the applications in real life. The final diagnosis of melanoma was made by histology, which is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had melanoma*. However, the studies excluded between 2% and 18% of images because the applications failed to produce a recommendation. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies took place in the USA and Germany. They did not report key patient information such as age and gender. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma was 18% and 35%, much higher than that observed in community settings. The definition of eligible patients was narrow in comparison to likely users of the applications. The photographs used were taken by doctors rather than by smartphone users, which seriously impacts the applicability of results. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Current smartphone applications using automated analysis are observed to have a high chance of missing melanomas (false negatives). Store‐and‐forward image applications could have a potential role in the timely identification of people with potentially malignant lesions by facilitating early engagement of those with suspicious skin lesions, but they have resource and workload implications. 
The development of applications to help identify people who might have melanoma is a fast‐moving field. The emergence of new applications, higher quality and better reported studies could change the conclusions of this review substantially. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies biopsy was the reference standard (means of establishing final diagnoses).

10.1002-14651858.CD013157.pub2,"Background
The prevalence of non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life expectancy and increases risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the requirement for liver transplantation. Uncertainty surrounds relative benefits and harms of various nutritional supplements in NAFLD. Currently no nutritional supplement is recommended for people with NAFLD. 
Objectives
• To assess the benefits and harms of different nutritional supplements for treatment of NAFLD through a network meta‐analysis• To generate rankings of different nutritional supplements according to their safety and efficacy 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until February 2021 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with NAFLD. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) for people with NAFLD, irrespective of method of diagnosis, age and diabetic status of participants, or presence of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. 
Data collection and analysis
We performed a network meta‐analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods whenever possible and calculated differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available‐case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. 
Main results
We included in the review a total of 202 randomised clinical trials (14,200 participants). Nineteen trials were at low risk of bias. A total of 32 different interventions were compared in these trials. A total of 115 trials (7732 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The remaining trials did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. 
Follow‐up ranged from 1 month to 28 months. The follow‐up period in trials that reported clinical outcomes was 2 months to 28 months. During this follow‐up period, clinical events related to NAFLD such as mortality, liver cirrhosis, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver‐related mortality were sparse. 
We did not calculate effect estimates for mortality because of sparse data (zero events for at least one of the groups in the trial). None of the trials reported that they measured overall health‐related quality of life using a validated scale. The evidence is very uncertain about effects of interventions on serious adverse events (number of people or number of events). 
We are very uncertain about effects on adverse events of most of the supplements that we investigated, as the evidence is of very low certainty. However, people taking PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) may be more likely to experience an adverse event than those not receiving an active intervention (network meta‐analysis results: OR 4.44, 95% CrI 2.40 to 8.48; low‐certainty evidence; 4 trials, 203 participants; direct evidence: OR 4.43, 95% CrI 2.43 to 8.42). People who take other supplements (a category that includes nutritional supplements other than vitamins, fatty acids, phospholipids, and antioxidants) had higher numbers of adverse events than those not receiving an active intervention (network meta‐analysis: rate ratio 1.73, 95% CrI 1.26 to 2.41; 6 trials, 291 participants; direct evidence: rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.25 to 2.40; low‐certainty evidence). 
Data were sparse (zero events in all groups in the trial) for liver transplantation, liver decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. So, we did not perform formal analysis for these outcomes. The evidence is very uncertain about effects of other antioxidants (antioxidants other than vitamins) compared to no active intervention on liver cirrhosis (HR 1.68, 95% CrI 0.23 to 15.10; 1 trial, 99 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
The evidence is very uncertain about effects of interventions in any of the remaining comparisons, or data were sparse (with zero events in at least one of the groups), precluding formal calculations of effect estimates. 
Data were probably because of the very short follow‐up period (2 months to 28 months). It takes follow‐up of 8 to 28 years to detect differences in mortality between people with NAFLD and the general population. Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in clinical outcomes are noted in trials providing less than 5 to 10 years of follow‐up. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about effects of nutritional supplementation compared to no additional intervention on all clinical outcomes for people with non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease. 
Accordingly, high‐quality randomised comparative clinical trials with adequate follow‐up are needed. We propose registry‐based randomised clinical trials or cohort multiple randomised clinical trials (study design in which multiple interventions are trialed within large longitudinal cohorts of patients to gain efficiencies and align trials more closely to standard clinical practice) comparing interventions such as vitamin E, prebiotics/probiotics/synbiotics, PUFAs, and no nutritional supplementation. The reason for the choice of interventions is the impact of these interventions on indirect outcomes, which may translate to clinical benefit. Outcomes in such trials should be mortality, health‐related quality of life, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and resource utilisation measures including costs of intervention and decreased healthcare utilisation after minimum follow‐up of 8 years (to find meaningful differences in clinically important outcomes). 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title: Do vitamins and other supplements help people with fatty liver disease?

### Rationale

Many people have a health problem called non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease, or NAFLD. This means too much fat builds up in their liver. NAFLD can make people sick. It can cause serious liver problems, like scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) or liver cancer. In some cases, people with NAFLD need a new liver. This disease can make people's lives shorter.

Many people wonder if taking extra vitamins or other supplements might help with NAFLD. Doctors do not yet know if these supplements work. There are no clear rules about which ones might be helpful. This study looked at many past studies to see if any supplements could treat NAFLD. We wanted to find out which supplements were safe and which ones helped.

### Trial Design

This study asked, ""How is this study designed?"" We looked at many past studies. These were special studies called ""randomized clinical trials."" In these studies, some people get a supplement, and others get no treatment or a fake pill. This helps us see if the supplement truly makes a difference.

We searched many health databases for these past studies. We looked for studies that included people with NAFLD. It did not matter how old they were, if they had diabetes, or how their NAFLD was found. We did not include studies where people had a liver transplant before. We wanted to find out the good and bad effects of different supplements.

We included 202 past studies with 14,200 people. Some studies followed people for as little as 1 month. Some followed them for as long as 28 months. Most studies followed people for a short time, from 2 to 28 months.

### Results

""What were the main results of the study?"" We looked at a lot of information from 202 past studies. These studies looked at 32 different kinds of supplements.

We found that we are not sure if most supplements help people with NAFLD. The studies did not give us clear answers about serious problems like death, liver damage, or liver cancer. This is because these problems did not happen often during the short time people were watched in the studies. It can take many years for these serious liver problems to show up. The studies were too short to see if supplements made a difference for these very serious issues.

We also looked at side effects. Some types of fat supplements, called PUFA, might cause more side effects. People taking other types of supplements also had more side effects. However, we are not very sure about these results.

**What we learned:** We do not have clear proof that any nutritional supplements help people with NAFLD. We also do not know much about their side effects. This means we need more and better studies. Future studies need to follow people for a much longer time. They should also look at important things like how long people live, their quality of life, and the cost of care. These new studies will help us find out if supplements truly make a difference for people with NAFLD.","Nutritional supplementation for people with non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease
What is the aim of this Cochrane Review?To find out if any form of nutritional supplementation decreases effects of non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease on lifespan, health‐related quality of life, chronic liver disease, and its complications, and whether nutritional supplementation causes any harm. 
Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an accumulation of fat in the liver of people who have no history of significant alcohol consumption, use of medicines, disease such as hepatitis C virus infection, or other conditions such as starvation that can damage the liver. Fatty liver can lead to liver damage resulting in inflammation (non‐alcohol‐related steatohepatitis, or NASH) or liver scarring (liver cirrhosis). Various medical treatments have been tried for treatment of NAFLD. However, no current evidence suggests that any of them work. Nutritional supplementation has the potential to decrease liver damage, but whether this occurs is currently unclear. The authors of this review collected and analysed all relevant randomised clinical trials with the aim of finding out what is the best treatment. They found 202 randomised clinical trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups). During analysis of data, review authors used standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time. In addition, review authors used advanced techniques that allow comparison of multiple treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network (or indirect) meta‐analysis'). 
Date of literature searchFebruary 2021. 
Key messagesOnly 19 trials were at low risk of bias, and because of this, uncertainty about the findings of this review is considerable. Studies that reported clinically important liver damage or its complications studied participants for a period of 2 months to 28 months. During this period, clinically important outcomes related to NAFLD such as death, liver‐related complications such as liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver decompensation (complications caused by scarring of the liver), liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), and death due to liver disease were rare, even without any treatment. No evidence suggests that any nutritional supplementation decreased these. A possible reason for complications of liver disease being rare in trial participants may be the short follow‐up period given in these trials (participants were followed only for a period of 2 months to 28 months). Liver‐related complications due to NAFLD develop over 8 to 28 years. Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in clinical outcomes can be noted in trials with less than 5 to 10 years of follow‐up. 
What was studied in the Review?This Review looked at people of any sex, age, and ethnic origin, with non‐alcohol‐related liver disease. Review authors excluded studies of people with previous liver transplantation. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 7 to 61 years. Participants were given different treatments including various vitamins and other nutritional supplements. Review authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death, quality of life, serious and non‐serious adverse events, severe liver damage, complications resulting from severe liver damage, liver cancer, and death due to liver damage ('clinical outcomes').What were the main results of the Review?The 202 studies included 14,200 participants. Study data were sparse. In all, 115 studies with 7732 participants provided data for analyses. Follow‐up of trial participants ranged from 1 month to 28 months (2 months to 28 months for trials that reported clinical outcomes). The Review shows the following.‐ The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about effects of interventions on all clinical outcomes.‐ Well‐designed trials that collect data over longer follow‐up times are needed in the future to find out the best nutritional supplementation (if any) for people with NAFLD.

### Plain Title

**Best Antibiotics for Lung Infection in Adults**

### Rationale

Pneumonia is a bad lung infection. It makes it hard to breathe. Doctors give medicine called antibiotics to treat it.

Some germs cause this lung infection. We call them ""typical"" or ""atypical."" Doctors usually give antibiotics that fight both kinds of germs. This is because it is hard to know which germ causes the infection.

Many guidelines say to treat for both types of germs. But we need to know if this is truly needed. We want to see if treating ""atypical"" germs makes a difference. This study looks at if these extra antibiotics help sick people. It also looks at how safe these medicines are.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. These studies checked different antibiotic treatments. They compared antibiotics that fight ""atypical"" germs to those that do not.

The studies only included adults in the hospital. These adults had lung infections. They got the infection outside of the hospital.

We looked at 28 studies. These studies had almost 6,000 patients. We wanted to see how well the medicines worked. We also looked at how safe they were.

### Results

We looked at how many people died. We also looked at how well they got better. The study found no real help from medicines that fight ""atypical"" germs. People got better the same amount.

Side effects happened in both groups. There was no big difference in how often side effects happened. Few people had to stop treatment due to side effects.

But, people who took antibiotics for ""atypical"" germs had fewer stomach problems. This means less upset stomach or diarrhea.

This review looked at many past studies. Some studies were open-label. This means doctors and patients knew what medicine they were taking. Many studies were also paid for by drug companies. This could affect the results.

In conclusion, giving extra antibiotics for ""atypical"" germs did not improve outcomes. It did not help people get better or live longer.","Initial antibiotic treatment for coverage of 'atypical' pathogens for community‐acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults

Germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage (GMH‐IVH) remains a substantial issue in neonatal intensive care units worldwide. Current therapies to prevent or treat GMH‐IVH are limited. Stem cell‐based therapies offer a potential therapeutic approach to repair, restore, and/or regenerate injured brain tissue. These preclinical findings have now culminated in ongoing human neonatal studies. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of stem cell‐based interventions for prevention or treatment of germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage (GM‐IVH) in preterm infants. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 1), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 7 January 2019); Embase (1980 to 7 January 2019); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 7 January 2019). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We attempted to identify randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials, and cluster trials comparing (1) stem cell‐based interventions versus control; (2) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of type or source versus MSCs of other type or source; (3) stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of type or source versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of other type or source; or (4) MSCs versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs. For prevention studies, we included extremely preterm infants (less than 28 weeks' gestation), 24 hours of age or less, without ultrasound diagnosis of GM‐IVH; for treatment studies, we included preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation), of any postnatal age, with ultrasound diagnosis of GM‐IVH. 
Data collection and analysis
For each of the included trials, two review authors independently planned to extract data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, type and source of MSCs, other stem cell‐based interventions) and assess the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomisation, blinding, completeness of follow‐up). Primary outcomes considered in this review are all‐cause neonatal mortality, major neurodevelopmental disability, GM‐IVH, and extension of pre‐existing non‐severe GM‐IVH. We planned to use the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
Our search strategy yielded 769 references. We did not find any completed studies for inclusion. One randomised controlled trial is currently registered and ongoing. Five phase 1 trials are described in the excluded studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently no evidence is available to show the benefits or harms of stem cell‐based interventions for treatment or prevention of GM‐IVH in preterm infants.

### Plain Title
Looking at Stem Cells to Help Babies' Brains

### Rationale
Some babies are born too early. They can get a bleed in their brain. This bleed is called GMH-IVH. It can cause big problems for the baby. There are not many good ways to stop or treat this bleed right now.

Stem cells are special cells. They can fix damaged parts of the body. They might help repair brain tissue that is hurt. This study wants to see if stem cells can prevent or treat this brain bleed in tiny babies. We need to know if they are safe and helpful.

### Trial Design
This study looks at other studies that have been done. We want to find studies that gave stem cells to very tiny babies. These babies were born before 28 weeks. They were less than a day old. They did not have the brain bleed yet.

We also looked for studies that gave stem cells to babies born before 37 weeks. These babies already had the brain bleed. We wanted to see if the stem cells helped them. We looked at how many babies died. We also looked at if they had problems with their brain growth. We checked if the bleed got worse. We looked for any bad effects from the stem cells.

### Results
We looked at many studies. We found 769 studies that might be about this topic. But we did not find any studies that were finished. No studies have given us clear answers yet.

One study is happening right now. Five other small studies have been done. But they were just testing how safe the stem cells were. They were not looking at if they worked.

Right now, we do not know if stem cells help or hurt babies with this brain bleed. We need more studies to find this out.","Stem cell‐based therapies for bleeding to the brain (germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage) in newborns born preterm 
Review question 
Do stem cell‐based therapies save the lives or improve the long‐term development of preterm newborns who have or may develop bleeding to the brain (""germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage"")? 
Background 
Newborns born too early (""preterm""), especially babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, sometimes develop bleeding to the brain. Babies with less severe bleeding may make a full recovery or may have only mild problems. For other babies with more serious bleeding, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. For instance, some of these babies develop cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, or other problems. Currently no approaches are available to prevent or treat this condition.   
The aim of this review was to assess whether stem cell‐based therapies could reduce death and improve the long‐term development of newborns born too early. During cell stem‐based therapy, stem cells are given to the baby, for instance, through injection. These stem cells may have come from humans or animals and may have been taken from cord blood, bone marrow, or other parts of the body. These cells then repair the brain cells that have been damaged by bleeding.

We were not able to include any studies in our review. We did identify five studies, but we excluded them because of the way they were designed, which meant that their results could not answer our review question (all were ""phase 1"" studies).   
We searched for studies that were available up to 7 January 2019.

10.1002-14651858.CD013285.pub2,"Background
There are many accepted airway clearance techniques (ACTs) for managing the respiratory health of people with cystic fibrosis (CF); none of which demonstrate superiority. Other Cochrane Reviews have reported short‐term effects related to mucus transport, but no evidence supporting long‐term benefits. Exercise is an alternative ACT thought to produce shearing forces within the lung parenchyma, which enhances mucociliary clearance and the removal of viscous secretions. 
Recent evidence suggests that some people with CF are using exercise as a substitute for traditional ACTs, yet there is no agreed recommendation for this. Additionally, one of the top 10 research questions identified by people with CF is whether exercise can replace other ACTs. 
Systematically reviewing the evidence for exercise as a safe and effective ACT will help people with CF decide whether to incorporate this strategy into their treatment plans and potentially reduce their treatment burden. The timing of this review is especially pertinent given the shifting landscape of CF management with the advent of highly‐effective small molecule therapies, which are changing the way people with CF are cared for. 
Objectives
To compare the effect of exercise to other ACTs for improving respiratory function and other clinical outcomes in people with CF and to assess the potential adverse effects associated with this ACT. 
Search methods
On 28 February 2022, we searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
We searched online clinical trial registries on 15 February 2022.
We emailed authors of studies awaiting classification or potentially eligible abstracts for additional information on 1 February 2021. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled studies (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing exercise to another ACT in people with CF for at least two treatment sessions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for the included studies. They assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Review authors contacted investigators for further relevant information regarding their publications. 
Main results
We included four RCTs. The 86 participants had a wide range of disease severity (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ranged from 54% to 95%) and were 7 to 41 years old. Two RCTs were cross‐over and two were parallel in design. Participants in one RCT were hospitalised with an acute respiratory exacerbation, whilst the participants in three RCTs were clinically stable. All four RCTs compared exercise either alone or in combination with another ACT, but these were too diverse to allow us to combine results. The certainty of the evidence was very low; we downgraded it due to low participant numbers and high or unclear risks of bias across all domains. 
Exercise versus active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) 
One cross‐over trial (18 participants) compared exercise alone to ACBT. There was no change from baseline in our primary outcome FEV1, although it increased in the exercise group before returning to baseline after 30 minutes; we are unsure if exercise affected FEV1 as the evidence is very low‐certainty. Similar results were seen for other measures of lung function. No adverse events occurred during the exercise sessions (very low‐certainty evidence). We are unsure if ACBT was perceived to be more effective or was the preferred ACT (very low‐certainty evidence). 24‐hour sputum volume was less in the exercise group than with ACBT (secondary outcome). Exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics were not reported. 
Exercise plus postural drainage and percussion (PD&P) versus PD&P only 
Two trials (55 participants) compared exercise and PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial narratively reported a greater increase in FEV1 % predicted with PD&P alone. At six months, the other trial reported a greater increase with exercise combined with PD&P, but did not provide data for the PD&P group. We are uncertain whether exercise with PD&P improves FEV1 as the certainty of evidence is very low. Other measures of lung function did not show clear evidence of effect. One trial reported no difference in exercise capacity (maximal work rate) after two weeks. No adverse events were reported (1 trial, 17 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Adherence was high, with all PD&P sessions and 96% of exercise sessions completed (1 trial, 17 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There was no difference between groups in 24‐hour sputum volume or in the mean duration of hospitalisation, although the six‐month trial reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Quality of life, ACT preference and need for antibiotics were not reported. 
Exercise versus underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP) 
One trial (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group (very low‐certainty evidence). Trial investigators reported that participants perceived exercise as more fatiguing but also more enjoyable than bubble PEP (very low‐certainty evidence). There were no differences found in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The trial did not report the primary outcomes (FEV1, quality of life, exercise capacity) or the secondary outcomes (other measures of lung function, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations). 
Authors' conclusions
As one of the top 10 research questions identified by clinicians and people with CF, it is important to systematically review the literature regarding whether or not exercise is an acceptable and effective ACT, and whether it can replace traditional methods. We identified an insufficient number of trials to conclude whether or not exercise is a suitable alternative ACT, and the diverse design of included trials did not allow for meta‐analysis of results. The evidence is very low‐certainty, so we are uncertain about the effectiveness of exercise as an ACT. Longer studies examining outcomes that are important to people with CF are required to answer this question. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study:

### **Plain Title: Can Exercise Help People with Cystic Fibrosis Breathe Better?**

### **Rationale**

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a serious illness. It causes thick mucus to build up in the lungs. This mucus makes it hard to breathe. It also causes bad lung infections. People with CF need treatments to clear this mucus. These treatments are called airway clearance techniques (ACTs). They help move the mucus out of the lungs. Many different ACTs exist. But no one ACT is clearly better than others.

Exercise might be a good way to clear mucus. When people exercise, their lungs move a lot. This movement may help break up and remove the thick mucus. Some people with CF already use exercise. They think it helps them breathe better. They wonder if exercise can replace other ACTs. Replacing other ACTs could make their daily routine easier. It could also save them time.

Doctors and people with CF want to know more about exercise. They want to know if it is safe. They also want to know if it works as well as other ACTs. This study helps answer these important questions. It looks at all the past research on exercise for CF. This information can help people with CF choose their best treatment plan. New medicines for CF are changing care. So it is a good time to look at all treatment options.

### **Trial Design**

This study looked at other studies. It gathered and reviewed studies about exercise for CF. The goal was to see if exercise helps people with CF. It also looked for any bad effects from exercise.

The study searched for research done up to February 2022. It looked in big health databases. It also checked journals and reports from meetings. The study included studies where people were randomly put into groups. One group used exercise. The other group used a different ACT. All studies had to compare treatments for at least two sessions.

Two people independently checked all the studies. They pulled out the important facts. They also checked if the studies were well-designed. They wanted to make sure the results were fair. Sometimes, they asked the original researchers for more details.

The studies included people with CF. They ranged from 7 to 41 years old. Some had mild CF. Others had more severe CF.

### **Results**

This study found four useful research studies. These studies included 86 people with CF. The people had different levels of CF. Some were in the hospital. Others were stable at home.

The studies looked at exercise in different ways. Some compared exercise alone to another ACT. Others combined exercise with another ACT. Because the studies were so different, we could not combine all their results.

The evidence from these studies was not very strong. There were too few people in the studies. Also, some studies had flaws in their design. This means we are not very sure about the findings.

One study compared exercise to a breathing technique (ACBT). It found no clear change in lung function. Exercise made one measure of lung function go up for a short time. But it went back down quickly. No one had bad side effects during exercise. Another study found that exercise made people produce less mucus in 24 hours.

Two studies looked at exercise combined with another technique (PD&P). One study suggested that PD&P alone might be better. Another study suggested that exercise with PD&P was better after six months. But it did not give all the needed information. We are not sure if exercise with PD&P helps lung function. No bad side effects were reported.

One study compared exercise to a different breathing device (uPEP). No one had bad side effects in either group. People thought exercise was more tiring. But they also liked it more than the device. There was no difference in the amount of mucus collected.

In short, there were not enough good studies. The studies we found were too different. So, we cannot say for sure if exercise is a good ACT for CF. We do not know if it can replace other treatments. We need more and better studies. These new studies should look at things that matter most to people with CF.","Exercise versus airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
Can exercise replace other methods of airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? 
Background 
CF affects many systems in the body, mainly the respiratory system. It causes a build‐up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs which causes irritation and damage to the lining of the airways. CF treatment involves chest physiotherapy, also called airway clearance, which uses a range of devices or techniques to get rid of this mucus. It has been suggested that exercise may have a similar effect. Exercising results in a person taking different volumes and depths of breaths. This leads to pressure changes and forces within the airways that move secretions out of the lungs. We compared the effect on lung function of exercise versus other techniques, to see if exercise is a suitable alternative for people with CF. We wanted to answer our review question to potentially reduce their treatment burden. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 15 February 2022.
Study characteristics 
We searched the literature for studies where people received at least two treatment sessions of exercise or another airway clearance technique, and report on four studies including 86 people with CF in the review. The people in the studies were aged between 7 and 41 years and had varying degrees of disease severity. Three studies included people who were clinically well and one study included people admitted to hospital for a chest infection. The studies lasted between four days and six months and compared exercise (alone or in combination with another airway clearance technique) to other techniques. Two studies compared exercise with postural drainage and percussion (PD&P), one study compared exercise with the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) and one study compared exercise with underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP), also known as bubble PEP. Three studies received financial support from funding bodies such as the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, the Buffalo Foundation and the Romanian National Council for Scientific Research in Higher Education. 
Key results 
We did not find enough evidence to conclude whether or not exercise can replace other methods of airway clearance. We did not find any evidence to suggest that exercise was either better or worse than other methods to improve lung function or clear mucus from the airways, although exercising did improve people's exercise ability, and it was the preferred choice of treatment in one study. None of the studies reported any negative effects of exercise therapy. None of the studies evaluated quality of life or the need for extra antibiotic treatment. One study did suggest that exercise alone was less effective at clearing sputum than ACBT. 
Exercise versus ACBT 
One study (18 participants) found that a measure of lung function temporarily (up to 30 minutes) increased in the exercise group only, otherwise there was no difference between the ACBT or the exercise group. No adverse events were reported, and it is not certain if ACBT was thought to be more effective or was preferred. The exercise group produced less sputum than the ACBT group. The study did not report on exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics. 
Exercise plus PD&P versus PD&P alone 
Two studies (55 participants) compared exercise plus PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial described a greater increase in lung function with PD&P alone, while at six months the second study reported a greater increase with exercise plus PD&P (but did not provide data for the PD&P group). One study reported no side effects at all, and also reported no difference between groups in exercise capacity (maximal work rate), sputum volume or the average length of time spent in hospital. Conversely, the second study reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Neither study reported on quality of life, preference and the need for antibiotics. 
Exercise versus uPEP 
One study (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group and investigators reported that those taking part thought that, while exercise was more tiring, it was also more enjoyable than bubble PEP. We found no differences in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The study did not report on lung function, quality of life, exercise capacity, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Overall, we had very little confidence in the evidence because all four studies had few participants and two studies only presented results as a shortened report given at a conference.  
We do not think the fact that participants and people measuring the outcomes knew which treatment the participants were receiving influenced the results of outcomes such as lung function and sputum weight. We do not think the fact that these studies were financed should influence the interpretation of the results in this review.

10.1002-14651858.CD011716.pub2,"Use of oxygen during activities for people with lung scarring conditions
Review question 
Should oxygen be used for people with lung scarring conditions, known as interstitial lung disease (ILD), whose oxygen levels drop when they exercise? 
Background 
Many people with ILD have a drop in their oxygen levels when they are moving about. This is because of their lung scarring. Oxygen can be given, to be used only when people are moving about, to prevent this drop. This is called ambulatory oxygen. This may help to improve symptoms of breathlessness and their ability to exercise. It may also improve their quality of life. This Cochrane review examined the evidence for any effect of ambulatory oxygen on the ability to exercise, breathlessness and quality of life. Cochrane researchers searched the available evidence up to 4th May 2016. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We included only three studies, which had a total of 98 participants with ILD. All three studies compared the effects of both oxygen and air in all participants while they did an exercise test, while preventing them from knowing which treatment they were being given. Two studies showed no helpful effects on the ability to exercise or on symptoms of breathlessness. One study showed that participants could exercise for longer with oxygen. None of these studies looked at the effect of oxygen on quality of life, survival, the cost of oxygen treatment or its effects on hospital admissions. No adverse events were reported in any of the studies. 
We also looked for studies of oxygen given after exercise in people with ILD (""short burst oxygen""), but did not find any studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
There were some problems with the way these studies were conducted. The included studies were small. Also, two studies did not make sure that the amount of oxygen given was enough to prevent a drop in oxygen levels when the participants were exercising. This could mean that they were not given enough oxygen. The overall quality of evidence in this review was low. 
Conclusions 
We cannot tell from these studies if ambulatory oxygen is helpful in people with ILD. More research is needed, which should look at the effect of ambulatory oxygen on exercise, breathlessness and also on quality of life in people with ILD. 
","**Plain Title: Oxygen Use for People with Scarred Lungs**

**Rationale**

Many people have a health problem called interstitial lung disease (ILD). This means their lungs have scars. These scars make it hard for their lungs to work well. When people with ILD move or exercise, their oxygen levels can drop. This drop in oxygen can make them feel out of breath. It can also make it hard to do daily tasks. They may not be able to exercise much. This can also make their lives less enjoyable.

Some doctors think giving oxygen during movement might help. This is called ""ambulatory oxygen."" People would only use this oxygen when they are moving. This could stop their oxygen levels from dropping. It might help them feel less out of breath. It could also help them exercise more. This might make their lives better. This study looked at past research. It wanted to see if ambulatory oxygen helps people with ILD.

**Trial Design**

This study looked at other studies. It asked, ""How is this study designed?"" The goal was to find out if ambulatory oxygen works. The researchers looked for studies up to May 2016. They only included studies about people with ILD. All participants in these studies had scarred lungs. Their oxygen levels dropped when they moved.

The researchers found only three studies. These studies had a total of 98 people. All people in these studies used both oxygen and regular air. They used them during an exercise test. The people did not know if they were getting oxygen or air. This helped make sure the results were fair. The studies did not say how long each person was in the study.

**Results**

The main question was, ""What were the main results of the study?"" These studies had mixed results. Two of the studies found no real help. They did not show that oxygen helped people exercise more. They also did not show that oxygen made people feel less out of breath.

But, one study did find a benefit. It showed that people could exercise longer with oxygen. None of these studies looked at how oxygen affected their daily life. They did not check how long people lived. They also did not look at the cost of oxygen. They did not check if oxygen stopped people from going to the hospital. No one in any study reported bad effects from the oxygen.

The quality of the proof was low. This means we cannot be sure about the results. The studies were small. Also, two studies did not give enough oxygen. The oxygen given might not have been enough to stop oxygen levels from dropping.

So, we cannot say for sure if oxygen helps people with ILD. We need more research. Future studies should look at exercise and breathing. They should also check how oxygen affects a person's quality of life.","Use of oxygen during activities for people with lung scarring conditions

10.1002-14651858.CD015061,"Background
Individuals dying of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) may experience distressing symptoms such as breathlessness or delirium. Palliative symptom management can alleviate symptoms and improve the quality of life of patients. Various treatment options such as opioids or breathing techniques have been discussed for use in COVID‐19 patients. However, guidance on symptom management of COVID‐19 patients in palliative care has often been derived from clinical experiences and guidelines for the treatment of patients with other illnesses. An understanding of the effectiveness of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological palliative interventions to manage specific symptoms of COVID‐19 patients is required. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in individuals with COVID‐19. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), medRxiv); Web of Science Core Collection (Science Citation Index Expanded, Emerging Sources); CINAHL; WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease; and COAP Living Evidence on COVID‐19 to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions until 23 March 2021. 
We screened the reference lists of relevant review articles and current treatment guidelines for further literature. 
Selection criteria
We followed standard Cochrane methodology as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 
We included studies evaluating palliative symptom management for individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID‐19 receiving interventions for palliative symptom control, with no restrictions regarding comorbidities, age, gender, or ethnicity. Interventions comprised pharmacological as well as non‐pharmacological treatment (e.g. acupressure, physical therapy, relaxation, or breathing techniques). We searched for the following types of studies: randomized controlled trials (RCT), quasi‐RCTs, controlled clinical trials, controlled before‐after studies, interrupted time series (with comparison group), prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies, (nested) case‐control studies, and cross‐sectional studies. 
We searched for studies comparing pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control with standard care. 
We excluded studies evaluating palliative interventions for symptoms caused by other terminal illnesses. If studies enrolled populations with or exposed to multiple diseases, we would only include these if the authors provided subgroup data for individuals with COVID‐19. We excluded studies investigating interventions for symptom control in a curative setting, for example patients receiving life‐prolonging therapies such as invasive ventilation.  
Data collection and analysis
We used a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for non‐randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) to assess bias in the included studies. We included the following outcomes: symptom relief (primary outcome); quality of life; symptom burden; satisfaction of patients, caregivers, and relatives; serious adverse events; and grade 3 to 4 adverse events. 
We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
As meta‐analysis was not possible, we used tabulation to synthesize the studies and histograms to display the outcomes.  
Main results
Overall, we identified four uncontrolled retrospective cohort studies investigating pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in hospitalized patients and patients in nursing homes. None of the studies included a comparator. We rated the risk of bias high across all studies. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary outcome symptom relief, downgrading mainly for high risk of bias due to confounding and unblinded outcome assessors. 
Pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control 
We identified four uncontrolled retrospective cohort studies (five references) investigating pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control. Two references used the same register to form their cohorts, and study investigators confirmed a partial overlap of participants. We therefore do not know the exact number of participants, but individual reports included 61 to 2105 participants. Participants received multimodal pharmacological interventions: opioids, neuroleptics, anticholinergics, and benzodiazepines for relieving dyspnea (breathlessness), delirium, anxiety, pain, audible upper airway secretions, respiratory secretions, nausea, cough, and unspecified symptoms.  
Primary outcome: symptom relief 
All identified studies reported this outcome. For all symptoms (dyspnea, delirium, anxiety, pain, audible upper airway secretions, respiratory secretions, nausea, cough, and unspecified symptoms), a majority of interventions were rated as completely or partially effective by outcome assessors (treating clinicians or nursing staff). Interventions used in the studies were opioids, neuroleptics, anticholinergics, and benzodiazepines.  
We are very uncertain about the effect of pharmacological interventions on symptom relief (very low‐certainty evidence). The initial rating of the certainty of evidence was low since we only identified uncontrolled NRSIs. Our main reason for downgrading the certainty of evidence was high risk of bias due to confounding and unblinded outcome assessors. We therefore did not find evidence to confidently support or refute whether pharmacological interventions may be effective for palliative symptom relief in COVID‐19 patients. 
Secondary outcomes 
We planned to include the following outcomes: quality of life; symptom burden; satisfaction of patients, caregivers, and relatives; serious adverse events; and grade 3 to 4 adverse events. 
We did not find any data for these outcomes, or any other information on the efficacy and safety of used interventions. 
Non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control 
None of the identified studies used non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control. 
Authors' conclusions
We found very low certainty evidence for the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom relief in COVID‐19 patients. We found no evidence on the safety of pharmacological interventions or efficacy and safety of non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in COVID‐19 patients. The evidence presented here has no specific implications for palliative symptom control in COVID‐19 patients because we cannot draw any conclusions about the effectiveness or safety based on the identified evidence. More evidence is needed to guide clinicians, nursing staff, and caregivers when treating symptoms of COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. Specifically, future studies ought to investigate palliative symptom control in prospectively registered studies, using an active‐controlled setting, assess patient‐reported outcomes, and clearly define interventions. 
The publication of the results of ongoing studies will necessitate an update of this review. The conclusions of an updated review could differ from those of the present review and may allow for a better judgement regarding pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in COVID‐19 patients.

## Helping Patients with COVID-19 Feel Better

### Rationale

When people get very sick with COVID-19 and are near the end of their lives, they can have hard symptoms. They might feel short of breath, confused, or in pain. These problems make life hard for them.

Doctors and nurses want to help these patients feel more comfortable. This help is called ""palliative care."" It is about making people feel better, not curing the illness.

For a long time, we did not have clear rules for helping COVID-19 patients. Doctors often used ideas from treating other sicknesses. But we need to know what really works for COVID-19 patients. We need to find out if medicines or other treatments truly help them feel better and are safe.

This study wanted to find out what treatments help sick COVID-19 patients. It looked at both medicines and things like breathing exercises. We wanted to see if these treatments really ease their tough symptoms.

### Trial Design

This study was a big review. It looked at many other studies that had already been done. Think of it like a librarian gathering all the books on one topic. We looked for studies about sick COVID-19 patients.

The study included people of all ages and genders. They all had COVID-19. We looked for studies about treatments that made them feel better. These treatments could be medicines, like pain relievers, or other things, like deep breathing.

We looked for all kinds of studies. Some were simple reports, and others were more planned. We did not set a time limit for how long people were in the studies. We just wanted to see what was tried and if it helped. We searched many places, even new studies not yet fully published.

We did not look at studies that tried to cure COVID-19. We focused only on making patients more comfortable. If a study had people with other sicknesses, we only looked at the COVID-19 patients.

### Results

We found four studies that looked at medicines for sick COVID-19 patients. These studies were not perfectly designed. They did not compare the medicines to a dummy pill or another treatment. This means we cannot be sure if the medicines worked because of the medicine itself or for other reasons.

The studies looked at drugs like strong pain pills (opioids) or medicines for confusion (neuroleptics). They aimed to help with shortness of breath, confusion, worry, pain, cough, and other issues. In these studies, doctors and nurses said that the medicines often helped a lot or a little.

But we are *very unsure* about these results. The studies had problems. They did not compare people who got medicine to people who did not. And the people who said if the treatments worked knew what medicines the patients were getting. This makes the results less clear.

Because of these problems, we cannot say for sure if these medicines are helpful or not. We also did not find any studies about how safe these medicines were for COVID-19 patients. We did not find any studies about treatments that were *not* medicines, like breathing exercises.

This means we still need more and better studies. Doctors and nurses need clear proof to know the best way to help COVID-19 patients feel better when they are very sick. New studies should be designed more carefully. They should compare treatments and ask patients how they feel.","Which treatments are best for symptoms in COVID‐19 patients at the end of life?
The burden of symptoms at the end of life of COVID‐19 patients and helpful treatments 
COVID‐19 patients may show symptoms such as breathlessness or delirium at the end of life. The goal of palliative medicine is to relieve such symptoms with specific treatments. Treatments can be drugs, for example opioids, or non‐drugs, such as breathing techniques or relaxation.  
What was the aim of our review? 
To explore how well different interventions (drugs and non‐drugs) work for the treatment of palliative symptoms in COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. We included patients of all ages and with all comorbidities (additional medical conditions).  
What type of studies did we search for? 
We searched selected medical databases and trial registries until 23 March 2021. We included studies looking at how well different palliative treatments work to relieve COVID‐19‐associated symptoms at the end of life. We wanted to compare studies investigating different medicines or therapies, but we only found studies without a comparison group. Only one study reported the specific drugs used for individual symptoms. 
Key results 
We found four studies that were published in five papers. Individual papers included between 61 and 2105 participants, and two papers partially reported on the same participants. All of the included studies investigated different drug treatments for palliative symptom management in people with COVID‐19. 
Drugs for symptom control at the end of life 
All of the included studies reported on the effectiveness of palliative care for symptom relief. In all studies, clinicians or nursing staff rated symptom relief rather than the patients themselves. Since the quality of the evidence was very low, we do not know the true effect of drug treatments on symptom relief and have very low confidence in the results of the studies. We did not find any data on quality of life; symptom burden; satisfaction of patients, caregivers, and relatives; or safety of the drug treatments. 
Non‐drug therapies for symptom control at the end of life 
We did not find any data on the benefits and harms of non‐drug therapies for symptom control of COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. 
Conclusions 
Based on our findings, we could not draw any conclusions on palliative symptom control of people with COVID‐19. Future studies need to be designed better so that we can determine which treatments work for symptom control in people with COVID‐19.

Endotracheal intubation is a commonly performed procedure in neonates, the risks of which are well‐described. Some endotracheal tubes (ETT) are equipped with a cuff that can be inflated after insertion of the ETT in the airway to limit leak or aspiration. Cuffed ETTs have been shown in larger children and adults to reduce gas leak around the ETT, ETT exchange, accidental extubation, and exposure of healthcare workers to anesthetic gas during surgery. With improved understanding of neonatal airway anatomy and the widespread use of cuffed ETTs by anesthesiologists, the use of cuffed tubes is increasing in neonates. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of cuffed ETTs (inflated or non‐inflated) compared to uncuffed ETTs for respiratory support in neonates.

We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, and CINAHL on 20 August 2021; we also searched trial registers and checked reference lists to identify additional studies.

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster‐randomized trials comparing cuffed (inflated and non‐inflated) versus uncuffed ETTs in newborns. We sought to compare 1. inflated, cuffed versus uncuffed ETT; 2. non‐inflated, cuffed versus uncuffed ETT; and 3. inflated, cuffed versus non‐inflated, cuffed ETT. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. Two review authors independently assessed studies identified by the search strategy for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We identified one eligible RCT for inclusion that compared the use of cuffed (inflated if ETT leak greater than 20% with cuff pressure 20 cm H2O or less) versus uncuffed ETT. The author provided a spreadsheet with individual data. Among 76 infants in the original manuscript, 69 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this Cochrane Review. We found possible bias due to lack of blinding and other bias. 
We are very uncertain about frequency of postextubation stridor, because the confidence intervals (CI) of the risk ratio (RR) were very wide (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.35 to 5.25; risk difference (RD) 0.03, −0.11 to 0.18; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No neonate was diagnosed with postextubation subglottic stenosis; however, endoscopy was not available to confirm the clinical diagnosis. 
We are very uncertain about reintubation for stridor or subglottic stenosis because the CIs of the RR were very wide (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.49; RD −0.03, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.05; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No neonate had surgical intervention (e.g. endoscopic balloon dilation, cricoid split, tracheostomy) for stridor or subglottic stenosis (1 study, 69 participants). 
Neonates randomized to cuffed ETT may be less likely to have a reintubation for any reason (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.45; RD −0.39, 95% CI −0.57 to −0.21; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome 3, 95% CI 2 to 5; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
We are very uncertain about accidental extubation because the CIs of the RR were wide (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.12 to 5.46; RD −0.01, 95% CI −0.12 to 0.10; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
We are very uncertain about all‐cause mortality during initial hospitalization because the CIs of the RR were extremely wide (RR 2.46, 95% CI 0.10 to 58.39; RD 0.03, 95% CI −0.05 to 0.10; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
There is one ongoing trial. We classified two studies as awaiting classification because outcome data were not reported separately for newborns and older infants. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence for comparing cuffed versus uncuffed ETTs in neonates is limited by a small number of babies in a single RCT with possible bias. There is very low certainty evidence for all outcomes of this review. CIs of the estimate for postextubation stridor were wide. No neonate had clinical evidence for subglottic stenosis; however, endoscopy results were not available to assess the anatomy. 
Additional RCTs are necessary to evaluate the benefits and harms of cuffed ETTs (inflated and non‐inflated) in the neonatal population. These studies must include neonates and be conducted both for short‐term use (in the setting of the operating room) and chronic use (in the setting of chronic lung disease) of cuffed ETTs. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study:

### Using Cuffed Breathing Tubes for Babies

**Rationale**

Babies often need a breathing tube placed in their windpipe. This is called intubation. It helps them breathe. It can also have some risks.

Some breathing tubes have a small balloon, called a cuff. This cuff can be filled with air. It helps the tube fit tightly. It stops air from leaking out. It also helps prevent fluid from going into the lungs.

In older kids and adults, cuffed tubes work well. They lead to fewer tube changes. They also help prevent the tube from coming out by accident.

Doctors are now using cuffed tubes more often in babies. We need to know if these tubes are safe and helpful for tiny babies.

**Trial Design**

This study looked at how different breathing tubes worked in newborns. It compared tubes with a cuff to tubes without a cuff.

Researchers searched for studies that were like a fair coin toss. This means babies had an equal chance to get either type of tube. They wanted to see the good and bad points of each tube.

The study looked at how babies did after getting the tube. They also looked at if the tube caused any problems.

They gathered information from one study that included 69 babies. These babies were newborns. They needed help breathing. The study looked at them during their hospital stay.

**Results**

This study found very little sure evidence. Only one small study was found.

We are not sure about how often babies got a raspy voice after the tube was taken out. This is called stridor.

No babies in the study got a serious narrowing in their windpipe. This is called subglottic stenosis. But doctors could not check inside the windpipe to be sure.

Babies with cuffed tubes might have needed the tube put back in less often. This was for any reason. But we are not very sure about this.

We are also not sure about how often tubes came out by accident.

We are very unsure about the risk of death for babies in the hospital. This is because the numbers were too wide to be certain.

More studies are needed to learn about cuffed tubes in babies. We need more research to know if they are truly better or safer.","Cuffed versus uncuffed endotracheal tubes for neonates
Background: newborn babies rarely need a tube placed in the windpipe; however, this may occur before a procedure or to help with breathing. The tube may or may not have a cuff. The standard of care in newborn babies is a tube without a cuff. Cuffed tubes are used more frequently in older babies and children to reduce leaks of gas around the tube, the risk of aspiration (breathing food, saliva, or stomach contents into the airways or lungs), the need to change the tube, or the tube coming out. 
Review question: in this review, we evaluated the evidence for or against using a cuffed tube in newborn babies. 
Study characteristics: we collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found one study enrolling 76 babies, of whom 69 met eligibility for this review. This review is up‐to‐date as of 20 August 2021. 
Key results: there is not enough evidence for or against tubes with a cuff to prevent airway problems. Newborn babies who have a tube with a cuff may require less frequent replacement of the tube for any reason and less frequent replacement of the tube to find the correct size than babies who had a tube without a cuff. 
Reliability of the evidence: we judged the reliability of the evidence to be very low. This is because only a few babies were in a single trial and there was possible bias. There is one ongoing trial. We classified two studies as awaiting classification because outcome data were not reported separately for newborns and older infants.

10.1002-14651858.CD013720.pub3,"Background
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X‐linked recessive disorder characterised by progressive muscle weakness beginning in early childhood. Respiratory failure and weak cough develop in all patients as a consequence of muscle weakness leading to a risk of atelectasis, pneumonia, or the need for ventilatory support. There is no curative treatment for DMD. Corticosteroids are the only pharmacological intervention proven to delay the onset and progression of muscle weakness and thus respiratory decline in DMD. Antioxidant treatment has been proposed to try to reduce muscle weakness in general, and respiratory decline in particular.  
Objectives
To assess the effects of antioxidant agents on preventing respiratory decline in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy during the respiratory decline phase of the condition.  
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers to 23 March 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We included male patients with a diagnosis of DMD who had respiratory decline evidenced by a forced vital capacity (FVC%) less than 80% but greater than 30% of predicted values, receiving any antioxidant agent compared with other therapies for the management of DMD or placebo.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened studies for eligibility, assessed risk of bias of studies, and extracted data. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. The primary outcomes were FVC and hospitalisation due to respiratory infections. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, adverse events, change in muscle function, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow (PEF).  
Main results
We included one study with 66 participants who were not co‐treated with corticosteroids, which was the only study to contribute data to our main analysis. We also included a study that enrolled 255 participants treated with corticosteroids, which was only available as a press release without numerical results. The studies were parallel‐group RCTs that assessed the effect of idebenone on respiratory function compared to placebo. The trial that contributed numerical data included patients with a mean (standard deviation) age of 14.3 (2.7) years at the time of inclusion, with a documented diagnosis of DMD or severe dystrophinopathy with clinical features consistent with typical DMD. The overall risk of bias across most outcomes was similar and judged as 'low'.  
Idebenone may result in a slightly less of a decline in FVC from baseline to one year compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 3.28%, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.41 to 6.97; 64 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and probably has little or no effect on change in quality of life (MD −3.80, 95% CI −10.09 to 2.49; 63 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), range 0 to 100, 0 = worst, 100 = best quality of life). As a related but secondary outcome, idebenone may result in less of a decline from baseline in FEV1 (MD 8.28%, 95% CI 0.89 to 15.67; 53 participants) and PEF (MD 6.27%, 95% CI 0.61 to 11.93; 1 trial, 64 participants) compared to placebo. 
Idebenone was associated with fewer serious adverse events (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.04; 66 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and little to no difference in non‐serious adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; 66 participants; low‐certainty evidence) compared to placebo. Idebenone may result in little to no difference in change in arm muscle function (MD −2.45 N, 95% CI −8.60 to 3.70 for elbow flexors and MD −1.06 N, 95% CI −6.77 to 4.65 for elbow extensors; both 52 participants) compared to placebo. We found no studies evaluating the outcome hospitalisation due to respiratory infection.  
The second trial, involving 255 participants, for which data were available only as a press release without numerical data, was prematurely discontinued due to futility after an interim efficacy analysis based on FVC. There were no safety concerns. 
The certainty of the evidence was low for most outcomes due to imprecision and publication bias (the lack of a full report of the larger trial, which was prematurely terminated). 
Authors' conclusions
Idebenone is the only antioxidant agent tested in RCTs for preventing respiratory decline in people with DMD for which evidence was available for assessment. Idebenone may result in slightly less of a decline in FVC and less of a decline in FEV1 and PEF, but probably has little to no measurable effect on change in quality of life. Idebenone is associated with fewer serious adverse events than placebo. Idebenone may result in little to no difference in change in muscle function. 
Discontinuation due to the futility of the SIDEROS trial and its expanded access programmes may indicate that idebenone research in this condition is no longer needed, but we await the trial data. Further research is needed to establish the effect of different antioxidant agents on preventing respiratory decline in people with DMD during the respiratory decline phase of the condition.  
","## Plain Language Summary: Helping Boys with Duchenne Breathe Better

### Rationale

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disease that affects boys. It makes their muscles weak over time. This weakness starts when they are young. It gets worse as they grow up.

When muscles get weak, it affects breathing. Boys with DMD can have trouble breathing. They might cough weakly. This can lead to serious problems like lung infections. It can also mean they need help to breathe with a machine.

Right now, there is no cure for DMD. Steroid medicines can help slow down muscle weakness. This also slows down breathing problems. Some people think that antioxidant medicines might help. These medicines could make muscles stronger. They might also help with breathing problems.

This study wanted to see if antioxidant medicines could help boys with DMD breathe better. It aimed to find out if these medicines could stop breathing problems from getting worse.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past studies. These were studies where some boys got an antioxidant medicine. Other boys got a fake medicine (a placebo) or a different treatment. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means boys were put into groups by chance.

The study included boys with DMD. Their lungs were already a bit weak. This meant their breathing capacity was between 30% and 80% of what it should be. The goal was to see if the antioxidant medicine, called idebenone, helped their breathing.

The study also looked at how the medicine affected their quality of life. This means how they felt and lived each day. It also checked for any bad side effects. It looked at how their muscles worked and how much air they could blow out.

Only one study gave enough clear numbers for us to use. This study included 66 boys. They were about 14 years old. They had DMD. They did not take steroids during this study. This study lasted for one year.

### Results

We found one main study that gave us clear numbers. It showed that idebenone might help a little. It seemed to slow down the loss of breathing power. Boys who took idebenone had a bit less decline in how much air they could blow out.

For example, their ability to take a deep breath and blow it out (called FVC) went down less. This was compared to boys who took the fake medicine.

Idebenone did not seem to make a big change in how boys felt about their daily lives. But it did not cause many serious bad side effects. In fact, boys who took idebenone had fewer serious side effects than those who took the fake medicine. There was no real difference in minor side effects.

The medicine did not seem to make a big difference in how strong their arm muscles were.

Another larger study with 255 boys also looked at idebenone. These boys were taking steroids. But this study was stopped early. This was because it seemed the medicine was not helping much with breathing. We do not have the full numbers from this larger study yet.

Overall, the results suggest idebenone might slightly slow down breathing decline. It seems safe to use. But we need more research. We need to be sure about its effects. We also need to see if other antioxidant medicines could help boys with DMD.","Antioxidants to prevent respiratory decline in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Review question 
What are the effects (benefits and harms) of antioxidants for preventing breathing problems becoming worse in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)? 
Background 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited condition where boys show signs of muscle weakness in early childhood that become worse over time. The muscles used in breathing become involved, which leads to shortness of breath and the need for artificial ventilation (a machine to support breathing). Treatment with antioxidants has been proposed to slow down the loss of muscle strength and the decline in breathing. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the evidence up to 23 March 2021. We included two studies in boys with DMD whose breathing was affected. Both studies compared the antioxidant medicine idebenone with a dummy medicine. One study included 66 participants between 10 and 18 years of age. The participants in this study were not receiving corticosteroids (medicines shown to be beneficial in DMD). The other study involved 255 children with DMD who were also taking corticosteroids. This study was stopped early for lack of benefit. The full results of the study are not yet available. 
Study funding sources 
The studies were sponsored by Santhera Pharmaceuticals, the maker of idebenone.
Key results 
Idebenone may result in slightly less of a decline in forced vital capacity (a measure of lung capacity), but probably has little or no effect on quality of life in patients with worsening breathing. Idebenone may result in less of a decline in the ability to force air out of the lungs and airways (based on tests of forced expiratory volume in the first second and peak expiratory flow). Idebenone was associated with fewer serious side effects than the dummy drug and has little or no effect on non‐serious side effects. Idebenone may have little or no effect on muscle function (arm strength). We found no studies that looked at hospitalisation due to respiratory infection. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the evidence was low.

10.1002-14651858.CD011960.pub2,"Background
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is the most common acute leukaemia affecting adults. Most patients diagnosed with AML are at advanced age and present with co‐morbidities, so that intensive therapy such as stem cell transplantation (SCT) is impossible to provide or is accompanied by high risks for serious adverse events and treatment‐related mortality. Especially for these patients, it is necessary to find out whether all‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an intermediate of vitamin A inducing terminal differentiation of leukaemic cell lines, added to chemotherapy confers increased benefit or harm when compared with the same chemotherapy alone. 
Objectives
This review aims to determine benefits and harms of ATRA in addition to chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone for adults with AML (not those with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (non‐APL)). 
Search methods
We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, study registries and relevant conference proceedings up to July 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also contacted experts for unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus ATRA in patients with all stages of AML. We excluded trials if less than 80% of participants were adults or participants with AML, and if no subgroup data were available. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were included, if they had a refractory anaemia and more than 20% of blasts. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. We used hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) and disease‐free survival (DFS; instead of the pre‐planned event‐free survival, as this outcome was not reported), and we calculated risk ratios (RR) for the other outcomes quality of life, on‐study mortality and adverse events. We presented all measures with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE methods. 
Main results
Our search resulted in 2192 potentially relevant references, of which we included eight trials with 28 publications assessing 3998 patients. Overall, we judged the potential risk of bias of the eight included trials as moderate. Two of eight trials were published as abstracts only. All the included trials used different chemotherapy schedules and one trial only evaluated the effect of the hypomethylating agent decitabine, a drug know to affect epigenetics, in combination with ATRA. 
The addition of ATRA to chemotherapy resulted in probably little or no difference in OS compared to chemotherapy only (2985 participants; HR 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.02); moderate‐certainty evidence). Based on a mortality rate at 24 months of 70% with chemotherapy alone, the mortality rate with chemotherapy plus ATRA was 68% (95% CI 65% to 71%). 
For DFS, complete response rate (CRR) and on‐study mortality there was probably little or no difference between treatment groups (DFS: 1258 participants, HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; CRR: 3081 participants, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.09; on‐study mortality: 2839 participants, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.30, all moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Three trials with 1428 participants reported the adverse events 'infection' and 'cardiac toxicity': There was probably no, or little difference in terms of infection rate between participants receiving ATRA or not (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether ATRA decreases cardiac toxicity (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.90; P = 0.02, very low certainty‐evidence, however, cardiac toxicity was low).  Rates and severity of diarrhoea and nausea/vomiting were assessed in two trials with 337 patients and we are uncertain whether there is a difference between treatment arms (diarrhoea: RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.47; nausea/vomiting: RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.85; both very low‐certainty evidence). 
Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence for a difference between participants receiving ATRA in addition to chemotherapy or chemotherapy only for the outcome OS. Regarding DFS, CRR and on‐study mortality, there is probably no evidence for a difference between treatment groups. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events are comparable to chemotherapy only. 
As quality of life has not been evaluated in any of the included trials, further research is needed to clarify the effect of ATRA on quality of life. 
","**Plain Title: Does Adding Vitamin A-like Drug to Chemo Help Adults with Blood Cancer?**

**Rationale**

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a serious blood cancer. It mostly affects older adults. Many of these adults have other health problems. This makes strong treatments like stem cell transplants hard to do. These strong treatments can also cause bad side effects. They can even lead to death.

Doctors need better ways to treat AML. They especially need options for older patients. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is like vitamin A. It can make cancer cells act more normal. We wanted to see if adding ATRA to chemo helps adults with AML. We also wanted to know if it causes more harm.

**Trial Design**

This study looked at other studies. It combined their results. We looked for studies that compared two groups. One group got chemo only. The other group got chemo plus ATRA.

We included studies with adults who had AML. We did not include studies on a specific type of AML called APL. We looked at studies from around the world. These studies were randomized. This means people were put into groups by chance. This helps make the study fair.

We collected data from these studies. We looked at how long people lived. We looked at how long they stayed cancer-free. We also checked for side effects. We wanted to see if ATRA improved health or caused problems.

**Results**

We found eight studies to include. These studies looked at nearly 4000 patients. Most of these studies had a fair design.

Adding ATRA to chemo likely made little to no difference. It did not greatly change how long people lived. For example, 70 out of 100 people on chemo alone died in two years. With ATRA, about 68 out of 100 people died. This is a small change.

ATRA also did not greatly change how long people stayed cancer-free. It did not change how many people went into remission. Remission means the cancer went away for a time. It also did not change how many people died during treatment.

We looked at side effects too. There was likely little or no change in infections. We are not sure if ATRA helped with heart problems. Heart problems were rare in both groups. We are also not sure about effects on upset stomach or diarrhea.

None of the studies looked at quality of life. This means we do not know how ATRA affects daily life.

In conclusion, adding ATRA to chemo did not show big benefits. It did not make people live much longer. It also did not make them stay cancer-free longer. The risk of side effects seemed similar. More research is needed to see if ATRA affects how people feel day-to-day.","Treatment with all‐trans retinoic acid in addition to chemotherapy for adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (non‐APL) 
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aims to determine benefits and harms of all‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in addition to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone for adults with AML. We did not evaluate participants with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found eight studies. 
Key messages 
The addition of ATRA to chemotherapy did not show relevant differences in terms of overall survival (OS), but the subgroup analyses showed that there is potential benefit for ATRA in combination with a certain chemotherapeutic called decitabine , for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who already had successful chemotherapy and now receive therapy for maintenance. We assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate for OS, disease‐free‐survival and on‐study mortality. 
Rates of toxicities were low, therefore certainty of evidence is 'very low' to 'low' for the adverse events diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting and cardiac toxicity. For the adverse event infection, we judged the certainty of evidence as moderate. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events with additional ATRA are comparable to chemotherapy only. 
Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.
What was studied in this review? 
Acute myeloid leukaemia is a life‐threatening type of cancer that starts in the blood‐forming cells of the bone marrow and can cause many different signs and symptoms. It is classified into several subtypes, of which one subtype, acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is treated differently to the other subtypes. 
Almost 60% of patients are older than 65 years at the time of diagnosis. Because of advanced age and accompanying diseases an intensive therapy with high‐dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation often is not possible or is accompanied by high risks for serious adverse events and treatment‐related mortality. For these reasons it would be important to know a less intensive and dangerous therapy for older patients. 
All‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an intermediate product of vitamin A, had been integrated into treatment regimens for APL by the end of the 1980s. It is administered orally and is generally well tolerated but can induce a severe, life‐threatening complication called differentiation syndrome, which includes breathing difficulties and fever. 
The literature provides contradictory data about the benefit of ATRA for patients with AML. It has been reported to increase the sensitivity of AML cell lines to chemotherapy by reducing one protein, which is associated with poor response to chemotherapy and therefore is related to a poor prognosis.These reports have led to the assumption that ATRA added to chemotherapy may improve outcomes and might replace or reduce the intensity of chemotherapy for patients with AML. 
What are the main results of this review? 
We found eight relevant studies with almost 4000 patients in total, conducted in the UK, Germany and France. These studies compared chemotherapy in combination with ATRA with chemotherapy alone in adult patients (over 18 years) with AML. All the included trials used different chemotherapy schedules, as there are several types of chemotherapy regimens for AML. Only in one trial did participants receive a newer drug, decitabine, which has been licensed for the treatment of AML since 2012. 
Adding ATRA to chemotherapy probably makes little or no difference to OS. ATRA may be potentially beneficial in combination with decitabine, for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who receive therapy for maintenance, but these findings need to be explored by further research. 
For disease‐free‐survival, complete response rate and on‐study mortality there was probably no or little difference between treatment groups. 
The combination of ATRA probably did not lead to a higher infection rate. Regarding cardiac toxicity and diarrhoea, the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low, so we are uncertain whether the addition of ATRA is beneficial. 
Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to July 2018.

10.1002-14651858.CD003552.pub4,"Skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control
The skin patch and the vaginal (birth canal) ring are two methods of birth control. Both methods contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. The patch is a small, thin, adhesive square that is applied to the skin. The contraceptive vaginal ring is a flexible, lightweight device that is inserted into the vagina. Both methods release drugs like those in birth control pills. These methods could be used more consistently than pills because they do not require a daily dose. This review looked at how well the methods worked to prevent pregnancy, if they caused bleeding problems, if women used them as prescribed, and how safe they were. 
Through February 2013, we did computer searches for randomized controlled trials of the skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control. Pills included types with both estrogen and progestin. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. 
We found 18 trials. Of six patch trials, five compared the marketed patch to birth control pills and one studied a patch being developed. Of 12 ring trials, 11 looked at the marketed ring and pills while one studied a ring being developed. The methods compared had similar pregnancy rates. Patch users reported using their method more consistently than the pill group did. Only half of the patch studies had data on pregnancy or whether the women used the method correctly. However, most of the ring studies had those data. 
Patch users were more likely than pill users to drop out early from the trial. Ring users were not more likely to drop out early. Compared to pill users, users of the marketed patch had more breast discomfort, painful periods, nausea, and vomiting. Ring users had more vaginal irritation and discharge than pill users but less nausea, acne, irritability, depression, and emotional changes. Ring users often had fewer bleeding problems than pill users. 
The quality of information was classed as low for the patch trials and moderate for the ring studies. Lower quality was due to not reporting how groups were assigned or not having good outcome measures. Other issues were high losses and taking assigned women out of the analysis. Studies of the patch and ring should provide more detail on whether women used the method correctly. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Skin Patch or Vaginal Ring vs. Birth Control Pills

### Plain Title

Comparing the Birth Control Patch and Ring to the Pill

### Rationale

Birth control helps people plan if and when to have babies. Many forms of birth control use hormones. These hormones stop the body from releasing an egg. This makes it hard to get pregnant.

Birth control pills work well. But you must take a pill every day. Some people forget to take their pill. This can lead to unwanted pregnancies.

Newer forms of birth control use hormones too. These include a skin patch and a vaginal ring. These methods may be easier to use. You do not need to use them every day. We wanted to see if they work as well as pills. We also looked at how safe they are. We wanted to know if they cause side effects.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past research. We found studies that compared birth control methods. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. One group used the patch or ring. The other group used birth control pills.

We looked for studies up to February 2013. We searched computer databases. We also asked other researchers for their studies. We wanted to see how well each method stopped pregnancy. We also checked for bleeding issues. We looked at if women used the methods correctly. We also checked for side effects.

### Results

We found 18 studies. Six studies looked at the birth control patch. Twelve studies looked at the birth control ring.

All three methods worked about the same to stop pregnancy. The patch and ring were just as good as the pill.

Women who used the patch said they used it more often than pills. But many patch studies did not have full data. They did not always report pregnancies or correct use. Ring studies had more complete data.

More women stopped using the patch early. They dropped out of the studies. Women using the ring did not drop out more often.

The patch caused more side effects. These included sore breasts, painful periods, and feeling sick. Women using the patch also threw up more often.

The ring caused more vaginal irritation and discharge. But ring users had fewer other problems. They had less sickness, acne, and bad moods. They also had fewer changes in feelings. Ring users also had fewer bleeding problems.

The quality of the patch studies was low. This means some details were missing. For example, we did not always know how groups were chosen. The ring studies were of moderate quality.

More studies are needed. They should share more details about how women use the patch and ring. This will help us know if these methods are a good choice for birth control.","Skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control
The skin patch and the vaginal (birth canal) ring are two methods of birth control. Both methods contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. The patch is a small, thin, adhesive square that is applied to the skin. The contraceptive vaginal ring is a flexible, lightweight device that is inserted into the vagina. Both methods release drugs like those in birth control pills. These methods could be used more consistently than pills because they do not require a daily dose. This review looked at how well the methods worked to prevent pregnancy, if they caused bleeding problems, if women used them as prescribed, and how safe they were. 
Through February 2013, we did computer searches for randomized controlled trials of the skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control. Pills included types with both estrogen and progestin. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. 
We found 18 trials. Of six patch trials, five compared the marketed patch to birth control pills and one studied a patch being developed. Of 12 ring trials, 11 looked at the marketed ring and pills while one studied a ring being developed. The methods compared had similar pregnancy rates. Patch users reported using their method more consistently than the pill group did. Only half of the patch studies had data on pregnancy or whether the women used the method correctly. However, most of the ring studies had those data. 
Patch users were more likely than pill users to drop out early from the trial. Ring users were not more likely to drop out early. Compared to pill users, users of the marketed patch had more breast discomfort, painful periods, nausea, and vomiting. Ring users had more vaginal irritation and discharge than pill users but less nausea, acne, irritability, depression, and emotional changes. Ring users often had fewer bleeding problems than pill users. 
The quality of information was classed as low for the patch trials and moderate for the ring studies. Lower quality was due to not reporting how groups were assigned or not having good outcome measures. Other issues were high losses and taking assigned women out of the analysis. Studies of the patch and ring should provide more detail on whether women used the method correctly.

Loss of olfactory function is well recognised as a symptom of COVID‐19 infection, and the pandemic has resulted in a large number of individuals with abnormalities in their sense of smell. For many, the condition is temporary and resolves within two to four weeks. However, in a significant minority the symptoms persist. At present, it is not known whether early intervention with any form of treatment (such as medication or olfactory training) can promote recovery and prevent persisting olfactory disturbance. This is an update of the 2021 review with four studies added. 
Objectives
1) To evaluate the benefits and harms of any intervention versus no treatment for people with acute olfactory dysfunction due to COVID‐19 infection.  
2) To keep the evidence up‐to‐date, using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the latest search was 20 October 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with COVID‐19 related olfactory disturbance, which had been present for less than four weeks. We included any intervention compared to no treatment or placebo.  
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were the presence of normal olfactory function, serious adverse effects and change in sense of smell. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of parosmia, change in sense of taste, disease‐related quality of life and other adverse effects (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.  
Main results
We included five studies with 691 participants. The studies evaluated the following interventions: intranasal corticosteroid sprays, intranasal corticosteroid drops, intranasal hypertonic saline and zinc sulphate.  
Intranasal corticosteroid spray compared to no intervention/placebo  
We included three studies with 288 participants who had olfactory dysfunction for less than four weeks following COVID‐19. 
Presence of normal olfactory function 
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of intranasal corticosteroid spray on both self‐rated recovery of olfactory function and recovery of olfactory function using psychophysical tests at up to four weeks follow‐up (self‐rated: risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.68; 1 study; 100 participants; psychophysical testing: RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.63; 1 study; 77 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).  
Change in sense of smell 
The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of intranasal corticosteroid spray on self‐rated change in the sense of smell (at less than 4 weeks: mean difference (MD) 0.5 points lower, 95% CI 1.38 lower to 0.38 higher; 1 study; 77 participants; at > 4 weeks to 3 months: MD 2.4 points higher, 95% CI 1.32 higher to 3.48 higher; 1 study; 100 participants; very low‐certainty evidence, rated on a scale of 1 to 10, higher scores mean better olfactory function). Intranasal corticosteroids may make little or no difference to the change in sense of smell when assessed with psychophysical testing (MD 0.2 points, 95% CI 2.06 points lower to 2.06 points higher; 1 study; 77 participants; low‐certainty evidence, 0‐ to 24‐point scale, higher scores mean better olfactory function).  
Serious adverse effects 
The authors of one study reported no adverse effects, but their intention to collect these data was not pre‐specified so we are uncertain if these were systematically sought and identified. The remaining two studies did not report on adverse effects.  
Intranasal corticosteroid drops compared to no intervention/placebo  
We included one study with 248 participants who had olfactory dysfunction for ≤ 15 days following COVID‐19. 
Presence of normal olfactory function 
Intranasal corticosteroid drops may make little or no difference to self‐rated recovery at > 4 weeks to 3 months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.11; 1 study; 248 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No other outcomes were assessed by this study.  
Data on the use of hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and the use of zinc sulphate to prevent persistent olfactory dysfunction are included in the full text of the review. 
Authors' conclusions
There is very limited evidence available on the efficacy and harms of treatments for preventing persistent olfactory dysfunction following COVID‐19 infection. However, we have identified a number of ongoing trials in this area. As this is a living systematic review we will update the data regularly, as new results become available. 
","## Plain Title: Smell Loss After COVID-19: What Treatments Work?

## Rationale

COVID-19 can make you lose your sense of smell. This can be hard for many people. It can be hard to enjoy food. It can also be unsafe if you cannot smell smoke or gas. For some, this problem goes away quickly. For others, it lasts a long time.

Doctors want to know if early treatment can help. They want to know if it can stop long-term smell loss. This study looks at different medicines. It checks if they help people get their smell back. These medicines might help the nose heal faster.

## Trial Design

This study asked, ""How well do treatments work for smell loss?"" It looked at past studies. These studies were of a special kind. They were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means some people got a treatment. Other people got a fake treatment or no treatment. This helps us see if the treatment really works.

The studies looked at people with COVID-19. Their smell loss was new, less than four weeks old. We included any age or gender. The studies checked if people got their smell back. They also looked for bad effects from the treatments.

## Results

We looked at five studies. These studies included 691 people. They tried different things. Some tried nose sprays with medicine. Some used nose drops with medicine. Others used salt water sprays or zinc pills.

For nose sprays with medicine, we are not sure. We do not have strong proof that they help. Some people said their smell got better. But other tests did not show a big change. We also do not know much about bad effects. The studies did not always track them well.

For nose drops with medicine, the proof is also weak. It seems they may not make a big difference. This was for people whose smell loss lasted more than four weeks.

In short, we do not have strong proof yet. We do not know for sure if these treatments help. They may not stop long-term smell loss. More studies are happening now. We will keep checking for new information.","Interventions for the prevention of persistent smell disorders (olfactory dysfunction) after COVID‐19 infection 
Why this is important 
COVID‐19 has been found to cause problems with the sense of smell. Sometimes this is a reduction in the ability to smell things, and sometimes it is a complete loss of the sense of smell. For many people this recovers in a short time, but for others it may last for weeks or months. This review considers whether there are treatments that people might take as soon as they have lost their sense of smell (within four weeks of the symptoms starting), to try and stop this becoming a long‐standing problem. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
We searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature to summarise the results. We also looked at how certain the evidence was, considering things like the size of the studies and how they were carried out. Based on this, we classed the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found five studies that had been completed. 
Intranasal corticosteroids compared to no treatment  
Three studies looked at this treatment. 
Nasal corticosteroid spray might make little or no difference to the sense of smell when measured with specific tests (rather than when asking people about their sense of smell). 
The rest of the evidence was of very low certainty, so we do not know whether a nasal corticosteroid spray is better or worse than no treatment at: 
‐ helping the sense of smell get back to normal (either people feeling that their sense of smell is back to normal, or having a normal sense of smell according to specific tests); 
‐ making people feel that their sense of smell has improved;
‐ causing any unwanted side effects.
Intranasal corticosteroid drops compared to placebo (dummy treatment) 
One study looked at this treatment.
Intranasal corticosteroid drops might not make any difference to the number of people who think their sense of smell has recovered at 30 days.  
We did find a number of other studies that are being carried out, but no results from these studies were available yet to be included in this review. 
What this means 
We do not know whether using a nasal corticosteroid spray or nasal drops has any benefit in preventing longer‐term loss of the sense of smell that is related to COVID‐19, or whether they may cause any harm. This review is a 'living systematic review' ‐ meaning that we will keep checking for new studies that might be relevant, and the review will be continually updated when any extra results are available. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to October 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013231.pub2,"Background
Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is characterized by tachypnea and signs of respiratory distress. Transient tachypnea typically appears within the first two hours of life in term and late preterm newborns. Supportive management might be sufficient. Non‐invasive (i.e. without endotracheal intubation) respiratory support may, however, be administered to reduce respiratory distress during TTN. In addition, non‐invasive respiratory support might improve clearance of lung liquid thus reducing the effort required to breathe, improving respiratory distress and potentially reducing the duration of tachypnea. 
Objectives
To assess benefits and harms of non‐invasive respiratory support for the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1996 to 19 February 2019), Embase (1980 to 19 February 2019) and CINAHL (1982 to 19 February 2019). We applied no language restrictions. We searched clinical trial registries for ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials, quasi‐randomized controlled trials and cluster trials on non‐invasive respiratory support provided to infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age or more and less than three days of age with transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Data collection and analysis
For each of the included trials, two review authors independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, duration of oxygen therapy, need for continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] and need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, etc.) and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomization, blinding, completeness of follow‐up). The primary outcomes considered in this review were need for mechanical ventilation and pneumothorax. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included three trials (150 infants) comparing either CPAP to free‐flow oxygen, nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation to nasal CPAP, or nasal high‐frequency percussive ventilation versus nasal CPAP. Due to these different comparisons and to high clinical heterogeneity in the baseline clinical characteristics, we did not pool the three studies. The use of CPAP versus free oxygen did not improve the primary outcomes of this review: need for mechanical ventilation (risk ratio [RR] 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01 to 6.99; 1 study, 64 participants); and pneumothorax (not estimable, no cases occurred). Among secondary outcomes, CPAP reduced the duration of tachypnea as compared to free oxygen (mean difference [MD] −21.10 hours, 95% CI −22.92 to −19.28; 1 study, 64 participants). Nasal intermittent ventilation did not reduce the need for mechanical ventilation as compared with CPAP (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 32.72; 1 study, 40 participants) or the incidence of pneumothorax (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.90; 1 study, 40 participants); duration of tachypnea did not differ (MD 4.30, 95% CI −19.14 to 27.74; 1 study, 40 participants). In the study comparing nasal high‐frequency ventilation to CPAP, no cases of mechanical ventilation of pneumothorax occurred (not estimable; 1 study, 46 participants); duration of tachypnea was reduced in the nasal high‐frequency ventilation group (MD −4.53, 95% CI −5.64 to −3.42; 1 study, 46 participants). The quality of the evidence was very low due to the imprecision of the estimates and unclear risk of bias for detection bias and high risk of bias for reporting bias. Tests for heterogeneity were not applicable for any of the analyses as no studies were pooled. Two trials are ongoing. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to establish the benefit and harms of non‐invasive respiratory support in the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. Though two of the included trials showed a shorter duration of tachypnea, clinically relevant outcomes did not differ amongst the groups. Given the limited and low quality of the evidence available, it was impossible to determine whether non‐invasive respiratory support was safe or effective for the treatment of transient tachypnea of the newborn.

## Plain Title
Breathing Help for Newborn Babies with Fast Breathing

## Rationale
Some babies are born with fast breathing. This is called ""transient tachypnea of the newborn"" or TTN. Babies with TTN may also show signs of trouble breathing. This can happen in the first two hours of life. It mostly affects babies born close to their due date.

Sometimes, babies just need a little extra care. But other times, they need help to breathe better. Doctors can give babies breathing support without putting a tube in their windpipe. This is called ""non-invasive"" support. It may help clear fluid from the baby's lungs. This makes it easier for them to breathe. It might also make their fast breathing stop sooner.

We wanted to know if this breathing support is good for babies with TTN. We looked at past studies to find out.

## Trial Design
We looked for studies that tested different kinds of breathing support. These studies were ""randomized controlled trials."" This means babies were put into groups by chance. One group got breathing support. Another group got different care.

We looked at studies with babies born at 34 weeks or more. These babies were less than three days old. All had TTN. Two doctors checked the data from these studies. They looked at things like how long babies needed oxygen. They also looked at if babies needed a breathing machine. We mainly wanted to know if babies needed a breathing tube. We also looked at if they got a lung problem called pneumothorax.

## Results
We found three studies. These studies looked at 150 babies in total. Each study compared different types of breathing support. Because the studies were so different, we could not combine their results.

One study compared a type of breathing support called CPAP to just giving oxygen. CPAP did not change if babies needed a breathing machine. No babies in this study got pneumothorax. But CPAP did make the fast breathing stop sooner. Babies on CPAP had fast breathing for about 21 hours less.

Another study looked at nasal intermittent ventilation versus CPAP. This study found no difference in needing a breathing machine. There was also no difference in pneumothorax. The time babies had fast breathing was also the same.

The third study compared nasal high-frequency ventilation to CPAP. No babies in this study needed a breathing machine. No babies got pneumothorax. Babies getting nasal high-frequency ventilation had fast breathing for about 4.5 hours less.

The studies we found were not very strong. It was hard to be sure of the results. This means we cannot say for sure if non-invasive breathing support helps or harms babies with TTN. While some types of support made fast breathing shorter, other important health issues were not changed. More studies are needed to find clear answers.","The use of respiratory support without endotracheal tube (i.e. non‐invasive) in babies to manage rapid breathing (transient tachypnea of the newborn) 
Review question 
Does the use of respiratory support without endotracheal tube (i.e. non‐invasive) in babies with rapid breathing (transient tachypnea of the newborn) improve lung function and reduce the need for invasive respiratory support with an endotracheal tube? 
Background 
Transient tachypnea (abnormally rapid breathing) of the newborn is characterized by high respiratory rate (more than 60 breaths per minute) and signs of respiratory distress (difficulty in breathing). It typically appears within the first two hours of life in infants born at or after 34 weeks' gestational age. Although transient tachypnea of the newborn usually improves without treatment, it might be associated with wheezing in late childhood. The idea behind using non‐invasive respiratory support for transient tachypnea of the newborn consists of reducing fluid from small cavities within the lungs called the alveoli and providing support to the baby with breathing difficulties. This review reports and critically analyzes the available evidence on the benefit and harms of non‐invasive respiratory support in the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Study characteristics 
We identified and included three studies (150 newborns in total) comparing the use of non‐invasive respiratory support with oxygen (one study), or different types of non‐invasive respiratory support (two studies). We found two ongoing studies. Evidence is up to date as of February 2019. 
Results 
The very limited available evidence cannot answer our review question. Non‐invasive respiratory support did not improve lung function or reduce the need for respiratory support.

10.1002-14651858.CD011636.pub2,"The use of the anticoagulant antithrombin to reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain) in very preterm infants 
Review question: Does antithrombin reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain) and mortality in very preterm infants? 
Background: Antithrombin is a drug that modulates blood coagulation together with other factors. Very low birth weight newborn infants (i.e. those neonates with a gestational age less than 32 weeks) have low level of antithrombin in the blood. On the basis of an observational study in very preterm infants, it has been suggested that the administration of drugs that prevent clotting (anticoagulants) such as antithrombin may reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage and progression of intraventricular hemorrhage, a frequent complication of preterm neonates. This systematic review synthesizes the available evidence on the effectiveness of antithrombin in preventing intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm neonates. 
Study characteristics: We included two trials for a total of 182 newborn infants comparing antithrombin with placebo (sugar or albumin solution). 
Results: The use of antithrombin does not reduce the risks of bleeding in the brain, mortality or any other relevant outcomes in very preterm neonates when compared to placebo. However, the data collected are too limited to draw definitive conclusions on the use of antithrombin in the prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain). 
Conclusions: The results of this systematic review are consistent with either a benefit or a detrimental effect of antithrombin and do not provide a definitive answer to the review question. 
","## A Look at Antithrombin for Early Babies

### Rationale

Babies born very early can face many health issues. One major issue is bleeding in the brain. This is called intraventricular hemorrhage. It can cause serious harm to these tiny babies.

Babies born very early have low levels of a blood helper called antithrombin. Antithrombin helps control blood clotting. Some doctors thought giving antithrombin might stop brain bleeds. This study looked into that idea. They wanted to see if antithrombin could help these babies.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past research. It gathered facts from two earlier studies. These studies included 182 very early babies. These babies were born before 32 weeks.

Half the babies got antithrombin. The other half got a ""dummy"" drug. This was a sugar or protein solution. The dummy drug looked like antithrombin but had no effect. This helped doctors see if antithrombin truly made a difference. The studies checked if antithrombin stopped brain bleeds. They also checked if it helped babies live longer.

### Results

The studies showed that antithrombin did not lower brain bleeds. It also did not help babies live longer. It did not seem to help with other health problems either. This was when compared to the dummy drug.

But, the number of babies in the studies was small. It is hard to be sure based on so few cases. We need more studies to fully know if antithrombin helps or hurts. This study did not give a clear answer. More research is needed to understand antithrombin's role.","The use of the anticoagulant antithrombin to reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain) in very preterm infants

10.1002-14651858.CD013245.pub2,"Background
Systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), also referred to as hormone therapy, has long been the primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Additional agents have been reserved for the castrate‐resistant disease stage when ADT start becoming less effective. Abiraterone is an agent with an established role in that disease stage, which has only recently been evaluated in the hormone‐sensitive setting. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of early abiraterone acetate, in combination with systemic ADT, for newly diagnosed metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, two trials registries, grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to 15 May 2020. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials, in which men diagnosed with hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer were administered abiraterone acetate and prednisolone with ADT or ADT alone. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analysesusing a random‐effects model. We rated the quality of evidence according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results
The search identified two randomized controlled trials (RCT), with 2201 men, who were assigned to receive either abiraterone acetate 1000 mg once daily and low dose prednisone (5mg) in addition to ADT, or ADT alone. In the LATITUDE trial, the median age and range of men in the intervention group was 68 (38 to 89) years, and 67 (33 to 92) years in the control group. Nearly all of the men in this study (97.6%) had prostate cancer with a Gleason score of at least 8 (ISUP grade group 4). 
Primary outcomes 
The addition of abiraterone acetate to ADT reduces the probability of death from any cause compared to ADT alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 0.73; 2 RCTs, 2201 men; high certainty of evidence); this corresponds to 163 fewer deaths per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (210 fewer to 115 fewer) at five years. 
Abiraterone acetate in addition to ADT probably results in little to no difference in quality of life compared to ADT alone, measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐prostate total score (FACT‐P; range 0 to 156; higher values indicates better quality of life), at 12 months (mean difference [MD] 2.90 points, 95% CI 0.11 to 5.60; 1 RCT, 838 men; moderate certainty of evidence). 
Secondary outcomes 
Abiraterone plus ADT increases the risk of grades III to V adverse events compared to ADT alone (risk ratio [RR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.47; 1 RCT, 1199 men; high certainty of evidence); this corresponds to 162 more grade III to V events per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (105 more to 224 more) at a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
Abiraterone acetate in addition to ADT probably reduces the probability of death due to prostate cancer compared to ADT alone (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.68; 2 RCTs, 2201 men; moderate certainty of evidence). This corresponds to 120 fewer death from prostate cancer per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (95% CI 145 fewer to 90 fewer) after a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
The addition of abiraterone acetate to ADT probably decreases the probability of disease progression compared to ADT alone (HR 0.35, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.49; 2 RCTs, 2097 men; moderate certainty of evidence). This corresponds to 369 fewer incidences of disease progression per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (456 fewer to 256 fewer) after a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
The addition of abiraterone acetate to ADT probably increases the risk of discontinuing treatment due to adverse events compared to ADT alone (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.92; 1 RCT, 1199 men; moderate certainty of evidence). This corresponds to 51 more men (95% CI 17 more to 93 more) discontinuing treatment because of adverse events per 1000 men treated with abiraterone acetate and ADT compared to ADT alone after a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
Authors' conclusions
The addition of abiraterone acetate to androgen deprivation therapy improves overall survival but probably not quality of life. It probably also extends disease‐specific survival, and delays disease progression compared to androgen deprivation therapy alone. However, the risk of grades III to V adverse events is increased, and probably, so is the risk of discontinuing treatment due to adverse events.

## Plain Title
New Drug Improves Life for Men with Prostate Cancer

## Rationale
Prostate cancer is a disease that affects many men. It happens when cells in the prostate gland grow out of control. When the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is called metastatic prostate cancer. This can cause serious health problems.

For a long time, the main treatment for this type of cancer has been hormone therapy. This therapy aims to lower male hormones, which can help slow down cancer growth. But sometimes, the cancer gets worse even with hormone therapy. Doctors call this ""castrate-resistant disease.""

A drug called abiraterone has helped men whose cancer got worse. Now, doctors want to see if using abiraterone *early* on, along with hormone therapy, can help men even more. They think that starting this drug sooner might stop the cancer from growing for longer and help men live longer. This study looked into that idea.

## Trial Design
This study asked: ""How well does abiraterone work when given early for prostate cancer that has spread?""

To find out, researchers looked at past studies. These studies were set up to compare two groups of men. All men in these studies had prostate cancer that had spread and still responded to hormone therapy.

One group of men received standard hormone therapy *plus* abiraterone and a small dose of another drug called prednisone. The other group received only standard hormone therapy. The men in these studies were mostly older, with an average age of about 67 to 68 years old. Their cancer was often serious, with a high ""Gleason score"" (a way to measure how aggressive the cancer is).

The researchers checked how long men lived, if their cancer got worse, and if they had side effects. They also looked at their quality of life. The studies followed men for about 2.5 to 5 years.

## Results
This study combined results from two main trials that included over 2200 men.

Here’s what they found:

*   **Longer Life:** Men who took abiraterone along with hormone therapy lived longer. For every 1000 men with this type of cancer, about 163 *fewer* men died over five years when they took abiraterone. This is a very good result.
*   **Cancer Slowed Down:** Abiraterone also greatly reduced the chance of the cancer getting worse or spreading further. For every 1000 men, about 369 *fewer* had their cancer progress. It also reduced the chance of dying specifically from prostate cancer.
*   **Quality of Life:** The study found that abiraterone probably did not make a big difference in how men felt in terms of their daily quality of life.
*   **Side Effects:** There was a higher risk of serious side effects with abiraterone. For every 1000 men, about 162 *more* had serious side effects. Also, about 51 *more* men out of 1000 had to stop treatment due to these side effects.

In conclusion, adding abiraterone to standard hormone therapy helps men with metastatic prostate cancer live longer and slows down their cancer. While it may not change their quality of life, it does increase the chance of serious side effects. Doctors now know that starting abiraterone early is an important option for these men.","Adding abiraterone acetate to androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer

The aim of this review was to find out what the effect of adding abiraterone was, in men with prostate cancer, who were receiving and still responding to hormone therapy. 
Background 
Abiraterone acetate is a medication that blocks the effect of male sex hormones, and thereby, slows down prostate cancer growth.  
More than 15% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer present with disease that has spread beyond the prostate. Another 15% to 30% of men who undergo primary treatment will experience a return of their cancer. Hormone therapy (drugs to reduce the level of male hormones) has been the main treatment for advanced disease, but this does not work forever. Recent studies have looked at whether drugs that block the growth of prostate cancer cells, such as abiraterone acetate, can improve how men do. 
Study characteristics 
We found two studies (specifically, studies in which 'chance' decided what treatment men got), with a total of 2201 men. The studies compared abiraterone acetate and hormone therapy to hormone therapy alone. In one of the studies, most of the included men had high risk prostate cancer, and had previously undergone local treatment. In the other study, most men had not had previous treatment to their prostate. The evidence is current to 15 May 2020. 
Key results 
Adding abiraterone acetate to hormone therapy improves overall survival but probably not quality of life. It probably improves cancer‐specific survival and reduces disease progression. However, there is also an increase in severe and life‐threatening side effects, likely leading to discontinued treatment, with the addition of abiraterone acetate. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence to be high for overall survival (time to death from any cause), and severe and life‐threatening side effects. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the actual effect for these outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was moderate for quality of life, cancer‐specific survival (time to death from prostate cancer), time to disease progression, and discontinued treatment due to adverse events. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the actual effect, but there were some limitations in the studies that reduced our confidence in the results.

10.1002-14651858.CD009487.pub3,"Lateral pararectal versus transrectal stoma placement for prevention of parastomal herniation 
We asked 
Is there a difference in the rate of parastomal herniation, and other stoma‐related complications in people undergoing abdominal wall enterostomy, when comparing two stoma formation techniques: lateral pararectal, in which the stoma is located beside the rectus abdominis muscle, one of the muscles of the abdominal wall, versus transrectal, in which the stoma is pulled through the rectus abdominis muscle? 
Background 
A stoma is an opening in the abdomen, which is surgically created to divert the flow of urine or feces; an enterostomy is a stoma that starts in the bowel. A parastomal hernia is an incisional hernia, through which abdominal contents protrude through a defect in the abdominal wall at the site of previous surgery. It is related to a stoma, and is one of the most common stoma‐related complications. Many factors that potentially influence the occurrence of parastomal herniation have been investigated. However, it remains unclear whether the enterostomy should be placed through or beside the rectus abdominis muscle in order to prevent parastomal herniation. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 9 November 2018. In this update, we included 10 retrospective cohort studies with a total of 864 participants, and one randomized controlled trial (RCT: a study in which participants are randomly allocated to the treatment groups), including 60 participants. The target population was individuals, regardless of age, who received a temporary or permanent enterostomy for any reason in either the elective (planned) or the emergency setting. 
Key results 
The results found inconclusive results between the two techniques for the risk of parastomal herniation (11 studies, 924 participants), stomal prolapse (1 study, 145 participants), ileus or stenosis (1 study, 60 participants), and skin irritation (1 study, 60 participants). 
Neither technique was found to be better than the other for any of the stoma‐related outcomes of interest. 
None of the studies measured other stoma‐related problems, or death.
Quality of the evidence 
We downgraded the quality of the evidence to moderate, low, or very low, because of high risk of bias, small sample sizes, few events, and diversity across studies. 
Conclusion 
Based on the current knowledge presented in this review, there is no evidence to support the use of one stoma formation technique over the other. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect. 
","## Plain Title: How to Place a Stoma to Prevent Problems

## Rationale

Sometimes, people need an opening in their belly. This opening is called a stoma. It helps waste leave the body. A problem can happen around the stoma. This problem is called a parastomal hernia. It is when part of the belly pushes out near the stoma. This can cause pain and other issues.

Doctors want to find the best way to make a stoma. They want to avoid these problems. There are two main ways to place a stoma. One way goes through a belly muscle. The other way goes beside it.

We need to know which way is better. This study checked both ways. It looked at how often hernias happen. It also checked other stoma problems.

## Trial Design

This study looked at past research. It gathered facts from many studies. These studies included people of all ages. All of them had a stoma. The stoma was new or planned.

We looked at 10 studies. They had 864 people in them. We also looked at one other study. In that study, 60 people were put into groups by chance. This helps make sure the study is fair.

The studies checked how people did over time. We wanted to see if one stoma method caused fewer problems. The studies looked at common issues. These issues included hernias and skin problems.

## Results

We looked at all the studies. We wanted to see if one method was better. We checked for hernias in 924 people. We also looked at other issues. These included the stoma sticking out or getting narrow. We also checked for skin irritation.

The results did not clearly show a winner. Neither way of placing the stoma seemed better. Both methods had similar rates of problems. No single method caused fewer hernias. Neither one caused fewer other issues.

The studies did not look at all problems. They also did not look at deaths. The facts we found were not always strong. Some studies were small. Some had other issues. More research is needed to be sure.

For now, we don't know which way is best. There is no clear proof yet.","Lateral pararectal versus transrectal stoma placement for prevention of parastomal herniation

10.1002-14651858.CD013393.pub2,"Background
Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is a widely used method to treat renal and ureteral stone. It fragments stones into smaller pieces that are then able to pass spontaneously down the ureter and into the bladder. Alpha‐blockers may assist in promoting the passage of stone fragments, but their effectiveness remains uncertain.  
Objectives
To assess the effects of alpha‐blockers as adjuvant medical expulsive therapy plus usual care compared to placebo and usual care or usual care alone in adults undergoing shock wave lithotripsy for renal or ureteral stones. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive literature search of the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, several clinical trial registries and grey literature for published and unpublished studies irrespective of language. The date of the most recent search was 27 February 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials of adults undergoing SWL. Participants in the intervention group had to have received an alpha‐blocker as adjuvant medical expulsive therapy plus usual care. For the comparator group, we considered studies in which participants received placebo. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion/exclusion, and performed data abstraction and risk of bias assessment. We conducted meta‐analysis for the identified dichotomous and continuous outcomes using RevManWeb according to Cochrane methods using a random‐effects model. We judged the certainty of evidence on a per outcome basis using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 40 studies with 4793 participants randomized to usual care and an alpha‐blocker versus usual care alone. Only four studies were placebo controlled. The mean age of participants was 28.6 to 56.8 years and the mean stone size prior to SWL was 7.1 mm to 13.2 mm. The most widely used alpha‐blocker was tamsulosin; others were silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin and alfuzosin.  
Alpha‐blockers may improve clearance of stone fragments after SWL (risk ratio (RR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.23; I² = 78%; studies = 36; participants = 4084; low certainty evidence). Based on the stone clearance rate of 69.3% observed in the control arm, an alpha‐blocker may increase stone clearance to 80.4%. This corresponds to 111 more (62 more to 159 more) participants per 1000 clearing their stone fragments. 
Alpha‐blockers may reduce the need for auxiliary treatments after SWL (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00; I² = 16%; studies = 12; participants = 1251; low certainty evidence), but also includes the possibility of no effect. Based on a rate of auxiliary treatments in the usual care arm of 9.7%, alpha‐blockers may reduce the rate to 6.5%. This corresponds 32 fewer (53 fewer to 0 fewer) participants per 1000 undergoing auxiliary treatments. 
Alpha‐blockers may reduce major adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.80; I² = 0%; studies = 7; participants = 747; low certainty evidence). Major adverse events occurred in 25.8% of participants in the usual care group; alpha‐blockers would reduce this to 15.5%. This corresponds to 103 fewer (139 fewer to 52 fewer) major adverse events per 1000 with alpha‐blocker treatment. None of the reported major adverse events appeared drug‐related; most were emergency room visits or rehospitalizations. 
Alpha‐blockers may reduce stone clearance time in days (mean difference (MD) –3.74, 95% CI –5.25 to –2.23; I² = 86%; studies = 14; participants = 1790; low certainty evidence). We found no evidence for the outcome of quality of life. 
For those outcomes for which we were able to perform subgroup analyses, we found no evidence of interaction with stone location, stone size or type of alpha‐blocker. We were unable to conduct an analysis by lithotripter type. The results were also largely unchanged when the analyses were limited to placebo controlled studies and those in which participants explicitly only received a single SWL session. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on low certainty evidence, adjuvant alpha‐blocker therapy following SWL in addition to usual care may result in improved stone clearance, less need for auxiliary treatments, fewer major adverse events and a reduced stone clearance time compared to usual care alone. We did not find evidence for quality of life. The low certainty of evidence means that our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. 
","**Plain Title: Helping People Pass Kidney Stones After Treatment**

**Rationale**

Kidney stones can be very painful. They are like small, hard rocks that form in your kidneys. These stones can block the tubes that carry urine from your kidneys to your bladder. This blockage causes great pain. It can also cause other problems.

Doctors often use a treatment called shock wave lithotripsy (SWL). This treatment uses sound waves to break stones into tiny pieces. These small pieces can then pass out of your body. Sometimes, the pieces still cause trouble. They can get stuck and hurt.

This study looked at a type of medicine called alpha-blockers. These medicines help relax the muscles in your body. For kidney stones, they might help the tiny stone pieces pass out more easily. This study wanted to see if these medicines truly help people. We wanted to know if they make passing stones faster and cause fewer problems. We also wanted to know if they make people feel better.

**Trial Design**

This study looked at many other studies. We gathered information from 40 different research projects. These projects included 4793 people in total. All these people had kidney or ureteral stones. They all had SWL treatment to break their stones.

In these studies, some people got alpha-blocker medicine. They also got the usual care after SWL. Other people just got the usual care. A few studies gave some people a sugar pill, called a placebo. This helps us see if the medicine really works, or if people just feel better because they think they are getting medicine.

The people in these studies were adults. Their ages ranged from about 28 to 56 years old. The stones they had were about 7 to 13 millimeters big. This is roughly the size of a pea or a small bean. The studies did not say how long each person was on the medicine. But this kind of treatment usually lasts for a few weeks.

**Results**

The results from all these studies suggest that alpha-blockers may help. They may help people pass stone fragments better after SWL. For every 1000 people, about 111 more cleared their stones. This is compared to people who only got usual care.

Alpha-blockers also seemed to reduce the need for more treatments. Sometimes, after SWL, people need another procedure. This is called an auxiliary treatment. For every 1000 people, about 32 fewer needed these extra treatments. This is good news, as it means less discomfort.

The medicine may also lower the chance of serious problems. These problems were not related to the medicine itself. They were things like needing to go to the emergency room again. Or needing to be admitted to the hospital again. For every 1000 people, about 103 fewer had these major problems.

People who took alpha-blockers might also pass their stones faster. The stones cleared about 3 to 5 days sooner. This means less pain and discomfort for a shorter time.

However, we did not find clear proof about quality of life. We don't know if alpha-blockers made people feel better in their daily lives. The evidence for all these findings was ""low certainty."" This means we are not very sure about the exact numbers. The real effect might be different. More studies are needed to be more certain.","After using shock waves to break up kidney stones, do medicines called alpha‑blockers help to get rid of the stone fragments? 
What are kidney stones? 
Waste products in the blood can sometimes form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. These can build up over time to form a hard stone‐like lump, called a kidney stone. 
Kidney stones can develop in both kidneys especially in people with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain medicines, or if people do not drink enough water or fluids. Stones can cause severe pain, fever and a kidney infection if they block the ureter. 
Treatments for kidney stones 
Most stones are small enough to pass out in the urine: drinking plenty of water and other fluids will help. Larger kidney stones may be too big to pass out naturally and are usually removed by surgery. 
Shock wave lithotripsy is a non‐surgical way to treat stones in the kidney or ureter. High energy sound waves are applied to the outside of the body to break kidney stones into smaller pieces. After shock wave treatment, medicines called alpha‐blockers are sometimes given to help the stone fragments pass out naturally. 
Alpha‐blockers work by relaxing muscles and helping to keep blood vessels open. They are usually used to treat high blood pressure and problems with storing and passing urine in men who have an enlarged prostate gland. Alpha‐blockers may relax the muscle in the ureters, which might help to get rid of kidney stones and fragments.              
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out how well alpha‐blockers work to help kidney stone fragments pass out in the urine. We also wanted to find out about potential unwanted effects that might be associated with alpha‐blockers. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at giving alpha‐blockers to adults, after shock wave treatment, to clear kidney stone fragments. 
We looked for randomized controlled studies, in which the treatments that people received were decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to 27 February 2020. 
What we found 
We found 40 studies including 4793 people who had shock wave treatment to break up their kidney stones. Most of the studies were done in Asia; some were in Europe, Africa and South America. Most studies did not report their sources of funding. 
The studies compared giving an alpha‐blocker with giving a placebo (dummy) treatment or usual care (could include antibiotics, painkillers and fluids given by mouth or through a drip). 
Tamsulosin was the most commonly studied alpha‐blocker; the others were silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin and alfuzosin. 
What are the results of our review? 
Compared with usual care or a placebo treatment, alpha‐blockers may:
clear kidney stones in more people: in 111 more people for every 1000 people treated (36 studies); 
clear stones faster: by nearly four days (14 studies);
reduce the need for extra treatments to clear stones: in 32 fewer people for every 1000 people treated (12 studies); and 
cause fewer unwanted effects: affecting 103 fewer people for every 1000 people treated (seven studies). 
Most unwanted effects were emergency visits to hospitals, and people going back into hospital for stone related problems. Unwanted effects were more common in people who had usual care or a placebo treatment than in people given alpha‐blockers. 
None of the studies looked at people's quality of life (well‐being).
How reliable are these results? 
We are uncertain about these results because they were based on studies in which it was unclear how people were chosen to take part; it was unclear if results were reported fully; some results were inconsistent and in some studies the results varied widely.  Our results are likely to change if further evidence becomes available. 
Conclusions 
Giving an alpha‐blocker after shock wave treatment to break up kidney stones might clear the fragments faster, in more people and reduce the need for extra treatments. Alpha‑blockers might cause fewer unwanted effects than usual care or a placebo.

Interleukin‐1 (IL‐1) blocking agents have been used for treating severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), on the premise that their immunomodulatory effect might be beneficial in people with COVID‐19. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of IL‐1 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo on effectiveness and safety outcomes in people with COVID‐19. 
We will update this assessment regularly.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the COVID‐19 L‐OVE Platform (search date 5 November 2021). These sources are maintained through regular searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, trial registers and other sources. We also checked the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, regulatory agency websites, Retraction Watch (search date 3 November 2021). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IL‐1 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo for people with COVID‐19, regardless of disease severity. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed Cochrane methodology. The protocol was amended to reduce the number of outcomes considered. Two researchers independently screened and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the critical outcomes of clinical improvement (Day 28; ≥ D60); WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above (i.e. the proportion of participants with mechanical ventilation +/‐ additional organ support OR death) (D28; ≥ D60); all‐cause mortality (D28; ≥ D60); incidence of any adverse events; and incidence of serious adverse events. 
Main results
We identified four RCTs of anakinra (three published in peer‐reviewed journals, one reported as a preprint) and two RCTs of canakinumab (published in peer‐reviewed journals). All trials were multicentre (2 to 133 centres). Two trials stopped early (one due to futility and one as the trigger for inferiority was met). The median/mean age range varied from 58 to 68 years; the proportion of men varied from 58% to 77%. All participants were hospitalised; 67% to 100% were on oxygen at baseline but not intubated; between 0% and 33% were intubated at baseline. We identified a further 16 registered trials with no results available, of which 15 assessed anakinra (four completed, four terminated, five ongoing, three not recruiting) and one (completed) trial assessed canakinumab. 
Effectiveness of anakinra for people with COVID‐19  
Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in clinical improvement at D28 (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.20; 3 RCTs, 837 participants; absolute effect: 59 more per 1000 (from 22 fewer to 147 more); moderate‐certainty evidence. 
The evidence is uncertain about an effect of anakinra on 1) the proportion of participants with a WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above at D28 (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.22; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 55 fewer per 1000 (from 107 fewer to 37 more); low‐certainty evidence) and ≥ D60 (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.96; 1 RCT, 606 participants; absolute effect: 47 fewer per 1000 (from 72 fewer to 4 fewer) low‐certainty evidence); and 2) all‐cause mortality at D28 (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.39; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 32 fewer per 1000 (from 68 fewer to 40 more); low‐certainty evidence).  
The evidence is very uncertain about an effect of anakinra on 1) the proportion of participants with clinical improvement at ≥ D60 (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; 1 RCT, 115 participants; absolute effect: 59 fewer per 1000 (from 186 fewer to 102 more); very low‐certainty evidence); and 2) all‐cause mortality at ≥ D60 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.56; 4 RCTs, 1633 participants; absolute effect: 8 more per 1000 (from 84 fewer to 147 more); very low‐certainty evidence). 
Safety of anakinra for people with COVID‐19  
Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.11; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 14 more per 1000 (from 43 fewer to 78 more); moderate‐certainty evidence).  
The evidence is uncertain regarding an effect of anakinra on serious adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.56; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 12 fewer per 1000 (from 104 fewer to 138 more); low‐certainty evidence). 
Effectiveness of canakinumab for people with COVID‐19  
Canakinumab probably results in little or no increase in clinical improvement at D28 (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.14; 2 RCTs, 499 participants; absolute effect: 42 more per 1000 (from 33 fewer to 116 more); moderate‐certainty evidence).  
The evidence of an effect of canakinumab is uncertain on 1) the proportion of participants with a WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above at D28 (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.20; 2 RCTs, 499 participants; absolute effect: 35 fewer per 1000 (from 69 fewer to 25 more); low‐certainty evidence); and 2) all‐cause mortality at D28 (RR:0.75; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.42); 2 RCTs, 499 participants; absolute effect: 20 fewer per 1000 (from 48 fewer to 33 more); low‐certainty evidence).  
The evidence is very uncertain about an effect of canakinumab on all‐cause mortality at ≥ D60 (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.91; 1 RCT, 45 participants; absolute effect: 112 fewer per 1000 (from 210 fewer to 227 more); very low‐certainty evidence). 
Safety of canakinumab for people with COVID‐19  
Canakinumab probably results in little or no increase in adverse events (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21; 1 RCT, 454 participants; absolute effect: 11 more per 1000 (from 74 fewer to 111 more); moderate‐certainty evidence). 
The evidence of an effect of canakinumab on serious adverse events is uncertain (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.13; 2 RCTs, 499 participants; absolute effect: 44 fewer per 1000 (from 94 fewer to 28 more); low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, we did not find evidence for an important beneficial effect of IL‐1 blocking agents. The evidence is uncertain or very uncertain for several outcomes. Sixteen trials of anakinra and canakinumab with no results are currently registered, of which four are completed, and four terminated. The findings of this review are updated on the COVID‐NMA platform (covid-nma.com). 
","## Plain Language Summary: Can We Use Immune Drugs for Severe COVID-19?

### Rationale

When people get very sick with COVID-19, their body’s defense system can get too active. This overactive defense can harm the body and make people even sicker. It can cause serious problems with breathing and other organs. This makes it hard for people to get better.

Doctors thought that certain drugs could help. These drugs are called IL-1 blockers. They work by calming down part of the body’s defense system. This calming effect might stop the body from hurting itself. We wanted to see if these drugs could help people with severe COVID-19 get better and stay safe.

### Trial Design

We looked at studies that were designed very carefully. These studies compared the IL-1 blocker drugs to usual medical care or a dummy pill. This way, we could tell if the drugs truly helped.

We looked at six main studies. These studies included people who were in the hospital with COVID-19. Their age ranged from 58 to 68 years old. Most of them were men, about 58 to 77 out of 100 people. All of them needed oxygen, but some were not on breathing machines yet. A few were already on breathing machines.

Each person in these studies was watched for at least 28 days. Some were watched for 60 days or more. We kept looking for new studies too, to make sure our results were up-to-date.

### Results

We looked at two main IL-1 blocker drugs: anakinra and canakinumab.

**Anakinra:**

This drug likely did not help people get better more quickly after 28 days. About 59 more people out of 1000 might have gotten better, but this was a small change. We were not sure if it helped people avoid serious breathing problems or death after 28 days. We also were very unsure about its effects after 60 days.

Anakinra likely did not cause many more side effects. It caused about 14 more side effects out of 1000 people. We were not sure about its effect on serious side effects.

**Canakinumab:**

This drug likely did not help people get better more quickly after 28 days. About 42 more people out of 1000 might have gotten better. We were not sure if it helped people avoid serious breathing problems or death after 28 days. We were also very unsure about its effects after 60 days.

Canakinumab likely did not cause many more side effects. It caused about 11 more side effects out of 1000 people. We were not sure about its effect on serious side effects.

**What we learned:**

Overall, we did not find strong proof that these IL-1 blocker drugs helped people with COVID-19. For many important things, like getting better or avoiding death, we were not sure if the drugs made a big difference. They also did not seem to cause many more bad side effects.

There are still many studies being done on these drugs. We will keep checking for new results.","Are medicines that block interleukin‐1 (a protein involved in immune responses) effective treatments for COVID‐19 and do they cause unwanted effects? 
Key messages 
• Overall, we did not find sufficient evidence to show that medicines that block interleukin‐1 (a protein involved in immune responses) are effective treatments for people with COVID‐19, or whether they cause unwanted effects. 
• We found 16 studies with unpublished results. We will update this review when new data are available. 
• In future, we need high‐quality studies to evaluate medicines that block interleukin‐1 to treat COVID‐19.  
What is interleukin‐1 and what is its role in COVID‐19? 
Interleukin‐1 (IL‐1) is a type of protein called a cytokine, which helps to regulate the body’s immune system. In particular, IL‐1 triggers inflammation to help fight infection. In COVID‐19, as the immune system fights the virus, the lungs and airways become inflamed, causing breathing difficulties. However, in some people, the immune system can over‐react (called a ‘cytokine storm’) and produce dangerously high levels of inflammation and tissue damage. This can lead to severe breathing difficulties, organ failure and death. 
What are interleukin‐1 ‘blockers’? 
IL‐1 blockers are medicines that stop IL‐1 from working by blocking signals from IL‐1 to other parts of the immune system. This reduces inflammation and may help the immune system to fight COVID‐19. In turn, this may reduce the need for breathing support with a ventilator (a machine that breathes for a patient) and reduce the number of deaths from COVID‐19. Three IL‐1 blockers are available: anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if IL‐1 blockers are effective treatments for people with COVID‐19, compared with standard care alone or with placebo (a dummy treatment that appears identical to the medicine being tested but without any active medicine). We were particularly interested in the effects of IL‐1 blockers on: 
•  whether people’s symptoms got better or worse;
•  how many people died; and
•  any unwanted effects and serious unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the effects of IL‐1 blockers to treat people with COVID‐19 compared with standard care alone or with placebo. People in the studies could have suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 of any severity (mild, moderate or severe), and be any age or sex. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found six studies with 2132 people. Four studies assessed anakinra (1633 people) and two assessed canakinumab (499 people). People in the studies were aged between 58 and 68 years old on average, and the majority were men. All the people in the studies were in hospital, mainly with moderate to critical COVID‐19. The studies varied in size, from 45 to 2253 people. At the start of the studies, 67% to 100% of people were receiving oxygen, and 0% to 33% were on a ventilator. 
We also found 16 studies that have not yet published their results.
Anakinra compared to usual care and placebo to treat people with COVID‐19 
• Anakinra probably results in little or no improvement in COVID‐19 symptoms (defined as improvement on a clinical scale or discharge from hospital) at 28 days after treatment (three studies, 837 people) but we do not know if it makes a difference at 60 days (one study, 115 people). 
• We do not know if anakinra makes a difference to the number of deaths at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 722 people) or at 60 days (four studies, 1633 people). 
• Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in any unwanted effects at 28 days after treatment, but we are not sure about its effect on serious unwanted effects (two studies, 722 people).  
Canakinumab compared to usual care and placebo to treat people with COVID‐19 
• Canakinumab probably results in little or no improvement in COVID‐19 symptoms (defined as improvement on a clinical scale or discharge from hospital) at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 499 people).  
• We do not know if canakinumab makes a difference to the number of deaths at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 499 people) or at 60 days (one study, 45 people).  
• Canakinumab probably results in little or no increase in any unwanted effects (one study, 454 people), but we are not sure about its effect on serious unwanted effects (two studies, 499 people) at 28 days.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. All the people in the studies were hospitalised, but some were more seriously ill than others ‐ some studies only included people on a ventilator. Usual care also differed between studies, and studies measured and reported their results using different methods.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 5 November 2021.

Diabetes and vascular disease are the leading causes of lower limb amputation. Currently, 463 million adults are living with diabetes, and 202 million with peripheral vascular disease, worldwide. When a lower limb amputation is considered, preservation of the knee in a below‐knee amputation allows for superior functional recovery when compared with amputation at a higher level. When a below‐knee amputation is not feasible, the most common alternative performed is an above‐knee amputation. Another possible option, which is less commonly performed, is a through‐knee amputation which may offer some potential functional benefits over an above‐knee amputation. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of through‐knee amputation compared to above‐knee amputation on clinical and rehabilitation outcomes and complication rates for all patients undergoing vascular and non‐vascular major lower limb amputation. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases; the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register to 17 February 2021. 
We undertook reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing through‐knee amputation and above‐knee amputation were eligible for inclusion in this study. Primary outcomes were uncomplicated primary wound healing and prosthetic limb fitting. Secondary outcomes included time taken to achieve independent mobility with a prosthesis, health‐related quality of life, walking speed, pain, and 30‐day survival. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed all records identified by the search. Data collection and extraction were planned in line with recommendations outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We planned to assess the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We did not identify RCTs that met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Authors' conclusions
No RCTs have been conducted to determine comparative clinical or rehabilitation outcomes of through‐knee amputation and above‐knee amputation, or complication rates. It is unknown whether either of these approaches offers improved outcomes for patients. RCTs are needed to guide practice and to ensure the best outcomes for this patient group.

### Plain Title
Looking at Leg Amputations: A Study of Different Surgery Types

### Rationale
Many people have diabetes. Many also have problems with their blood vessels. These issues are the main reasons why people might need to have a leg removed. Right now, more than 400 million adults have diabetes. Over 200 million have blood vessel disease. These problems can make life hard for many patients.

If a leg needs to be removed, doctors try to save the knee if possible. Taking off the leg below the knee is better. It helps people move around more easily later. But sometimes, doctors cannot remove the leg below the knee. The most common choice then is to remove the leg above the knee.

There is another choice called a through-knee amputation. This surgery takes off the leg right at the knee. It is not done as often. But it might help people move better than an above-knee amputation. We need to know more about which surgery is best.

This study wants to find out which surgery works better. We want to know if through-knee amputation is better than above-knee amputation. We are looking at how well patients recover. We also want to know about problems after surgery. This information will help doctors choose the best surgery for patients.

### Trial Design
This study was designed to look for other studies. We searched for studies that compared two types of leg amputation. These were through-knee amputation and above-knee amputation. We wanted to find studies that tested these surgeries in a fair way. These are called ""randomized controlled trials"" or RCTs.

In an RCT, people are put into groups by chance. One group gets one type of surgery. The other group gets the other type. This helps us see which surgery works best. We looked for studies about all patients. This includes people needing a leg removed for any reason. We did not set limits on age or gender.

We looked for information on several important things. First, we wanted to see if the wound healed without problems. Second, we wanted to know if patients could get an artificial leg. We also looked at how long it took to walk on their own. We checked their quality of life and walking speed. We also looked at pain and how many people were alive after 30 days. We searched many medical databases. We looked for studies up until February 17, 2021.

### Results
We looked for many studies. We checked different medical records. We spoke with authors of some studies. We searched very carefully.

But we did not find any studies that met our needs. We did not find any RCTs that compared these two types of leg amputations. This means we do not know for sure which surgery is better. We cannot say if through-knee amputation works better than above-knee amputation. We also do not know about problems after these surgeries.

This means we need more studies. Doctors need clear information to make the best choices. This will help patients get the best care. We need RCTs to guide doctors. These studies will help improve outcomes for people who need leg amputations.","Does surgical removal of the lower leg (amputation) through the knee offer patients improved surgical recovery and better rehabilitation than amputation above the knee? 
Background 
Each year, thousands of people worldwide need to have their lower leg surgically removed (lower limb amputation) due to problems such as blockages in blood vessels (vascular disease), diabetes, and injury. When an amputation is planned, a surgeon needs to decide how high up the leg to go, and therefore how much leg to leave behind. This decision is based on a balance between leaving as much of the leg as possible to improve a person’s ability to walk with an artificial leg (prosthesis) and removing anything that will not survive or go on to heal. If possible, a surgeon will prefer to preserve the knee, as having a working knee of one's own ensures a person’s best chance of walking. In some cases, this is not possible, and currently almost all people in this situation will have an amputation in the middle of the thigh (above the knee). However, another option is an amputation that can be performed through the knee joint itself. This carries potential advantages, as all of the muscles controlling movements of the thighbone are undamaged. A longer remaining leg would be expected to act as a lever to reduce the effort of swinging a prosthetic limb during walking and to aid sitting balance and transfer from bed to chair. By avoiding cutting the muscles, it is possible to minimise the physical trauma of surgery, allowing a procedure with reduced blood loss and less procedure time. In addition, the end of the thighbone and in some cases the knee cap remain. These bones can support the body’s weight at the end of the remaining limb through the same mechanism as kneeling down. On the other hand, some surgeons think that problems with healing may be more common with this approach. It is unclear whether amputation through the knee may therefore be a better operation, allowing improved recovery, greater likelihood of being able to walk with an artificial leg, and better quality of life, or whether it is associated with worse outcomes due to wound healing failure and the need for further surgery. The aim of this review was to look at the best available evidence to see how these operations compare.  
This review searched for studies that looked at whether through‐the‐knee or above‐the‐knee amputation resulted in better wound healing after amputation, improved patient survival, and reduced pain (clinical outcomes), as well as better rates of prosthesis use, walking speed, and quality of life (rehabilitation outcomes). 
Study characteristics and key results 
A thorough search of the available literature was performed (up to 17 February 2021) to find studies comparing through‐knee with above‐knee amputation. We identified no studies comparing these two procedures. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We were unable to assess the certainty of evidence because of the absence of studies included in this review. 
Conclusion 
Due to a lack of randomised trials, we are unable to determine if through‐knee amputations have different outcomes from above‐knee amputations. High‐quality randomised controlled trials are required to provide evidence on this topic.

How an ocular burn damages the eye 
The cornea is the transparent window of the eye that helps focus light to form an image of the outside world. For the cornea to remain transparent, it must have a healthy surface layer of epithelium, a stable tear film, and an absence of blood vessels. The epithelium is the moist cellular layer that covers the cornea, the white part of the eye, and the inside of the eyelids. The epithelium that covers the cornea is different from the epithelium of the conjunctiva. It is maintained in this state by a population of specialised stem cells found at the margin of the cornea (the limbus). In the normal eye, corneal epithelial cells slowly migrate from the limbus towards the centre of the cornea. 
A burn to the eye initially damages the surface epithelial layer, but it can also damage the deeper structures of the eye and the eyelids. A characteristic of an acute burn is an epithelial defect. This defect can fully recover after a minor burn. However, if the burn damages the stem cells of a segment of the limbus, the normal epithelium central to that area may not recover. The cornea is then covered by a functionally different type of epithelium derived from the peripheral conjunctiva, which may take weeks or months, and the cornea can become hazy and vascularised. In the absence of any epithelial covering, an additional risk is that the deeper tissues of the exposed cornea (stroma) may become progressively thinner and eventually perforate. The more extensive the damage to the limbus (measured in clock hours), the worse the outcome. The abnormal surface of the cornea, as well as haze and damage to structures within the eye (iris, lens, retina, optic nerve), can all lead to loss of vision. 
Treatments for ocular burns 
A burn to the surface of the eye is an emergency, and the eye must be washed immediately with water or saline to remove any chemical agents. The amount of damage to the epithelium (an epithelial defect) and the blood vessels at the edge of the cornea are measured, estimating the risk of future complications. The eye is then treated with medicines to reduce the risk of further complications and help the epithelial layer recover. Some doctors also use an amniotic tissue membrane placed over the surface of the eye. The amniotic membrane is the sac that surrounds a baby as it develops inside its mother. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to know whether using an amniotic membrane with medicines is better than just medicines. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies in which an amniotic membrane was used to treat eyes that had been burned. We then looked for studies comparing eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane patch with eyes treated using only medicines. We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which the treatment that people received was decided at random because these studies give the most reliable evidence about the effect of treatment. We assessed the treatment of moderate burns and severe burns separately, because they have different outcomes. We measured whether the treatment worked by comparing the proportion of eyes in which the epithelium over the cornea had failed to recover 21 days after the injury, visual function at the end of treatment, the presence of abnormal new blood vessels on the cornea, scarring between the cornea and the lids, the time taken for the epithelium to heal and adverse events in the intervention and control groups. We assessed the risk of bias in the randomised controlled study findings across pre‐specified domains. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to evaluate certainty of evidence include risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias.  
What we found 
We found two randomised controlled studies comparing the effect of medicines with the addition of an amniotic membrane patch inserted within seven days of the injury against medicines alone. One study suggested that treatment with amnion may be beneficial in moderate burns, but we found the certainty of the evidence to be low due to a high risk of bias and serious imprecision. For severe burns, there were no important differences between eyes that received an amniotic membrane and eyes that did not.  
Conclusions 
There is only uncertain evidence from randomised controlled studies of an important difference in healing between eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane within seven days of an ocular burn and eyes that are treated only with medicines. Further research is needed to identify the best treatment for acute burns to the eye to reduce the risk of potentially devastating consequences and visual loss.

","## Treating Eye Burns with Amniotic Membrane

### Rationale

Your eye has a clear front window called the cornea. It helps you see clearly. A thin, wet layer of cells, called the epithelium, covers the cornea. It keeps the cornea healthy. Special cells at the edge of the cornea help new cells grow.

An eye burn can hurt this clear window. It can damage the surface cells. If the burn is bad, these special cells might get hurt. This can stop the cornea from healing well. Your eye might get cloudy. New blood vessels might grow on it. This can make it hard to see. In bad cases, the eye might even get a hole.

When an eye gets burned, it's an emergency. Doctors wash the eye right away. They also give medicines. These medicines help the eye heal. Some doctors also put a thin patch on the eye. This patch is made from amniotic membrane. This is the sac that holds a baby in the womb.

We wanted to know if using this membrane with medicines works better. We wanted to see if it helps burn eyes heal more.

### Trial Design

We looked for studies that treated burned eyes. We wanted to find studies that compared two groups. One group got medicines only. The other group got medicines plus the amniotic membrane.

We looked for a special type of study. These are called ""randomized controlled trials."" In these studies, a computer decides which treatment people get. This helps make sure the results are fair. It gives us the best proof about what works.

We looked at burns that were not too bad. We also looked at very bad burns. We checked how well the eye healed after 21 days. We looked at how well people could see. We also checked for new blood vessels. We looked for scars and how long it took to heal. We also checked for any problems from the treatment.

### Results

We found two studies. They compared medicines alone to medicines plus amniotic membrane. The membrane was put on within seven days of the burn.

One study looked at moderate burns. It hinted that the membrane might help. But we are not sure about this. The study had some problems. It was not clear enough.

For severe burns, there was no big difference. Eyes with the membrane did not heal better. Eyes that only got medicines did not heal worse.

So, we have very little proof right now. We cannot say for sure if the amniotic membrane helps. We need more studies. These studies will help us find the best way to treat eye burns. This can help prevent vision loss.","Amniotic membrane transplantation for the treatment of ocular burns

New minimal invasive surgeries have been suggested as alternative options to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy is a new technology that uses targeted, controlled water vapour energy (steam) to create necrotic tissue in the prostate. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and the Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings published up to 18 February 2020, with no restriction on the language or status of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, and non‐randomised observational prospective studies with concurrent comparison groups, in which men with BPH underwent convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy, another active therapy, or a sham procedure. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We had planned to perform statistical analyses using a random‐effects model, and interpret them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the certainty of the evidence according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included a single, industry‐sponsored RCT, with 197 randomised men, that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to a sham procedure. The mean age 62.9 years, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was 21.97, and the mean prostate volume was 45.4 mL. We only found short‐term data, measured up to three months. 
Primary outcomes 
Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may improve urologic symptom scores more than a sham procedure, measured on a IPSS scale (0 to 35; higher score represents worse urological symptoms) by a mean difference (MD) of ‐6.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐9.06 to ‐4.74; 195 men; low‐certainty evidence), and likely improves quality of life (QoL), measured on a IPSS‐QoL scale (0 to 6; higher score represents worse QoL), by a MD of ‐1.2 (95% CI ‐1.66 to ‐0.74; 195 men; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on major adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 6.79, 95% CI 0.39 to 117.00; 197 men; very low‐certainty evidence) assessed by the Clavien‐Dindo classification system of III, IV, and V complications. 
Secondary outcomes 
We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on retreatment (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.06 to 32.86; 197 men; very low‐certainty evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may have little to no effect on erectile function (MD 0.4, 95% CI ‐1.91 to 2.71; 130 men; low‐certainty evidence) and ejaculatory function (MD 0.5, 95% CI ‐0.83 to 1.83; 130 men; low‐certainty evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may increase minor adverse events assessed by the Clavien‐Dindo classification system of Grade I and II complications (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.11; 197 men; low‐certainty evidence). This would correspond to 434 minor adverse events per 1000 men (95% CI 264 more to 714 more). We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on acute urinary retention (RR 4.98, 95% CI 0.28 to 86.63; 197 men; very low‐certainty evidence). It likely greatly increases the rate of men requiring indwelling urinary catheters (RR 35.58, 95% CI 15.37 to 82.36; 197 men; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
We were unable to perform any of the predefined secondary analyses.
We found no evidence for other comparisons, such as convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy versus TURP or other minimal invasive procedures. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared to a sham procedure, urologic symptom scores and quality of life appear to improve with convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy, but we are very uncertain about major adverse events. The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, with study limitations and imprecision being the most common reasons for rating down. These findings are based on a single industry‐sponsored study, with three‐month short‐term follow‐up. We did not find any studies comparing convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to any other active treatment form, such as TURP. 
","## Plain Title: Steam Treatment for Prostate Problems

## Rationale

Many men face problems with their prostate gland. This gland is part of the male body. It sits below the bladder. When it grows too large, it is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This often happens as men get older.

A large prostate can make it hard to pee. Men may feel like they need to go often. They may also have a weak pee stream. This can be a real burden. It makes daily life hard.

Doctors use surgery to help with BPH. One common surgery is called TURP. But new ways to treat BPH are being found. These new ways are less invasive. This means they are gentler on the body.

One new way uses steam. It is called convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy. This treatment uses heat from steam. The steam targets the prostate. It helps shrink the part that is too big. This can make it easier to pee.

This study looked at how well steam treatment works. We wanted to see if it helps men with BPH. We also wanted to see how safe it is. This study is important. It helps us learn more about new ways to help men with BPH.

## Trial Design

We wanted to know how this new steam treatment works. We looked for studies that tested it. We wanted studies that compared the steam treatment to other things.

We looked for studies called ""randomized controlled trials."" In these studies, some men get the real treatment. Other men get a ""sham"" treatment. A sham treatment is like a fake treatment. This helps us see if the real treatment makes a true difference.

We found one study that fit our needs. It included 197 men. These men had BPH. They had problems with peeing. Their average age was about 63 years old. Their prostate size was about 45 mL.

In this study, men were split into two groups. One group got the steam treatment. The other group got a sham treatment. The study followed these men for three months. We looked at how their symptoms changed. We also looked at their quality of life. This means how happy they were with their health.

We also checked for any problems from the treatment. We looked at both small and big problems. This study design helps us compare the steam treatment to no treatment.

## Results

We found one main study about the steam treatment. It compared the steam treatment to a sham treatment. The study involved 197 men.

The steam treatment helped men pee better. Their pee problems got better. This was measured on a scale from 0 to 35. A lower score means better health. Men who got steam treatment had a score that was about 7 points lower. This is a good change.

Men also felt better about their lives. Their quality of life improved. This was measured on a scale from 0 to 6. A lower score means a better life. Men who got steam treatment had a score that was about 1 point lower. This also shows good results.

We are not sure about serious side effects. The study did not give clear answers. There might be more minor side effects. These are not as serious. Things like needing a catheter after treatment were more common. A catheter is a thin tube. It helps drain pee from the bladder.

The study only looked at results for three months. We do not know about long-term effects. We also did not find studies that compared steam treatment to other real treatments like TURP surgery.

Overall, the steam treatment looks like it helps men pee better. It also makes them feel better. But we need more studies. We need to know more about long-term effects. We also need to compare it to other treatments.","Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia 
Review Question 
What are the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy in men with bothersome urinary symptoms because of an enlarged prostate? 
Background 
Prostate enlargement is common in older men, and can cause bothersome urinary symptoms, such as having to pass their water (voiding) often, a weak stream while voiding, or dribbling. If lifestyle changes and medications don't help, a variety of surgical procedures, including transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), can improve these symptoms. They may also cause unwanted effects, such as problems with ejaculation or erections. Recently, a new procedure called 'convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy' has become available. It is unclear how it compares to other treatments, such as TURP. 
Study characteristics  We found a single study, with 197 men, that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to a sham procedure (men were made to believe they received treatment, while in reality, they did not), funded by the device company. The men's average age was 62.9 years, and most had a moderate degree of bothersome urinary symptoms. 
We found no studies that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to another form of active treatment, such as TURP that men with an enlarged prostate and bothersome symptoms might otherwise choose. 
Key results 
Compared to a sham procedure, and with a three‐month follow‐up, convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may improve urinary symptoms (low certainty of evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy also likely improves quality of life (moderate certainty of evidence). We are very uncertain whether serious unwanted side effects are more common or not (very low certainty of evidence). Men's erections and ejaculations may be similar in men who have convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy and those who receive the sham procedure (low certainty of evidence). 
Findings of this review are up to date until 18 February 2020.
Certainty of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes to be moderate, low or very low. Reasons for not being so confident had to do with the study design and the study size.

Although this technique produces good results, anatomic issues (such as common iliac artery ectasia or an aneurysm that involves the iliac bifurcation) can make EVAR more complex and challenging and can lead to an inadequate distal seal zone for the stent‐graft. Inadequate distal fixation in the common iliac arteries can lead to a type Ib endoleak. To avoid this complication, one of the most commonly used techniques is unilateral or bilateral internal iliac artery occlusion and extension of the iliac limb stent‐graft to the external iliac arteries with or without embolisation of the internal iliac artery. However, this occlusion is not without harm and is associated with ischaemic complications in the pelvic territory such as buttock claudication, sexual dysfunction, ischaemic colitis, gluteal necrosis, and spinal cord injury. 
New endovascular devices and alternative techniques such as iliac branch devices and the sandwich technique have been described to maintain pelvic perfusion and decrease complications, achieving revascularisation of the internal iliac arteries in patients not suitable for an adequate seal zone in the common iliac arteries. These approaches may also preserve the quality of life of treated individuals and may decrease other serious complications including spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis, thereby decreasing the morbidity and mortality of EVAR. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion during endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialists searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 28 August 2019. The review authors searched Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) and the Indice Bibliográfico Español de Ciencias de la Salud (IBECS) on 28 August 2019 and contacted specialists in the field and manufacturers to identify relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared internal iliac artery revascularisation with internal iliac artery occlusion for patients undergoing endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed identified studies for potential inclusion in the review. We used standard methodological procedures in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions. 
Main results
We identified no RCTs that met the inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
We found no RCTs that compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation. High‐quality studies that evaluate the best strategy for managing endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms with inadequate distal seal zones in the common iliac artery are needed.

### Plain Title
Comparing Ways to Treat Blood Vessel Bulges in the Belly

### Rationale

Your body has large blood vessels. These vessels carry blood. Sometimes, a blood vessel can get a weak spot. This spot can bulge out. This bulge is called an aneurysm. It can happen in your belly. If it breaks, it can be very dangerous.

Doctors can fix these bulges. They can put a tube inside the vessel. This tube is called a stent-graft. This fix is called EVAR. It helps many people. But sometimes, the bulge is in a tricky spot. It can be near where the blood vessel splits. This makes it hard to place the tube.

If the tube is not sealed well, blood can leak. This leak is called a type Ib endoleak. To stop this, doctors sometimes close off a small blood vessel nearby. This vessel goes to your hip. But closing it off can cause problems. It can hurt your hip or make it hard to walk. It can also cause problems with sex.

New ways to fix the bulge are being tried. These new ways try to keep the small hip vessel open. This might stop the bad side effects. It might make people feel better. It might also save lives. This study wanted to see if keeping the hip vessel open was better.

### Trial Design

This study looked for other studies. We wanted to find studies that compared two ways of fixing blood vessel bulges. One way closes off the hip blood vessel. The other way keeps it open. We wanted to find studies that randomly put people into one of these two groups. This is called a randomized controlled trial (RCT). These are the best kinds of studies.

We looked through many lists of studies. We searched for studies up to August 2019. We looked in many health databases. We also asked experts in the field. We wanted to find all studies that fit our plan. The studies needed to compare keeping the hip vessel open versus closing it. They needed to be for people with belly blood vessel bulges. These bulges had to be near where the vessel splits.

We did not find any studies that fit.

### Results

We looked for studies that compared two ways to fix blood vessel bulges. One way closes off a small hip vessel. The other way keeps it open. We wanted to find studies that used a fair method (RCTs).

We did not find any such studies. This means we cannot say which way is better yet. We need more studies. Doctors need to do new studies. These studies should compare these two ways. They should be good quality studies. This will help doctors know the best way to treat these bulges. It will help people who need this surgery.","Internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms 
Background 
An aorto‐iliac aneurysm is a dilatation (aneurysm) of the aorta, the main large blood vessel in the body, which carries blood out from the heart to all organs and iliac arteries (distal branches of the aorta). The aneurysm can grow and burst (rupture), which leads to severe bleeding and is frequently fatal; an estimated 15,000 deaths occur each year from ruptured aortic abdominal aneurysms in the USA alone. To avoid this complication, the aorto‐iliac aneurysm should be repaired when the maximum diameter of the aorta reaches 5 cm to 5.5 cm, or when the maximum diameter of the common iliac arteries reaches 3 cm to 4 cm. 
Endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms is one approach that is used to manage this condition: a tube (stent‐graft) is placed inside the aorto‐iliac aneurysm, so that blood flows through the stent‐graft and no longer into the aneurysm, excluding it from the circulation. To achieve a successful deployment of the stent‐graft, a good seal zone (fixation zone) is needed in the aorta (proximal) and in the common iliac arteries (distal). However, in 40% of patients, the distal seal zone in the common iliac arteries is inadequate. In these cases, most commonly the stent‐graft is extended to the external iliac artery and the internal iliac artery is blocked (occluded). However, this obstruction (occlusion) is not without harms: the internal iliac artery supplies blood to the pelvic organs (rectum, bladder, and reproductive organs) and the pelvic muscles, and occlusion is associated with complications in the pelvic area such as buttock claudication (cramping pain in the buttock during exercise), sexual dysfunction, and spinal cord injury. 
New endovascular devices and techniques such as iliac branch devices have emerged to maintain blood flow into the internal iliac artery. These special stent‐grafts position the distal seal zone within the external iliac artery, and a side branch of the graft allows for revascularisation of the internal iliac artery, while excluding the aneurysm from the circulation, promoting an adequate distal seal zone, and maintaining pelvic circulation. This may also preserve the quality of life of treated individuals and may reduce serious complications including spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis. 
This review aimed to assess the effects of internal iliac artery revascularisation compared with internal iliac artery occlusion during endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We searched for evidence that directly compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. Our searches up to 28 August 2019 did not identify any randomised controlled trials (clinical studies in which people are randomly (by chance alone) put into one of several intervention groups) that met our criteria. Studies are needed to help vascular and endovascular surgeons choose the best option for endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms with an inadequate distal fixation zone. 
Conclusion 
We found no RCTs that compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. High‐quality studies that evaluate the best strategy for managing the endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms with inadequate distal seal zones in the common iliac artery are needed.

10.1002-14651858.CD015043,"Background
The role of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment for COVID‐19 has been a subject of considerable discussion. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for COVID‐19 based on randomised controlled trials is required. 
Objectives
To assess whether vitamin D supplementation is effective and safe for the treatment of COVID‐19 in comparison to an active comparator, placebo, or standard of care alone, and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions to 11 March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. 
We excluded studies investigating preventive effects, or studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)). 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following prioritised outcome categories: individuals with moderate or severe COVID‐19: all‐cause mortality, clinical status, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events, and for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease: all‐cause mortality, development of severe clinical COVID‐19 symptoms, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events. 
Main results
We identified three RCTs with 356 participants, of whom 183 received vitamin D. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical progression scale, two studies investigated participants with moderate or severe disease, and one study individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease. The control groups consisted of placebo treatment or standard of care alone. 
Effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19 and moderate to severe disease 
We included two studies with 313 participants. Due to substantial clinical and methodological diversity of both studies, we were not able to pool data. Vitamin D status was unknown in one study, whereas the other study reported data for vitamin D deficient participants. One study administered multiple doses of oral calcifediol at days 1, 3 and 7,  whereas the other study gave a single high dose of oral cholecalciferol at baseline. We assessed one study with low risk of bias for effectiveness outcomes, and the other with some concerns about randomisation and selective reporting. 
All‐cause mortality at hospital discharge (313 participants) 
We found two studies reporting data for this outcome. One study reported no deaths when treated with vitamin D out of 50 participants, compared to two deaths out of 26 participants in the control group (Risk ratio (RR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.13). The other study reported nine deaths out of 119 individuals in the vitamin D group, whereas six participants out of 118 died in the placebo group (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.04]. We are very uncertain whether vitamin D has an effect on all‐cause mortality at hospital discharge (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Clinical status assessed by the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (237 participants) 
We found one study reporting data for this outcome. Nine out of 119 participants needed invasive mechanical ventilation when treated with vitamin D, compared to 17 out of 118 participants in the placebo group (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.13). Vitamin D supplementation may decrease need for invasive mechanical ventilation, but the evidence is uncertain (low‐certainty evidence). 
Quality of life 
We did not find data for quality of life.
Safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19 and moderate to severe disease 
We did not include data from one study, because assessment of serious adverse events was not described and we are concerned that data might have been inconsistently measured. This study reported vomiting in one out of 119 participants immediately after vitamin D intake (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.30). We are very uncertain whether vitamin D supplementation is associated with higher risk for adverse events (very low‐certainty). 
Effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19 and asymptomatic or mild disease 
We found one study including 40 individuals, which did not report our prioritised outcomes, but instead data for viral clearance, inflammatory markers, and vitamin D serum levels. The authors reported no events of hypercalcaemia, but recording and assessment of further adverse events remains unclear. Authors administered oral cholecalciferol in daily doses for at least 14 days, and continued with weekly doses if vitamin D blood levels were > 50 ng/mL. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment of COVID‐19. The evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of COVID‐19 is very uncertain. Moreover, we found only limited safety information, and were concerned about consistency in measurement and recording of these outcomes. 
There was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity of included studies, mainly because of different supplementation strategies, formulations, vitamin D status of participants, and reported outcomes. 
There is an urgent need for well‐designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with an appropriate randomisation procedure, comparability of study arms and preferably double‐blinding. We identified 21 ongoing and three completed studies without published results, which indicates that these needs will be addressed and that our findings are subject to change in the future. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically.

### Plain Title
Vitamin D for COVID-19: Does It Help?

### Rationale
COVID-19 is a sickness caused by a germ. It can make people very sick. Many people wonder if vitamin D can help treat COVID-19. Vitamin D is a common supplement. Some people think it might make sick people feel better.

We wanted to know if giving vitamin D to people with COVID-19 helps them. We also wanted to know if it is safe. This study looked at other studies to find answers. We looked for studies where some people got vitamin D and others did not.

### Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies. We wanted to see if vitamin D helps people with COVID-19. We looked at studies that gave vitamin D to people who had COVID-19. This included people of all ages and all health levels. They had all kinds of COVID-19, from mild to severe.

We did not look at studies about preventing COVID-19. We only looked at studies about treating it. Each study we reviewed had a group that got vitamin D. Another group got a fake pill or standard care. This helps us see if vitamin D made a difference. We looked for studies that were well-designed. This means they were fair and did not have biases.

### Results
We found three studies to look at. A total of 356 people were in these studies. About half of them got vitamin D.

Two studies looked at people who were quite sick with COVID-19. These people were in the hospital. One study found that very few people who got vitamin D died. But the numbers were too small to be sure. The other study found more people died in the vitamin D group. It is hard to know if vitamin D changes the chance of dying. The results were not clear.

One study looked at people who needed help breathing. Fewer people who got vitamin D needed help breathing. But this was only one study. So, we are not sure if vitamin D really helps with breathing.

We did not find enough information about how vitamin D affects quality of life. This means how good people feel. We also found little information on side effects. One study saw some people vomit after taking vitamin D. But we are not sure how safe vitamin D is for COVID-19.

For people with mild COVID-19, we found only one study. This study did not look at the things we wanted to know. It did not tell us if vitamin D helped them get better.

Right now, we do not have enough clear proof. We cannot say if vitamin D helps or harms people with COVID-19. More good studies are needed to find answers. Many new studies are happening now. We will update this report as we learn more.","Is vitamin D an effective and safe treatment for COVID‐19?
Key messages 
‐ We did not find enough, good‐quality evidence to judge whether vitamin D is an effective or safe treatment for adults with COVID‐19. 
‐ We need more research on this topic. Future research should focus on well‐designed studies with robust methods. 
‐ We identified 21 studies on this topic that are ongoing. We will update this review when more evidence becomes available. 
What is the link between vitamin D and COVID‐19? 
Some studies have shown that people who are in hospital with severe COVID‐19 also have low levels of  vitamin D (vitamin D deficiency). However, the risk factors for developing severe COVID‐19 are the same as those for developing vitamin D deficiency, so it is difficult to tell if vitamin D deficiency itself is a risk factor for severe COVID‐19. Risk factors include general ill‐health, a poor diet, and pre‐existing health conditions, such as diabetes, and liver and kidney disease. 
Vitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. It helps to regulate blood sugar, the heart and blood vessels, and the lungs and airways. It also has a role in boosting the body’s immune system. These are areas affected by COVID‐19, so giving vitamin D to people with COVID‐19 might help them to recover more quickly or have the disease less severely. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out the effects of giving vitamin D to adults with confirmed COVID‐19 on the following: 
‐ death from any cause;
‐ improvement or worsening of the patient’s condition;
‐ unwanted effects; and
‐ quality of life.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the use of vitamin D as a treatment for adults with confirmed COVID‐19 compared with a placebo (sham treatment) or another treatment. Vitamin D could be given in any form and in any dose. 
We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found three studies with 356 participants. One study took place in Brazil, and the other two in Spain. Two studies had participants with severe COVID‐19 and one had participants with mild COVID‐19 or with no symptoms. All the participants tested positive for COVID‐19 with a laboratory test called ‘PCR’, which is currently the most accurate test available. 
The studies gave their participants different doses of vitamin D. They used different timings from each other, from one large dose in one study to several smaller doses over 14 days in another study. Only two studies said that their participants were vitamin D‐deficient. The other study did not say anything about their participants’ vitamin D status. 
Deaths from any causeWe do not know whether vitamin D helps to prevent death from COVID‐19. Two studies (in participants with severe COVID‐19) provided evidence about deaths from any cause. One reported no deaths in the 50 participants who had received vitamin D, but two  deaths in the 26 participants who received the hospital’s usual COVID‐19 treatment. The other study reported nine deaths in 119 participants who had been given vitamin D and six deaths in the 118 participants given placebo. These studies were too different from each other to allow us to draw any conclusions. 
Patient’s conditionVitamin D may reduce the need for patients to be put on a ventilator to help them breathe, but the evidence is uncertain. One study (in participants with severe COVID‐19) reported that nine out of 119 participants given vitamin D had to be put on a ventilator and 17 out of 118 given a placebo needed a ventilator. 
Unwanted effectsWe do not know whether vitamin D causes unwanted effects. Only one study (in participants with severe COVID‐19) reported data on unwanted effects in a way that we could use. It found that one participant out of 119 vomited shortly after being given vitamin D. 
Quality of lifeNone of the studies reported quality of life. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is very limited because the studies gave different doses of vitamin D at different times from each other, did not all report participants’ vitamin D status, and did not measure and record their results using consistent methods. 
We found little evidence on unwanted effects and none on quality of life.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 11 March 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD011683.pub2,"Targeted mass media interventions to encourage healthier behaviours in adult, ethnic minorities 
Background and review question 
Health authorities and non‐governmental organisations often use mass media interventions (e.g. leaflets, radio and TV advertisements, posters and social media) to encourage healthier behaviours related to physical activity, dietary patterns, tobacco use or alcohol consumption, among others. In this review, we consider the effects of mass media interventions targeted towards ethnic minorities. A targeted intervention is designed for and considers the characteristics of a specific group, ideally providing ethnic minority groups equal opportunities and resources to access information, life skills, and opportunities to make healthier choices. However, we do not know whether targeted mass media strategies are more effective in reaching and influencing ethnic minorities than mass media strategies developed for the general population. 
Study characteristics 
We found six studies, all from the USA, four of which targeted African Americans and two which targeted Latino or Chinese immigrants. Of the studies, four were experimental (1693 volunteers) and two reported the results of large, targeted campaigns run in whole communities and cities. The evidence is current to August 2016. 
Key results 
The available evidence is insufficient to conclude whether targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups are more, less or equally effective in changing health behaviours than general mass media interventions. Only one study compared participants' smoking habits and intentions to quit following the receipt of either a culturally adapted smoking advice booklet or a booklet developed for the general population. They found little or no differences in smoking behaviours between the groups. 
When compared to no mass media intervention, a targeted mass media intervention may increase the number of calls to smoking quit lines, but the effect on health behaviours is unclear. This conclusion is based on findings from three studies. One study gave participants access to a series of 12 live shows on cable TV with information on how to maintain a healthy weight through diet and physical activity. Compared to women who did not watch the shows, participants reported slightly increased physical activity and some positive changes to their dietary patterns; however, their body weight was no different over time. Two other studies were large‐scale targeted campaigns in which smokers were encouraged to call a quit line for smoking cessation advice. The number of telephone calls from the target population increased considerably during the campaign. 
This review also compared targeted mass media interventions versus mass media interventions with added personal interactions. These findings, based on three studies, were inconclusive. 
None of the studies reported whether the interventions could have had any adverse effects, such as possible stigmatisation or increased resistance to messages. 
Further studies directly comparing targeted mass media interventions with general mass media interventions would be useful. Few studies have investigated the effects of targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups who primarily speak a non‐dominant language. 
Quality of the evidence 
Our confidence in the evidence of effect on all main outcomes is low to very low. This means that the true effect may be different or substantially different from the results presented in this review. We have moderate confidence in the estimated increase in the number of calls to smoking quit lines. 
","**1. Plain Title: Do Special Ads Help Minorities Live Healthier?**

**2. Rationale**

Many groups, like health experts, use ads on TV, radio, and social media. They want people to make healthier choices. These choices include being more active, eating better, not smoking, and drinking less alcohol.

This study looked at ads made for certain groups of people. These ads are called ""targeted."" They try to fit the needs of groups like ethnic minorities. The idea is to give everyone a fair chance to get health tips. They also want to help everyone make good health choices.

But we do not know if these special ads work better. We do not know if they work better than ads made for everyone. This study tried to find out. We wanted to see if targeted ads help ethnic minorities change their health habits more.

**3. Trial Design**

This study looked at six past studies. All these studies came from the United States. Four studies focused on African Americans. Two studies looked at people who came from Latino or Chinese backgrounds.

Four of these studies were like small tests. They had 1,693 people join them. Two other studies were big ad campaigns. These campaigns ran in whole cities or towns. The study looked at facts up to August 2016.

The studies compared different things. Some compared special ads to regular ads. Others compared special ads to no ads at all. A few compared special ads to ads plus personal talks.

**4. Results**

We did not find enough clear proof. So, we cannot say if special ads work better or worse. We cannot say if they work the same as regular ads.

Only one study looked at smoking. It compared a special booklet about quitting smoking. It also compared a general booklet. The study found almost no change in smoking habits between the two groups.

When there were no ads at all, special ads might help more people call quit lines for smoking. Quit lines are phone numbers you can call to get help to stop smoking. But we are not sure if this really changes health habits. Three studies looked at this.

One study used TV shows. The shows gave tips on healthy eating and being active. Women who watched the shows did move a bit more. They also made some better food choices. But their body weight did not change over time.

Two other studies had big campaigns. They told smokers to call a quit line. A lot more people from the target group called the quit line during the campaign.

The study also looked at special ads plus talking to someone. This was not clear either. We need more studies to know for sure.

None of the studies said if the ads caused any harm. For example, they did not say if people felt bad or did not want to listen.

We need more studies. We need studies that directly compare special ads to general ads. We also need studies for minority groups who speak a different language.

We are not very sure about these findings. This means the real answer might be different from what we found. But we are more sure that special ads can make more people call smoking quit lines.","Targeted mass media interventions to encourage healthier behaviours in adult, ethnic minorities

10.1002-14651858.CD012019,"Urinary biomarkers for the non‐invasive diagnosis of endometriosis
Review Question 
How accurate are urine test in detecting endometriosis? Can any urine test be accurate enough to replace or reduce the need for surgery in the diagnosis of endometriosis? 
Background 
Women with endometriosis have endometrial tissue (the tissue that lines the womb and is shed during menstruation) growing outside the womb within the pelvic cavity. This tissue responds to reproductive hormones causing painful periods, chronic lower abdominal pain and difficulty conceiving. Currently, the only reliable way of diagnosing endometriosis is to perform laparoscopic surgery and visualise the endometrial deposits inside the abdomen. Because surgery is risky and expensive, urine tests have been evaluated for their ability to detect endometriosis non‐invasively. An accurate urine test could lead to the diagnosis of endometriosis without the need for surgery; or it could reduce the need for diagnostic surgery, so only women who were most likely to have endometriosis would require it. Other non‐invasive ways of diagnosing endometriosis using blood, imaging, endometrial and combination tests are evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews from this series. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence included in this review is current to July 2015. We included eight studies involving 646 participants. All studies evaluated reproductive‐aged women who were undertaking diagnostic surgery to investigate symptoms of endometriosis or for other indications. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of four urinary biomarkers, including four biomarkers that were expressed differently in women with and without endometriosis and one showing no difference between the two groups. Three other studies just identified three biomarkers that did not distinguish the two groups. 
Key results 
None of the assessed biomarkers, including cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), enolase 1 (NNE), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and urinary peptide profiling have been evaluated by enough studies to provide a meaningful assessment of test accuracy. None of the tests were accurate enough to replace diagnostic surgery. Several studies identified biomarkers that might be of value in diagnosing endometriosis, but there are too few reports to be sure of their diagnostic benefit. There is not enough evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. 
Quality of the evidence 
Generally, the reports were of low methodological quality and urine tests were only assessed in small individual studies. 
Future research 
More high quality research trials are needed to accurately assess the diagnostic potential of urinary biomarkers identified in small numbers of studies as having value in detecting endometriosis. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary based on the provided abstract:

## Plain Title: Urine Tests for Finding Endometriosis

### Rationale

Many women have a problem called endometriosis. This is when tissue like the lining of the womb grows outside the womb. This tissue can be in places like the tummy area. It reacts to body hormones. This can cause very painful periods. It can also cause ongoing pain in the lower tummy. Some women also find it hard to get pregnant.

Right now, doctors must do surgery to find endometriosis. This surgery is called laparoscopy. They look inside the tummy for the tissue. Surgery has risks. It can also be costly. So, doctors want an easier way to find endometriosis.

Researchers looked at urine tests. They wanted to see if a simple urine test could find endometriosis. If a good urine test existed, it could mean less surgery. It might even stop the need for surgery. This study aimed to see if urine tests could help women avoid surgery.

### Trial Design

This study asked a main question: How well do urine tests find endometriosis? Could a urine test be good enough to take the place of surgery? Or, could it at least lower the need for surgery?

This study looked at past research. It gathered facts up to July of 2015. The study included eight other studies. These studies looked at 646 women in total. All the women were of childbearing age. They were having surgery. Doctors were looking for endometriosis during their surgery. Or, they were having surgery for other reasons.

Five of the studies checked how well four urine markers worked. Markers are like signs in the urine. These markers were different in women with endometriosis. They were different from women who did not have it. One marker was not different in the two groups. Three other studies found three markers that did not help tell the groups apart. The study looked at how well these urine markers could spot endometriosis.

### Results

The study looked at several urine markers. These included CK 19, NNE, VDBP, and certain small proteins. But, not enough studies checked these markers. So, we cannot say how well they really work.

None of the urine tests were good enough. They could not take the place of surgery to find endometriosis. Some studies found markers that might be useful. But there were too few reports to be sure. We do not have enough facts. So, we cannot suggest using any urine test right now. We need more studies to know for sure.

The studies found some markers that might help in the future. But, right now, there is not enough proof. Doctors cannot use these urine tests yet to find endometriosis. More strong research is needed. This will help doctors know if these urine tests can truly help patients.","Urinary biomarkers for the non‐invasive diagnosis of endometriosis
Review Question 
How accurate are urine test in detecting endometriosis? Can any urine test be accurate enough to replace or reduce the need for surgery in the diagnosis of endometriosis? 
Background 
Women with endometriosis have endometrial tissue (the tissue that lines the womb and is shed during menstruation) growing outside the womb within the pelvic cavity. This tissue responds to reproductive hormones causing painful periods, chronic lower abdominal pain and difficulty conceiving. Currently, the only reliable way of diagnosing endometriosis is to perform laparoscopic surgery and visualise the endometrial deposits inside the abdomen. Because surgery is risky and expensive, urine tests have been evaluated for their ability to detect endometriosis non‐invasively. An accurate urine test could lead to the diagnosis of endometriosis without the need for surgery; or it could reduce the need for diagnostic surgery, so only women who were most likely to have endometriosis would require it. Other non‐invasive ways of diagnosing endometriosis using blood, imaging, endometrial and combination tests are evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews from this series. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence included in this review is current to July 2015. We included eight studies involving 646 participants. All studies evaluated reproductive‐aged women who were undertaking diagnostic surgery to investigate symptoms of endometriosis or for other indications. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of four urinary biomarkers, including four biomarkers that were expressed differently in women with and without endometriosis and one showing no difference between the two groups. Three other studies just identified three biomarkers that did not distinguish the two groups. 
Key results 
None of the assessed biomarkers, including cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), enolase 1 (NNE), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and urinary peptide profiling have been evaluated by enough studies to provide a meaningful assessment of test accuracy. None of the tests were accurate enough to replace diagnostic surgery. Several studies identified biomarkers that might be of value in diagnosing endometriosis, but there are too few reports to be sure of their diagnostic benefit. There is not enough evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. 
Quality of the evidence 
Generally, the reports were of low methodological quality and urine tests were only assessed in small individual studies. 
Future research 
More high quality research trials are needed to accurately assess the diagnostic potential of urinary biomarkers identified in small numbers of studies as having value in detecting endometriosis.

Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and debilitating condition. Several pharmacological interventions have been proposed with the aim to prevent or mitigate it. These interventions should balance efficacy and tolerability, given that not all individuals exposed to a traumatic event will develop PTSD. There are different possible approaches to preventing PTSD; universal prevention is aimed at individuals at risk of developing PTSD on the basis of having been exposed to a traumatic event, irrespective of whether they are showing signs of psychological difficulties. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of pharmacological interventions for universal prevention of PTSD in adults exposed to a traumatic event. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMDCTR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trials registers (November 2020). We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. The search was last updated on 13 November 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials on adults exposed to any kind of traumatic event. We considered comparisons of any medication with placebo or with another medication. We excluded trials that investigated medications as an augmentation to psychotherapy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. In a random‐effects model, we analysed dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/NNTH). We analysed continuous data as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). 
Main results
We included 13 studies which considered eight interventions (hydrocortisone, propranolol, dexamethasone, omega‐3 fatty acids, gabapentin, paroxetine, PulmoCare enteral formula, Oxepa enteral formula and 5‐hydroxytryptophan) and involved 2023 participants, with a single trial contributing 1244 participants. Eight studies enrolled participants from emergency departments or trauma centres or similar settings. Participants were exposed to a range of both intentional and unintentional traumatic events. Five studies considered participants in the context of intensive care units with traumatic events consisting of severe physical illness. Our concerns about risk of bias in the included studies were mostly due to high attrition and possible selective reporting. We could meta‐analyse data for two comparisons: hydrocortisone versus placebo, but limited to secondary outcomes; and propranolol versus placebo. No study compared hydrocortisone to placebo at the primary endpoint of three months after the traumatic event. 
The evidence on whether propranolol was more effective in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms compared to placebo at three months after the traumatic event is inconclusive, because of serious risk of bias amongst the included studies, serious inconsistency amongst the studies' results, and very serious imprecision of the estimate of effect (SMD ‐0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.61 to 0.59; I2 = 83%; 3 studies, 86 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No study provided data on dropout rates due to side effects at three months post‐traumatic event. The evidence on whether propranolol was more effective than placebo in reducing the probability of experiencing PTSD at three months after the traumatic event is inconclusive, because of serious risk of bias amongst the included studies, and very serious imprecision of the estimate of effect (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92; 3 studies, 88 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No study assessed functional disability or quality of life.  
Only one study compared gabapentin to placebo at the primary endpoint of three months after the traumatic event, with inconclusive evidence in terms of both PTSD severity and probability of experiencing PTSD, because of imprecision of the effect estimate, serious risk of bias and serious imprecision (very low‐certainty evidence). We found no data on dropout rates due to side effects, functional disability or quality of life. 
For the remaining comparisons, the available data are inconclusive or missing in terms of PTSD severity reduction and dropout rates due to adverse events. No study assessed functional disability. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides uncertain evidence only regarding the use of hydrocortisone, propranolol, dexamethasone, omega‐3 fatty acids, gabapentin, paroxetine, PulmoCare formula, Oxepa formula, or 5‐hydroxytryptophan as universal PTSD prevention strategies. Future research might benefit from larger samples, better reporting of side effects and inclusion of quality of life and functioning measures. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### A Look at Medicines to Stop PTSD Before it Starts

### Why This Study Matters

Traumatic events can change lives. Some people who go through scary events develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, called PTSD. PTSD can make daily life very hard. It can cause bad memories, trouble sleeping, and strong feelings of fear.

Doctors want to find ways to help people. They want to stop PTSD before it even starts. This study looked at medicines. These medicines might help people who have just gone through a trauma. The goal is to see if these medicines can stop PTSD from forming.

We want to know if medicines can keep people from getting PTSD. We also want to know if these medicines are safe to use. Not everyone will get PTSD after a bad event. So, any medicine needs to be helpful and have few side effects.

### How We Did This Study

This study looked at many other studies. It gathered facts about adults. These adults had just gone through a traumatic event. This could be an accident or a serious illness.

The studies compared medicines to a ""sugar pill,"" called a placebo. A placebo has no medicine in it. Some studies also compared one medicine to another. We only looked at studies where people were chosen by chance. This helps make sure the results are fair.

We wanted to know two main things. Did the medicine work? And were there bad side effects? We looked at how severe PTSD symptoms were. We also checked if people dropped out of the study because of side effects.

### What We Found

We looked at 13 studies. These studies included over 2000 people. They tested eight different medicines. These medicines included hydrocortisone, propranolol, and gabapentin. Many people in these studies came from emergency rooms. They had just been through a trauma. Some were also in intensive care for serious sickness.

For most medicines, we could not say for sure if they worked. The studies did not give clear answers. This was often because the studies were too small. Or, there were problems with how the studies were done.

For example, we looked at propranolol. It might reduce PTSD symptoms. But the facts were not strong enough to say for sure. We could not tell if it stopped PTSD from happening. There were also no facts about side effects.

The same was true for gabapentin. One study looked at it. But the facts were not clear. We could not tell if it helped with PTSD symptoms. We also did not know about side effects.

Many studies did not have all the facts we needed. They did not say if people's lives got better. They also did not talk about how the medicine affected their daily activities.

**In short, we still do not know if these medicines can stop PTSD.** The facts we have are not clear. More research is needed. Future studies need to be bigger. They need to report all the details. This includes side effects. They also need to look at how people's quality of life changes.","Medicines for preventing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Why is this review important? 
Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and disabling condition which may develop in people exposed to traumatic events. Such events can have long‐lasting negative repercussions on the lives of those who have experienced them, as well as on the lives of loved ones. 
Research has shown that there are some alterations in how the brain works in people with PTSD. Some researchers have thus proposed using medicines to target these alterations soon after a traumatic event, as a way to prevent the development of PTSD. However, the majority of people who experience a traumatic event will not develop PTSD. Therefore, medicines that can be given soon after exposure to a traumatic event must be carefully evaluated for their effectiveness, including balancing the risk of side effects against the risk of developing PTSD. 
Who will be interested? 
‐ People exposed to traumatic events and their family, friends, and loved ones
‐ Professionals working in mental health 
‐ Professionals working in traumatology and emergency medicine
‐ People caring for victims of traumatic experiences and veterans of the armed forces
What questions did this review try to answer? 
For people exposed to a traumatic event, whether or not they have psychological symptoms, are some medicines more effective than other medicines or placebo (dummy pills) in: 
‐ reducing the severity of symptoms of PTSD?
‐ reducing the number of people stopping the medication because of side effects?
‐ reducing the probability of developing PTSD?
Which studies were included? 
We searched scientific databases for studies in which participants were randomly assigned to a medicine with the aim of preventing PTSD and its symptoms or reducing severity. We included studies published up until November 2020. We selected studies in adults who had experienced any kind of traumatic event, and which provided treatment, regardless of whether or not the participants had psychological symptoms. 
We included 13 studies, with a total of 2023 participants. One study alone contributed 1244 participants. The studies took place in different settings and involved people exposed to a wide range of traumatic events. Some studies took place in emergency departments and considered people whose trauma resulted from intentional harm or unintentional harm. Other studies focused on life‐threatening illness as the source of trauma, including major surgeries or being admitted to intensive care units. The medicines most commonly given to participants in the studies included: hydrocortisone (which reduces the body's immune response), propranolol (used to treat heart problems and anxiety, amongst other conditions), and gabapentin (a medicine primarily used to treat seizures and nerve pain). 
What did the evidence tell us? 
We found four trials comparing hydrocortisone to placebo. These trials did not report how participants were doing at three months after a traumatic event, a time point that is usually useful to assess the evolution of PTSD symptoms. 
We found very low‐certainty evidence about propranolol compared to placebo three months after a traumatic event. This evidence does not tell us whether or not propranolol is more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms and the probability of developing PTSD. We did not find evidence on the probability of people stopping the medication because of side effects, quality of life, or functional disability (a measure of how much one’s life is limited by symptoms). 
We found very low‐certainty evidence about gabapentin compared to placebo three months after a traumatic event. This evidence does not tell us whether or not gabapentin is more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms and the probability of developing PTSD. We did not find evidence on the probability of people stopping the medication because of side effects, quality of life, or functional disability. 
We found studies on additional medicines, for which information about the reduction of PTSD severity and the probability of people stopping the medication was either inconclusive or missing. 
None of the included studies measured the functional disability of participants.
What should happen next? 
The evidence we found does not support the use of any medicines for the prevention of PTSD in people exposed to a traumatic event, regardless of whether or not they have psychological symptoms. More higher quality studies involving more people are needed to draw conclusions about these treatments.

10.1002-14651858.CD010621.pub2,"Background
Keratoconus is a condition of the eye that affects approximately 1 in 2000 people. The disease leads to a gradual increase in corneal curvature and decrease in visual acuity with consequent impact on quality of life. Collagen cross‐linking (CXL) with ultraviolet A (UVA) light and riboflavin (vitamin B2) is a relatively new treatment that has been reported to slow or halt the progression of the disease in its early stages. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess whether there is evidence that CXL is an effective and safe treatment for halting the progression of keratoconus compared to no treatment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2014), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to August 2014), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled‐trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 28 August 2014. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where CXL with UVA light and riboflavin was used to treat people with keratoconus and was compared to no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed trial quality, and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were two indicators of progression at 12 months: increase in maximum keratometry of 1.5 dioptres (D) or more and deterioration in uncorrected visual acuity of more than 0.2 logMAR. 
Main results
We included three RCTs conducted in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States that enrolled a total of 225 eyes and analysed 219 eyes. The total number of people enrolled was not clear in two of the studies. Only adults were enrolled into these studies. Out of the eyes analysed, 119 had CXL (all using the epithelium‐off technique) and 100 served as controls. One of these studies only reported comparative data on review outcomes. All three studies were at high risk for performance bias (lack of masking), detection bias (only one trial attempted to mask outcome assessment), and attrition bias (incomplete follow‐up). It was not possible to pool data due to differences in measuring and reporting outcomes. We identified a further three unpublished trials that potentially had enrolled a total of 195 participants. 
There was limited evidence on the risk of progression. Analysis of the first few participants followed up to one year in one study suggested that eyes given CXL were less likely to have an increase in maximum keratometry of 1.5 D or more at 12 months compared to eyes given no treatment, but the confidence intervals (CI) were wide and compatible with no effect or more progression in the CXL group (risk ratio (RR) 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.00, 19 eyes). The same study reported the number of eyes with an increase of 2 D or more at 36 months in the whole cohort with a RR of 0.03 favouring CXL (95% CI 0.00 to 0.43, 94 eyes). Another study reported ""progression"" at 18 months using a different definition; people receiving CXL were less likely to progress, but again the effect was uncertain (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.61, 44 eyes). We judged this to be very low‐quality evidence due to the risk of bias of included studies, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias but noted that the size of the potential effect was large. 
On average, treated eyes had a less steep cornea (approximately 2 D less steep) (mean difference (MD) ‐1.92, 95% CI ‐2.54 to ‐1.30, 94 eyes, 1 RCT, very low‐quality evidence) and better uncorrected visual acuity (approximately 2 lines or 10 letters better) (MD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.31 to ‐0.09, 94 eyes, 1 RCT, very low‐quality evidence) at 12 months. None of the studies reported loss of 0.2 logMAR acuity. The data on corneal thickness were inconsistent. There were no data available on quality of life or costs. Adverse effects were not uncommon but mostly transient and of low clinical significance. In one trial, 3 out of 12 participants treated with CXL had an adverse effect including corneal oedema, anterior chamber inflammation, and recurrent corneal erosions. In one trial at 3 years 3 out of 50 participants experienced adverse events including mild diffuse corneal oedema and paracentral infiltrate, peripheral corneal vascularisation, and subepithelial infiltrates and anterior chamber inflammation. No adverse effects were reported in the control groups. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence for the use of CXL in the management of keratoconus is limited due the lack of properly conducted RCTs. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the provided abstract:

## Plain Title
New Eye Treatment for Thinning Cornea

## Rationale
Keratoconus is an eye problem. It makes the front of the eye, called the cornea, thinner and bulge outwards. This change makes vision blurry and worse over time. About 1 in 2000 people have this issue. It can make daily life hard for them.

Doctors want to find a good way to stop this problem from getting worse. A new treatment called Collagen Cross-Linking (CXL) might help. It uses special light (UVA) and a vitamin (riboflavin). This treatment may make the cornea stronger. We want to see if CXL can stop keratoconus from getting worse.

## Trial Design
We looked at past studies. These studies checked if CXL treatment helped people with keratoconus. They compared people who got CXL to people who did not get CXL. All people in these studies were adults. The studies looked at how their eyes changed over about one to three years.

We wanted to know how well CXL worked. We also checked if it was safe. We looked for studies that randomly put people into two groups. One group got the CXL treatment. The other group did not get any special treatment.

## Results
We found three studies to look at. These studies included 225 eyes in total. About 119 eyes got CXL. 100 eyes did not get CXL. All people in these studies were adults.

It was hard to combine all the study results. The studies measured things in different ways. Some studies did not clearly report all the details. We think the studies may have some flaws in how they were done.

One study saw that eyes treated with CXL had less chance of getting worse. Their corneas became less steep. Treated eyes also had better vision. This means they could see about two lines better on an eye chart.

Some people had side effects from CXL. These were mostly minor and went away. Things like swelling or redness of the eye happened. People who did not get treatment did not have these problems.

We need more good studies. These new studies should be done very carefully. This will help us know for sure if CXL is the best treatment. We want to know how much it helps people and if it is fully safe.","Corneal collagen cross‐linking for thinning of the transparent front part of the eye ('keratoconus') 
Review question  Is corneal collagen cross‐linking (CXL) a good treatment for slowing down the progression of keratoconus? 
Background  Keratoconus is a condition where the transparent front of the eye (cornea) gets thinner and begins to bulge. This leads to vision problems, usually short‐sightedness (distant objects appear blurred). The condition is more common in children and young adults and can deteriorate over time. Initially glasses and contact lenses can help. If the disease progresses, the only option may be a corneal transplant. 
CXL is a new treatment for keratoconus. The eye doctor removes the outer layer of the cornea, puts in vitamin B2 eye drops, and then treats the eye with ultraviolet A light radiation. This can be done in outpatients and takes about an hour. 
Study characteristics  The searches are current to August 2014. We found three randomised controlled trials, which were done in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A total of 219 eyes were randomly allocated to treatment with CXL or no treatment. In all three studies the surgery was done in the same way. None of the studies included children. 
Key results  Eyes treated with CXL were less likely to have problems with progression of bulging compared to eyes that were not treated. However, the studies were small and there were some concerns about the way they were done. It is therefore difficult to say exactly how much the treatment helped. None of the studies reported the risk of eyesight getting worse but, on average, treated eyes had better vision (about 10 letters better) compared to untreated eyes. None of the studies reported on a change in quality of life for the participant. The main adverse effects were inflammation and swelling; this occurred in approximately one in 10 participants. 
Quality of the evidence  We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low because of problems in the way the studies were done and reported and the small number of eyes included.

10.1002-14651858.CD014484,"Background
Misoprostol given orally is a commonly used labour induction method. Our Cochrane Review is restricted to studies with low‐dose misoprostol (initially ≤ 50 µg), as higher doses pose unacceptably high risks of uterine hyperstimulation. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of low‐dose oral misoprostol for labour induction in women with a viable fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov,  the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (14 February 2021) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing low‐dose oral misoprostol (initial dose ≤ 50 µg) versus placebo, vaginal dinoprostone, vaginal misoprostol, oxytocin, or mechanical methods; or comparing oral misoprostol protocols (one‐ to two‐hourly versus four‐ to six‐hourly; 20 µg to 25 µg versus 50 µg; or 20 µg hourly titrated versus 25 µg two‐hourly static). 
Data collection and analysis
Using Covidence, two review authors independently screened reports, extracted trial data, and performed quality assessments. Our primary outcomes were vaginal birth within 24 hours, caesarean section, and hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes. 
Main results
We included 61 trials involving 20,026 women. GRADE assessments ranged from moderate‐ to very low‐certainty evidence, with downgrading decisions based on imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations. 
Oral misoprostol versus placebo/no treatment (four trials; 594 women) 
Oral misoprostol may make little to no difference in the rate of caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.11; 4 trials; 594 women; moderate‐certainty evidence), while its effect on uterine hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes is uncertain (RR 5.15, 95% CI 0.25 to 105.31; 3 trials; 495 women; very low‐certainty evidence). Vaginal births within 24 hours was not reported. In all trials, oxytocin could be commenced after 12 to 24 hours and all women had pre‐labour ruptured membranes. 
Oral misoprostol versus vaginal dinoprostone (13 trials; 9676 women) 
Oral misoprostol probably results in fewer caesarean sections (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.90; 13 trials, 9676 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis indicated that 10 µg to 25 µg (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.87; 9 trials; 8652 women) may differ from 50 µg (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.34; 4 trials; 1024 women) for caesarean section. Oral misoprostol may decrease vaginal births within 24 hours (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; 10 trials; 8983 women; low‐certainty evidence) and hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.59; 11 trials; 9084 women; low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol versus vaginal misoprostol (33 trials; 6110 women) 
Oral use may result in fewer vaginal births within 24 hours (average RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95; 16 trials, 3451 women; low‐certainty evidence), and less hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.92, 25 trials, 4857 women, low‐certainty evidence), with subgroup analysis suggesting that 10 µg to 25 µg orally (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.57; 6 trials, 957 women) may be superior to 50 µg orally (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.11; 19 trials; 3900 women). Oral misoprostol probably does not increase caesarean sections overall (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; 32 trials; 5914 women; low‐certainty evidence) but likely results in fewer caesareans for foetal distress (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; 24 trials, 4775 women). 
Oral misoprostol versus intravenous oxytocin (6 trials; 737 women, 200 with ruptured membranes) 
Misoprostol may make little or no difference to vaginal births within 24 hours (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33; 3 trials; 466 women; low‐certainty evidence), but probably results in fewer caesarean sections (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 6 trials; 737 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). The effect on hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes is uncertain (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.26; 3 trials, 331 women; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol versus mechanical methods (6 trials; 2993 women) 
Six trials compared oral misoprostol to transcervical Foley catheter. Misoprostol may increase vaginal birth within 24 hours (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.79; 4 trials; 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence), and probably reduces the risk of caesarean section (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95; 6 trials; 2993 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.21; 4 trials; 2828 women; low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol one‐ to two‐hourly versus four‐ to six‐hourly (1 trial; 64 women) 
The evidence on hourly titration was very uncertain due to the low numbers reported.
Oral misoprostol 20 µg hourly titrated versus 25 µg two‐hourly static (2 trials; 296 women) 
The difference in regimen may have little or no effect on the rate of vaginal births in 24 hours (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is of very low certainty for all other reported outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Low‐dose oral misoprostol is probably associated with fewer caesarean sections (and therefore more vaginal births) than vaginal dinoprostone, and lower rates of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes. However, time to birth may be increased, as seen by a reduced number of vaginal births within 24 hours. 
Compared to transcervical Foley catheter, low‐dose oral misoprostol is associated with fewer caesarean sections, but equivalent rates of hyperstimulation. 
Low‐dose misoprostol given orally rather than vaginally is probably associated with similar rates of vaginal birth, although rates may be lower within the first 24 hours. However, there is likely less hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes, and fewer caesarean sections performed due to foetal distress. 
The best available evidence suggests that low‐dose oral misoprostol probably has many benefits over other methods for labour induction. This review supports the use of low‐dose oral misoprostol for induction of labour, and demonstrates the lower risks of hyperstimulation than when misoprostol is given vaginally. More trials are needed to establish the optimum oral misoprostol regimen, but these findings suggest that a starting dose of 25 µg may offer a good balance of efficacy and safety.  
","**1. Plain Title: Gentle Start to Labor: Using a Low-Dose Pill to Help Birth**

**2. Rationale**

Sometimes, women need help to start labor. This is called labor induction. One common way to do this is with a medicine called misoprostol. It is a pill you take by mouth.

When labor needs to start, it is important to find safe ways. High doses of misoprostol can cause problems. It can make the womb work too hard. This can be unsafe for the baby. So, doctors use a low dose of this pill.

This study looked at how well low-dose misoprostol works. It also checked how safe it is. We wanted to see if this pill helps women have their babies. We also checked if it causes any harm. This study helps doctors know the best way to help women start labor. We believe this pill can help women have a good birth experience.

**3. Trial Design: How Is This Study Designed?**

This study is a big review. It looked at many smaller studies. These smaller studies included women who needed help starting labor. All these women had a healthy baby in their womb. They were in their last three months of pregnancy.

In these studies, some women took a low dose of misoprostol by mouth. The starting dose was small, 50 micrograms or less. Other women received different treatments. Some had a sugar pill (placebo). Others received different ways to start labor. These included other medicines or tools.

Doctors checked how many women had their baby within 24 hours. They also checked how many women had a C-section. A C-section is surgery to deliver the baby. They also looked for problems. One problem is when the womb works too hard and affects the baby's heart. This study gathered facts from many births. This helps us learn more about safe birth options.

**4. Results: What Were the Main Results of the Study?**

This big review looked at 61 studies. A total of 20,026 women were part of these studies. We found that low-dose oral misoprostol has good benefits.

When compared to a sugar pill, oral misoprostol may not change the need for C-sections much. The effect on the womb working too hard was not clear.

When compared to another medicine called vaginal dinoprostone, oral misoprostol probably leads to fewer C-sections. This means more women had a natural birth. It also may cause less of the womb working too hard. This is good news for moms and babies. However, it might take a bit longer for birth to happen.

When compared to misoprostol placed in the vagina, the oral pill may also lead to less of the womb working too hard. It also led to fewer C-sections when babies were in distress. The number of natural births was similar.

Compared to a medicine given through a vein, oral misoprostol likely results in fewer C-sections. The effect on the womb working too hard was not clear.

When compared to tools that help open the cervix, oral misoprostol may help more women have a natural birth within 24 hours. It also likely lowers the chance of a C-section. There was little to no difference in the womb working too hard.

The study showed that low-dose oral misoprostol is a good choice to start labor. It may lead to fewer C-sections. It may also lower the risk of the womb working too hard, especially compared to misoprostol placed in the vagina. This is safer for the baby. The best starting dose seems to be around 25 micrograms. This offers a good balance of helping labor start and keeping mom and baby safe. More studies are needed to find the perfect way to give this medicine.","Low‐dose misoprostol given by mouth for induction of labour
We looked at the evidence from randomised controlled trials to see if low‐dose misoprostol given by mouth is effective in starting labour in women in their third trimester with a live baby. We compared misoprostol with other commonly used methods of inducing labour. 
What is the issue? 
Artificially starting labour, or induction, is common in pregnancy. Reasons include the mother having high blood pressure in pregnancy or the baby being past the due date. Misoprostol is a type of prostaglandin that can be taken in low doses by mouth to induce labour. Prostaglandins are hormone‐like compounds that are made by the body for various functions (including the natural onset of labour). Unlike other prostaglandins such as vaginal dinoprostone, misoprostol does not need to be stored in the refrigerator. Taking a tablet is convenient to mothers and the low‐dose tablet sizes are now available (25 µg).  
Why is this important? 
A good induction method achieves a safe birth for mother and baby. It is effective, results in a relatively low number of caesarean sections, has few side effects, and is highly acceptable to mothers. Some methods of inducing labour may cause more caesarean sections by being ineffective at bringing on labour, other methods may lead to more caesareans as they cause too many contractions (hyperstimulation) that result in the baby becoming distressed (foetal heart rate changes). 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 14 February 2021 and identified 61 trials involving 20,026 women for inclusion in this review. Not all trials were high quality. 
Starting with oral misoprostol immediately may have a similar effect on rates of caesarean section (4 trials, 594 women; low‐certainty evidence) to giving no treatment for 12 to 24 hours then starting oxytocin, while the effects of misoprostol on uterine hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes are unclear (3 trials, 495 women; very low‐quality evidence). All women in theses trials had ruptured membranes. 
Oral misoprostol was compared to vaginal dinoprostone in 13 trials (9676 women). Misoprostol use probably decreased the risk of caesarean section (moderate‐certainty evidence). When studies were divided by their initial dose of misoprostol, there was evidence that use of 10 µg to 25 µg may be effective in reducing the risk of a caesarean section (9 trials, 8652 women), while the higher 50 µg dose might not reduce the risk (4 trials, 1024 women). There may be very small or no differences between misoprostol and dinoprostone in rates of vaginal births within 24 hours (10 trials, 8983 women; low‐certainty evidence) but may be fewer cases of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes with oral misoprostol (11 trials, 9084 women; low‐certainty evidence).  
Oral misoprostol was compared with vaginal misoprostol in 33 trials (6110 women). Oral use may have resulted in fewer vaginal births within 24 hours (16 trials, 3451 women; low‐certainty evidence). Oral use may have caused less hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (25 trials, 4857 women; low‐certainty evidence), especially with a dose of 10 µg to 25 µg. There was no clear difference in the number of caesarean sections overall (32 trials, 5914 women; low‐certainty evidence) but oral use likely resulted in fewer caesareans being performed because of concerns of the baby being in distress (24 trials, 4775 women). 
When oral misoprostol was compared to oxytocin for induction, misoprostol use probably resulted in fewer caesarean sections (6 trials, 737 women). We found no clear difference in vaginal birth within 24 hours (3 trials, 466 women; moderate‐certainty evidence) or hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (3 trials, 331 women; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol was compared to a balloon catheter inserted in the cervix to mechanically induce labour. The number of vaginal births within 24 hours may have increased with misoprostol (4 trials, 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence). Misoprostol probably reduced the risk of caesarean section (6 trials, 2993 women; moderate‐certainty evidence) with no difference in risk of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (4 trials, 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence). 
Different doses and timings of giving oral misoprostol were explored in three small trials. The certainty of the findings from these trials was either low or very low so we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions from this data. 
What does this mean? 
Using low‐dose (50 µg or less) oral misoprostol to induce labour likely leads to fewer caesarean sections and so more vaginal births than vaginal dinoprostone, oxytocin, and a transcervical Foley catheter. Rates of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes were comparable with these methods. Misoprostol taken by mouth causes less hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes compared to when taken vaginally.  
More trials are needed to establish the most effective misoprostol regimen for labour induction, but for now the findings of this review support oral rather than vaginal use, and suggest that commencing oral misoprostol at a dose of 25 µg or less may be safe and effective.

What is Crohn's disease? 
Crohn’s disease is a long‐term condition that results in inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, occurring anywhere from the mouth to the anus. Common symptoms include fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss. Crohn's disease is characterized by periods of relapse when people are actively experiencing symptoms and periods of remission when the symptoms stop. 
What are Cannabis and Cannabinoids? 
Cannabis is a widely used drug which acts on the endocannabinoid system. Cannabis contains multiple components called cannabinoids. The use of cannabis and cannabis oil containing specific cannabinoids produces mental and physical effects such as altered sensory perception and euphoria when consumed. Some cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, do not have a psychoactive effect. Cannabis and cannabidiol have some anti‐inflammatory properties that might help people with Crohn's disease. 
What did the researchers investigate? 
The researchers studied whether cannabis is better than placebo (e.g. a sugar pill) therapy for treating adults with active Crohn's disease or Crohn's disease that is in remission. 
What did the researchers find? 
The researchers extensively searched the literature up to 17 October 2018 and found three studies (93 participants) that met the inclusion criteria. One ongoing study was also identified. All of the studies were small in size and had some quality issues. One small study (21 participants) compared eight weeks of treatment with cannabis cigarettes containing 115 mg of D9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to placebo cigarettes containing cannabis with the THC removed in participants with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. Although no difference in clinical remission rates was observed, more participants in the cannabis group had improvement in their Crohn's disease symptoms than participants in the placebo group. More side effects were observed in the cannabis cigarette group compared to placebo. These side effects were considered to be mild in nature and included sleepiness, nausea, difficulty with concentration, memory loss, confusion and dizziness. Participants in the cannabis cigarette group reported improvements in pain, appetite and satisfaction with treatment. 
One small study (22 participants) compared cannabis oil (10 mg of cannabidiol twice daily) to placebo oil (i.e. olive oil) in participants with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. No difference in clinical remission rates was observed. There was no difference in serious side effects. Serious side effects included worsening Crohn's disease in one participant in each group. 
One small study (50 participants) compared cannabis oil (composed of 15% cannabidiol and 4% THC) to placebo oil in participants with active Crohn's disease. Positive differences in quality of life and the Crohn's disease activity index were observed. 
Conclusions 
The effects of cannabis and cannabis oil on Crohn's disease are uncertain. No firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms (e.g. side effects) of cannabis and cannabis oil in adults with Crohn's disease can be drawn. The effects of cannabis and cannabis oil in people with Crohn's disease in remission have not been investigated. Further studies with larger numbers of participants are required to assess the potential benefits and harms of cannabis in Crohn's disease. Future studies should assess the effects of cannabis in people with active and inactive Crohn's disease. Different doses of cannabis and formulations (e.g. cannabis oil or pills) should be investigated.

## Plain Title: Does Cannabis Help People with Crohn's Disease?

### Rationale

Crohn's disease is a sickness that lasts a long time. It makes your gut swell up, anywhere from your mouth to your bottom. People with Crohn's often have fever, loose stools, belly pain, and lose weight. Sometimes their sickness gets worse (called a flare-up). Other times, their sickness gets better (called remission).

Doctors looked into cannabis. Cannabis has parts called cannabinoids. Some people use cannabis for fun, but it also has parts that might help with swelling. This means cannabis could help with the swelling that happens in Crohn's disease.

This study looked at whether cannabis can help people with Crohn's disease. We need to know if it can make symptoms better. We also need to know if it can cause problems.

### Trial Design

How did this study work?

The study looked at other small studies. These studies checked if cannabis or cannabis oil worked better than a fake medicine (like a sugar pill). The studies included grown-ups with Crohn's disease. Some had active Crohn's, meaning their symptoms were bad. Others were in remission, meaning their symptoms were quiet.

In one study, people smoked cannabis cigarettes. These had a part called THC. Other people smoked fake cigarettes with no THC. This study lasted for eight weeks.

Another study gave people cannabis oil. This oil had a part called cannabidiol. Other people got fake oil (olive oil). This study also looked at grown-ups.

A third study gave people cannabis oil with both cannabidiol and THC. Other people got fake oil.

These studies were small. They looked at how cannabis affected people’s symptoms and if they felt better. They also checked for any bad effects.

### Results

What did the studies find?

Doctors looked at three small studies. These studies had a total of 93 people. All the studies were small, and more research is needed.

One study had 21 people. They smoked cannabis cigarettes or fake cigarettes. People in the cannabis group felt better. Their Crohn's symptoms got better more often than the fake cigarette group. But cannabis also caused more small problems. These included feeling sleepy, sick to your stomach, dizzy, confused, or having trouble thinking. People who used cannabis also said their pain was better, they ate more, and they liked their treatment more.

Another study had 22 people. They used cannabis oil or fake oil. We did not see a clear difference in how many people felt better in this study. There were no big problems. One person in each group got worse, but this was rare.

A third study had 50 people. They used cannabis oil or fake oil. People who used cannabis oil said their quality of life was better. Their Crohn's disease activity also got better.

Overall, it's not clear if cannabis helps or hurts people with Crohn's disease. We need bigger studies with more people. We also need to look at different types of cannabis and how much to use. We need to study people with both active and quiet Crohn's disease.","Cannabis and cannabis oil for the treatment of Crohn's disease

10.1002-14651858.CD013845.pub2,"Background
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD; also known as autism) is a developmental disability that begins in childhood and is typically seen in around 1% to 2% of children. It is characterised by social communication difficulties and repetitive and restricted behaviours and routines that can have a negative impact on a child's quality of life, achievement at school, and social interactions with others. It has been hypothesised that memantine, which is traditionally used to treat dementia, may be effective in reducing the core symptoms of autism as well as some co‐occurring symptoms such as hyperactivity and language difficulties. If memantine is being used to treat the core symptoms of autism, it is important to review the evidence of its effectiveness. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of memantine on the core symptoms of autism, including, but not limited to, social communication and stereotypical behaviours. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases and three trials registers up to February 2022. We also checked reference lists of key studies and checked with experts in the field for any additional papers. We searched for retractions of the included studies in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Retraction Watch Database. No retractions or corrections were found. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any dose of memantine compared with placebo in autistic people. We also included RCTs in which only one group received memantine, but both groups received the same additional therapy (e.g. a behaviour intervention). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were core autism symptoms and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were language, intelligence, memory, adaptive behaviour, hyperactivity, and irritability. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included three RCTs (two double‐blind and one single‐blind) with 204 participants that examined the short‐term effect (immediately postintervention) of memantine in autistic people. Two studies took place in the USA and the other in Iran. All three studies focused on children and adolescents, with a mean age of 9.40 (standard deviation (SD) 2.26) years. Most participants were male (range across studies 73% to 87%). The diagnosis of ASD was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition; 4th edition, text revision; or 5th edition). To confirm the diagnosis, one study used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview‐Revised (ADI‐R); one used ADOS, ADI‐R or the Autism Diagnostic Interview Screener; and one used the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale. Dosage of memantine was based on the child's weight and ranged from 3 mg to 15 mg per day.  
Comparisons Two studies examined memantine compared with placebo; in the other study, both groups had a behavioural intervention while only one group was given memantine.  
Risk of biasAll studies were rated at high risk of bias overall, as they were at high or unclear risk of bias across all but four domains in one study, and all but two domains in the other two studies. One study was funded by Forest Laboratories, LLC, (Jersey City, New Jersey), Allergan. The study sponsor was involved in the study design, data collection (via contracted clinical investigator sites), analysis and interpretation of data, and the decision to present these results. The other two studies reported no financial support or sponsorship; though in one of the two, the study medication was an in‐kind contribution from Forest Pharmaceuticals. 
Primary outcomesThere was no clear evidence of a difference between memantine and placebo with respect to severity of core symptoms of autism, although we are very uncertain about the evidence. The standardised mean difference in autism symptoms score in the intervention group versus the control group was –0.74 standard deviations (95% confidence interval (CI) −2.07 to 0.58; 2 studies, 181 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; medium effect size); lower scores indicate less severe autistic symptoms. Two studies (144 participants) recorded adverse effects that the authors deemed related to the study and found there may be no difference between memantine and placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.39; low‐certainty evidence). 
Secondary outcomesThere may be no difference between memantine and placebo on language (2 studies, 144 participants; low‐certainty evidence); memory or adaptive behaviour (1 study, 23 participants; both low‐certainty evidence); or hyperactivity or irritability (1 study, 121 participants; both low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
It is unclear whether memantine is an effective treatment for autistic children. None of the three included trials reported on the effectiveness of memantine in adults. Further studies using rigorous designs, larger samples, longer follow‐up and clinically meaningful outcome measures that are important to autistic people and their families will strengthen our knowledge of the effects of memantine in autism. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Does Memantine Help Children with Autism?

### Rationale

Autism is a problem with how a child grows and learns. It starts early in life. About 1 or 2 children out of 100 have autism. Children with autism find it hard to talk with others. They often do things in the same way, over and over. This can make their daily life harder. It can affect how they do in school and how they make friends.

Doctors thought a medicine called memantine might help. This medicine is used for memory problems in older adults. But some thought it could also help with autism. It might lessen problems like being too active or having trouble speaking. We needed to check if memantine really helps children with autism.

### Trial Design

**How was this study set up?**

This study looked at three smaller studies. These studies checked if memantine worked for children with autism.

*   **Who was in the studies?** The studies included children and teens with autism. Their average age was about 9 years old. Most of them were boys.
*   **What was the medicine?** Children in the studies took memantine or a fake pill (placebo). The amount of memantine given was small. It was based on each child's weight. It ranged from 3 to 15 milligrams each day.
*   **How long did they take it?** The studies checked the effects of the medicine right after the children stopped taking it. This was a short-term check.
*   **Where were the studies done?** Two studies were in the United States. One was in Iran.
*   **How did they check autism?** Doctors used special tests to confirm if a child had autism. They also used tests to see if the symptoms got better.

In two studies, some children got memantine and others got a fake pill. In the third study, all children got help with their behavior. But only some of them also got memantine.

### Results

**What did the studies find?**

We looked at the results from all three studies. There were 204 children in total.

*   **Autism symptoms:** We are not sure if memantine made a clear difference in the main problems of autism. These include talking with others and doing things over and over. It is hard to say for sure from these studies. The evidence was not strong.
*   **Side effects:** The studies checked for bad effects from the medicine. It seemed there was no big difference in side effects between memantine and the fake pill.
*   **Other problems:** We also looked at things like speech, memory, and being too active. It seemed there was no clear difference with memantine for these problems either.

**What does this mean?**

Right now, we cannot say if memantine helps children with autism. The studies were small. They did not follow the children for a long time. They also mostly looked at children and teens. We do not know if memantine would help adults with autism.

**What do we need next?**

Doctors need to do more studies. These new studies should:

*   Be very well-planned.
*   Include many more children.
*   Follow children for a longer time.
*   Look at things that are truly important to families and children with autism.

This will help us learn more about memantine and autism.","Can a dementia medicine (memantine) help people with autism spectrum disorder?
BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (autism) is a condition that begins in childhood. Core symptoms include persistent difficulties with social communication (e.g. difficulties with back‐and‐forth conversations, communication without words, and in developing and maintaining relationships), and repetitive and restricted interests and behaviours (e.g. repetitive mannerisms, restricted interests and behaviours, resistance to change and sensory sensitivities). Around 1% to 2% of children have autism. Autistic people often have other conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, language impairments (e.g. difficulties understanding and using grammar) and intellectual disability. Autism can have negative impacts on quality of life, school achievement and social relationships. Memantine is a medication traditionally used to treat dementia, but some studies suggest that it may decrease core autistic symptoms. If memantine is being used to change the core symptoms of autism, it is important to assess whether it works and is safe. This review combines the research evidence on the use of memantine in autism. 
Review questionDoes memantine change the core symptoms of autism and related behaviours? 
Search dateThe evidence is current to 14 February 2022. 
Study characteristicsWe found three studies with 204 people that had evaluated the effectiveness of memantine in autism. All studies were randomised controlled trials, meaning participants were randomly allocated to receive either the treatment or a dummy pill (placebo). This is the best design for assessing the effectiveness of treatments. All three studies included children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, with an average age of 9.40 years. We found no studies in adults. The children received memantine (for 12 weeks in two studies and for 24 weeks in one study), and their behaviour was assessed before treatment and immediately after treatment. 
Study funding sourcesOne study was sponsored and funded by a laboratory that makes memantine (Forest). The study sponsor helped to design the study, collect information, analyse and interpret the information, and take the decision to publish the results. The authors of the other two smaller studies said they did not receive any funding; though in one of these studies, Forest Pharmaceuticals provided the medicine for free. 
Key resultsIt is unclear if memantine makes any difference to the core symptoms of autism. Additionally, there may be no difference between memantine and placebo in the occurrence of side effects, language ability, memory, adaptive behaviour or the autism‐related behaviours of hyperactivity and irritability. 
Limitations of the evidenceWe are not confident about the evidence for core symptoms of autism because it comes from only three small studies; because the studies included different types of people and delivered the medicine in different ways; and because the studies did not always provide information about everything we were interested in. Additionally, we have little confidence in the evidence on side effects and language because it comes from only two small studies; and we have little confidence in the evidence on intelligence, memory, adaptive behaviour, hyperactivity and irritability, because it comes from only one small study.

What was the aim of this review? To compare treatment with and without anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF) medications for people with neovascular glaucoma (NVG). 
Key message It is uncertain whether treatment with anti‐VEGF medications is more beneficial than treatment without anti‐VEGF medications for people with NVG. More research is needed to investigate the long‐term effect of anti‐VEGF medications compared with, or in addition to, conventional treatment. 
What did we study in this review? VEGF is a protein produced by cells in your body, and produces new blood vessels when needed. When cells produce too much VEGF, abnormal blood vessels can grow in the eye. NVG is a type of glaucoma where the angle between the iris (coloured part of the eye) and the cornea (transparent front part of the eye) is closed by new blood vessels growing in the eye, hence, the name 'neovascular'. New blood vessels can cause scarring and narrowing, which can eventually lead to complete closure of the angle. This results in increased eye pressure since the fluid in the eye cannot drain properly. In NVG, the eye is often red and painful, and the vision is abnormal. High pressure in the eye can lead to blindness. 
Anti‐VEGF medication is a type of medicine that blocks VEGF, therefore, slowing the growth of blood vessels. It is administered by injection into the eye. It can be used early stage, when conventional treatment may not be possible. Most studies report short‐term (generally four to six weeks) benefits of anti‐VEGF medication, but long‐term benefits are not clear. 
What were the main results of this review? We included four studies enrolling a total of 263 participants with NVG. In one study, results beyond the treatment period of 1 week could not be evaluated. In another study, results were uncertain due to the limitation of study design. 
The last two studies reported different results for lowering eye pressure; one study showed inconclusive results, and the other study showed that anti‐VEGF medications were more effective. The certainty of the evidence in these studies was low, due to limitations in the study designs and inconsistency of results. Therefore, available evidence is insufficient to recommend the routine use of anti‐VEGF medication in individuals with NVG. 
How up to date is the review? We searched for studies that were published up to 22 March 2019. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary based on the provided abstract:

## Plain Title
Study on a New Medicine for Eye Pressure Caused by New Blood Vessels

## Rationale

Your eye has fluid inside it. This fluid needs to drain out. If it does not drain well, pressure builds up in your eye. This high pressure can hurt your eyesight and even cause blindness.

Sometimes, new blood vessels grow where they should not. This can happen in your eye. When these new blood vessels grow too much, they can block the eye's drain. This causes a type of eye problem called neovascular glaucoma, or NVG. People with NVG often have a red, painful eye and blurry vision.

Our bodies make a protein called VEGF. VEGF helps new blood vessels grow when we need them. But if your body makes too much VEGF, too many new blood vessels can grow in your eye. This makes NVG worse.

There is a medicine called anti-VEGF. This medicine stops VEGF from working. By doing this, it can slow down or stop the growth of bad blood vessels in the eye. Doctors can inject this medicine right into the eye. It might help when other treatments are not possible yet. Early studies showed it might help for a short time. This study wanted to see if anti-VEGF helps people with NVG. We wanted to know if it is better than not using it.

## Trial Design

This study looked at past studies. It asked: ""How well does anti-VEGF medicine work for NVG?""

We looked at studies about people who had NVG. These studies included both men and women. We did not specify their age range, but they all had NVG.

The studies compared two groups. One group got anti-VEGF medicine. The other group did not get anti-VEGF medicine. The goal was to see if the medicine helped lower eye pressure. It also looked at how it affected vision.

The studies we reviewed looked at short periods. This was usually about one to six weeks.

## Results

We looked at four studies. These studies included 263 people with NVG.

One study could not tell us much. Its results were only for one week. Another study also had unclear results. This was because of how it was set up.

The other two studies had mixed results. One study did not show clear benefits for lowering eye pressure. The other study said anti-VEGF medicine did help lower eye pressure.

Overall, the studies we found were not strong enough. The ways they were designed had problems. Also, their results did not always agree.

Because of this, we cannot say for sure if anti-VEGF medicine should be used often for people with NVG. More research is needed to learn if anti-VEGF medicine helps for a long time. It also needs to be compared with or used with other treatments.

We looked for studies that were published up to March 22, 2019.","Anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor for neovascular glaucoma

What did we study in this review? VEGF is a protein produced by cells in your body, and produces new blood vessels when needed. When cells produce too much VEGF, abnormal blood vessels can grow in the eye. NVG is a type of glaucoma where the angle between the iris (coloured part of the eye) and the cornea (transparent front part of the eye) is closed by new blood vessels growing in the eye, hence, the name 'neovascular'. New blood vessels can cause scarring and narrowing, which can eventually lead to complete closure of the angle. This results in increased eye pressure since the fluid in the eye cannot drain properly. In NVG, the eye is often red and painful, and the vision is abnormal. High pressure in the eye can lead to blindness. 
Anti‐VEGF medication is a type of medicine that blocks VEGF, therefore, slowing the growth of blood vessels. It is administered by injection into the eye. It can be used early stage, when conventional treatment may not be possible. Most studies report short‐term (generally four to six weeks) benefits of anti‐VEGF medication, but long‐term benefits are not clear. 
What were the main results of this review? We included four studies enrolling a total of 263 participants with NVG. In one study, results beyond the treatment period of 1 week could not be evaluated. In another study, results were uncertain due to the limitation of study design. 
The last two studies reported different results for lowering eye pressure; one study showed inconclusive results, and the other study showed that anti‐VEGF medications were more effective. The certainty of the evidence in these studies was low, due to limitations in the study designs and inconsistency of results. Therefore, available evidence is insufficient to recommend the routine use of anti‐VEGF medication in individuals with NVG. 
How up to date is the review? We searched for studies that were published up to 22 March 2019.

10.1002-14651858.CD013518.pub2,"Background
Asthma affects 350 million people worldwide including 45% to 70% with mild disease. Treatment is mainly with inhalers containing beta₂‐agonists, typically taken as required to relieve bronchospasm, and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as regular preventive therapy. Poor adherence to regular therapy is common and increases the risk of exacerbations, morbidity and mortality. Fixed‐dose combination inhalers containing both a steroid and a fast‐acting beta₂‐agonist (FABA) in the same device simplify inhalers regimens and ensure symptomatic relief is accompanied by preventative therapy. Their use is established in moderate asthma, but they may also have potential utility in mild asthma. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of single combined (fast‐onset beta₂‐agonist plus an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)) inhaler only used as needed in people with mild asthma. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal. We contacted trial authors for further information and requested details regarding the possibility of unpublished trials. The most recent search was conducted on 19 March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cross‐over trials with at least one week washout period. We included studies of a single fixed‐dose FABA/ICS inhaler used as required compared with no treatment, placebo, short‐acting beta agonist (SABA) as required, regular ICS with SABA as required, regular fixed‐dose combination ICS/long‐acting beta agonist (LABA), or regular fixed‐dose combination ICS/FABA with as required ICS/FABA. We planned to include cluster‐randomised trials if the data had been or could be adjusted for clustering. We excluded trials shorter than 12 weeks. We included full texts, abstracts and unpublished data. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (OR) or rate ratios (RR) and continuous data as mean difference (MD). We reported 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures of meta‐analysis. We applied the GRADE approach to summarise results and to assess the overall certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring systemic steroids, hospital admissions/emergency department or urgent care visits for asthma, and measures of asthma control. 
Main results
We included six studies of which five contributed results to the meta‐analyses. All five used budesonide 200 μg and formoterol 6 μg in a dry powder formulation as the combination inhaler. Comparator fast‐acting bronchodilators included terbutaline and formoterol. Two studies included children aged 12+ and adults; two studies were open‐label. A total of 9657 participants were included, with a mean age of 36 to 43 years. 2.3% to 11% were current smokers. 
FABA / ICS as required versus FABA as required 
Compared with as‐required FABA alone, as‐required FABA/ICS reduced exacerbations requiring systemic steroids (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.60, 2 RCTs, 2997 participants, high‐certainty evidence), equivalent to 109 people out of 1000 in the FABA alone group experiencing an exacerbation requiring systemic steroids, compared to 52 (95% CI 40 to 68) out of 1000 in the FABA/ICS as‐required group. FABA/ICS as required may also reduce the odds of an asthma‐related hospital admission or emergency department or urgent care visit (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.60, 2 RCTs, 2997 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Compared with as‐required FABA alone, any changes in asthma control or spirometry, though favouring as‐required FABA/ICS, were small and less than the minimal clinically‐important differences. We did not find evidence of differences in asthma‐associated quality of life or mortality. For other secondary outcomes FABA/ICS as required was associated with reductions in fractional exhaled nitric oxide, probably reduces the odds of an adverse event (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95, 2 RCTs, 3002 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and may reduce total systemic steroid dose (MD ‐9.90, 95% CI ‐19.38 to ‐0.42, 1 RCT, 443 participants, low‐certainty evidence), and with an increase in the daily inhaled steroid dose (MD 77 μg beclomethasone equiv./day, 95% CI 69 to 84, 2 RCTs, 2554 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
FABA/ICS as required versus regular ICS plus FABA as required 
There may be little or no difference in the number of people with asthma exacerbations requiring systemic steroid with FABA/ICS as required compared with regular ICS (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.07, 4 RCTs, 8065 participants, low‐certainty evidence), equivalent to 81 people out of 1000 in the regular ICS plus FABA group experiencing an exacerbation requiring systemic steroids, compared to 65 (95% CI 49 to 86) out of 1000 FABA/ICS as required group. The odds of an asthma‐related hospital admission or emergency department or urgent care visit may be reduced in those taking FABA/ICS as required (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91, 4 RCTs, 8065 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Compared with regular ICS, any changes in asthma control, spirometry, peak flow rates (PFR), or asthma‐associated quality of life, though favouring regular ICS, were small and less than the minimal clinically important differences (MCID). Adverse events, serious adverse events, total systemic corticosteroid dose and mortality were similar between groups, although deaths were rare, so confidence intervals for this analysis were wide. We found moderate‐certainty evidence from four trials involving 7180 participants that FABA/ICS as required was likely associated with less average daily exposure to inhaled corticosteroids than those on regular ICS (MD ‐154.51 μg/day, 95% CI ‐207.94 to ‐101.09). 
Authors' conclusions
We found FABA/ICS as required is clinically effective in adults and adolescents with mild asthma. Their use instead of FABA as required alone reduced exacerbations, hospital admissions or unscheduled healthcare visits and exposure to systemic corticosteroids and probably reduces adverse events. FABA/ICS as required is as effective as regular ICS and reduced asthma‐related hospital admissions or unscheduled healthcare visits, and average exposure to ICS, and is unlikely to be associated with an increase in adverse events. 
Further research is needed to explore use of FABA/ICS as required in children under 12 years of age, use of other FABA/ICS preparations, and long‐term outcomes beyond 52 weeks. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study:

### Plain Title
Better Asthma Care for Mild Asthma

### Rationale

Asthma makes it hard to breathe. About 350 million people around the world have asthma. Many of them have mild asthma. This means their symptoms are not always severe.

People often use inhalers for asthma. Some inhalers stop attacks when they happen. These are called beta₂‐agonists. Other inhalers prevent attacks. These have steroids and are used every day.

Sometimes, people do not use their daily inhaler as they should. This can make their asthma worse. It can lead to more asthma attacks. It can also make them very sick.

A new type of inhaler helps with this problem. It has both a steroid and a quick-acting medicine. This ""two-in-one"" inhaler can be used only when needed. It gives quick relief. It also provides medicine to prevent attacks. This may be a good choice for people with mild asthma. This study looked at how well it works. It also checked if it is safe.

### Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

We looked at many past studies. These studies were called randomized controlled trials. Some were also crossover trials. In these studies, people got different treatments. This helps us compare how well each treatment works.

We looked at studies where people used a single inhaler. This inhaler had both a steroid and a fast-acting medicine. They used it only when they needed it. We compared this to other ways of treating asthma. These included:

*   No treatment
*   A fake medicine (placebo)
*   Only a fast-acting inhaler when needed
*   A daily steroid inhaler plus a fast-acting inhaler when needed
*   Other combined inhalers used daily or when needed

We only looked at studies that lasted at least 12 weeks. This helps us see long-term effects. We included information from papers and other records.

The people in these studies had mild asthma. They were often adults. Some studies also included teens 12 years and older. The average age was 36 to 43 years old. A small number of people were smokers. We gathered all this information to see the full picture.

### Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

We looked at six studies. Five of them gave us results to compare. All five studies used a specific combined inhaler. It had budesonide (steroid) and formoterol (fast-acting medicine).

**Compared to using only a fast-acting inhaler when needed:**

The combined inhaler worked much better. It cut the number of bad asthma attacks in half. These are attacks that needed strong steroid medicine. Out of 1000 people, 109 had a bad attack with the fast-acting inhaler. Only 52 people had one with the combined inhaler.

The combined inhaler also likely lowered urgent doctor visits for asthma. This means fewer trips to the hospital or emergency room.

We did not find big changes in how well people's asthma was controlled. There were also no big changes in how they felt. But the combined inhaler likely led to fewer side effects. It also reduced the total amount of strong steroid medicine needed.

**Compared to using a daily steroid inhaler plus a fast-acting inhaler when needed:**

There was little to no difference in bad asthma attacks. Out of 1000 people, 81 had a bad attack with the daily steroid. 65 people had one with the combined inhaler.

The combined inhaler likely cut down on urgent doctor visits for asthma.

Other things like asthma control or quality of life were about the same. The number of side effects and deaths were also similar. But the combined inhaler used less steroid medicine each day.

**What did the study conclude?**

This study found that the combined inhaler works well. It is also safe for adults and teens with mild asthma.

Using this inhaler only when needed:

*   Lowers bad asthma attacks.
*   Reduces hospital visits for asthma.
*   Decreases the amount of strong steroid medicine people need.
*   Likely causes fewer side effects.

It works just as well as taking a daily steroid inhaler. But it uses less steroid medicine each day. This is good for people's health.

More studies are needed. We need to check this inhaler in children under 12. We also need to study it for longer than one year.","Combination fixed‐dose beta agonist and steroid inhaler as required for adults or children with mild asthma 
Background 
Asthma is the most common respiratory illness. Many people with asthma have mild asthma, but still remain at risk of severe asthma exacerbations, which often result in the use of oral steroids. Mild asthma is commonly treated with preventative inhalers, which contain a steroid used to reduce inflammation in the airways, and with reliever inhalers, which relax the muscles of the airways causing quick relief of asthma symptoms. Combination inhalers contain both the preventative steroid and the reliever, simplifying treatment and ensuring steroids are always given alongside the immediate relief of symptoms. 
Review question 
We examined the findings of clinical trials to assess the use of combination inhalers in the treatment of mild asthma when taken on an as‐needed, symptom‐driven basis. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to March 2021. Results were collected from six studies which compared use of a combination inhaler used on an as‐needed basis with either as‐needed reliever‐only therapy or daily treatment with a low dose preventative inhaler. 
Key findings 
We found that combination inhalers used as‐needed when compared with reliever‐only treatment reduced severe exacerbations requiring tablet steroids and rates of emergency admission to hospital with asthma symptoms. Differences in other measures relating to symptom control and lung function were too small to be clinically important. Rates of severe exacerbations were similar between patients on daily preventative steroid inhalers and those using combination inhalers as‐needed. People using combination inhalers had lower rates of hospital admission and lower total inhaled steroid dose, whilst the differences in lung function and asthma symptom control were not clinically significant. 
This review found the use of combination inhalers used when the patient experiences asthma symptoms was beneficial in reducing severe exacerbations when compared to stand‐alone reliever therapy in mild asthma. In addition to this the use of combination inhalers used on an as‐needed basis was associated with a reduction in hospital admissions and total inhaled steroid dose when compared with regularly‐taken low dose preventative inhaler therapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies which contributed data were well‐designed and robust, although two were open‐label (participants knew which treatment they were getting), with some potential for bias, so the evidence was generally of moderate‐to‐high quality.

Review question 
Phototherapy is a pain‐free method of treatment that uses light to treat various medical conditions. We reviewed the evidence about phototherapy for foot ulcers in people with diabetes. We wanted to find out whether phototherapy speeds up wound healing and improves patients' quality of life, and whether there are any side effects. 
Background 
Foot ulcers are a disabling complication of diabetes that affect 15% to 25% of people with diabetes at some time in their lives. Diabetic foot ulcers are painful and prone to infection. Not all diabetic foot ulcers can be healed, which can ultimately lead to surgical removal of a limb. Phototherapy involves exposing the affected area to ultraviolet light, sometimes using lasers. This is thought to help ulcers heal through multiple mechanisms such as increased cell growth and blood vessel activity. It has been used as an alternative approach for healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing different phototherapies, or comparing phototherapy with other treatments or a placebo (sham treatment), for foot ulcers in adults with diabetes in October 2016. We included eight trials (316 participants). Most studies were undertaken in clinics or hospitals and had small numbers of participants (14 to 84). The average age in the included studies was from 53 to 68 years, and the ratio of females to males was 0.46 to 1.88. The included studies compared phototherapy with placebo or no phototherapy, on top of usual care (usual care could include treatments such as dressings, antibiotics, or wound cleaning). Treatment times ranged from 15 days to 20 weeks. 
Key results 
The results suggested that phototherapy, when compared to no phototherapy or a placebo, may increase the proportion of wounds completely healed during follow‐up and reduce wound size. However, as the included studies involved small numbers of participants and had drawbacks in study methods, our confidence in these results is limited. We did not find sufficient evidence that the potential harms or incidence of amputations differed between the phototherapy group and the no phototherapy/placebo group. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be low due to a lack of data and risk of the study results being biased. Further high‐quality studies are needed to confirm the benefits and harms of phototherapy.

","## Plain Language Summary: Light Therapy for Foot Sores in People with Diabetes

### Rationale

Diabetes can cause many problems. One common problem is foot sores, also called ulcers. These sores can be very painful. They can also get infected easily.

Sometimes, these sores do not heal. If a sore does not heal, doctors may need to remove a toe or part of a foot. This can be very hard for people with diabetes.

Light therapy uses light to treat health problems. It is a treatment that does not cause pain. Doctors think light may help sores heal. It may help new cells grow. It may also help blood flow better. This study looked at if light therapy helps foot sores heal in people with diabetes. We wanted to see if it made sores heal faster. We also wanted to see if it made people feel better. We looked for any bad effects too.

### Trial Design

This study looked at how light therapy works. We wanted to see if it helps people with diabetes. We looked at past studies that used light therapy.

These studies included adults with diabetes. Their ages were from 53 to 68 years old. They all had foot sores. Some studies had more women, some had more men.

The studies compared different types of light therapy. Some compared light therapy to no treatment. Some compared it to a ""fake"" treatment. This fake treatment looked like light therapy but did not use real light. All people also got their usual care. Usual care can include things like bandages or medicine for infections. People were in these studies for different amounts of time. Some were in the study for 15 days. Others were in for up to 20 weeks.

### Results

The studies showed some good things. Light therapy might help foot sores heal fully. It might also make the sores smaller. This means it could help people with diabetes get better faster.

However, we need more studies to be sure. The studies we looked at were small. They did not have many people. Also, some parts of the studies were not perfect. We are not very sure about these results yet.

We did not find clear proof of harm. We did not see more limb removals in people who got light therapy. More good studies are needed. These new studies will help us learn more. They can tell us how much light therapy helps. They can also tell us if there are any risks. This will help doctors decide if light therapy is a good choice for people with diabetes and foot sores.","Phototherapy for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes

10.1002-14651858.CD000371.pub7,"Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treating all school children at regular intervals with deworming drugs in areas where helminth infection is common. Global advocacy organizations claim routine deworming has substantive health and societal effects beyond the removal of worms. In this update of the 2015 edition we included six new trials, additional data from included trials, and addressed comments and criticisms. 
Objectives
To summarize the effects of public health programmes to regularly treat all children with deworming drugs on child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT); reference lists; and registers of ongoing and completed trials up to 19 September 2018. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared deworming drugs for soil‐transmitted helminths (STHs) with placebo or no treatment in children aged 16 years or less, reporting on weight, height, haemoglobin, and formal tests of cognition. We also sought data on other measures of growth, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and mortality. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion, risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed continuous data using the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where data were missing, we contacted trial authors. We stratified the analysis based on the background burden of STH infection. We used outcomes at time of longest follow‐up. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified 51 trials, including 10 cluster‐RCTs, that met the inclusion criteria. One trial evaluating mortality included over one million children, and the remaining 50 trials included a total of 84,336 participants. Twenty‐four trials were in populations categorized as high burden, including nine trials in children selected because they were helminth‐stool positive; 18 with intermediate burden; and nine as low burden. 
First or single dose of deworming drugs 
Fourteen trials reported on weight after a single dose of deworming drugs (4970 participants, 14 RCTs). The effects were variable. There was little or no effect in studies conducted in low and intermediate worm burden groups. In the high‐burden group, there was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago. These trials result in qualitative heterogeneity and uncertainty in the meta‐analysis across all studies (I2 statistic = 90%), with GRADE assessment assessed as very low‐certainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight. 
For height, most studies showed little or no effect after a single dose, with one of the two trials in Kenya from 30 years ago showing a large average difference (2621 participants, 10 trials, low‐certainty evidence). Single dose probably had no effect on average haemoglobin (MD 0.10 g/dL, 95% CI 0.03 lower to 0.22 higher; 1252 participants, five trials, moderate‐certainty evidence), or on average cognition (1596 participants, five trials, low‐certainty evidence). The data are insufficient to know if there is an effect on school attendance and performance (304 participants, one trial, low‐certainty evidence), or on physical fitness (280 participants, three trials, very low‐certainty evidence). No trials reported on mortality. 
Multiple doses of deworming drugs 
The effect of regularly treating children with deworming drugs given every three to six months on weight was reported in 18 trials, with follow‐up times of between six months and three years; there was little or no effect on average weight in all but two trials, irrespective of worm prevalence‐intensity. The two trials with large average weight gain included one in the high burden area in Kenya carried out over 30 years ago, and one study from India in a low prevalence area where subsequent studies in the same area did not show an effect. This heterogeneity causes uncertainty in any meta‐analysis (I2 = 78%). Post‐hoc analysis excluding trials published prior to 2000 gave an estimate of average difference in weight gain of 0.02 kg (95%CI from 0.04 kg loss to 0.08 gain, I2 = 0%). Thus we conclude that we do not know if repeated doses of deworming drugs impact on average weight, with a fewer older studies showing large gains, and studies since 2000 showing little or no average gain. 
Regular treatment probably had little or no effect on the following parameters: average height (MD 0.02 cm higher, 95% CI 0.09 lower to 0.13 cm higher; 13,700 participants, 13 trials, moderate‐certainty evidence); average haemoglobin (MD 0.01 g/dL lower; 95% CI 0.05 g/dL lower to 0.07 g/dL higher; 5498 participants, nine trials, moderate‐certainty evidence); formal tests of cognition (35,394 participants, 8 trials, moderate‐certainty evidence); school performance (34,967 participants, four trials, moderate‐certainty evidence). The evidence assessing an effect on school attendance is inconsistent, and at risk of bias (mean attendance 2% higher, 95% CI 5% lower to 8% higher; 20,650 participants, three trials, very low‐certainty evidence). No trials reported on physical fitness. No effect was shown on mortality (1,005,135 participants, three trials, low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Public health programmes to regularly treat all children with deworming drugs do not appear to improve height, haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, or mortality. We do not know if there is an effect on school attendance, since the evidence is inconsistent and at risk of bias, and there is insufficient data on physical fitness. Studies conducted in two settings over 20 years ago showed large effects on weight gain, but this is not a finding in more recent, larger studies. We would caution against selecting only the evidence from these older studies as a rationale for contemporary mass treatment programmes as this ignores the recent studies that have not shown benefit. 
The conclusions of the 2015 edition have not changed in this update.

### Plain Title
Do Worm Medicines Help Kids Grow and Learn?

### Rationale
Worms can live inside people, especially children. These worms can make children sick. They can cause children to not grow well. They might also make it hard for children to learn at school.

Some groups say giving all children worm medicine often can help them a lot. This study wanted to see if this is true. We wanted to know if giving children worm medicine makes them grow taller or heavier. We also wanted to know if it helps their blood stay healthy or if they learn better. We looked at whether it helped them go to school more or do better in school. We also checked if it made them stronger or live longer.

This study is important because many groups recommend giving children worm medicine often. We need to know if this practice truly helps children.

### Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies. It gathered facts from studies that already happened. These studies compared children who got worm medicine to children who did not. All the children were 16 years old or younger.

Some studies gave children one dose of medicine. Other studies gave children medicine every few months for up to three years. The studies looked at how children grew, how much they weighed, and how healthy their blood was. They also checked how well children thought and learned.

### Results
We looked at 51 studies in total. These studies included over one million children.

**One Dose of Worm Medicine:**
* For weight, a single dose likely has no effect. Only two old studies showed a big change. These studies were from over 30 years ago.
* For height, one dose likely has no effect.
* For blood health, one dose likely has no effect.
* For learning, one dose likely has no effect.
* We do not have enough facts to know if one dose helps with going to school or doing well in school.
* We do not have enough facts to know if one dose helps with being strong.
* No studies looked at if one dose helped children live longer.

**Many Doses of Worm Medicine:**
* Giving children worm medicine often likely has no effect on their weight. Only two studies showed a big change. One was an old study from over 30 years ago.
* Giving children worm medicine often likely has no effect on their height.
* Giving children worm medicine often likely has no effect on their blood health.
* Giving children worm medicine often likely has no effect on how well they learn.
* Giving children worm medicine often likely has no effect on how well they do in school.
* We do not know if giving children worm medicine often helps them go to school more. The facts are unclear.
* No studies looked at if many doses helped children be strong.
* Giving children worm medicine often likely has no effect on children living longer.

**In summary, this study found that giving children worm medicine often does not seem to make them grow taller or healthier. It also does not seem to help them learn or do better in school. It does not seem to help them live longer.** Older studies showed some big benefits, but newer studies do not show these same results. We should be careful about using only old studies to decide on new health programs. Our findings are the same as what we found in 2015.","Deworming school children in low‐ and middle‐income countries
Cochrane researchers examined the effects of deworming children in areas where intestinal worm infection is common. After searching for relevant trials up to 19 September 2018, we included 50 trials with a total of 84,336 participants, and an additional trial of one million children. 
What is deworming and why might it be important 
Soil‐transmitted worms, including roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms, are common in tropical and subtropical areas, and particularly affect children living in poverty where there is inadequate sanitation. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends that school children in many areas are regularly treated with drugs which kill these worms. Some advocates claim such programmes improve child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and survival. 
What the research says 
In populations of children living in endemic areas, the effect of the first, single dose of deworming drugs on weight is unclear. There was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya, reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago in a school where children were heavily infected with worms. This causes uncertainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight. For height, most studies showed little or no effect, with the exception of the site in Kenya. A single dose of deworming medicine probably has no effect on haemoglobin and cognition. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on school attendance, school performance, or physical fitness or mortality. 
In studies where children were regularly treated with deworming medicine there was little or no effect on weight in all but two trials, irrespective of whether children were heavily infected with worms or not. The two trials with large average weight gains included the Kenya study carried out over 30 years ago, and one study from India carried out over 20 years ago in a low worm burden area where later studies in the same area did not show an effect. In trials from 2000 onwards, which are more relevant given the global reduction in worm burden, there is little or no effect. This causes uncertainty and means we do not know if regularly treating children with deworming medicine improves their weight. Regularly deworming children probably has no effect on height, haemoglobin, cognition, and mortality. We do not know if there is an impact on school attendance, since the evidence is inconsistent and at high risk of bias. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on physical fitness. 
Authors' conclusions 
For public health programmes to regularly treat all children in endemic areas with deworming drugs, there is quite substantial evidence of no benefit in terms of haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, and mortality. For weight, contemporary studies do not show an effect, but unusually large effects were seen in studies over 20 years ago.

### Plain Title
Extra medicine during eye surgery: Does it help with a past glaucoma operation?

### Rationale
Glaucoma and cataracts are big problems for eyes. They can make it hard for people to see. Losing sight from glaucoma cannot be fixed. Glaucoma happens when pressure inside the eye gets too high. This pressure hurts the nerve that sends pictures to the brain. Fixing this pressure helps stop more damage to sight.

Medicines and laser treatments can help glaucoma. But sometimes, they are not enough. If they don't work, a surgery called a trabeculectomy is needed. This surgery makes a small hole in the eye. This hole lets extra fluid drain out. This lowers the eye pressure.

Many people who had a trabeculectomy also get cataracts. Cataracts make the lens of the eye cloudy. Cataract surgery removes this cloudy lens. When someone with a trabeculectomy has cataract surgery, doctors often give extra medicine. This extra medicine tries to stop the eye from healing too much. Too much healing can make scar tissue. Scar tissue can block the drainage hole made by the trabeculectomy. If the hole gets blocked, the trabeculectomy might not work anymore.

We wanted to see if this extra medicine truly helps keep the drainage hole open. We wanted to know if it helps the trabeculectomy keep working well after cataract surgery.

### Trial Design
We wanted to find out how this study was designed. We looked for a special kind of study. These studies are called ""randomized controlled trials."" In these studies, people get treatment by chance. Some get the medicine, and some do not. This helps us know if the medicine really works. These studies give the best proof about treatments.

We looked for studies about people who had a working trabeculectomy. These people also had cataract surgery. Some of them got extra medicine. This medicine included 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C, or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. Other people did not get any extra medicine.

We planned to put together the results from these studies. This would help us answer our question. We looked for studies that met our rules. The study checked evidence up to April 2021.

### Results
We searched for the right studies. But we did not find any ""randomized controlled trials"" that fit our rules.

This means we do not know if extra medicine helps. We do not know if it keeps the drainage hole open after cataract surgery. Right now, there is no clear proof.

More studies are needed in the future. These studies would help doctors know what is best for patients. It would help them decide if extra medicine is helpful.","The use of additional medication during cataract surgery to improve the continued success of a pre‐existing operation (trabeculectomy)

","## Plain Title: Medicine for Tension Headaches

## Rationale

Many people get tension headaches. These headaches can make daily life hard. Some people get them often. Other people have very bad headaches.

Taking medicine *before* the pain starts can help. This study looked at two types of medicine. They are called SSRIs and SNRIs. These medicines usually treat sadness (depression). We wanted to see if they could stop tension headaches.

We needed to know if these medicines worked. We also wanted to know if they caused problems.

## Trial Design

This study looked at past research. We gathered all studies on tension headaches. We included studies from before and after November 2014. We found two new studies. Six studies were already in our older review.

In total, we looked at 412 adults. All studies had a small number of people. Each study lasted two to four months. The people in the studies had tension headaches. We wanted to see if SSRIs or SNRIs helped them.

## Results

We found that SSRIs and SNRIs did not help much. They were no better than a sugar pill. The sugar pill is called a placebo. Both medicines did not lower headache days.

People taking SSRIs or SNRIs had few side effects. People taking the sugar pill also had few side effects. There was no big difference.

We also compared them to another medicine. This medicine is called amitriptyline. SSRIs and SNRIs did not work better than amitriptyline. People taking SSRIs or SNRIs had fewer minor side effects. But the same number of people stopped taking either medicine. This was due to side effects.

These results come from small studies. The studies were short. They were not always the best quality. We need more research. We did not find studies comparing these medicines to others. We also did not compare them to other ways to treat headaches. This includes things like massage or acupuncture.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for preventing tension‐type headache

10.1002-14651858.CD013424.pub2,"Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis and is more prevalent among people with CKD than among people who do not have CKD. Although several drugs have been used to effectively treat osteoporosis in the general population, it is unclear whether they are also effective and safe for people with CKD, who have altered systemic mineral and bone metabolism. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for osteoporosis in patients with CKD stages 3‐5, and those undergoing dialysis (5D). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 January 2021 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing any anti‐osteoporotic drugs with a placebo, no treatment or usual care in patients with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3 to 5D were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed their quality using the risk of bias tool, and extracted data. The main outcomes were the incidence of fracture at any sites; mean change in the bone mineral density (BMD; measured using dual‐energy radiographic absorptiometry (DXA)) of the femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine, and distal radius; death from all causes; incidence of adverse events; and quality of life (QoL). Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
Main results
Seven studies involving 9164 randomised participants with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3 to 5D met the inclusion criteria; all participants were postmenopausal women. Five studies included patients with CKD stages 3‐4, and two studies included patients with CKD stages 5 or 5D. Five pharmacological interventions were identified (abaloparatide, alendronate, denosumab, raloxifene, and teriparatide). All studies were judged to be at an overall high risk of bias. 
Among patients with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.69; low certainty evidence). Anti‐osteoporotic drugs probably makes little or no difference to the risk of clinical fracture (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.05; moderate certainty evidence) and adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00; moderate certainty evidence). We were unable to incorporate studies into the meta‐analyses for BMD at the femoral neck, lumbar spine and total hip as they only reported the percentage change in the BMD in the intervention group. 
Among patients with severe CKD stages 5 or 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.87; very low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improves the BMD at the femoral neck because the certainty of this evidence is very low (MD 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.02). Anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve the BMD at the lumbar spine (MD 0.03, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.04, low certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported in the included studies. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of death (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.56; very low certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Among patients with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture in low certainty evidence. Anti‐osteoporotic drugs make little or no difference to the risk of clinical fracture and adverse events in moderate certainty evidence. Among patients with CKD stages 5 and 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture and death because the certainty of this evidence is very low. Anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve the BMD at the lumbar spine in low certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improves the BMD at the femoral neck because the certainty of this evidence is very low. Larger studies including men, paediatric patients or individuals with unstable CKD‐mineral and bone disorder are required to assess the effect of each anti‐osteoporotic drug at each stage of CKD.

### Plain Title
Bone Drugs for People with Kidney Disease

### Rationale
Our bones can become weak and break easily. This is called osteoporosis. People with kidney disease often get osteoporosis. It happens more often in them than in people with healthy kidneys.

Many drugs can make bones stronger for most people. But we do not know if these drugs are safe or work well for people with kidney disease. Their bodies handle minerals and bones differently. This study looked at different bone drugs. We wanted to see if they help people with kidney disease. We also wanted to know if these drugs are safe for them.

### Trial Design
This study looked at other studies that were done before. We wanted to find trials that compared bone drugs to a sugar pill or no treatment. We looked for studies with people who had weak bones and kidney disease. This included people with mid-stage to severe kidney disease. It also included people on dialysis.

We searched many health databases for these studies. Two people checked each study very carefully. They made sure the studies were good quality. They also pulled out important facts. We looked at how often bones broke. We also looked at how strong bones became. We checked for any bad side effects. We also looked at how long people lived and their quality of life.

### Results
We found seven studies that fit our needs. These studies included 9,164 women after menopause. All of them had weak bones and kidney disease. Some had mid-stage kidney disease (stages 3-4). Others had severe kidney disease or were on dialysis (stages 5 or 5D). The studies looked at five different bone drugs.

For women with mid-stage kidney disease:
* Bone drugs might make spine fractures less likely. We are not very sure about this.
* Bone drugs likely do not change the risk of other bone breaks much.
* Bone drugs likely do not cause many more bad side effects.

For women with severe kidney disease or on dialysis:
* We are not sure if bone drugs lower the risk of bone breaks. We are very unsure about this.
* We are not sure if bone drugs make the thigh bone stronger. We are very unsure about this.
* Bone drugs might make the spine a little stronger. We are not very sure about this.
* No studies reported bad side effects in this group.
* We are not sure if bone drugs lower the risk of dying. We are very unsure about this.

This means we need more and bigger studies. We need to include men and children too. We also need to study people with other bone problems linked to kidney disease. This will help us know which bone drugs work best and are safest for each stage of kidney disease.","Pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis in patients with chronic kidney disease
What is the issue?Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of osteoporosis (weakened bone strength), which can often lead to bone fracture. Several drugs are available for the treatment of osteoporosis; however, it is unknown whether these drugs are equally effective and safe in patients with CKD because bone strength impairment in these patients occurs via a different mechanism. 
What did we do?Data were collected from studies including patients with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3‐5, and those undergoing dialysis (stage 5D) with data available on fracture, change in the bone mineral density (BMD; a bone strength index), and adverse events. We included seven studies with available evidence up to 25 January 2021, comparing anti‐osteoporotic drugs (abaloparatide, alendronate, denosumab, raloxifene, and teriparatide) with placebo (a dummy drug), in 9,164 postmenopausal women. We performed a meta‐analysis to assess the effects of these anti‐osteoporotic drugs. 
What did we find?In postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce vertebral fracture in low certainty evidence. Anti‐osteoporotic drugs probably make little or no difference to clinical fracture and adverse events in moderate certainty evidence. In postmenopausal with CKD stages 5 or 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture and death, and anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve BMD at the lumbar spine in low certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improve BMD at the femoral neck. 
ConclusionsAmong postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture. Among patients with CKD stages 5 and 5D, anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve bone strength. However, these conclusions are based on limited data and therefore uncertain.

10.1002-14651858.CD013228,"Background
The use of short‐acting insulin analogues (insulin lispro, insulin aspart, insulin glulisine) for adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes is still controversial, as reflected in many scientific debates. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of short‐acting insulin analogues compared to regular human insulin in adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Search methods
For this update we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the WHO ICTRP Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov to 31 October 2018. We placed no restrictions on the language of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials with an intervention duration of at least 24 weeks that compared short‐acting insulin analogues to regular human insulin in the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes, who were not pregnant. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We assessed dichotomous outcomes by risk ratios (RR), and Peto odds ratios (POR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed continuous outcomes by mean differences (MD) with 95% CI. We assessed trials for certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified 10 trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, randomising 2751 participants; 1388 participants were randomised to receive insulin analogues and 1363 participants to receive regular human insulin. The duration of the intervention ranged from 24 to 104 weeks, with a mean of about 41 weeks. The trial populations showed diversity in disease duration, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. None of the trials were blinded, so the risk of performance bias and detection bias, especially for subjective outcomes, such as hypoglycaemia, was high in nine of 10 trials from which we extracted data. Several trials showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods and results. 
None of the included trials defined all‐cause mortality as a primary outcome. Six trials provided Information on the number of participants who died during the trial, with five deaths out of 1272 participants (0.4%) in the insulin analogue groups and three deaths out of 1247 participants (0.2%) in the regular human insulin groups (Peto OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.41 to 6.64; P = 0.48; moderate‐certainty evidence). Six trials, with 2509 participants, assessed severe hypoglycaemia differently, therefore, we could not summarise the results with a meta‐analysis. Overall, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events was low, and none of the trials showed a clear difference between the two intervention arms (low‐certainty evidence). 
The MD in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) change was ‐0.03% (95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.09; P = 0.60; 9 trials, 2608 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction ranged between ‐0.31% and 0.25%. The MD in the overall number of non‐severe hypoglycaemic episodes per participant per month was 0.08 events (95% CI 0.00 to 0.16; P = 0.05; 7 trials, 2667 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between ‐0.03 and 0.19 events per participant per month. The results provided for nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes were of questionable validity. Overall, there was no clear difference between the two short‐acting insulin analogues and regular human insulin. Two trials assessed health‐related quality of life and treatment satisfaction, but we considered the results for both outcomes to be unreliable (very low‐certainty evidence). 
No trial was designed to investigate possible long term effects (all‐cause mortality, microvascular or macrovascular complications of diabetes), especially in participants with diabetes‐related complications. No trial reported on socioeconomic effects. 
Authors' conclusions
Our analysis found no clear benefits of short‐acting insulin analogues over regular human insulin in people with type 2 diabetes. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was poor and results on patient‐relevant outcomes, like all‐cause mortality, microvascular or macrovascular complications and severe hypoglycaemic episodes were sparse. Long‐term efficacy and safety data are needed to draw conclusions about the effects of short‐acting insulin analogues on patient‐relevant outcomes.

### Plain Title
Comparing New Insulins to Old Insulins for Type 2 Diabetes

### Rationale

Many people live with type 2 diabetes. This is a sickness where your body does not use sugar well. Over time, high blood sugar can cause big problems. It can hurt your heart, eyes, and kidneys. Insulin is a medicine that helps your body use sugar. It helps keep your blood sugar levels healthy.

Doctors use different types of insulin. Some newer insulins are called ""short-acting insulin analogues."" Older insulins are called ""regular human insulin."" There has been a lot of talk about whether the newer insulins are better. We needed to know if these newer insulins really work better for people with type 2 diabetes. We wanted to see if they were safer or helped people feel better.

This study looked closely at past research. It wanted to find out if newer insulins had any clear benefits. We wanted to see if they helped people live longer or have fewer problems from diabetes.

### Trial Design

This study was a ""review"" of other studies. This means we looked at many past studies. We wanted to find all research that compared newer insulins to older insulins.

We looked for studies that met certain rules. Each study had to randomly give people either a new insulin or an old insulin. The studies had to last for at least 24 weeks, or about 6 months. We only looked at adults who had type 2 diabetes. These people could not be pregnant.

We looked at studies with different types of people. Some people had diabetes for a short time. Others had it for a long time. People in these studies took the insulin for about 41 weeks on average. This is about 9 to 10 months. Our goal was to find clear answers from all these studies.

### Results

We found 10 studies that met our rules. These studies included more than 2,700 people. About half got the new insulin. The other half got the old insulin. The studies lasted from 24 weeks to over 100 weeks.

Here is what we found:

*   **Dying from any cause:** A few people in the studies died. There was no clear difference between the new insulin group and the old insulin group. The studies did not focus on this.
*   **Severe low blood sugar:** Low blood sugar can be dangerous. The studies did not all measure this the same way. So, we could not combine the results. But overall, very few people had severe low blood sugar. There was no clear difference between the two groups.
*   **Blood sugar control:** We looked at a test called A1c. This test shows your average blood sugar over a few months. There was almost no difference in A1c levels between the new and old insulin groups.
*   **Mild low blood sugar:** We also looked at mild low blood sugar events. There was no big difference in how often these happened.
*   **Feeling better:** Some studies looked at how people felt. They looked at their health and how happy they were with their treatment. But the results from these studies were not clear enough to trust.

Overall, our study found no clear benefits of the newer insulins. They did not seem to work better than the older insulins. They did not appear to be safer either. We need more research that lasts a long time. We need to know if newer insulins help people live longer. We also need to know if they prevent problems from diabetes.","Short‐acting insulin analogues versus regular human insulin for type 2 diabetes mellitus
Review question 
Are short‐acting insulin analogues better than regular human insulin for adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes? 
Background 
Short‐acting insulin analogues act more quickly than regular human insulin. They can be injected immediately before meals and lead to lower blood sugar levels after food intake. Whether people with diabetes really profit from these newer insulins is debated. 
Study characteristics 
We found 10 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the short‐acting insulin analogues insulin lispro, insulin aspart, or insulin glulisine to regular human insulin in 2751 participants. The people in the included trials were monitored (followed) for 24 to 104 weeks. 
This evidence is up to date as of 31 October 2018.
Key results 
We are uncertain whether short‐acting insulin analogues are better than regular human insulin for long‐term blood glucose control or for reducing the number of times blood sugar levels drop below normal (hypoglycaemic episodes). The studies were too short to reliably investigate death from any cause. We found no clear effect of insulin analogues on health‐related quality of life. We found no information on late diabetes complications, such as problems with the eyes, kidneys, or feet. No study reported on socioeconomic effects, such as costs of the intervention and absence from work. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the included studies was low or very low for most outcomes, mainly because all studies were carried out in an open‐labelled fashion (study participants and study personnel knew who was getting which treatment). Several studies also showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods, and results were imprecise.

10.1002-14651858.CD010222.pub4,"Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism
Background 
Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke. The advent of multi‐detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE regarding visualisation of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, increasing its rate of diagnosis. More cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have thereby been identified. These two conditions are usually found in patients with few or no classic symptoms such as coughing (including coughing up blood), chest or upper back pain, acute shortness of breath, or general or specific failure of the circulation that is either cardiac or peripheral in nature. However, in patients with an impaired cardiac and pulmonary condition the classic PE symptoms can be found with isolated SSPEs. Incidental SSPE is found casually in asymptomatic patients, usually by diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons (for example routine computed tomography (CT) for cancer staging in oncologic patients). Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may have a more benign clinical presentation compared to those with proximal PEs. However, the clinical significance and prognosis in these patients has to be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is required. 
Review question 
What is the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE? 
Study characteristics 
We did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria.
Key results 
There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials (current to 26 November 2019) on the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE. We cannot draw any conclusions. Well‐conducted research is required before informed practice decisions can be made.

","**Plain Title: What Works for Small Blood Clots in the Lungs?**

**Rationale**

Blood clots in the lungs are a big problem. They can cause many deaths each year. This is the third main cause of death from heart and blood vessel problems. It comes after heart attacks and strokes.

New scan tools help us see these clots better. We now find small clots in the outer parts of the lungs more often. We call these ""subsegmental pulmonary embolisms"" or SSPEs. Some people may have no usual signs like coughing or chest pain. But people with heart or lung problems might show these signs. Sometimes, doctors find these small clots by chance. This happens when they do scans for other reasons, like checking for cancer.

Doctors are not sure if these small, small clots are as bad as bigger ones. We need to know if we should give medicine to thin the blood for these small clots. Blood thinner medicine might help treat these clots. It could stop bad things from happening. This study wants to see if this medicine works and is safe for people with these tiny lung clots.

**Trial Design**

This study wants to learn about treatment for small lung clots. We looked for studies that had a clear plan. These studies would compare blood thinner medicine to no medicine. People in these studies would have small clots in their lungs. We wanted to see how well the medicine worked. We also wanted to check if it was safe.

We looked for studies that had specific rules. They would use a random way to give people medicine or no medicine. This helps make sure the study is fair. We did not find any studies that fit these rules. So, we cannot say more about how such a study would be set up or who would be in it.

**Results**

We looked for studies about medicine for small lung clots. These studies would need to be well-done. They would compare blood thinner medicine to not giving medicine. We checked for studies up to November 26, 2019.

We did not find any such studies. This means we have no clear proof. We cannot say if blood thinner medicine helps. We also cannot say if it is safe for people with these small clots. We cannot draw any answers from this work.

More good studies are needed. Doctors need these studies to make choices about care. Right now, we do not know the best way to treat these small lung clots.","Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism
Background 
Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke. The advent of multi‐detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE regarding visualisation of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, increasing its rate of diagnosis. More cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have thereby been identified. These two conditions are usually found in patients with few or no classic symptoms such as coughing (including coughing up blood), chest or upper back pain, acute shortness of breath, or general or specific failure of the circulation that is either cardiac or peripheral in nature. However, in patients with an impaired cardiac and pulmonary condition the classic PE symptoms can be found with isolated SSPEs. Incidental SSPE is found casually in asymptomatic patients, usually by diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons (for example routine computed tomography (CT) for cancer staging in oncologic patients). Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may have a more benign clinical presentation compared to those with proximal PEs. However, the clinical significance and prognosis in these patients has to be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is required. 
Review question 
What is the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE? 
Study characteristics 
We did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria.
Key results 
There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials (current to 26 November 2019) on the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE. We cannot draw any conclusions. Well‐conducted research is required before informed practice decisions can be made.

10.1002-14651858.CD013489.pub2,"Background
Stuttering, or stammering as it is referred to in some countries, affects a child's ability to speak fluently. It is a common communication disorder, affecting 11% of children by four years of age. Stuttering can be characterized by sound, part word or whole word repetitions, sound prolongations, or blocking of sounds or airflow. Moments of stuttering can also be accompanied by non‐verbal behaviours, including visible tension in the speaker's face, eye blinks or head nods. Stuttering can also negatively affect behavioural, social and emotional functioning. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
To assess the immediate and long‐term effects of non‐pharmacological interventions for stuttering on speech outcomes, communication attitudes, quality of life and potential adverse effects in children aged six years and younger. 
Secondary objective 
To describe the relationship between intervention effects and participant characteristics (i.e. child age, IQ, severity, sex and time since stuttering onset) at pretest. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, nine other databases and two trial registers on 16 September 2020, and Open Grey on 20 October 2020. There were no limits in regards to language, year of publication or type of publication. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and requested data on unpublished trials from authors of published studies. We handsearched conference proceedings and programmes from relevant conferences. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that assessed non‐pharmacological interventions for stuttering in young children aged six years and younger. Eligible comparators were no intervention, wait list or management as usual. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We identified four eligible RCTs, all of which compared the Lidcombe Program to a wait‐list control group. In total, 151 children aged between two and six years participated in the four included studies. In the Lidcombe Program, the parent and their child visit a speech and language therapist (SLT) in a clinic. One study conducted clinic visits by telephone. In each clinic visit, parents were taught how to conduct treatment at home. Two studies took place in Australia, one in New Zealand and one in Germany. Two studies were conducted for nine months, one for 16 weeks and one for 12 weeks. The frequency of clinic visits and practice sessions at home varied within the programme. One study was partially funded by the Rotary Club, Wiesbaden, Germany; and one was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. One study did not report funding sources and another reported that they did not receive any funding for the trial.  
All four studies reported the outcome of stuttering frequency. One study also reported on speech efficiency, defined as articulation rate. No studies reported the other predetermined outcomes of this review, namely stuttering severity; communication attitudes; emotional, cognitive or psychosocial domains; or adverse effects.  
The Lidcombe Program resulted in a lower stuttering frequency percentage syllables stuttered (% SS) than a wait‐list control group at post‐test, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and nine months postrandomization (mean difference (MD) −2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) −3.48 to −0.84, 4 studies, 151 participants; P = 0.001; very low‐certainty evidence).  
However, as the Lidcombe Program is designed to take one to two years to complete, none of the participants in these studies had finished the complete intervention programme at any of the data collection points. 
We assessed stuttering frequency to have a high risk of overall bias due to high risk of bias in at least one domain within three of four included studies, and to have some concern of overall bias in the fourth, due to some concern in at least one domain. 
We found moderate‐certainty evidence from one study showing that the Lidcombe Program may increase speech efficiency in young children. 
Only one study reported outcomes at long‐term follow‐up. The long‐term effect of intervention could not be summarized, as the results for most of the children in the control group were missing. However, a within‐group comparison was performed between the mean % SS at randomization and the mean % SS at the time of extended follow‐up, and showed a significant reduction in frequency of stuttering.  
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review indicates that the Lidcombe Program may result in lower stuttering frequency and higher speech efficiency than a wait‐list control group in children aged up to six years at post‐test. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the very low and moderate certainty of the evidence and the high risk of bias identified in the included studies. Thus, there is a need for further studies from independent researchers, to evaluate the immediate and long‐term effects of other non‐pharmacological interventions for stuttering compared to no intervention or a wait‐list control group. 
","## Stopping Stuttering in Young Kids

### Rationale

It is hard for kids to speak smoothly when they stutter. This is also called stammering. Many kids, about 1 in 10, stutter by age four. Stuttering means a child may repeat sounds or words. They might hold sounds for too long. Or, they might block sounds so no air comes out.

Sometimes, kids may also make faces or nod their heads when they stutter. Stuttering can make kids feel bad. It can also make it hard for them to make friends.

This study looked at ways to help kids who stutter. We wanted to see if certain treatments could make speaking easier. We also wanted to see if these treatments helped kids feel better. We looked at a treatment called the Lidcombe Program. This program teaches parents how to help their child at home.

### Trial Design

This study looked at how other studies were done. It gathered all the results. We only looked at studies where kids were chosen by chance for a treatment. This is like flipping a coin. This helps make sure the results are fair.

We looked at studies with kids aged six years or younger. All kids in these studies stuttered. Some kids got a special treatment. Other kids were on a waiting list. They did not get any treatment right away. This helped us see if the treatment really worked.

The studies looked at how often kids stuttered. They also looked at how well kids spoke. We checked for any bad effects from the treatment. The studies followed kids for weeks or months. But none of the studies followed kids until the Lidcombe Program was fully done. This program can take one to two years.

### Results

We found four studies that fit our rules. All of them looked at the Lidcombe Program. They compared it to a waiting list. A total of 151 kids were in these studies. They were between two and six years old.

In the Lidcombe Program, parents learned how to help their child at home. They met with a speech helper in a clinic. Sometimes, they met over the phone.

The studies showed that the Lidcombe Program might help kids stutter less. Kids in this program stuttered less than kids on the waiting list. This was seen after a few weeks to nine months. The program also seemed to help kids speak better.

However, we need to be careful with these results. The studies did not follow kids long enough. No one finished the full program in these studies. Also, there were some problems in how the studies were done. This means we cannot be fully sure about the results.

We need more studies. These studies should follow kids for a longer time. They should also look at other ways to help kids who stutter. This will help us know the best ways to help young kids speak more easily.","Medicine‐free treatment for stuttering in children aged six years and younger
What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to find out if medicine‐free treatment for stuttering can improve speech fluency, children's communication attitudes and the impact on the child's quality of life, and potential harmful effects in children aged six years and younger, both in the short‐ and long‐term. We collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question and found four studies. 
Key messages 
The Lidcombe Program may result in lower stuttering frequency and higher speech efficiency (i.e. number of words or syllables spoken per minute) for young children after receiving the amount of treatment included in the studies. We do not yet know the impact of the programme delivered in its entirety, as no study reported outcomes for children who had completed the programme, which is designed to last for one to two years. 
Only one study reported how treatment worked in the long run, but the effect of treatment could not be summarized, as the results for most children in the control group were missing. 
We require more high‐quality studies assessing stuttering treatments for young children, including studies that report on a broader range of outcomes and that assess treatments other than the Lidcombe Program. 
What did the review study? 
Stuttering, or stammering as it is sometimes called, is a common communication disorder, that usually begins when children are between two and four years of age. Stuttering can be characterized by repetitions of individual speech sounds, parts of words or whole words; involuntary lengthening of speech sounds; or speech blockages. Moments of stuttering can also be accompanied by visible tension in the speaker's face or voice, eye blinks or head nods. Stuttering can have a negative effect on how people feel about themselves and how they live their lives. Therefore, it is important to identify effective treatments for stuttering in young children to reduce the chance that they will experience these negative effects. 
What were the main results of the review?  
We found four studies, all of which compared young children who received the Lidcombe Program to young children on a wait‐list. In three studies, the children on the wait‐list did not receive any treatment until after the study was finished. In the fourth, the children on the wait‐list could receive treatment from their local speech language therapist (SLT) if they wanted to. At the end of the study, parents of seven children (35%) in the control group reported their child had received some treatment, either the Lidcombe Program or another treatment programme called ""Easy Does It"", while on the wait‐list. 
There were 151 children aged between two and six years in the four studies. In the Lidcombe Program, an SLT conducted clinic visits with the child and parent in person in a clinic or spoke to them by telephone. During these visits, parents were taught to conduct treatment at home during 10‐ to 15‐minute daily practice sessions. Two studies were conducted in Australia, one in New Zealand and one in Germany. Two studies were conducted for nine months, one for 16 weeks and one for 12 weeks. One study was partially funded by the Rotary Club, Wiesbaden, Germany; and one was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. One study did not report any funding sources and another reported that they did not receive any funding for the trial. 
All four studies reported the effects of treatment on stuttering frequency. One study also reported on speech efficiency. We found no studies that looked at the effects of treatments for stuttering on stuttering severity; communication attitudes; emotional (how a child recognizes, expresses, and manages feelings), cognitive (how a child thinks, explores and works problems out) or psychosocial (how a child's individual needs link to the needs or demands of society) development; or side effects. 
The included studies suggest that the Lidcombe Program may reduce stuttering frequency in young children compared to a wait‐list control group (very low‐quality evidence). One study also reported that the Lidcombe Program may increase speech efficiency in young children compared to a wait‐list control group (moderate‐quality evidence). 
Only one study followed the children up to five years after treatment started, and at that time the results for most of the children in the control group were missing. Therefore, we do not know if the benefits of the treatment lasted over time. 
How up‐to‐date was this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to 16 September 2020. One additional database was searched on 20 October 2020.  
How reliable was the evidence generated by this review? 
The quality of the results related to stuttering frequency was very low and the results related to speech efficiency was moderate. This means that we are uncertain that the treatment effect would stay the same if we added more studies to the review. More studies comparing different treatments for stuttering to a wait‐list control group are needed to know the effect of treatment for stuttering with greater certainty.

10.1002-14651858.CD013206.pub2,"Background
Eczema is a common and chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder. It seriously impacts quality of life and economic outcomes, especially for those with moderate to severe eczema. Various treatments allow sustained control of the disease; however, their relative benefit remains unclear due to the limited number of trials directly comparing treatments. 
Objectives
To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of different types of systemic immunosuppressive treatments for moderate to severe eczema using NMA and to generate rankings of available systemic immunosuppressive treatments for eczema according to their efficacy and safety. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to August 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic immunosuppressive agents for moderate to severe atopic eczema when compared against placebo or any other eligible eczema treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We synthesised data using pair‐wise analysis and NMA to compare treatments and rank them according to their effectiveness. 
Effectiveness was assessed primarily by determining the proportion of participants who achieved at least 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) and improvement in the Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM). Safety was evaluated primarily by considering the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) and infection. 
We deemed short‐term follow‐up as ≤ 16 weeks and long‐term follow‐up as > 16 weeks.
We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for these primary outcomes using six domains of CiNEMA grading. 
Main results
We included a total of 74 studies, with 8177 randomised participants. Approximately 55% of participants were male, with average age of 32 years (range 2 to 84 years), although age and gender were unreported for 419 and 902 participants, respectively. Most of the included trials were placebo controlled (65%), 34% were head‐to‐head studies (15% assessed the effects of different doses of the same drug), and 1% were multi‐armed studies with both an active comparator and a placebo. 
All trials included participants with moderate to severe eczema, but 62% of studies did not separate data by severity; 38% of studies assessed only severe eczema. The total duration of included trials ranged from 2 weeks to 60 months, whereas treatment duration varied from a single dose (CIM331, KPL‐716) to 60 months (methotrexate (MTX)). 
Seventy studies were available for quantitative synthesis; this review assessed 29 immunosuppressive agents from three classes of interventions. These included (1) conventional treatments, with ciclosporin assessed most commonly; (2) small molecule treatments, including phosphodiesterase (PDE)‐4 inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors; and (3) biological treatments, including anti‐CD31 receptors, anti‐interleukin (IL)‐22, anti‐IL‐31, anti‐IL‐13, anti‐IL‐12/23p40, anti‐OX40, anti‐TSLP, anti‐CRTH2, and anti‐immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibodies, but most commonly dupilumab. 
Most trials (73) assessed outcomes at a short‐term duration ranging from 2 to 16 weeks, whereas 33 trials assessed long‐term outcomes, with duration ranging from 5 to 60 months. All participants were from a hospital setting. Fifty‐two studies declared a source of funding, and of these, pharmaceutical companies funded 88%. We rated 37 studies as high risk; 21, unclear risk, and 16, low risk of bias, with studies most commonly at high risk of attrition bias. 
Network meta‐analysis suggests that dupilumab ranks first for effectiveness when compared with other biological treatments. Dupilumab is more effective than placebo in achieving EASI75 (risk ratio (RR) 3.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.51 to 3.69) and improvement in POEM score (mean difference 7.30, 95% CI 6.61 to 8.00) at short‐term follow‐up (high‐certainty evidence). 
Very low‐certainty evidence means we are uncertain of the effects of dupilumab when compared with placebo, in terms of the proportion of participants who achieve EASI75 (RR 2.59, 95% CI 1.87 to 3.60) at longer‐term follow‐up. 
Low‐certainty evidence indicates that tralokinumab may be more effective than placebo in achieving short‐term EASI75 (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.21 to 5.34), but there was no evidence for tralokinumab to allow us to assess short‐term follow‐up of POEM or long‐term follow‐up of EASI75. 
We are uncertain of the effect of ustekinumab compared with placebo in achieving EASI75 (long‐term follow‐up: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.45; short‐term follow‐up: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.97; both very low certainty). We found no evidence on ustekinumab for the POEM outcome. 
We are uncertain whether other immunosuppressive agents that targeted our key outcomes influence the achievement of short‐term EASI75 compared with placebo due to low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence. 
Dupilumab and ustekinumab were the only immunosuppressive agents evaluated for longer‐term EASI75. Dupilumab was the only agent evaluated for improvement in POEM during short‐term follow‐up. 
Low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence indicates a lower proportion of participants with SAEs after treatment with QAW039 and dupilumab compared to placebo during short‐term follow‐up, but low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence suggests no difference in SAEs during short‐term follow‐up of other immunosuppressive agents compared to placebo. 
Evidence for effects of immunosuppressive agents on risk of any infection during short‐term follow‐up and SAEs during long‐term follow‐up compared with placebo was of low or very low certainty but did not indicate a difference. 
We did not identify differences in other adverse events (AEs), but dupilumab is associated with specific AEs, including eye inflammation and eosinophilia. 
Authors' conclusions
Our findings indicate that dupilumab is the most effective biological treatment for eczema. Compared to placebo, dupilumab reduces eczema signs and symptoms in the short term for people with moderate to severe atopic eczema. Short‐term safety outcomes from clinical trials did not reveal new safety concerns with dupilumab. Overall, evidence for the efficacy of most other immunosuppressive treatments for moderate to severe atopic eczema is of low or very low certainty. 
Given the lack of data comparing conventional with newer biological treatments for the primary outcomes, there remains high uncertainty for ranking the efficacy and safety of conventional treatments such as ciclosporin and biological treatments such as dupilumab. 
Most studies were placebo‐controlled and assessed only short‐term efficacy of immunosuppressive agents. Further adequately powered head‐to‐head RCTs should evaluate comparative long‐term efficacy and safety of available treatments for moderate to severe eczema. 
","## A Look at Eczema Treatments

### Rationale

Eczema is a skin problem. It makes skin red, itchy, and dry. Many people live with it. For some, it is mild. For others, it is bad and lasts a long time. This can make life hard. It can also cost a lot of money.

Doctors have many ways to treat eczema. These drugs can help control the problem. But we do not know which drug works best. We also do not know which drug is safest. This is because few studies have compared them directly.

This study aimed to find the best drugs. We looked at drugs that calm the body's defense system. These drugs can treat moderate to severe eczema. We wanted to see how well they worked. We also checked how safe they were. This study helps doctors and patients pick the best treatment.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many past studies. We wanted to see how different eczema drugs worked. We looked at studies that gave people a drug or a dummy pill. Some studies compared one drug to another.

We searched big health databases. We looked for studies up to August 2019. We picked studies that tested drugs for moderate to severe eczema. These drugs change the body's defense system.

We gathered all the study information. We then compared the drugs. We ranked them from best to worst. We looked at how much the eczema got better. We used two main ways to measure this. One was the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). A 75% drop in this score meant good progress. The other was the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM). We also checked for bad effects. We looked for serious health problems or infections.

We looked at short-term results. This meant up to 16 weeks of treatment. We also looked at long-term results. This was for more than 16 weeks. We wanted to be sure about our findings. So, we checked the quality of the evidence.

### Results

We looked at 74 studies. These studies had 8,177 people. About half were men. Their ages ranged from 2 to 84 years. Most studies compared a drug to a dummy pill. Some studies compared drugs to each other.

All studies included people with moderate to severe eczema. But some studies did not split the results by how bad the eczema was. The studies lasted from 2 weeks to 60 months.

We looked at 29 different drugs. These drugs fell into three groups. These groups included older drugs like ciclosporin. They also included newer drugs. These newer drugs were called small molecules or biologics. Dupilumab was a common biologic drug.

Most studies looked at short-term effects. This was up to 16 weeks. A few studies looked at longer effects. All people in these studies were at a hospital. Most studies got money from drug companies. Some studies had flaws in how they were done.

Our findings show dupilumab works best. It is better than other biologic drugs. Dupilumab is much better than a dummy pill. It improved eczema symptoms by a lot. This was true for short-term use. This finding is very strong.

We are less sure about long-term effects of dupilumab. The evidence for that is not as strong.

Another drug, tralokinumab, might also work better than a dummy pill. This was for short-term use. But we do not have enough info on its long-term effects. We also do not know about its effect on patient symptoms.

We are not sure about other drugs. The evidence for them is weak. This means we cannot say if they work better than a dummy pill.

Dupilumab and ustekinumab were the only drugs studied for long-term eczema improvement. Dupilumab was the only drug studied for how patients felt in the short term.

Some drugs had fewer serious problems than a dummy pill. These included QAW039 and dupilumab. This was for short-term use. But for many other drugs, we saw no big difference in serious problems.

We did not find big differences in other bad effects. But dupilumab can cause some eye problems. It can also cause a blood cell problem.

In short, dupilumab is the best biologic drug for eczema. It helps a lot with eczema signs and symptoms. This is for people with moderate to severe eczema. It is safe for short-term use. For most other drugs, we are not very sure how well they work.

We still need more studies. We need to compare older drugs with newer ones. We need to know which drugs work best in the long run. We also need to know which are safest over time.","Which oral or injected medicines work best to treat moderate to severe eczema?
Why this question is important 
Eczema is a persistent condition that causes dry, cracked, and itchy skin. People with mild eczema have small patches of dry skin, and people with moderate eczema have larger, redder, or swollen areas of skin. People with severe eczema have red crusts and broken skin (which may ooze fluid) that develop all over the body. 
Although there is currently no cure for eczema, treatments that aim to relieve symptoms are available. Usually, the first treatment option is to apply creams, ointments, or liquids to the affected skin. If this does not work, it is possible to take oral or injected (systemic) medicines that work throughout the body. 
Many systemic medicines are available for eczema. To help people decide which one is most appropriate for managing their symptoms, we reviewed the evidence on benefits and risks of different systemic medicines for people with moderate or severe eczema. We particularly wanted to find out: 
• whether some medicines were more likely than others to have an important positive effect on symptoms (defined as either at least a 75% improvement on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), or improvement on the Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)—two scales that are used by clinicians to evaluate changes in eczema symptoms); and 
• whether some medicines are associated with more serious unwanted events, including infection, than others. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (studies where people are randomly divided into different treatment groups) because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared study results and summarised the evidence from all studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, the size of studies, and the consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate, or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found 74 studies that involved a total of 8177 people with moderate to severe eczema. Studies lasted between 2 weeks and 60 months. Treatments received varied from a single, one‐off dose to weekly doses for 60 months. These studies evaluated 29 different medicines by comparing them to a placebo (fake treatment) or to another medicine, or by comparing different doses of the same medicine. The medicine that was studied most frequently was dupilumab (12 studies), a laboratory‐made version of a protein, which blocks parts of the immune system involved in causing eczema. 
Dupilumab versus placebo 
High‐certainty evidence shows that, compared to a placebo or other laboratory‐made proteins, dupilumab improves the symptoms of people with moderate to severe eczema in the short term (within 16 weeks of treatment). It is unclear whether this improvement is sustained after 16 weeks because no studies have looked at changes in POEM scores beyond that time, and because the evidence from studies that measured EASI scores was of very low certainty. Dupilumab may be associated with fewer serious unwanted events than placebo (low‐certainty evidence). 
Other systemic medicines versus placebo 
Evidence on the benefits and risks of other systemic medicines compared to placebo is limited because no studies have measured their effects on symptom improvement or serious unwanted effects, or because the certainty of the evidence is low or very low. 
Comparing different systemic medicines with one another 
Reviewers found too few studies that compared different systemic medicines against one another to determine which worked best for people with moderate to severe eczema. 
What this means 
Evidence shows that, compared to placebo, dupilumab improves the symptoms of people with moderate to severe eczema within 16 weeks of treatment and may be associated with fewer serious unwanted events. 
Reviewers found too few robust studies to conclude whether dupilumab improves symptoms beyond 16 weeks, or whether this medicine works better than older systemic medicines. Future studies need to compare different systemic treatments beyond 16 weeks in people with moderate to severe eczema. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?

10.1002-14651858.CD011931.pub2,"Preventing pain after brain surgery
The problem 
There is increasing evidence that people who have undergone brain surgery experience significant pain. This pain can have serious consequences including raised blood pressure, agitation, prolonged recovery time and an increased risk of long‐term headaches. Research studies have looked at different drugs in an attempt to reduce the risk of pain for these people. There is now more evidence about pain reduction options for adults undergoing brain surgery but there remains uncertainty as to which options work best. 
The question 
This review aimed to determine which drugs provide the best chance of reducing pain for adults undergoing brain surgery, by collecting and combining the results of studies that looked at pain‐relieving drugs for this patient group. To provide an accurate answer to this question, only studies conducted in accordance with an approved high standard were included. Studies published in different languages and countries were included in order to obtain as much information as possible. 
In addition to determining which drugs were best at preventing or reducing pain after brain surgery, this review attempted to determine additional information such as how much additional pain‐relieving treatment was required in addition to the treatment under study; whether participants' pain was adequately controlled or not; how drowsy the participants were; what side effects they experienced; and how long they needed to stay in intensive care and in hospital. This review also considered whether some treatments worked better when given before or after surgery or for people undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. 
The results 
A total of 43 eligible studies, (42 complete and one still in progress), were found. Of the 42 completed studies (3548 participants), 10 studied injections of local anaesthetic into the scalp, 12 studied injection of local anaesthetic around specific scalp nerves, 8 studied nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 4 studied dexmedetomidine, 4 studied acetaminophen aka paracetamol), 2 studied opioid drugs, 3 studied gabapentin or pregabalin (anti‐seizure drugs that can also be used for pain relief) together with 1 study each of local anaesthetic injected into the veins, local anaesthetic injected into the jaw and the drug flupirtine. 
Sufficient information was abstracted to calculate the overall pain‐preventing effects of the following: local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound, local anaesthetic injections around specific scalp nerves, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, dexmedetomidine and pregabalin or gabapentin. When only high‐quality studies were examined: NSAIDs reduced pain up to 24 hours after surgery, dexmedetomidine and local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves reduced pain in the first 12 hours after surgery, pregabalin or gabapentin reduced pain in the first 6 hours after surgery and local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound significantly reduced pain 48 hours after surgery, but did not affect pain at earlier time points. 
When the timing of injection of local anaesthetics was examined, local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves provided better early pain relief (first 6 hours) when injected after surgery and better late pain relief (12 and 24 hours) when injected before surgery. 
The following interventions were also found to reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs: local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and dexmedetomidine. Gabapentin or pregabalin was found to reduce the risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery. 
Acetaminophen was not found to prevent pain after brain surgery or reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs. 
Insufficient evidence was found to determine whether any of these drugs made the participants more or less drowsy, affected how long they needed to stay in intensive care or whether different drugs worked better for adults undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. 
The overall quality of the evidence that contributed to the results of this review was assessed and judged to be 'high' for pain‐reducing effects of NSAIDs, 'moderate' to 'low' for pain‐reducing effects of dexmedetomidine, acetaminophen, pregabalin and gabapentin and local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and ' low' to ' very low' for pain‐reducing effects of local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound, additional pain relief requirements and risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery . 
","## Plain Title: Finding the Best Ways to Stop Pain After Brain Surgery

### Rationale

Many people feel a lot of pain after brain surgery. This pain can cause problems like high blood pressure and make recovery take longer. It can also lead to headaches that last a long time. Doctors have looked at different medicines to help reduce this pain. We know some things work for adults, but we are not sure which medicines work best.

This study wanted to find out which medicines are best at stopping pain after brain surgery. We looked at many studies that tested pain medicines for adults. We wanted to see what medicine gave the best chance of feeling less pain.

We also looked at other things. We wanted to know if people needed more pain medicine. We checked how sleepy people were and what side effects they had. We also looked at how long people stayed in the hospital. We even checked if some medicines worked better when given before or after surgery.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many past studies. It combined their results to get a clearer picture. We only included studies that followed strict rules to make sure they were good. We included studies from many different countries and in different languages. This helped us get as much information as possible.

We looked at studies that focused on adults who had brain surgery. The studies tested different pain medicines. We wanted to see how well these medicines stopped or lowered pain. This study did not involve new patients. It reviewed work already done.

### Results

We found 43 good studies. 42 studies were finished, and one was still going. The 42 finished studies included 3548 people. These studies looked at many different medicines. Some studies looked at shots of numbing medicine in the scalp. Others looked at shots of numbing medicine around nerves in the scalp. Some looked at common pain pills like ibuprofen (NSAIDs) or Tylenol (acetaminophen). Other studies looked at medicines like dexmedetomidine, opioids, or gabapentin.

We found that some medicines really helped. NSAIDs reduced pain for up to 24 hours after surgery. Dexmedetomidine and numbing shots around scalp nerves lowered pain in the first 12 hours. Gabapentin or pregabalin reduced pain in the first 6 hours. Numbing shots around the cut area greatly reduced pain for 48 hours. But these numbing shots did not help with pain earlier on.

When numbing shots were given around scalp nerves, the timing mattered. Shots given after surgery helped more in the first 6 hours. Shots given before surgery helped more from 12 to 24 hours later.

Some treatments also meant people needed fewer other pain medicines. These included numbing shots around scalp nerves and dexmedetomidine. Gabapentin or pregabalin also made it less likely for people to feel sick or throw up after surgery. Tylenol did not stop pain after brain surgery. It also did not reduce the need for more pain medicine.

We did not find enough proof to say if any of these medicines made people more or less sleepy. We also could not say if they changed how long people stayed in the hospital. We also could not tell if different medicines worked better for different types of brain surgery.

Overall, we have a lot of trust in the results for NSAIDs helping with pain. We have some trust in the results for dexmedetomidine, Tylenol, gabapentin, pregabalin, and numbing shots around scalp nerves. We have less trust in the results for numbing shots around the cut area, how much more pain medicine was needed, and feeling sick after surgery.","Preventing pain after brain surgery
The problem 
There is increasing evidence that people who have undergone brain surgery experience significant pain. This pain can have serious consequences including raised blood pressure, agitation, prolonged recovery time and an increased risk of long‐term headaches. Research studies have looked at different drugs in an attempt to reduce the risk of pain for these people. There is now more evidence about pain reduction options for adults undergoing brain surgery but there remains uncertainty as to which options work best. 
The question 
This review aimed to determine which drugs provide the best chance of reducing pain for adults undergoing brain surgery, by collecting and combining the results of studies that looked at pain‐relieving drugs for this patient group. To provide an accurate answer to this question, only studies conducted in accordance with an approved high standard were included. Studies published in different languages and countries were included in order to obtain as much information as possible. 
In addition to determining which drugs were best at preventing or reducing pain after brain surgery, this review attempted to determine additional information such as how much additional pain‐relieving treatment was required in addition to the treatment under study; whether participants' pain was adequately controlled or not; how drowsy the participants were; what side effects they experienced; and how long they needed to stay in intensive care and in hospital. This review also considered whether some treatments worked better when given before or after surgery or for people undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. 
The results 
A total of 43 eligible studies, (42 complete and one still in progress), were found. Of the 42 completed studies (3548 participants), 10 studied injections of local anaesthetic into the scalp, 12 studied injection of local anaesthetic around specific scalp nerves, 8 studied nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 4 studied dexmedetomidine, 4 studied acetaminophen aka paracetamol), 2 studied opioid drugs, 3 studied gabapentin or pregabalin (anti‐seizure drugs that can also be used for pain relief) together with 1 study each of local anaesthetic injected into the veins, local anaesthetic injected into the jaw and the drug flupirtine.

When the timing of injection of local anaesthetics was examined, local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves provided better early pain relief (first 6 hours) when injected after surgery and better late pain relief (12 and 24 hours) when injected before surgery. 
The following interventions were also found to reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs: local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and dexmedetomidine. Gabapentin or pregabalin was found to reduce the risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery. 
Acetaminophen was not found to prevent pain after brain surgery or reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs. 
Insufficient evidence was found to determine whether any of these drugs made the participants more or less drowsy, affected how long they needed to stay in intensive care or whether different drugs worked better for adults undergoing different approaches to brain surgery.

10.1002-14651858.CD005293.pub2,"Treatments for accidental damage during surgery to the nerves supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin 
Review question 
The main question addressed by this review is how effective are different treatments and what are the best timings for these treatments following accidental damage during surgery to the nerves that supply sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin. 
Background 
The nerves (alveolar and lingual) supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin, may be injured as a result of surgical treatments to the mouth and face, including surgery to remove lower wisdom teeth. The vast majority (90%) of these injuries are temporary and get better within eight weeks. However if they last for longer than six months they are considered to be permanent. Damage to these nerves can lead to altered sensation in the region of the lower lip and chin, or tongue or both. Furthermore, damage to the nerve supplying the tongue may lead to altered taste perception. These injuries can affect people's quality of life leading to emotional problems, problems with socialising and disabilities. Accidental injury after surgery can also give rise to legal action. 
There are many interventions or treatments available, surgical and non‐surgical, that may enhance recovery, including improving sensation. They can be grouped as. 
1. Surgical – a variety of procedures. 2. Laser treatment – low‐level laser treatment has been used to treat partial loss of sensation. 3. Medical – treatment with drugs including antiepileptics, antidepressants and painkillers. 4. Counselling – including cognitive behavioural and relaxation therapy, changing behaviour and hypnosis. 
Study characteristics 
The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review, and the evidence is current as of 9 October 2013. There are two studies included, both published in 1996, which compared low‐level laser treatment to placebo or fake treatment for partial loss of sensation following surgery to the lower jaw. There were 15 participants in one study and 16 in the other, their ages ranging from 17 to 55 years. All had suffered accidental damage to nerves of the lower jaw and tongue causing some loss of sensation following surgery. 
Key results 
Low‐level laser therapy was the only treatment to be evaluated in the included studies and this was compared to fake or placebo laser therapy. No studies were found that evaluated other surgical, medical or counselling treatments. 
There was some evidence of an improvement when participants reported whether or not sensation was better in the lip and chin areas with low‐level laser therapy. This is based on the results of a single, small study, so the results should be interpreted with caution. 
No studies reported on the effects of the treatment on other outcomes such as pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste. No studies reported on quality of life or harm. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence is very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the two included studies and the low number of participants, and evidence from participants with only partial sensory loss. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title

Help for Tongue, Lip, and Chin Nerves After Surgery

### Rationale

Sometimes, surgery in the mouth or face can harm nerves. These nerves help you feel things in your tongue, lower lip, and chin. They also help with taste. Wisdom tooth removal is one type of surgery that can cause this.

Most of the time, nerve damage gets better quickly. It usually heals within two months. But if the problem lasts longer than six months, it may be permanent. This can make it hard to feel things in your face or tongue. It can also change how food tastes.

These problems can make people feel sad or worried. It can be hard to spend time with others. It can even cause trouble with daily tasks. Doctors want to find the best ways to help people get better. They want to know what treatments work best. They also want to know when to give these treatments. This study looks at different ways to fix nerve damage. It checks if some treatments can make people feel better.

### Trial Design

This study asked a big question: ""What treatments help with nerve damage from surgery, and when is the best time to give them?""

Experts looked at old studies that were done on this topic. They found two studies that matched what they were looking for. Both studies were published in 1996. These studies looked at a treatment called low-level laser therapy. This is a special light treatment.

The studies compared this light treatment to a ""fake"" treatment. The fake treatment used a laser that was not turned on. This helped them see if the real laser treatment made a difference.

There were 31 people in total across both studies. One study had 15 people. The other study had 16 people. The people were between 17 and 55 years old. All of them had some nerve damage after jaw or tongue surgery. They had trouble feeling things in their lower jaw or tongue. The studies checked to see if the laser treatment helped them feel better. We do not know how long each person was in the study.

### Results

Only one type of treatment was studied in these reports: low-level laser therapy. This was a special light treatment. It was compared to a fake laser treatment.

One small study found that people felt better with the low-level laser therapy. They said their lip and chin felt more normal. But this was just one small study. So, we need to be careful about what this means. More research is needed to be sure.

The studies did not look at other important things. They did not check if the treatment helped with pain. They did not check if it made eating or speaking easier. They also did not look at changes in taste. The studies also did not say if the treatment improved how people felt about their lives. They also did not report if there were any harms from the treatment.

Overall, the studies were not very strong. They had some problems in how they were done. There were also only a few people in the studies. The people in the studies only had some loss of feeling, not complete loss. So, we need more studies to find clear answers.","Treatments for accidental damage during surgery to the nerves supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin

10.1002-14651858.CD013193,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are high‐risk skin cancers which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early curable cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Teledermatology provides a way for generalist clinicians to access the opinion of a specialist dermatologist for skin lesions that they consider to be suspicious without referring the patients through the normal referral pathway. Teledermatology consultations can be 'store‐and‐forward' with electronic digital images of a lesion sent to a dermatologist for review at a later time, or can be live and interactive consultations using videoconferencing to connect the patient, referrer and dermatologist in real time. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of teledermatology for the detection of any skin cancer (melanoma, BCC or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)) in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of in‐person diagnosis. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CPCI, Zetoc, Science Citation Index, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies evaluating skin cancer diagnosis for teledermatology alone, or in comparison with face‐to‐face diagnosis by a specialist clinician, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up and expert opinion. We also included studies evaluating the referral accuracy of teledermatology compared with a reference standard of face‐to‐face diagnosis by a specialist clinician. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where there were information related to the target condition of any skin cancer missing. Data permitting, we estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. Due to the scarcity of data, we undertook no covariate investigations for this review. For illustrative purposes, we plotted estimates of sensitivity and specificity on coupled forest plots for diagnostic threshold and target condition under consideration. 
Main results
The review included 22 studies reporting diagnostic accuracy data for 4057 lesions and 879 malignant cases (16 studies) and referral accuracy data for reported data for 1449 lesions and 270 'positive' cases as determined by the reference standard face‐to‐face decision (six studies). Methodological quality was variable with poor reporting hindering assessment. The overall risk of bias was high or unclear for participant selection, reference standard, and participant flow and timing in at least half of all studies; the majority were at low risk of bias for the index test. The applicability of study findings were of high or unclear concern for most studies in all domains assessed due to the recruitment of participants from secondary care settings or specialist clinics rather than from primary or community‐based settings in which teledermatology is more likely to be used and due to the acquisition of lesion images by dermatologists or in specialist imaging units rather than by primary care clinicians. 
Seven studies provided data for the primary target condition of any skin cancer (1588 lesions and 638 malignancies). For the correct diagnosis of lesions as malignant using photographic images, summary sensitivity was 94.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 90.1% to 97.4%) and summary specificity was 84.3% (95% CI 48.5% to 96.8%) (from four studies). Individual study estimates using dermoscopic images or a combination of photographic and dermoscopic images generally suggested similarly high sensitivities with highly variable specificities. Limited comparative data suggested similar diagnostic accuracy between teledermatology assessment and in‐person diagnosis by a dermatologist; however, data were too scarce to draw firm conclusions. For the detection of invasive melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants both sensitivities and specificities were more variable. Sensitivities ranged from 59% (95% CI 42% to 74%) to 100% (95% CI 48% to 100%) and specificities from 30% (95% CI 22% to 40%) to 100% (95% CI 93% to 100%), with reported diagnostic thresholds including the correct diagnosis of melanoma, classification of lesions as 'atypical' or 'typical, and the decision to refer or to excise a lesion. 
Referral accuracy data comparing teledermatology against a face‐to‐face reference standard suggested good agreement for lesions considered to require some positive action by face‐to‐face assessment (sensitivities of over 90%). For lesions considered of less concern when assessed face‐to‐face (e.g. for lesions not recommended for excision or referral), agreement was more variable with teledermatology specificities ranging from 57% (95% CI 39% to 73%) to 100% (95% CI 86% to 100%), suggesting that remote assessment is more likely recommend excision, referral or follow‐up compared to in‐person decisions. 
Authors' conclusions
Studies were generally small and heterogeneous and methodological quality was difficult to judge due to poor reporting. Bearing in mind concerns regarding the applicability of study participants and of lesion image acquisition in specialist settings, our results suggest that teledermatology can correctly identify the majority of malignant lesions. Using a more widely defined threshold to identify 'possibly' malignant cases or lesions that should be considered for excision is likely to appropriately triage those lesions requiring face‐to‐face assessment by a specialist. Despite the increasing use of teledermatology on an international level, the evidence base to support its ability to accurately diagnose lesions and to triage lesions from primary to secondary care is lacking and further prospective and pragmatic evaluation is needed. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study:

**1. Plain Title: Photos and Videos Help Find Skin Cancer**

**2. Rationale**

Skin cancer is a big problem. Some types, like melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma, can spread and cause serious health issues. Basal cell carcinoma usually stays in one spot but can damage nearby skin. Finding these cancers early is key. It helps doctors treat them before they get worse.

Sometimes, it's hard to tell if a skin spot is cancer or not. Doctors want to catch all cancers. But they also don't want to cut out spots that are not cancer. This causes worry for patients and can lead to unneeded trips to the clinic.

Teledermatology can help with this. It lets local doctors send pictures or videos of skin spots to skin specialists. This means patients might not need to travel for every visit. This study looked at how well teledermatology finds skin cancer. We wanted to see if it works as well as seeing a skin doctor in person. This way, more people could get quick advice from a specialist.

**3. Trial Design**

This study looked at many past studies. We wanted to know ""How well does looking at skin through photos or videos find skin cancer?"" We searched many health databases up to August 2016. We looked for studies about adults with skin spots. These studies used teledermatology to check for any type of skin cancer. This includes melanoma, BCC, and SCC.

The studies we chose compared teledermatology to a true diagnosis. This true diagnosis came from a biopsy (a small piece of skin checked under a microscope) or from a specialist doctor's long-term follow-up. We also looked at how well teledermatology decided if a patient needed to see a specialist in person.

We brought together all the data from these studies. We checked the quality of each study. We wanted to see if the way they did their research was fair and clear. Each study had patients of different ages and health issues. They had various skin spots that doctors thought might be cancer. The time a person was followed in each study varied.

**4. Results**

We looked at 22 studies in total. These studies involved more than 4,000 skin spots. Over 800 of these spots were cancer.

The results showed that teledermatology is good at finding skin cancer. When doctors used photos, they correctly found almost 95 out of every 100 skin cancers. They also correctly said that a spot was *not* cancer most of the time. When doctors used special magnified photos (dermoscopy) or a mix of photos and dermoscopy, they also found most cancers.

It seemed that teledermatology worked about as well as a skin doctor seeing the patient in person. But there was not enough data to say this for sure. For very serious skin cancers like melanoma, the results were more varied. Some studies found all cases, while others missed some.

The study also looked at how well teledermatology decided if a patient needed to see a specialist. Teledermatology was very good at spotting spots that needed quick action. It correctly found over 90 out of 100 spots that a specialist would want to check. However, remote checks were more likely to suggest that a spot needed removal, a referral, or more check-ups, even if a specialist in person might not have been as worried. This means teledermatology might be a bit cautious, which could be a good thing.

The studies we reviewed were often small. It was sometimes hard to tell how well they were done because they did not always give enough details. Also, many studies looked at patients who were already seeing specialists, not people in their local doctor's office. This might make the results seem better than they would be in real life.

The main takeaway is that teledermatology can find most skin cancers. It can also help decide which spots need a closer look by a skin specialist. This could help more people get the right care. However, we need more studies that are bigger and look at how teledermatology is used in everyday doctor's offices.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of teledermatology for the diagnosis of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are different types of skin cancer. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms and it is important to identify it early so that it can be removed. If it is not recognised when first brought to the attention of doctors (also known as a false‐negative test result) treatment can be delayed resulting in the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body and possibly causing early death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are usually localised skin cancers, although cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Calling something a skin cancer when it is not really a skin cancer (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations that can cause stress and worry to the patient. Making the correct diagnosis is important. Mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether teledermatology is accurate enough to identify which people with skin lesions need to be referred to see a specialist dermatologist (a doctor concerned with disease of the skin) and who can be safely reassured that their lesion (damage or change of the skin) is not malignant. We included 22 studies to answer this question. 
What was studied in the review? 
Teledermatology means sending pictures of skin lesions or rashes to a specialist for advice on diagnosis or management. It is a way for primary care doctors (general practitioners (GPs)) to get an opinion from a specialist dermatologist without having to refer patients through the normal referral pathway. Teledermatology can involve sending photographs or magnified images of a skin lesion taken with a special camera (dermatoscope) to a skin specialist to look at or it might involve immediate discussion about a skin lesion between a GP and a skin specialist using videoconferencing. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included 22 studies, 16 studies comparing teledermatology diagnoses to the final lesion diagnoses (diagnostic accuracy) for 4057 lesions and 879 malignant cases and five studies comparing teledermatology decisions to the decisions that would be made with the patient present (referral accuracy) for 1449 lesions and 270 'positive' cases. 
The studies were very different from each other in terms of the types of people with suspicious skin cancer lesions included and the type of teledermatology used. A single reliable estimate of the accuracy of teledermatology could not be made. For the correct diagnosis of a lesion to be a skin cancer, data suggested that less than 7% of malignant skin lesions were missed by teledermatology. Study results were too variable to tell us how many people would be referred unnecessarily for a specialist dermatology appointment following a teledermatology consultation. Without access to teledermatology services however, most of the lesions included in these studies would likely be referred to a dermatologist. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
In the included studies, the final diagnosis of skin cancer was made by lesion biopsy (taking a small sample of the lesion so it could be examined under a microscope) and the absence of skin cancer was confirmed by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer. In a few studies, a diagnosis of no skin cancer was made by a skin specialist rather than biopsy. This is less likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer*. Poor reporting of what was done in the study made it difficult for us to say how reliable the study results are. Selecting some patients from specialist clinics instead of primary care along with different ways of doing teledermatology were common problems. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in: Europe (64%), North America (18%), South America (9%) or Oceania (9%). The average age of people who were studied was 52 years; however, several studies included at least some people under the age of 16 years. The percentage of people with skin cancer ranged between 2% and 88% with an average of 30%, which is much higher than would be observed in a primary care setting in the UK. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Teledermatology is likely to be a good way of helping GPs to decide which skin lesions need to be seen by a skin specialist. Our review suggests that using magnified images, in addition to photographs of the lesion, improves accuracy. More research is needed to establish the best way of providing teledermatology services. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow‐up or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference comparisons.

10.1002-14651858.CD013679,"Background
The global burden of poor maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) accounts for more than a quarter of healthy years of life lost worldwide. Targeted client communication (TCC) via mobile devices (MD) (TCCMD) may be a useful strategy to improve MNCH. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of TCC via MD on health behaviour, service use, health, and well‐being for MNCH. 
Search methods
In July/August 2017, we searched five databases including The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched two trial registries. A search update was carried out in July 2019 and potentially relevant studies are awaiting classification. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that assessed TCC via MD to improve MNCH behaviour, service use, health, and well‐being. Eligible comparators were usual care/no intervention, non‐digital TCC, and digital non‐targeted client communication. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane, although data extraction and risk of bias assessments were carried out by one person only and cross‐checked by a second. 
Main results
We included 27 trials (17,463 participants). Trial populations were: pregnant and postpartum women (11 trials conducted in low‐, middle‐ or high‐income countries (LMHIC); pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV (three trials carried out in one lower middle‐income country); and parents of children under the age of five years (13 trials conducted in LMHIC). Most interventions (18) were delivered via text messages alone, one was delivered through voice calls only, and the rest were delivered through combinations of different communication channels, such as multimedia messages and voice calls. 
Pregnant and postpartum women 
TCCMD versus standard care 
For behaviours, TCCMD may increase exclusive breastfeeding in settings where rates of exclusive breastfeeding are less common (risk ratio (RR) 1.30, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.06 to 1.59; low‐certainty evidence), but have little or no effect in settings where almost all women breastfeed (low‐certainty evidence). For use of health services, TCCMD may increase antenatal appointment attendance (odds ratio (OR) 1.54, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.96; low‐certainty evidence); however, the CI encompasses both benefit and harm. The intervention may increase skilled attendants at birth in settings where a lack of skilled attendants at birth is common (though this differed by urban/rural residence), but may make no difference in settings where almost all women already have a skilled attendant at birth (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.94; low‐certainty evidence). There were uncertain effects on maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity because the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low. 
TCCMD versus non‐digital TCC (e.g. pamphlets) 
TCCMD may have little or no effect on exclusive breastfeeding (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.07; low‐certainty evidence). TCCMD may reduce 'any maternal health problem' (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.79) and 'any newborn health problem' (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.06) reported up to 10 days postpartum (low‐certainty evidence), though the CI for the latter includes benefit and harm. The effect on health service use is unknown due to a lack of studies. 
TCCMD versus digital non‐targeted communication 
No studies reported behavioural, health, or well‐being outcomes for this comparison. For use of health services, there are uncertain effects for the presence of a skilled attendant at birth due to very low‐certainty evidence, and the intervention may make little or no difference to attendance for antenatal influenza vaccination (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.58), though the CI encompasses both benefit and harm (low‐certainty evidence). 
Pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV 
TCCMD versus standard care 
For behaviours, TCCMD may make little or no difference to maternal and infant adherence to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (low‐certainty evidence). For health service use, TCC mobile telephone reminders may increase use of antenatal care slightly (mean difference (MD) 1.5, 95% CI –0.36 to 3.36; low‐certainty evidence). The effect on the proportion of births occurring in a health facility is uncertain due to very low‐certainty evidence. For health and well‐being outcomes, there was an uncertain intervention effect on neonatal death or stillbirth, and infant HIV due to very low‐certainty evidence. No studies reported on maternal mortality or morbidity. 
TCCMD versus non‐digital TCC 
The effect is unknown due to lack of studies reporting this comparison.
TCCMD versus digital non‐targeted communication 
TCCMD may increase infant ARV/prevention of mother‐to‐child transmission treatment adherence (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.48; low‐certainty evidence). The effect on other outcomes is unknown due to lack of studies. 
Parents of children aged less than five years 
No studies reported on correct treatment, nutritional, or health outcomes.
TCCMD versus standard care 
Based on 10 trials, TCCMD may modestly increase health service use (vaccinations and HIV care) (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.34; low‐certainty evidence); however, the effect estimates varied widely between studies. 
TCCMD versus non‐digital TCC 
TCCMD may increase attendance for vaccinations (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.28; low‐certainty evidence), and may make little or no difference to oral hygiene practices (low‐certainty evidence). 
TCCMD versus digital non‐targeted communication 
TCCMD may reduce attendance for vaccinations, but the CI encompasses both benefit and harm (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.20; low‐certainty evidence). 
No trials in any population reported data on unintended consequences.
Authors' conclusions
The effect of TCCMD for most outcomes is uncertain. There may be improvements for some outcomes using targeted communication but these findings were of low certainty. High‐quality, adequately powered trials and cost‐effectiveness analyses are required to reliably ascertain the effects and relative benefits of TCCMD. Future studies should measure potential unintended consequences, such as partner violence or breaches of confidentiality. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Can Mobile Phone Messages Help Moms and Kids Stay Healthy?

### Rationale

Being a new mom, a baby, or a young child can be tough. Many health problems can happen during this time. These problems cause a lot of harm around the world.

We want to see if talking to people on their cell phones can help. This is called ""targeted client communication"" or TCC. We want to know if TCC helps moms and kids stay healthy. We also want to know if it helps them use health services. We think TCC might make a big difference.

### Trial Design

We looked at many past studies. These studies tested TCC using cell phones. They included a total of 27 studies with 17,463 people.

The studies focused on different groups:
* Pregnant and new moms (11 studies). These studies were from many different countries.
* Pregnant and new moms with HIV (3 studies). These were from one country.
* Parents of young kids under five years old (13 studies). These were from many different countries.

Most studies sent text messages. Some used phone calls. Others used a mix of messages and calls. We compared TCC to usual care, old-fashioned ways of sharing health info, or general digital messages.

### Results

What did we find? It's a bit mixed.

For pregnant and new moms:
* If breastfeeding is not common, TCC might help more moms breastfeed.
* TCC might help more moms go to their doctor visits during pregnancy. But we are not fully sure.
* TCC might help more women have skilled help during birth in some places.
* We are not sure about TCC's effect on moms or babies dying or getting sick.
* TCC might reduce some health problems for moms and babies after birth.

For pregnant and new moms with HIV:
* TCC might not change how well moms and babies take their HIV medicine.
* TCC reminders might slightly help moms go to their doctor visits during pregnancy.
* We are not sure about TCC's effect on babies born in a hospital.
* TCC might help babies take their HIV medicine better.

For parents of kids under five:
* TCC might slightly help parents get their kids vaccinated or get HIV care.
* TCC might help more kids get their shots.

We did not find clear answers for most health issues. There were no studies about bad things that might happen with TCC, like privacy issues.

In conclusion, TCC on cell phones might help in some ways. But we need more, better studies to be sure. We need to know if it's worth the cost. We also need to check for any unexpected problems.","Communicating to pregnant woman and parents through their mobile devices to improve maternal, neonatal, and child health 
Aim of this review 
We assessed the effect of sending targeted messages by mobile devices to pregnant women and parents of young children about health and healthcare services. 
Key messages 
There are gaps in the evidence regarding the effects of targeted messages by mobile devices to pregnant women and parents of young children about health and healthcare services. Some of these messages may improve some people's health and their use of health services, but others may make little or no difference. The existing evidence is mostly of low or very low certainty. 
What was studied in the review? 
Targeted client communication (TCC) is an intervention in which the health system sends information to particular people, based on their health status or other factors specific to that population group. Common types of TCC are text messages reminding people to attend appointments or that offer healthcare information and support. Our review assessed whether TCC can change pregnant women's and parents' behaviour, health service use, health, and well‐being. 
What happens when pregnant women receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to women who get no messages 
Women may breastfeed more in settings where exclusive breastfeeding is not common. They may also go to more antenatal care appointments. They may use skilled birth attendants more where this is less common. We do not know if the messages affect women's or babies' health because the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
Compared to women who get messages sent in other ways 
Women and newborns may have fewer health problems during the first 10 days after birth. The messages may make little or no difference to the number of women who breastfeed. We do not know if they make women use more health services. 
Compared to women who get untargeted messages 
The messages may make little or no difference to whether women get influenza vaccines during pregnancy. We do not know if the messages affect women's or babies' health or lead women to use skilled birth attendants more because the evidence is lacking or of very low certainty. 
What happens when pregnant women living with HIV receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to women who get no messages 
Women may go to slightly more antenatal care appointments. We do not know whether the messages lead more women to give birth in a health facility or improve babies' health because the evidence is of very low certainty. The messages may make little or no difference to whether pregnant women and babies follow antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (used to treat HIV) according to plan. We do not know if the messages affect women's health because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to women who get messages sent in other ways 
We do not know what the effect of these messages is because we lack evidence.
Compared to women who get untargeted messages 
More parents may follow their babies' ARV treatment according to plan. We do not know if the messages improve women's or babies' health or their use of services because the evidence is missing. 
What happens when parents of young children receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to parents who get no messages 
More parents may take their children to healthcare services such as vaccination appointments. But we do not know if the messages improve children's health or their health behaviour because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to parents who get messages sent in other ways 
Slightly more parents may take their children to vaccination appointments. The messages may make little or no difference to children's toothbrushing habits. We do not know if the messages affect children's health because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to parents who get untargeted messages 
Fewer parents may take their children to vaccination appointments, but this evidence is mixed. We do not know if the messages affect children's health due to lack of evidence. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies published up to August 2017. We carried out a search update in July 2019 and relevant studies are reported in the 'Characteristics of studies awaiting classification' section.

10.1002-14651858.CD013432.pub2,"Background
Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of hospital admissions, disease‐related morbidity and mortality. COPD is a heterogeneous disease with distinct inflammatory phenotypes, including eosinophilia, which may drive acute exacerbations in a subgroup of patients. Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin 5 (IL‐5) or its receptor (IL‐5R) have a role in the care of people with severe eosinophilic asthma, and may similarly provide therapeutic benefit for people with COPD of eosinophilic phenotype. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibody therapies targeting IL‐5 signalling (anti‐IL‐5 or anti‐IL‐5Rα) compared with placebo in the treatment of adults with COPD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, clinical trials registries, manufacturers' websites, and reference lists of included studies. Our most recent search was 23 September 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing anti‐IL‐5 therapy with placebo in adults with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and analysed outcomes using a random‐effects model.The primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring antibiotics or oral steroids, hospitalisations due to exacerbation of COPD, serious adverse events, and quality of life. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
Six studies involving a total of 5542 participants met our inclusion criteria. Three studies used mepolizumab (1530 participants), and three used benralizumab (4012 participants). The studies were on people with COPD, which was similarly defined with a documented history of COPD for at least one year. We deemed the risk of bias to be generally low, with all studies contributing data of robust methodology. 
Mepolizumab 100 mg reduces the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations by 19% in those with an eosinophil count of at least 150/μL (rate ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.93; participants = 911; studies = 2, high‐certainty evidence). When participants with lower eosinophils are included, mepolizumab 100 mg probably reduces the exacerbation rate by 8% (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03; participants = 1285; studies = 2, moderate‐certainty evidence). Mepolizumab 300 mg probably reduces the rate of exacerbations by 14% in participants all of whom had raised eosinophils (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.06; participants = 451; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence); the evidence was uncertain for a single small study of mepolizumab 750 mg. In participants with high eosinophils, mepolizumab probably reduces the rate of hospitalisation by 10% (100 mg, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.24; participants = 911; studies = 2, moderate‐certainty evidence) and 17% (300 mg, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.35; participants = 451; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence). Mepolizumab 100 mg increases the time to first moderate or severe exacerbation compared to the placebo group, in people with the eosinophilic phenotype (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.92; participants = 981; studies 2, high‐certainty evidence). When participants with lower eosinophils were included this difference was smaller and less certain (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.0; participants = 1285; studies 2, moderate‐certainty evidence). Mepolizumab 300 mg probably increases the time to first moderate or severe exacerbation in participants who all had eosinophilic phenotype (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99; participants = 451; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Benralizumab 100 mg reduces the rate of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalisation in those with an eosinophil count of at least 220/μL (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.81; participants = 1512; studies = 2, high‐certainty evidence). Benralizumab 10 mg probably reduces the rate of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalisation in those with an eosinophil count of at least 220/μL (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94; participants = 765; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
There was probably little or no difference between the intervention and placebo for quality of life measures. Where there were differences the mean difference fell below the pre‐specified minimum clinically significant difference. 
Treatment with mepolizumab and benralizumab appeared to be safe. All pooled analyses showed that there was probably little or no difference in serious adverse events, adverse events, or side effects between the use of a monoclonal antibody therapy compared to placebo. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that mepolizumab and benralizumab probably reduce the rate of moderate and severe exacerbations in the highly selected group of people who have both COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils. This highlights the importance of disease phenotyping in COPD, and may play a role in the personalised treatment strategy in disease management. 
Further research is needed to elucidate the role of monoclonal antibodies in the management of COPD in clinical practice. In particular, it is not clear whether there is a threshold blood eosinophil level above which these drugs may be effective. Studies including cost effectiveness analysis may be beneficial given the high cost of these therapies, to support use if appropriate. 
","## A New Way to Treat Lung Disease

### Rationale

COPD, or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, makes it hard to breathe. It is a common and serious lung disease. People with COPD often have sudden worsenings, called ""flares"" or ""exacerbations."" These flares can be very bad. They often send people to the hospital. They can even lead to death.

Some people with COPD have a lot of white blood cells called eosinophils in their blood. High eosinophils might cause these flares. This study looked at new medicines for COPD. These medicines are called monoclonal antibodies. They target a signal in the body called IL-5. This signal helps control eosinophils.

These medicines work well for a type of asthma. We wanted to see if they could also help people with COPD who have high eosinophils. We hoped these medicines would lower the number of flares. They might also make flares less severe.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many smaller studies. It was a ""review"" of past research. We wanted to know if new medicines could help adults with COPD. These medicines were called anti-IL-5 or anti-IL-5Rα. We compared them to a ""dummy"" medicine, called a placebo.

We looked at studies that were well-designed. These are called ""randomized controlled trials."" They make sure the results are fair. The people in these studies had COPD for at least one year. They were adults, but their exact age varied. The studies checked if the medicines were safe. They also checked if the medicines helped people feel better.

We looked at a few key things. We checked how often people had flares that needed strong medicines. We also looked at how often people went to the hospital for their COPD. We checked if the medicines caused any serious problems. Finally, we looked at how the medicines affected people's quality of life. This means how well they felt and could do daily tasks.

### Results

We found six studies that fit our rules. A total of 5542 people were in these studies. Three studies used a medicine called mepolizumab. Three studies used a medicine called benralizumab. All studies looked at people with COPD. The studies were well-done and fair.

**For Mepolizumab:**

*   **Less Flares:** If people had high eosinophils, mepolizumab 100 mg lowered their moderate or severe flares by about 2 out of every 10 flares. This was a clear benefit.
*   If we included people with lower eosinophils, the medicine still helped. It lowered flares by about 1 out of every 10 flares.
*   A higher dose of mepolizumab (300 mg) also helped. It lowered flares by about 1.5 out of every 10 flares in people with high eosinophils.
*   **Less Hospital Stays:** In people with high eosinophils, mepolizumab 100 mg likely lowered hospital stays by about 1 out of every 10 stays. The 300 mg dose likely lowered hospital stays by almost 2 out of every 10 stays.
*   **More Time Between Flares:** Mepolizumab 100 mg also made the time between flares longer. This was true for people with high eosinophils. The 300 mg dose also made the time between flares longer for these people.

**For Benralizumab:**

*   **Less Hospital Stays for Severe Flares:** Benralizumab 100 mg lowered severe flares that needed a hospital stay. This was for people with very high eosinophils (at least 220 per microliter). It lowered these severe flares by almost 4 out of every 10 flares.
*   A lower dose of benralizumab (10 mg) also helped. It lowered severe flares needing a hospital stay by about 3 out of every 10 flares. This was also for people with very high eosinophils.

**Quality of Life and Safety:**

*   The medicines did not make a big difference in how people felt day-to-day.
*   Both mepolizumab and benralizumab seemed safe. There were no big differences in serious problems or side effects compared to the dummy medicine.

**Conclusions:**

These new medicines, mepolizumab and benralizumab, seem to help. They likely lower moderate and severe flares in people with COPD. But this benefit is mainly for people who also have high eosinophils in their blood.

This study shows that it is key to know what type of COPD a person has. This can help doctors choose the best treatment. More study is needed to know exactly how these medicines should be used. We also need to know if they are worth the high cost.","Mepolizumab or benralizumab for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
Background to the question 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung condition in which people can experience severe difficulties with breathing and an associated reduction in their quality of life. 
For people with COPD, episodes in which the condition of patients seriously worsens are a major concern. We examined the findings of clinical trials to see whether mepolizumab or benralizumab, two new drugs, are better than placebo (dummy treatment) for people with COPD, and whether they reduce the number of episodes when the condition of patients seriously worsens. 
Study characteristics 
Six clinical studies compared either mepolizumab or benralizumab to placebo in a total of 5542 people with COPD. We examined the findings of the studies in terms of episodes when patients' conditions flared up requiring additional treatment, patient quality of life, patient performance in breathing tests, and side effects of the medication. 
Main results 
Three studies used mepolizumab, and the other three studies used benralizumab.
Mepolizumab 100 mg reduced the rate of flare‐ups in a group of people with both COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils (a type of white blood cells involved in inflammatory and allergic reactions). When mepolizumab is given in a higher dose (300 mg or 750 mg) the rate of flare‐ups is probably reduced. 
Benralizumab at a dose of 100mg resulted in a clear reduction in the number of episodes requiring admission to hospital, and when given at a lower dose (10mg) probably reduces flare‐ups requiring hospitalisation. This is in people with COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils. 
Further studies comparing mepolizumab or benralizumab to a placebo may provide more clarity on the role of these drugs for COPD. 
Quality of the evidence 
The included studies were for the most part very well‐designed and robust, and the evidence was generally of high quality.

### Brittle Bone Disease Medicine

**Rationale**

Brittle bone disease is a health problem. Doctors call it osteogenesis imperfecta. It makes bones break very easily. This can cause a lot of pain. People may break long bones in their arms or legs. Bones in the back can also break down.

This disease runs in families. A parent can pass it to a child. Sometimes, it just happens in a child. There is no cure for it right now. Doctors mostly try to help with symptoms.

This study looked at a type of medicine. These medicines are called bisphosphonates. They can make bones stronger. This might help stop bones from breaking. This study wants to see if this medicine works. It also wants to check if it is safe for people.

**Trial Design**

This study is a review of other studies. It looked at past trials. These trials tested bisphosphonate medicines. This medicine often treats weak bones in older people. It was used here for brittle bone disease.

The trials included people with brittle bone disease. Both children and adults were in these studies. The goal was to see if the medicine helped. It wanted to see if bones broke less often.

The study looked at 14 different trials. These trials tested how the medicine worked. They also checked for any problems. The review gathered all this information.

**Results**

The studies showed something good. The medicine made bones denser. Denser bones are stronger bones. This was true for all the trials. People took the medicine by mouth or through a shot.

But the studies did not show a big change in breaks. Most trials did not see many fewer broken bones. This was a key finding.

Other things were not clear. We do not know much about pain relief. We also do not know about growth. How people felt about their lives was not clear either. The studies did not give enough details.

More study is needed. We need to know how well the medicine works over time. We also need to know if it is safe for a long time. The right amount of medicine is also not clear. How long to take it needs more study too.

Many of the studies were small. They did not have enough people. This made it hard to be sure about some results. More big studies are needed.","Bisphosphonate therapy for osteogenesis imperfecta

10.1002-14651858.CD013186,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) are high‐risk skin cancers which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early curable cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Computer‐assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems use artificial intelligence to analyse lesion data and arrive at a diagnosis of skin cancer. When used in unreferred settings ('primary care'), CAD may assist general practitioners (GPs) or other clinicians to more appropriately triage high‐risk lesions to secondary care. Used alongside clinical and dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, CAD may reduce unnecessary excisions without missing melanoma cases. 
Objectives
To determine the accuracy of CAD systems for diagnosing cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, BCC or cSCC in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of dermoscopy. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design that evaluated CAD alone, or in comparison with dermoscopy, in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma or BCC or cSCC, and compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities separately by type of CAD system, using the bivariate hierarchical model. We compared CAD with dermoscopy using (a) all available CAD data (indirect comparisons), and (b) studies providing paired data for both tests (direct comparisons). We tested the contribution of human decision‐making to the accuracy of CAD diagnoses in a sensitivity analysis by removing studies that gave CAD results to clinicians to guide diagnostic decision‐making. 
Main results
We included 42 studies, 24 evaluating digital dermoscopy‐based CAD systems (Derm–CAD) in 23 study cohorts with 9602 lesions (1220 melanomas, at least 83 BCCs, 9 cSCCs), providing 32 datasets for Derm–CAD and seven for dermoscopy. Eighteen studies evaluated spectroscopy‐based CAD (Spectro–CAD) in 16 study cohorts with 6336 lesions (934 melanomas, 163 BCC, 49 cSCCs), providing 32 datasets for Spectro–CAD and six for dermoscopy. These consisted of 15 studies using multispectral imaging (MSI), two studies using electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and one study using diffuse‐reflectance spectroscopy. Studies were incompletely reported and at unclear to high risk of bias across all domains. Included studies inadequately address the review question, due to an abundance of low‐quality studies, poor reporting, and recruitment of highly selected groups of participants. 
Across all CAD systems, we found considerable variation in the hardware and software technologies used, the types of classification algorithm employed, methods used to train the algorithms, and which lesion morphological features were extracted and analysed across all CAD systems, and even between studies evaluating CAD systems. Meta–analysis found CAD systems had high sensitivity for correct identification of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in highly selected populations, but with low and very variable specificity, particularly for Spectro–CAD systems. Pooled data from 22 studies estimated the sensitivity of Derm–CAD for the detection of melanoma as 90.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 84.0% to 94.0%) and specificity as 74.3% (95% CI 63.6% to 82.7%). Pooled data from eight studies estimated the sensitivity of multispectral imaging CAD (MSI–CAD) as 92.9% (95% CI 83.7% to 97.1%) and specificity as 43.6% (95% CI 24.8% to 64.5%). When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the mean observed melanoma prevalence of 20%, Derm–CAD would miss 20 melanomas and would lead to 206 false‐positive results for melanoma. MSI–CAD would miss 14 melanomas and would lead to 451 false diagnoses for melanoma. Preliminary findings suggest CAD systems are at least as sensitive as assessment of dermoscopic images for the diagnosis of invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants. We are unable to make summary statements about the use of CAD in unreferred populations, or its accuracy in detecting keratinocyte cancers, or its use in any setting as a diagnostic aid, because of the paucity of studies. 
Authors' conclusions
In highly selected patient populations all CAD types demonstrate high sensitivity, and could prove useful as a back‐up for specialist diagnosis to assist in minimising the risk of missing melanomas. However, the evidence base is currently too poor to understand whether CAD system outputs translate to different clinical decision–making in practice. Insufficient data are available on the use of CAD in community settings, or for the detection of keratinocyte cancers. The evidence base for individual systems is too limited to draw conclusions on which might be preferred for practice. Prospective comparative studies are required that evaluate the use of already evaluated CAD systems as diagnostic aids, by comparison to face–to–face dermoscopy, and in participant populations that are representative of those in which the test would be used in practice.

## Plain Title: Computers Help Spot Skin Cancer, But Need More Study

### Rationale

Skin cancer is a big worry. Some types, like melanoma and cSCC, can spread in the body and become very serious. Other types, like BCC, usually stay in one place but can still harm nearby tissue. Finding these cancers early is key to good treatment and a better chance of getting well.

Doctors want to find all cancers quickly. But they also want to avoid cutting out skin spots that are not cancer. This causes worry and unnecessary surgery.

New computer systems use smart technology. These systems look at skin spots. They try to figure out if a spot is cancer. This study looked at these systems. We wanted to see if they can help doctors find skin cancer. We also wanted to see if they can help doctors decide who needs more care.

### Trial Design

How did we do this study? We looked at many past studies. We searched big health databases up to August 2016. We looked for any study that used computer systems to check skin spots.

These studies included adults. These adults had skin spots that doctors thought might be melanoma, BCC, or cSCC. The studies compared the computer systems to a real diagnosis. This real diagnosis came from looking at the skin spot under a microscope or by watching the spot over time.

We gathered all the facts from these studies. Two people checked the facts carefully. We wanted to see how well the computer systems worked. We looked at how often they found cancer when it was there. We also looked at how often they said there was cancer when there wasn't.

### Results

We found 42 studies to include. These studies looked at two main types of computer systems. One type used a special camera called a dermoscope. The other type used light and sound to check the skin.

Many of these studies were not well done. They did not always share all the facts. They often looked at people who already had a high chance of having cancer. So, the results might not be true for everyone.

Overall, the computer systems were good at finding melanoma when it was there. They found melanoma about 90 out of 100 times. This is called high sensitivity. But they often said there was cancer when there wasn't. This means they had low specificity.

For example, for every 1000 skin spots, a computer system might miss 20 melanomas. But it might also say 206 spots are melanoma when they are not. Another system might miss 14 melanomas. But it might say 451 spots are melanoma when they are not. This would lead to many unnecessary doctor visits and worries.

The early findings suggest these computer systems are as good as looking at dermoscope images for finding melanoma. But we need more studies. We don't have enough facts about how well these systems work for all skin cancers. We also don't know how well they work in everyday doctor's offices.

In conclusion, these computer systems can be helpful. They might be a good backup for skin cancer specialists. They could help make sure no melanomas are missed. But we need better studies. We need to see how these systems truly help doctors make decisions. We also need to study them in more types of patients. This will help us know which system is best to use.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of computer‐assisted diagnosis techniques for the detection of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms. If it is not recognised early treatment can be delayed and this risks the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body and may eventually lead to death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and BCC are considered less dangerous, as they are localised (less likely to spread to other parts of the body compared to melanoma). However, cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) might result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations and can cause stress and anxiety to the patient. Missing a diagnosis of skin cancer may result in the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate computer–assisted diagnosis (CAD) is for diagnosing melanoma, BCC or cSCC. The review also compared the accuracy of two different types of CAD, and compared the accuracy of CAD with diagnosis by a doctor using a handheld illuminated microscope (a dermatoscope or ‘dermoscopy’). We included 42 studies to answer these questions. 
What was studied in the review? 
A number of tools are available to skin cancer specialists which allow a more detailed examination of the skin compared to examination by the naked eye alone. Currently a dermatoscope which magnifies the skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) using a bright light source is used by most skin cancer specialists. CAD tests are computer systems that analyse information about skin lesions obtained from a dermatoscope or other techniques that use light to describe the features of a skin lesion (spectroscopy) to produce a result indicating whether skin cancer is likely to be present. We included CAD systems that get their information from dermoscopic images of lesions (Derm–CAD), or that use data from spectroscopy. Most of the spectroscopy studies used data from multispectral imaging (MSI–CAD) and are the main focus here. When a skin cancer specialist finds a lesion is suspicious using visual examination with or without additional dermoscopy, results from CAD systems can be used alone to make a diagnosis of skin cancer (CAD–based diagnosis), or can be used by doctors in addition to their visual inspection examination of a skin lesion to help them reach a diagnosis (CAD–aided diagnosis). Researchers examined how useful CAD systems are to help diagnose skin cancers in addition to visual inspection and dermoscopy. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included 42 studies looking at CAD systems for the diagnosis of melanoma. There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of CAD systems for the diagnosis of BCC (3 studies) or cSCC (1 study). 
Derm‐CAD results for diagnosis of melanoma  
The main results for Derm‐CAD are based on 22 studies including 8992 lesions.
Applied to a group of 1000 skin lesions, of which 200 (20%) are given a final diagnosis* of melanoma, the results suggest that: 
‐ An estimated 386 people will have a Derm–CAD result suggesting that a melanoma is present, and of these 206 (53%) will not actually have a melanoma (false‐positive result) 
‐ Of the 614 people with a Derm–CAD result indicating that no melanoma is present, 20 (3%) will in fact actually have a melanoma (false‐negative result) 
There was no evidence to suggest that dermoscopy or Derm–CAD was different in its ability to detect or rule out melanoma. 
MSI‐CAD results for diagnosis of melanoma  
The main results for MSI–CAD are based on eight studies including 2401 lesions. In a group of 1000 people, of whom 200 (20%) actually do have melanoma*, then: 
‐ An estimated 637 people will have an MSI–CAD result suggesting that a melanoma is present, and of these 451 (71%) will not actually have a melanoma (false‐positive result) 
‐ Of the 363 people with an MSI–CAD result indicating that no melanoma is present, 14 (4%) will in fact have a melanoma (false‐negative result) 
MSI–CAD detects more melanomas, but possibly produces more false‐positive results (an increase in unnecessary surgery). 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
Incomplete reporting of studies made it difficult for us to judge how reliable they were. Many studies had important limitations. Some studies only included particular types of skin lesions or excluded lesions that were considered difficult to diagnose. Importantly, most of the studies only included skin lesions with a biopsy result, which means that only a sample of lesions that would be seen by a doctor in practice were included. These characteristics may result in CAD systems appearing more or less accurate than they actually are. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were largely conducted in Europe (29, 69%) and North America (8, 19%). Mean age (reported in 6/42 studies) ranged from 32 to 49 years for melanoma. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma ranged from 1% to 52%. It was not always possible to tell whether suspicion of skin cancer in study participants was based on clinical examination alone, or both clinical and dermoscopic examinations. Almost all studies were done in people with skin lesions who were seen at specialist clinics rather than by doctors in primary care. 
What are the implications of this review? 
CAD systems appear to be accurate for identification of melanomas in skin lesions that have already been selected for excision on the basis of clinical examination (visual inspection and dermoscopy). It is possible that some CAD systems identify more melanomas than doctors using dermoscopy images. However, CAD systems also produced far more false‐positive diagnoses than dermoscopy, and could lead to considerable increases in unnecessary surgery. The performance of CAD systems for detecting BCC and cSCC skin cancers is unclear. More studies are needed to evaluate the use of CAD by doctors for the diagnosis of skin cancer in comparison to face‐to‐face diagnosis using dermoscopy, both in primary care and in specialist skin cancer clinics. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow up, or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference standards (means of establishing the final diagnosis).

Review question 
Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the most effective way of using gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) as part of controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing assisted reproduction technology (ART). 
Background 
GnRHa are given along with hormone injections that stimulate the ovaries, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous release of eggs prior to their planned surgical retrieval. GnRHa have been proven to improve pregnancy rates; however, various regimens are described in the literature. We conducted this review to identify the most effective regimens. 
Study characteristics 
We found 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 3872 women comparing the use of GnRHa in various protocols. Twenty of these RCTs (1643 women) compared a long protocol with a short protocol. The evidence is current to April 2015. 
Key results 
In comparisons of long GnRHa protocols (where GnRHa is given for at least 14 days prior to the start of ovarian stimulation) versus short GnRHa protocols (when the GnRHa is given at the start of stimulation) there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates. However there was moderate quality evidence of higher clinical pregnancy rates in the long protocol groups. Our findings suggest that in a population in which 14% of women achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a short protocol, between 13% and 23% will achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a long protocol. 
None of the other analyses showed any evidence of a difference in birth or pregnancy outcomes between the protocols compared. There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding adverse effects. Further research is needed to determine which long protocol is most cost effective and acceptable to women. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or ongoing pregnancy, poor reporting of methods in the primary studies, and imprecise findings due to lack of data. Only 10 of the 37 included studies were conducted within the last 10 years.

### Plain Title

Better Ways to Help Women Get Pregnant with IVF

### Rationale

Many women want to have a baby but have trouble getting pregnant naturally. They might choose to use a treatment called assisted reproduction technology (ART), often known as In Vitro Fertilization or IVF. In IVF, doctors help eggs grow, then take them out of the woman's body. They then combine the eggs with sperm to make an embryo. This embryo is then put back into the woman's body.

Before the eggs are taken out, women get shots of hormones to help their ovaries make more eggs. Sometimes, eggs release too early. This makes it harder for the doctors to collect them. To stop this early release, doctors often give a special medicine. This medicine is called a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist, or GnRHa.

GnRHa has been shown to help women get pregnant. But doctors use it in different ways. Some ways might be better than others. This study looked at all the research to find the best way to use GnRHa. We wanted to see which way works best for women trying to get pregnant with ART.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies that were already done. These studies were called randomized controlled trials, or RCTs. In these trials, women were put into different groups by chance. This helps make sure the groups are fair to compare.

We found 37 of these RCTs. These studies included 3872 women in total. All these women were using ART to try and get pregnant. They were given GnRHa in different ways.

Twenty of these studies, with 1643 women, compared two main ways of using GnRHa. One way was called a ""long protocol."" The other way was called a ""short protocol."" In the long protocol, women took GnRHa for at least 14 days before starting the hormone shots for their ovaries. In the short protocol, women started GnRHa at the same time as their hormone shots.

The study looked at information up to April 2015. We wanted to see if one way was better for helping women have a baby.

### Results

We looked at the ""long protocol"" versus the ""short protocol."" We wanted to know if one way led to more babies born alive or more ongoing pregnancies. An ongoing pregnancy means the pregnancy is past the early stages. We did not find strong proof that one way was clearly better than the other for these results.

However, we did find some proof that the long protocol led to more clinical pregnancies. A clinical pregnancy means a doctor confirmed the pregnancy, often by seeing a heartbeat.

Here is what our findings mean for women. If 14 women out of 100 get pregnant with a live birth or ongoing pregnancy using the short protocol, then 13 to 23 women out of 100 might get pregnant with a live birth or ongoing pregnancy using the long protocol. This means the long protocol might help a few more women.

For all the other ways of using GnRHa that we looked at, there was no clear difference. We could not say that one way was better for having a baby.

We also looked at side effects. But there was not enough information to say if one way caused more side effects than another. More studies are needed to find the best long protocol. This includes looking at which way costs the least and which way women like best.

The information we found was of medium to low quality. This is because some studies did not report all the important details. Some studies also did not clearly explain their methods. Also, some studies did not have enough women to give clear answers. Most of the studies were also done a long time ago. Only 10 of the 37 studies were done in the last 10 years.","Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) used as an adjuvant to gonadotrophins in assisted reproduction treatments

10.1002-14651858.CD002779.pub3,"Interventions for treating burning mouth syndrome
Review question 
Which treatments help to relieve symptoms for people with burning mouth syndrome (BMS)?
Background 
BMS is a common painful condition. Symptoms include burning, dryness or uncomfortable sensations in the mouth and changes to taste, with no obvious underlying medical or dental cause. BMS is usually persistent and suffered long term, and can lead to a reduced quality of life (QoL). Currently, scientific research suggests that BMS is caused by underlying damage to the nerves. There are many treatments available including drugs for anxiety, other psychological conditions and increasing saliva production, protective barriers and treatments applied to the mouth surface amongst others. 
Study characteristics 
This review of studies was carried out through Cochrane Oral Health, and the evidence is current up to 31 December 2015. 
We found 23 studies (assessing 1121 people; 83% were women), published between 1995 and 2015 to include in this review. Twenty‐one studies assessed short‐term (up to three months) symptom relief, and four studies assessed long‐term (from three to six months) symptom relief. Seventeen studies provided information about side effect occurrence, seven studies assessed a measure of QoL, and two studies assessed changes in taste and feeling of dryness. 
All of the 23 treatments included in this review were compared to a placebo (fake treatment): antidepressants and antipsychotics (two studies), antiseizure drugs (one study), types of tranquillisers (four studies), saliva stimulants (one study), dietary supplements (12 studies), directed energy waves (one study), physical barriers (one study), psychological therapies (one study), and treatments applied to the mouth surface (five studies). 
Key results 
Short‐term symptom relief  
We found evidence of short‐term symptom relief for directed energy waves (one study, 58 participants), a type of tranquilliser used topically (that is held in the mouth before being removed, and which also acts as an antiseizure drug) called clonazepam (two studies, 111 participants), thin plastic tongue covers (one study, 50 participants), and an antiseizure drug called gabapentin (one study, 100 participants). 
There was no difference in short‐term symptom relief found for antidepressants, saliva stimulants, and another type of tranquilliser used systemically (one that is swallowed) also called clonazepam. We were unable to show whether dietary supplements or treatments applied to the mouth surface provide symptom relief in the short term or not. 
Short‐term relief was not reported for the single study that assessed a psychological therapy. 
Long‐term symptom relief  
We found evidence of long‐term symptom relief for psychological therapy (one study, 30 participants), chili pepper mouthrinse (one study, 18 participants) and the topical tranquilliser called clonazepam (one study, 66 participants). 
We found there was no difference in long‐term symptom relief for dietary supplements or treatments applied to the mouth surface. 
Studies which assessed antidepressants, directed energy waves, saliva stimulants, antiseizure drugs, or physical barriers did not evaluate long‐term symptom relief. 
Change in QoL  
There was evidence of short‐term improvement in QoL for directed energy waves (one study, 58 patients), although no difference was found for antidepressants, tranquillisers, dietary supplements and physical barriers. No study assessed long‐term QoL changes. 
Change in taste or feeling of dryness  
A few studies assessed short‐term change in taste or feeling of dryness (none evaluated these outcomes long‐term), but there was not enough evidence to judge the effects of treatment on these outcomes. 
Side effects  
Side effects were more likely to be experienced with antidepressants (dizziness and drowsiness more likely: one study, 37 people), and with a dietary supplement called alpha lipoic acid (also known as ALA) with or without other ingredients (headaches more likely: two studies, 118 people; and upset stomachs more likely: three studies, 138 people). 
Quality of the evidence  Overall, we found very low‐quality evidence for each short‐ and long‐term outcome we investigated (symptom relief; changes in QoL, taste and feeling of dryness; and side effects) in all types of assessed treatment: antidepressants and antipsychotics, antiseizure drugs, types of tranquillisers, saliva stimulants, dietary supplements, directed energy waves, physical barriers (except side effects, which was assessed as low quality), psychological therapies, and treatments applied to the mouth surface. As we found so few studies at low risk of bias, we are currently unable to prove or disprove the effectiveness of any treatments for managing BMS. 
","## Plain Title: Help for Burning Mouth Pain

## Rationale

Do you feel a burning or dry feeling in your mouth? Does your mouth feel strange, or does food taste different? This might be from a problem called Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS). It causes pain in your mouth. There is no clear reason for this pain from teeth or other health issues.

BMS often lasts a long time. It can make life harder for people. We think BMS happens because of small nerve damage in the mouth. Many things are used to treat BMS. These include pills for stress, other mood problems, and drugs to help make more spit. Some people use mouth rinses or things they put on their mouth.

We need to know what treatments truly help. This study looked at many treatments. It helped us learn what might make the pain better.

## Trial Design

How did we learn about BMS treatments?

We looked at many past studies. We searched for studies up to the end of 2015. We found 23 studies to include. These studies looked at 1121 people in total. Most of these people (83 out of 100) were women.

The studies were done from 1995 to 2015. Most studies (21 out of 23) looked at how people felt for a short time. This was up to three months. A few studies (four out of 23) looked at how people felt for a longer time. This was from three to six months.

The studies also looked at other things. Seventeen studies reported if people had bad reactions to the treatment. Seven studies looked at how the treatment changed people's lives. Two studies checked changes in taste or dry mouth.

All 23 treatments were compared to a ""fake"" treatment. This fake treatment had no medicine in it. The types of treatments we looked at were:
* Pills for sad feelings or mood (2 studies)
* Pills for seizures (1 study)
* Pills for stress (4 studies)
* Drugs to make more spit (1 study)
* Vitamins or other health boosts (12 studies)
* Special energy waves (1 study)
* Thin covers for the tongue (1 study)
* Talking therapy (1 study)
* Things put on the mouth (5 studies)

## Results

What did we find out from the studies?

**For short-term relief (up to 3 months):**

Some treatments helped ease the pain for a short time. These included:
* Special energy waves (1 study, 58 people).
* A stress drug called clonazepam. People held this in their mouth and then took it out (2 studies, 111 people). This drug also helps with seizures.
* Thin plastic covers for the tongue (1 study, 50 people).
* A seizure drug called gabapentin (1 study, 100 people).

Other treatments did not show a difference in short-term pain relief. These were pills for sad feelings, drugs to make more spit, and a stress drug called clonazepam that people swallowed. We could not tell if vitamins or things put on the mouth helped for a short time. Talking therapy also did not show short-term relief in the one study that looked at it.

**For long-term relief (3 to 6 months):**

Some treatments helped ease the pain for a longer time. These included:
* Talking therapy (1 study, 30 people).
* A chili pepper mouth rinse (1 study, 18 people).
* The stress drug clonazepam that people held in their mouth (1 study, 66 people).

Vitamins or things put on the mouth did not show a difference for long-term pain relief. Other treatments like pills for sad feelings, energy waves, spit makers, seizure drugs, or tongue covers were not checked for long-term relief.

**Changes in how people felt about their life:**

Special energy waves showed a short-term improvement in how people felt about their life (1 study, 58 people). Other treatments like pills for sad feelings, stress drugs, vitamins, or tongue covers did not show a difference. No studies looked at long-term changes in how people felt about their life.

**Changes in taste or dry mouth:**

A few studies looked at changes in taste or dry mouth for a short time. But there was not enough proof to say if any treatment helped with these issues.

**Bad reactions to treatment:**

Some treatments caused more bad reactions.
* Pills for sad feelings caused more dizziness and sleepiness (1 study, 37 people).
* A vitamin called alpha lipoic acid (ALA) caused more headaches (2 studies, 118 people) and upset stomachs (3 studies, 138 people).

**What does this all mean?**

Overall, we found that the proof for these treatments was not strong. This was true for both short and long-term relief. It was also true for how people felt, taste, dry mouth, and bad reactions. We did not find many studies with good designs. So, right now, we cannot say for sure if any of these treatments really work for BMS. More research is needed to find good ways to help people with this pain.","Interventions for treating burning mouth syndrome

10.1002-14651858.CD013069.pub2,"Cognitive training for people with mild to moderate dementia
Background 
Dementia due to Alzheimer’s and other diseases is a leading cause of disability and an enormous health and societal problem. More than 40 million people in the world currently live with dementia, and this number is expected to increase to more than 115 million by the year 2050. Effective treatments to reduce the burden of dementia are urgently needed. Cognitive training (CT) is a non‐pharmacological form of treatment that focuses on guided practice on tasks that target specific cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, or problem‐solving. Whether CT can help people with mild to moderate dementia maintain or improve their thinking, well‐being, and general functioning remains unclear. 
Main findings 
We analysed data from 33 studies of CT that included a total of approximately 2000 participants and were conducted in 12 countries. We found that, compared with receiving usual treatment or engaging in non‐specific activities, people completing CT may show some benefits in overall cognition, as well as in more specific cognitive abilities such as verbal fluency, and that improvements may last for at least a few months. We did not find any evidence that participating in CT was associated with increased burden for participants. However, we also found no evidence that CT was better than participating in other active treatments. 
Limitations of this review 
The quality of the studies we reviewed varied but overall was not very high, so our certainty in some of these findings is low. Future studies should continue improving on quality, should continue comparing CT with other treatments, and should follow participants for a longer period to understand whether observed benefits for cognition last beyond the short or medium term.

## Plain Title
Brain Exercises for People with Memory Loss

## Rationale
Memory loss and other thinking problems can make life hard. This is called dementia. Many people have dementia. This number will grow in the future. We need good ways to help people with dementia.

Brain exercises can help people think better. These exercises focus on things like memory and thinking clearly. We want to know if these brain exercises help people with mild to moderate dementia. We also want to know if these exercises help them live better.

## Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies. We gathered information from 33 past studies. These studies included about 2,000 people. They were done in 12 different countries.

These studies looked at people with mild to moderate dementia. They wanted to see how brain exercises helped them. The studies often compared brain exercises to normal care. They also compared them to other fun activities. We looked at how long any good effects lasted.

## Results
We found some good news. People who did brain exercises seemed to think a bit better. They also spoke words more easily. These improvements lasted for a few months.

Taking part in brain exercises did not seem to make things worse. It did not add extra stress. However, we did not find that brain exercises were better than other helpful activities.

The studies we looked at were not always the best quality. So, we are not fully sure about all our findings. More good studies are needed. They should compare brain exercises to other treatments. They should also follow people for a longer time. This will help us know if the good effects last.","Cognitive training for people with mild to moderate dementia
Background 
Dementia due to Alzheimer’s and other diseases is a leading cause of disability and an enormous health and societal problem. More than 40 million people in the world currently live with dementia, and this number is expected to increase to more than 115 million by the year 2050. Effective treatments to reduce the burden of dementia are urgently needed. Cognitive training (CT) is a non‐pharmacological form of treatment that focuses on guided practice on tasks that target specific cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, or problem‐solving. Whether CT can help people with mild to moderate dementia maintain or improve their thinking, well‐being, and general functioning remains unclear. 
Main findings 
We analysed data from 33 studies of CT that included a total of approximately 2000 participants and were conducted in 12 countries. We found that, compared with receiving usual treatment or engaging in non‐specific activities, people completing CT may show some benefits in overall cognition, as well as in more specific cognitive abilities such as verbal fluency, and that improvements may last for at least a few months. We did not find any evidence that participating in CT was associated with increased burden for participants. However, we also found no evidence that CT was better than participating in other active treatments. 
Limitations of this review 
The quality of the studies we reviewed varied but overall was not very high, so our certainty in some of these findings is low. Future studies should continue improving on quality, should continue comparing CT with other treatments, and should follow participants for a longer period to understand whether observed benefits for cognition last beyond the short or medium term.

10.1002-14651858.CD011723.pub2,"Mindfulness‐based interventions for substance use disorders
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to determine whether mindfulness‐based interventions (MBIs) i.e. interventions involving training in mindfulness meditation improve symptoms of substance use disorders (SUDs) (i.e. alcohol and/or drug use, but excluding tobacco use disorders). Cochrane researchers searched, selected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question. We found 40 randomized controlled trials,that assessed MBI as a treatment for SUDs. 
Key messages 
SUD outcomes were monitored at different time points: directly following completion of the MBIs, and at follow‐up time points, which ranged from 3 months to 10 months after the MBI ended. Relative to other interventions (standard of care, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoeducation, support group, physical exercise, medication), MBIs may slightly reduce days with substance use, but it is very uncertain whether they reduce other SUD‐related outcomes. The effects of MBIs relative to no treatment was very uncertain across all SUD‐assessed outcomes, as was the risk for adverse events. 
What was studied in this review? 
SUDs are very common and associated with negative physical and psychological health outcomes. Although evidence‐based interventions exist for treating SUDs, the standard treatments may not be sufficient and many individuals relapse to substance use. In the past several decades, MBIs have been examined for the treatment of SUDs. MBIs involve training in mindfulness meditation practice, which emphasizes the cultivation of present‐moment, non‐judgmental awareness. MBIs may improve many of the psychological variables involved in substance use and relapse (i.e. depression, anxiety, stress, attention). We studied whether MBIs benefit individuals with SUDs. 
We searched for studies that compared an MBI to no treatment or to another treatment (e.g. cognitive behavior therapy, psychoeducation). We studied the results at the end of the intervention and at follow‐up assessments, which occurred 3 to 10 months following the end of the intervention. 
What are the main results of this review? 
The review authors found 40 relevant studies, of which 45% were focused on individuals with various SUDs with the remaining studies including participants using a specific substance (e.g. alcohol, opioids). Of these 40 studies, 23 were conducted in the USA, 11 were conducted in Iran, two were conducted in Thailand, one was conducted in Brazil, one was conducted in China, one was conducted in Taiwan, and one was conducted in both Spain and the USA. We were able to analyze results of 35 studies composed of 2825 participants; the other five did not report usable results, and requests to the authors for more information were unsuccessful. 
When MBIs were compared with other treatments, our review and analysis showed that MBIs may slightly reduce days with substance use at post‐treatment and follow‐up, and show similar study retention. The evidence is uncertain for other SUD‐related outcomes we assessed (continuous abstinence, consumed amount, craving intensity). When MBIs were compared with no treatment, the evidence was uncertain for all SUD‐related outcomes, although MBIs showed similar treatment retention. Adverse effects were only reported on in four studies. However, the available evidence did not suggest MBIs result in adverse events or serious adverse events. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies published up to April 2021.
Study funding sources 
Sixteen studies reported no funding. The remaining studies reported one or more sources of funding and support. Nineteen acknowledged federal sources, seven acknowledged internal grants, four acknowledged non‐profit entities, and two acknowledged clinics. 
","## A New Way to Help With Drug and Alcohol Problems

### Rationale

Drug and alcohol problems, called ""substance use disorders"" (SUDs), are very common. They can cause big health problems. People can have trouble with their body and their mind. Even with good care, many people go back to using drugs or alcohol. We need more ways to help them.

Mindfulness is a kind of mind training. It teaches you to pay attention to the here and now. You learn to notice things without judging them. This might help with feelings like sadness or worry. These feelings can make people want to use drugs or alcohol again.

We want to know if mindfulness training can help people with SUDs. It could be a new way to treat this problem.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. It searched for studies that compared mindfulness training to other treatments. It also looked at studies that compared mindfulness training to no treatment at all.

The studies included people with different types of drug and alcohol problems. These problems did not include smoking. The studies looked at results right after the training. They also checked on people 3 to 10 months later.

This study wanted to see how well mindfulness worked. It also checked for any bad effects.

### Results

We found 40 studies that fit our needs. Most of these studies were done in the USA and Iran. The studies included 2825 people in total.

When compared to other treatments, mindfulness training might slightly reduce the number of days people use drugs or alcohol. This was true right after training and months later. People in mindfulness groups also stayed in treatment as long as those in other groups.

For other things like stopping completely, or how much was used, or how strong cravings were, we are not sure. We need more studies to know for sure.

When compared to no treatment, we are not sure about any of the results. But people in mindfulness groups stayed in treatment as long as those who got no treatment.

Only a few studies talked about bad effects. The results do not show that mindfulness training causes bad or serious bad effects.

This study shows that mindfulness might be a little helpful for people with SUDs. But we need more clear facts to be sure.","Mindfulness‐based interventions for substance use disorders

10.1002-14651858.CD013874.pub2,"Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological cause of disability in young adults. Off‐label rituximab for MS is used in most countries surveyed by the International Federation of MS, including high‐income countries where on‐label disease‐modifying treatments (DMTs) are available.  
Objectives
To assess beneficial and adverse effects of rituximab as 'first choice' and as 'switching' for adults with MS. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and trial registers for completed and ongoing studies on 31 January 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) comparing rituximab with placebo or another DMT for adults with MS. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We used the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias. We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE for: disability worsening, relapse, serious adverse events (SAEs), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), common infections, cancer, and mortality. We conducted separate analyses for rituximab as 'first choice' or as 'switching', relapsing or progressive MS, comparison versus placebo or another DMT, and RCTs or NRSIs. 
Main results
We included 15 studies (5 RCTs, 10 NRSIs) with 16,429 participants of whom 13,143 were relapsing MS and 3286 progressive MS. The studies were one to two years long and compared rituximab as 'first choice' with placebo (1 RCT) or other DMTs (1 NRSI), rituximab as 'switching' against placebo (2 RCTs) or other DMTs (2 RCTs, 9 NRSIs). The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high‐income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two studies. We identified 14 ongoing studies. 
Rituximab as 'first choice' for relapsing MS 
Rituximab versus placebo: no studies met eligibility criteria for this comparison.
Rituximab versus other DMTs: one NRSI compared rituximab with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, or fingolimod in active relapsing MS at 24 months' follow‐up. Rituximab likely results in a large reduction in relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (hazard ratio (HR) 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.39; 335 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may reduce relapses compared with dimethyl fumarate (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.00; 206 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and natalizumab (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.00; 170 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It may make little or no difference on relapse compared with fingolimod (HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.69; 137 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported no deaths over 24 months. The study did not measure disability worsening, SAEs, HRQoL, and common infections. 
Rituximab as 'first choice' for progressive MS 
One RCT compared rituximab with placebo in primary progressive MS at 24 months' follow‐up. Rituximab likely results in little to no difference in the number of participants who have disability worsening compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.11; 439 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may result in little to no difference in recurrence of relapses (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.99; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), SAEs (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.20; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), common infections (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.73; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), cancer (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.59; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and mortality (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.77; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure HRQoL. 
Rituximab versus other DMTs: no studies met eligibility criteria for this comparison.
Rituximab as 'switching' for relapsing MS  
One RCT compared rituximab with placebo in relapsing MS at 12 months' follow‐up. Rituximab may decrease recurrence of relapses compared with placebo (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.93; 104 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to placebo on SAEs (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.92; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), common infections (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.24; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), cancer (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 39.15; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and mortality (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 39.15; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure disability worsening and HRQoL.  
Five NRSIs compared rituximab with other DMTs in relapsing MS at 24 months' follow‐up. The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to interferon beta or glatiramer acetate on disability worsening (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.42; 1 NRSI, 853 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Rituximab likely results in a large reduction in relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; 1 NRSI, 1383 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and fingolimod (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32; 1 NRSI, 256 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to natalizumab on relapses (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.2 to 5.0; 1 NRSI, 153 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Rituximab likely increases slightly common infections compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.62; 1 NRSI, 5477 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and compared with natalizumab (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.32; 2 NRSIs, 5001 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may increase slightly common infections compared with fingolimod (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.77; 3 NRSIs, 5187 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It may make little or no difference compared with ocrelizumab (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.40; 1 NRSI, 472 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab on mortality compared with fingolimod (OR 5.59, 95% CI 0.22 to 139.89; 1 NRSI, 136 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and natalizumab (OR 6.66, 95% CI 0.27 to 166.58; 1 NRSI, 153 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The included studies did not measure SAEs, HRQoL, and cancer. 
Authors' conclusions
For preventing relapses in relapsing MS, rituximab as 'first choice' and as 'switching' may compare favourably with a wide range of approved DMTs. A protective effect of rituximab against disability worsening is uncertain. There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for progressive MS.  
The evidence is uncertain about the effect of rituximab on SAEs. They are relatively rare in people with MS, thus difficult to study, and they were not well reported in studies. There is an increased risk of common infections with rituximab, but absolute risk is small.  
Rituximab is widely used as off‐label treatment in people with MS; however, randomised evidence is weak. In the absence of randomised evidence, remaining uncertainties on beneficial and adverse effects of rituximab for MS might be clarified by making real‐world data available. 
","Here's a Plain Language Summary of the abstract:

**Plain Title: A Look at Rituximab for Multiple Sclerosis**

**Rationale**
Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a brain and nerve disease. It is the top cause of physical challenges for young adults. People with MS have trouble moving. They may also have problems with thinking. MS can make daily life very hard.

Many countries use a drug called rituximab for MS. They use it even when other drugs are approved for MS. This study looked at how well rituximab works. It also looked at any bad effects. We wanted to know if rituximab helps people with MS. We also wanted to know if it is a safe choice.

**Trial Design**
We wanted to find out how rituximab works for adults with MS. We looked for studies that compared rituximab to a fake drug (placebo). We also looked for studies that compared it to other MS drugs. We searched many medical databases. We looked for studies that were finished or still going on.

We included studies where patients were given rituximab first. This means it was their first MS drug. We also looked at studies where patients switched to rituximab. This means they were on another MS drug first. We looked at people with both types of MS. These are relapsing MS and progressive MS. The studies lasted one to two years.

We looked at 15 studies in total. They included 16,429 patients. Most of these patients had relapsing MS. These studies came from all over the world. Most were from rich countries. Two studies got money from drug companies. We also found 14 studies that are still going on.

**Results**
We found that rituximab may help prevent MS attacks. This was true for people with relapsing MS. It worked whether it was their first drug or they switched to it. Compared to some other drugs, rituximab greatly cut down on relapses. It might also reduce relapses more than some other drugs. It seemed to work as well as another drug.

For progressive MS, rituximab did not seem to change things much. It did not seem to stop MS from getting worse. It also did not change the number of MS attacks. There was no big change in bad effects, infections, or cancer. It also did not change the risk of death.

Rituximab may cause a few more common infections. But the overall risk of these infections is small. We need more study to be sure about serious bad effects. These events are rare in people with MS.

In short, rituximab looks promising for stopping relapses in relapsing MS. But we are not sure if it helps stop MS from getting worse. We also need more facts about rituximab for progressive MS. Rituximab is used a lot for MS. But we need more strong studies. We need more clear facts about how well it works and if it is safe.","Rituximab for people with multiple sclerosis
Key messages 
– Rituximab may offer moderate‐to‐large benefit against a range of other medicines in preventing relapses in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Compared with no medicines, the desirable effects would be greater. 
– There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for preventing disability worsening in all forms of MS.  
– Serious harmful effects are relatively rare in people with MS making them difficult to study, and they were also not well reported in studies. 
What is the issue? 
Rituximab is a medicine administered by intravenous (by a vein) infusion that can suppress certain immune cells. The immune system fights infections and consists of many immune cells; it is affected in MS. 
Rituximab is currently used in many low‐ to middle‐income countries that have major barriers for accessing approved medicines for MS. However, rituximab is not always reimbursed by health systems because it is not licensed for MS by marketing authorities.  
Rituximab is considered a feasible treatment option as it is considered a highly effective treatment (similar to other approved medicines used to treat MS) but has considerably lower cost and less frequent dosing. Treatment with rituximab requires specialist care and infusion facilities, but other approved medicines do too. 
What did we want to find out? 
We aimed to investigate the beneficial and unwanted effects of rituximab for people with MS, when is used as a 'first choice' or as 'switching' (in other words, used when other medicines do not work well or become contraindicated). 
We wanted to find out if rituximab was better than other medicines to prevent disability worsening and recurrence of relapse, and to improve well‐being. 
We also wanted to find out if rituximab was associated with any unwanted or harmful effects, for example, serious harmful effects, common infections, cancer, and mortality (death). 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that investigated rituximab compared with all other approved medicines for MS. We searched the literature up to January 2021. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and quality. 
What did we find?  
We found 15 studies that involved about 16,000 people with MS and lasted one or two years. The biggest study was of 6421 people and the smallest study was of 27 people. The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high‐income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two included studies. 
Main results 
Rituximab as a first choice treatment in relapsing MS: 
– likely results in a large reduction in the number of people who have relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study in 335 people); 
– may reduce the number of people who have relapses compared with dimethyl fumarate and natalizumab, but the evidence is uncertain (evidence from one study). 
There was no usable information on disability worsening, well‐being, and serious harmful effects. 
Rituximab as a first choice treatment in progressive MS: 
– likely results in little to no difference in the number of participants who have disability worsening over 24 months compared with pretend treatment (evidence from one study of 439 people); 
– the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of rituximab on well‐being and serious harmful effects. 
Rituximab as 'switching' for relapsing MS: 
– likely results in a large reduction in the number of people who have relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study of 1383 people), and fingolimod (evidence from one study of 256 people). The evidence is very uncertain on the comparison of rituximab with natalizumab; 
– the evidence is very uncertain on disability worsening;
– likely increases slightly the number of people who have common infections compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study of 5477 people), and natalizumab (evidence from two studies of 5001 people). The evidence is uncertain for the comparisons of rituximab with fingolimod and ocrelizumab. 
There was no usable information on well‐being and serious harmful effects.
Rituximab as 'switching' for progressive MS 
Only three small studies investigated rituximab in secondary progressive MS. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of rituximab on disability worsening, well‐being, and serious harmful effects. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
– Limited confidence about the effect of rituximab on disability worsening in all forms of MS. 
– Limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for progressive forms of MS. 
– Studies were short with a median duration of 24 months.
How up to date is the evidence? 
This review is up to day to 31 January 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD015077,"Background
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents the most severe course of COVID‐19 (caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus), usually resulting in a prolonged stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) and high mortality rates. Despite the fact that most affected individuals need invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), evidence on specific ventilation strategies for ARDS caused by COVID‐19 is scarce. Spontaneous breathing during IMV is part of a therapeutic concept comprising light levels of sedation and the avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA). This approach is potentially associated with both advantages (e.g. a preserved diaphragmatic motility and an optimised ventilation‐perfusion ratio of the ventilated lung), as well as risks (e.g. a higher rate of ventilator‐induced lung injury or a worsening of pulmonary oedema due to increases in transpulmonary pressure). As a consequence, spontaneous breathing in people with COVID‐19‐ARDS who are receiving IMV is subject to an ongoing debate amongst intensivists. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of early spontaneous breathing activity in invasively ventilated people with COVID‐19 with ARDS compared to ventilation strategies that avoid spontaneous breathing. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (which includes CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials.gov WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv) and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies from their inception to 2 March 2022.  
Selection criteria
Eligible study designs comprised randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated spontaneous breathing in participants with COVID‐19‐related ARDS compared to ventilation strategies that avoided spontaneous breathing (e.g. using NMBA or deep sedation levels). Additionally, we considered controlled before‐after studies, interrupted time series with comparison group, prospective cohort studies and retrospective cohort studies. For these non‐RCT studies, we considered a minimum total number of 50 participants to be compared as necessary for inclusion. Prioritised outcomes were all‐cause mortality, clinical improvement or worsening, quality of life, rate of (serious) adverse events and rate of pneumothorax. Additional outcomes were need for tracheostomy, duration of ICU length of stay and duration of hospitalisation.  
Data collection and analysis
We followed the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 
Two review authors independently screened all studies at the title/abstract and full‐text screening stage. We also planned to conduct data extraction and risk of bias assessment in duplicate. We planned to conduct meta‐analysis for each prioritised outcome, as well as subgroup analyses of mortality regarding severity of oxygenation impairment and duration of ARDS. In addition, we planned to perform sensitivity analyses for studies at high risk of bias, studies using NMBA in addition to deep sedation level to avoid spontaneous breathing and a comparison of preprints versus peer‐reviewed articles. We planned to assess the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.  
Main results
We identified no eligible studies for this review.
Authors' conclusions
We found no direct evidence on whether early spontaneous breathing in SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS is beneficial or detrimental to this particular group of patients.  RCTs comparing early spontaneous breathing with ventilatory strategies not allowing for spontaneous breathing in SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS are necessary to determine its value within the treatment of severely ill people with COVID‐19. Additionally, studies should aim to clarify whether treatment effects differ between people with SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS and people with non‐SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS. 
","## Easy Breathing for COVID-19 Patients on Machines

### Rationale

The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes COVID-19. Some people get very sick with COVID-19. Their lungs stop working well. This severe lung problem is called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

People with ARDS often need help breathing. A machine called a ventilator helps them. This means they stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) for a long time. Many also die.

Doctors sometimes let patients try to breathe on their own. Even while still on the breathing machine. This is called ""spontaneous breathing."" It means the patient's own lungs try to work. This might help keep their breathing muscles strong. It might also help air flow better in their lungs.

But there are also risks. It could hurt the lungs more. It could make the lungs swell more. Doctors are not sure if spontaneous breathing is good or bad. Especially for COVID-19 patients with ARDS. This study wanted to find out more. We wanted to see if it helps or harms these patients.

### Trial Design

This study asked a big question. ""How do doctors help very sick COVID-19 patients breathe?""

We looked for other studies. These studies needed to compare two ways of helping patients breathe. One way allowed early spontaneous breathing. The other way stopped it. They might use strong medicine to make patients sleep deeper. Or give medicine to relax their muscles.

We looked for studies that had good designs. We wanted to find trials where patients were chosen by chance. These are called ""randomized controlled trials."" We also looked at other types of studies. They needed to have at least 50 patients.

We looked at how patients fared. We looked at whether they lived or died. We looked at if they got better or worse. We also checked their quality of life. We wanted to see if there were bad side effects. Like a collapsed lung. We also checked how long they stayed in the ICU. And how long they stayed in the hospital.

We searched many health databases. We looked for studies up until March 2, 2022. Our goal was to find clear answers.

### Results

We looked for many studies. We searched deeply. But we found no studies that met our needs. We could not find any studies. There was no direct proof. We could not say if early spontaneous breathing helps. We also could not say if it hurts. This is for COVID-19 patients with ARDS.

More research is needed. Doctors need to do new studies. These studies should compare both ways of breathing. They should choose patients by chance. This will help us learn the best way to treat these very sick patients. We also need to know if COVID-19 ARDS is different. Is it different from other types of ARDS? More studies can help answer this too.","Spontaneous breathing activity in COVID‐19‐related lung failure
Is early spontaneous breathing beneficial in the treatment of lung failure in individuals with COVID‐19? 
People with severe COVID‐19 can present with lung failure, which is called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This requires invasive mechanical ventilation through a breathing tube. It is possible to allow breathing, triggered by the patient (called spontaneous breathing), whilst being on a ventilator. However, it is unclear whether this is beneficial for such individuals, especially in the early phase of ventilation. 
Key messages 
We found no evidence if spontaneous breathing is beneficial in the treatment of lung failure due to COVID‐19. 
What are the advantages of early spontaneous breathing in ARDS?  
The advantage of spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation is the preserved movement of the diaphragm (the major muscle for breathing located under the lungs). It leads to better distribution of the inhaled air, especially in the pulmonary alveoli (small air sacs within the lungs) close to the diaphragm. In general, ventilation procedures with possible spontaneous breathing require lower doses of sedatives (which slow down brain activity). Since these can cause low blood pressure, it can additionally reduce the administration of cardiovascular medicines. 
Can early spontaneous breathing be harmful in the treatment of ARDS? 
During spontaneous breathing under mechanical ventilation, increased pressure fluctuations in the lungs may occur. Increased pressure difference within the lung is the main cause of ventilator‐associated lung injury. 
What is the alternative to using early spontaneous breathing? 
Spontaneous breathing may be suppressed by increased sedation or blockade of the nerves innervating muscles by medicines that allow for breathing (called neuromuscular blockade). The advantage of complete ventilator‐based breathing is a lower oxygen consumption of the muscles and the reduced risk of self‐inflicted lung injury. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of early spontaneous breathing activity in ventilated people with COVID‐19 with ARDS compared to ventilation strategies that avoid spontaneous breathing. 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that compared early spontaneous breathing during invasive mechanical ventilation with mandatory invasive ventilation and neuromuscular blockade in people with ARDS related to COVID‐19. People could have been any age, sex or ethnicity.  
What did we find?  
After systematic search, we found no records that met the inclusion criteria.
Main results 
We identified no eligible studies for this review.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
To date, there are no studies that have compared early spontaneous breathing during invasive mechanical ventilation to mandatory invasive ventilation without spontaneous breathing in people with ARDS related to COVID‐19.  
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
Our evidence is up‐to‐date to 2 March 2022.

Fetal malposition (occipito‐posterior and persistent occipito‐transverse) in labour is associated with adverse maternal and infant outcomes. Whether use of maternal postures can improve these outcomes is unclear. This Cochrane Review of maternal posture in labour is one of two new reviews replacing a 2007 review of maternal postures in pregnancy and labour. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of specified maternal postures for women with fetal malposition in labour on maternal and infant morbidity compared to other postures.  
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (13 July 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster‐RCTs conducted among labouring women with a fetal malposition confirmed by ultrasound or clinical examination, comparing a specified maternal posture with another posture. Quasi‐RCTs and cross‐over trials were not eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, risk of bias, and performed data extraction. We used mean difference (MD) for continuous variables, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included eight eligible studies with 1766 women. 
All studies reported some form of random sequence generation but were at high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding. There was a high risk of selection bias in one study, detection bias in two studies, attrition bias in two studies, and reporting bias in two studies. 
Hands and knees 
The use of hands and knees posture may have little to no effect on operative birth (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.50; 3 trials, 721 women; low‐certainty evidence) and caesarean section (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.87; 3 trials, 721 women; low‐certainty evidence) but the evidence is uncertain; and very uncertain for epidural use (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.31; 2 trials, 282 women; very low‐certainty evidence), instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.90; 3 trials, 721 women; very low‐certainty evidence), severe perineal tears (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.03 to 22.30; 2 trials, 586 women; very low‐certainty evidence), maternal satisfaction (average RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.54; 3 trials, 350 women; very low‐certainty evidence), and Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.34; 2 trials, 586 babies; very low‐certainty evidence).  
No data were reported for the hands and knees comparisons for postpartum haemorrhage, serious neonatal morbidity, death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant), admission to neonatal intensive care, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy.  
Lateral postures 
The use of lateral postures may have little to no effect on reducing operative birth (average RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.19; 4 trials, 871 women; low‐certainty evidence), caesarean section (average RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.39; 4 trials, 871 women; low‐certainty evidence), instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.36; 4 trials, 871 women; low‐certainty evidence), and maternal satisfaction (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; 2 trials, 451 women; low‐certainty evidence), but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of lateral postures on severe perineal tears (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.48; 3 trials, 609 women; very low‐certainty evidence), postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.70; 1 trial, 322 women; very low‐certainty evidence), serious neonatal morbidity (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.12; 3 trials, 752 babies; very low‐certainty evidence), Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.24; 1 trial, 322 babies; very low‐certainty evidence), admissions to neonatal intensive care (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.12; 2 trials, 542 babies; very low‐certainty evidence) and neonatal death (stillbirth or death of liveborn) (1 trial, 210 women and their babies; no events).  
For the lateral posture comparisons, no data were reported for epidural use, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy. We were not able to estimate the outcome death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant) due to no events (1 trial, 210 participants).  
Authors' conclusions
We found low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence which indicated that the use of hands and knees posture or lateral postures in women in labour with a fetal malposition may have little or no effect on health outcomes of the mother or her infant. If a woman finds the use of hands and knees or lateral postures in labour comfortable there is no reason why they should not choose to use them. Further research is needed on the use of hands and knees and lateral postures for women with a malposition in labour. Trials should include further assessment of semi‐prone postures, same‐side‐as‐fetus lateral postures with or without hip hyperflexion, or both, and consider interventions of longer duration or that involve the early second stage of labour. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study:

### Plain Title
How a Mother's Position During Labor Affects Birth

### Rationale

When a baby is not in the best position for birth, it can cause problems. This is called fetal malposition. These problems can be hard for both the mother and the baby. It can lead to a longer labor. It can also cause more pain for the mother. Sometimes, it can even lead to special procedures during birth.

We want to know if changing the mother's body position during labor can help. It might make birth easier and safer. Doctors and nurses often suggest certain positions. But we are not sure if these positions truly help. This study looks at what we know about how different positions affect birth. We want to see if they can make things better for moms and babies.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many past studies. We wanted to see how different body positions affect birth. We focused on women who were in labor. These women had a baby who was not in the best position for birth. Doctors checked the baby's position with a scan or by hand.

The studies compared one body position to another. For example, some studies looked at a ""hands and knees"" position. Others looked at lying on the side, called ""lateral postures."" We included studies where women were put into groups by chance. This helps to make the results fair. We did not include studies where the groups were not chosen by chance.

We gathered results from eight studies. These studies included 1766 women. The study looked at how different positions affected many things. These included how often women needed special procedures. It also looked at how happy mothers were. We also checked the baby's health.

### Results

We found eight studies that fit our needs. They included 1766 women in labor.

When women were on their hands and knees, it did not seem to change much. It did not clearly make birth better or worse. This position did not seem to lower the chance of surgery or special tools for birth. It also did not clearly change how much pain medicine women needed. We need more clear proof to be sure. It did not seem to affect how happy mothers were. It also did not seem to affect the baby's health after birth.

When women lay on their side, it also did not clearly change much. This position did not clearly lower the chance of surgery or special tools for birth. It also did not clearly affect how happy mothers were. It did not seem to affect serious problems for the mother or baby. We need more clear proof to be sure.

Overall, our study suggests that these positions might not change birth outcomes much. This means mothers and babies may not see big changes from using these positions. But, if a position feels good to a woman in labor, she should feel free to use it. It likely does not cause harm.

More research is needed to fully understand this topic. Future studies should look at these positions more closely. They should also look at other positions. And they should track how long women use these positions. This will help us learn more about what truly helps moms and babies.","Mothers' positions in labour when baby is lying 'back‐to‐back'
What is the issue? 
Malposition is when the back of the baby's head lies towards the mother's back. As a result, labour and birth can be long and difficult, sometimes resulting in an operative birth (where the baby is delivered by caesarean section or with special tools to help the baby through the birth canal) and more perineal trauma (damage to the pelvic floor). The baby may be more likely to go to a neonatal care unit. Also, women may experience stress or disappointment with the birth experience.  
Why is this important? 
The way a pregnant woman is positioned during labour may help rotate a baby so that the back of the baby's head lies towards the front of the mother's abdomen. This improved position may help the mother and baby have a more normal labour and birth. However, it is not yet known which posture, if any, is effective and when is the best time to use it. 
A systematic review of studies of positions (postures) used by women in labour with a baby in a malposition can provide answers on whether the postures improve birth and other health outcomes for mothers and babies. The summary of this review can be used to update clinical practice guidelines. 
A Cochrane Review in 2007 reported that the use of the 'hands and knees' posture in labour was ineffective for malposition, but it did reduce labouring women's backache. Since then, more trials have been conducted, some using other postures; these need evaluating to see if those postures work. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence (published to 13 July 2021) and identified eight studies  in nine different countries involving 1766 women and their babies. Women in the included studies were either first‐time mothers or mothers who had birthed before. All the women's  pregnancies were at least at 36 weeks.  
The trials compared use of 'hands and knees' posture or 'side‐lying' (lateral) postures (lying on the same side as the baby, lying on the opposite side to the baby, and lying semi‐prone) to other postures (free posture, lying on back, leaning back, lying on the same side as the baby).  
For both the hands and knees posture and side‐lying positions during labour, there may be little or no difference in the numbers of operative births, haemorrhage (profuse bleeding of the mother), severe perineal trauma, and women's satisfaction with their labour and delivery, but there was insufficient evidence to be sure. Many of our outcomes of interest were not reported in the included studies. 
Overall, we have little to no confidence in the evidence, mainly because there were too few women and babies in the studies, and some studies used unclear methods. 
What does this mean? 
Overall, it is uncertain whether hands and knees or side‐lying positions in labour improve the health of mother and baby when a baby is in a malposition. However, if women find the use of hands and knees, side‐lying, or other postures in labour comfortable, there is no reason why they should not choose to use them. 
Further research is needed to enable optimal fetal positioning. In particular, further research is needed on variations in the postures, the impact of longer use of these postures during labour, and on long‐term outcomes for women and their babies.

Carotid artery stenosis is an important cause of stroke and transient ischemic attack. Correctly and rapidly identifying patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis is essential for adequate treatment with early cerebral revascularization. Doubts about the diagnostic value regarding the accuracy of duplex ultrasound (DUS) and the possibility of using DUS as the single diagnostic test before carotid revascularization are still debated. 
Objectives
To estimate the accuracy of DUS in individuals with symptomatic carotid stenosis verified by either digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). 
Search methods
We searched CRDTAS, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), ISI Web of Science, HTA, DARE, and LILACS up to 15 February 2021. We handsearched the reference lists of all included studies and other relevant publications and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies or unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We included studies assessing DUS accuracy against an acceptable reference standard (DSA, MRA, or CTA) in symptomatic patients. We considered the classification of carotid stenosis with DUS defined with validated duplex velocity criteria, and the NASCET criteria for carotid stenosis measures on DSA, MRA, and CTA. We excluded studies that included < 70% of symptomatic patients; the time between the index test and the reference standard was longer than four weeks or not described, or that presented no objective criteria to estimate carotid stenosis. 
Data collection and analysis
The review authors independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS‐2 domain list. We extracted data with an effort to complete a 2 × 2 table (true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives) for each of the different categories of carotid stenosis and reference standards. We produced forest plots and summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots to summarize the data. Where meta‐analysis was possible, we used a bivariate meta‐analysis model. 
Main results
We identified 25,087 unique studies, of which 22 were deemed eligible for inclusion (4957 carotid arteries). The risk of bias varied considerably across the studies, and studies were generally of moderate to low quality. We narratively described the results without meta‐analysis in seven studies in which the criteria used to determine stenosis were too different from the duplex velocity criteria proposed in our protocol or studies that provided insufficient data to complete a 2 × 2 table for at least in one category of stenosis. Nine studies (2770 carotid arteries) presented DUS versus DSA results for 70% to 99% carotid artery stenosis, and two (685 carotid arteries) presented results from DUS versus CTA in this category. Seven studies presented results for occlusion with DSA as the reference standard and three with CTA as the reference standard. Five studies compared DUS versus DSA for 50% to 99% carotid artery stenosis. Only one study presented results from 50% to 69% carotid artery stenosis. 
For DUS versus DSA, for < 50% carotid artery stenosis, the summary sensitivity was 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48 to 0.76) and the summary specificity was 0.99 (95% CI 0.96 to 0.99); for the 50% to 69% range, only one study was included and meta‐analysis not performed; for the 50% to 99% range, the summary sensitivity was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.98) and the summary specificity was 0.70 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.73); for the 70% to 99% range, the summary sensitivity was 0.85 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.91) and the summary specificity was 0.98 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.90); for occlusion, the summary sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.97) and the summary specificity was 0.95 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.99). 
For sensitivity analyses, excluding studies in which participants were selected based on the presence of occlusion on DUS had an impact on specificity: 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 0.99). For DUS versus CTA, we found two studies in the range of 70% to 99%; the sensitivity varied from 0.57 to 0.94 and the specificity varied from 0.87 to 0.98. For occlusion, the summary sensitivity was 0.95 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.99) and the summary specificity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.99). For DUS versus MRA, there was one study with results for 50% to 99% carotid artery stenosis, with a sensitivity of 0.88 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.98) and specificity of 0.60 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.95); in the 70% to 99% range, two studies were included, with sensitivity that varied from 0.54 to 0.99 and specificity that varied from 0.78 to 0.89. We could perform only a few of the proposed sensitivity analyses because of the small number of studies included. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides evidence that the diagnostic accuracy of DUS is high, especially at discriminating between the presence or absence of significant carotid artery stenosis (< 50% or 50% to 99%). This evidence, plus its less invasive nature, supports the early use of DUS for the detection of carotid artery stenosis. The accuracy for 70% to 99% carotid artery stenosis and occlusion is high. Clinicians should exercise caution when using DUS as the single preoperative diagnostic method, and the limitations should be considered. There was little evidence of the accuracy of DUS when compared with CTA or MRA. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution because they are based on studies of low methodological quality, mainly due to the patient selection method. Methodological problems in participant inclusion criteria from the studies discussed above apparently influenced an overestimated estimate of prevalence values. Most of the studies included failed to precisely describe inclusion criteria and previous testing. Future diagnostic accuracy studies should include direct comparisons of the various modalities of diagnostic tests (mainly DUS, CTA, and MRA) for carotid artery stenosis since DSA is no longer considered to be the best method for diagnosing carotid stenosis and less invasive tests are now used as reference standards in clinical practice. Also, for future studies, the participant inclusion criteria require careful attention. 
","## Simple Title: Finding Blockages in Neck Arteries with Ultrasound

## Rationale

When a main artery in the neck, called the carotid artery, gets narrow, it's called carotid artery stenosis. This narrowing can cause serious problems like a stroke or a mini-stroke. A stroke happens when blood flow to the brain is cut off. This can cause lasting brain damage.

It is very important to find this problem early. Finding it early allows doctors to treat it quickly. One way to check for this problem is using a special ultrasound test called duplex ultrasound (DUS). DUS uses sound waves to look inside your arteries.

Doctors want to know if DUS is good enough on its own. They want to know if DUS can accurately tell how narrow the artery is. This study looked at how well DUS works. We want to see if DUS can be the main test doctors use before surgery. This would help patients get treatment faster and with less risk.

## Trial Design

This study asked, ""How good is DUS at finding narrow carotid arteries?"" We looked at many past studies. These studies checked DUS against other tests. These other tests are known to be very accurate. They include digital subtraction angiography (DSA), CT angiography (CTA), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).

We only included studies that looked at patients with symptoms. These are people who had a stroke or mini-stroke. We focused on studies where the DUS test and the other tests were done close in time. The time between tests was not longer than four weeks. We also made sure the studies used clear rules to measure the narrowing.

We found and reviewed over 25,000 studies. We chose 22 studies that fit our rules. These studies involved about 5,000 carotid arteries. The quality of these studies varied. Some were better designed than others.

## Results

We found that DUS is good at telling if an artery is very narrow or not narrow at all. For very narrow arteries (50% to 99% blocked), DUS was very good at finding the problem. It found the problem in 97 out of 100 cases. For arteries that were not very narrow (less than 50% blocked), DUS was very good at saying there was no big problem. It correctly said no big problem in 99 out of 100 cases.

When the artery was blocked 70% to 99%, DUS found it in 85 out of 100 cases. For a full blockage, DUS found it in 91 out of 100 cases. This shows that DUS is very useful for finding blockages.

DUS is also a less risky test. It does not use needles or X-rays like some other tests. So, using DUS early can help patients get treated sooner. This could help prevent strokes.

However, we need to be careful. Some studies were not perfect. More studies are needed to compare DUS with CTA and MRA. These two tests are now often used. They are also less invasive than DSA. We also need better ways to choose patients for these studies. This will help us get even clearer answers in the future.","How accurate is duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging for diagnosing carotid artery stenosis in symptomatic patients? 
Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) is a narrowing of the lumen (the inside space) of the carotid artery (usually due to cholesterol deposits called plaque). CAS is responsible for 8% of all strokes due to a blocked blood vessel (ischemic strokes) and is associated with a high chance of recurrence. In such circumstances, the treatment is to re‐establish adequate blood flow (by surgery or other approaches to open the artery) to prevent further neurologic episodes. Duplex ultrasound (DUS) can help identify the appropriate patients who will benefit from a more invasive treatment and those who should be with drugs alone. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine how accurate DUS is for diagnosing different grades of CAS in individuals with neurologic symptoms. 
What was studied in the review? 
DUS is used in clinical practice as the first test to detect carotid artery stenosis, usually with the result confirmed by other more expensive and invasive tests, such as computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The advantage of DUS is that it is less expensive and helps to reduce the time required to select patients for treatment. We included studies assessing the accuracy of DUS compared with DSA, MRA, or CTA in patients with recent stroke symptoms. We grouped the results from studies that used approximately the same method and threshold to assess accuracy in the following categories of carotid artery stenosis: < 50%, 50% to 99%, 50% to 69%, 70% to 99%, and occlusion (blockage of the vessel). 
What are the main results of this review? 
This review included 22 studies (4957 carotid arteries tested). The searches were performed up to 15 February 2021. The results indicate the following: If DUS were to be used in a standardized cohort of 1000 patients: 
For DUS versus DSA  
< 50% CAS (4 studies, 1495 carotid arteries): Estimated 299 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of non‐significant CAS, of whom eight (2.7%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 701 people with a result indicating that < 50% carotid stenosis is not present, 169 (24.1%) would be incorrectly classified. 
50% to 99% CAS (5 studies, 1536 carotid arteries): Estimated 642 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of 50% to 99% CAS; of these, 147 (22.8%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 358 people with a result indicating that 50% to 99% carotid stenosis is not present, 15 (4.2%) would be incorrectly classified. 
70% to 99% CAS (9 studies, 2770 carotid arteries): Estimated 390 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of 70% to 99% CAS; of these, eight (2%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 610 people with a result indicating that 70% to 99% carotid stenosis is not present, 68 (11.1%) would be incorrectly classified. 
Occlusion (7 studies, 1212 carotid arteries): Estimated 205 patients would have a DUS result indicating carotid artery occlusion; of these, 41 (20%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 795 people with a result indicating that carotid occlusion is not present, 16 (2%) would be incorrectly classified. 
For DUS versus CTA  
Occlusion (3 studies, 833 carotid arteries): An estimated 606 patients would have a DUS result indicating carotid artery occlusion; of these, 36 (6%) would be incorrectly classified. 394 people with a result indicating that carotid occlusion is not present, 30 (8%) would be incorrectly classified. 
For DUS versus MRA  
Meta‐analysis was not performed.
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
There were some problems with how the studies were conducted that could impair the correct estimates of the diagnostic accuracy. Many of the studies were of poor or unclear quality. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
The results are relevant for patients with neurologic symptoms who are suspected of having carotid artery stenosis. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The diagnostic accuracy of DUS is high, especially at discriminating between the presence or absence of significant carotid artery stenosis. This evidence, plus its less invasive nature, supports the early use of DUS for the detection of carotid artery stenosis.

10.1002-14651858.CD011357.pub2,"Antibiotics for bacterial infection in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms 
What is the issue? Bacteria in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms of urine infection is called asymptomatic bacteriuria. Up to one in two people with a kidney transplant will develop a bacterial infection of the urine (bacteriuria) at some point after transplantation. Bacteriuria with symptoms like fever, chills, painful urination, abdominal pain and blood in urine is a urinary tract infection (UTI). Bacteriuria often occurs without symptoms and it is frequently treated with antibiotics with the idea this might help avoid subsequent UTI. Avoiding UTI might improve patient and transplant survival. However, it is unclear how many people with asymptomatic bacteriuria go on to develop UTI symptoms; whether treatment with antibiotics truly avoids UTI; or whether treatment when asymptomatic improves survival of both patient and kidney. Also, there can be downsides to taking antibiotics. Taking regular antibiotics might mean that bacteria resistant to antibiotics are encouraged, and taking antibiotics might cause diarrhoea and other adverse events. There are also antibiotic costs to consider. This review looked at whether treating with antibiotics is beneficial of harmful. 
What did we do? 
We searched the literature up to September 2017 and identified two studies (212 participants) that were evaluated in this review. These studies compared antibiotics versus no treatment. 
What did we find? The bacterial infection of the urine often persisted, whether antibiotics were given or not. It was uncertain whether antibiotics prevented symptomatic urinary infection or increased the risk of selecting bacteria resistant to antibiotics, because there were too few data and several limitations in the included studies. Also, it was unclear whether the use of antibiotics in case of urinary infection without symptoms reduced the risks of graft rejection, need for hospitalisation due to symptoms of urinary infection, or mortality, or whether antibiotics improved the function of the kidney transplant. One study with 112 participants suggested there were no severe harmful reactions caused by the antibiotic treatment, and non‐severe adverse events appeared to be rare. 
Conclusions It is uncertain whether antibiotics are beneficial in kidney transplant recipients with bacteria in their urine but no symptoms. In one study, participants were assigned to antibiotics or no therapy by a method that was not random (i.e. according to patients' transplant code). In both studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving (i.e. antibiotics or no therapy), which may have influenced the results. Last, we had not enough data to estimate with precision some effects of antibiotics. More research is needed. 
","## A Look at Antibiotics for Hidden Urine Germs in Kidney Transplant Patients

### Rationale

After a kidney transplant, many patients get germs in their urine. This can happen to half of all patients. Sometimes, these germs cause problems like fever, chills, belly pain, or blood in the urine. This is a ""urinary tract infection"" (UTI).

But often, these germs don't cause any symptoms. This is called ""asymptomatic bacteriuria."" Doctors often give antibiotics to treat these hidden germs. They hope this will stop a UTI from happening later. Avoiding a UTI could help patients and their new kidney live longer.

However, we don't know for sure if treating hidden germs with antibiotics really works. We need to find out if antibiotics truly stop UTIs. We also need to see if they help patients and their kidneys live longer.

Taking antibiotics can also have problems. They can make germs stronger and harder to kill. This is called ""antibiotic resistance."" Antibiotics can also cause upset stomach or other bad effects. Plus, antibiotics cost money. This study looked at if antibiotics help or hurt patients with hidden urine germs.

### Trial Design

This study asked: ""Do antibiotics help kidney transplant patients with hidden urine germs?""

To answer this, we looked at past medical papers. We searched for studies up to September 2017. We found two studies that fit what we were looking for. These studies included 212 patients in total.

These studies compared two groups of patients. One group got antibiotics. The other group did not get any treatment. We looked at the results from both groups.

### Results

What did we find out? The germs in the urine often stayed, whether patients took antibiotics or not.

We could not say for sure if antibiotics stopped UTIs. We also could not say if antibiotics made germs stronger. This is because there was not enough information in the studies. The studies had some limits.

It was also not clear if antibiotics helped in other ways. We could not tell if they stopped the body from rejecting the new kidney. We also could not tell if they stopped patients from going to the hospital for UTIs. We could not tell if they helped patients live longer. We also could not tell if they made the new kidney work better.

One study had 112 patients. It showed that antibiotics did not cause serious bad effects. Small problems from antibiotics seemed rare.

It is still not clear if antibiotics are good for kidney transplant patients with hidden urine germs. In one study, patients were not put into groups by chance. This could have changed the results. Also, in both studies, patients knew if they were getting antibiotics or not. This might have changed how they felt or what they reported. We also did not have enough facts to truly know how antibiotics worked. More research is needed to get clear answers.","Antibiotics for bacterial infection in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms 
What is the issue? Bacteria in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms of urine infection is called asymptomatic bacteriuria. Up to one in two people with a kidney transplant will develop a bacterial infection of the urine (bacteriuria) at some point after transplantation. Bacteriuria with symptoms like fever, chills, painful urination, abdominal pain and blood in urine is a urinary tract infection (UTI). Bacteriuria often occurs without symptoms and it is frequently treated with antibiotics with the idea this might help avoid subsequent UTI. Avoiding UTI might improve patient and transplant survival. However, it is unclear how many people with asymptomatic bacteriuria go on to develop UTI symptoms; whether treatment with antibiotics truly avoids UTI; or whether treatment when asymptomatic improves survival of both patient and kidney. Also, there can be downsides to taking antibiotics. Taking regular antibiotics might mean that bacteria resistant to antibiotics are encouraged, and taking antibiotics might cause diarrhoea and other adverse events. There are also antibiotic costs to consider. This review looked at whether treating with antibiotics is beneficial of harmful. 
What did we do? 
We searched the literature up to September 2017 and identified two studies (212 participants) that were evaluated in this review. These studies compared antibiotics versus no treatment. 
What did we find? The bacterial infection of the urine often persisted, whether antibiotics were given or not. It was uncertain whether antibiotics prevented symptomatic urinary infection or increased the risk of selecting bacteria resistant to antibiotics, because there were too few data and several limitations in the included studies. Also, it was unclear whether the use of antibiotics in case of urinary infection without symptoms reduced the risks of graft rejection, need for hospitalisation due to symptoms of urinary infection, or mortality, or whether antibiotics improved the function of the kidney transplant. One study with 112 participants suggested there were no severe harmful reactions caused by the antibiotic treatment, and non‐severe adverse events appeared to be rare. 
Conclusions It is uncertain whether antibiotics are beneficial in kidney transplant recipients with bacteria in their urine but no symptoms. In one study, participants were assigned to antibiotics or no therapy by a method that was not random (i.e. according to patients' transplant code). In both studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving (i.e. antibiotics or no therapy), which may have influenced the results. Last, we had not enough data to estimate with precision some effects of antibiotics. More research is needed.

10.1002-14651858.CD008819.pub4,"Wearing stockings to provide compression for the treatment of varicose veins
Review question 
What is the effectiveness of compression stockings as the only and initial treatment of varicose veins in people without healed or active venous ulceration (leg ulcers)? 
Background 
Varicose veins are widened veins that twist and turn and are visible under the skin of the legs. They generally do not cause medical problems, although many people seek medical advice. Symptoms may include pain, ankle swelling, tired legs, restless legs, night cramps, heaviness, itching and distress from their cosmetic appearance. Complications such as oedema (build‐up of fluid), pigmentation, inflammation (swelling, redness and pain) and ulceration (sores) can also develop. Compression stockings are often the first line of treatment and come in a variety of lengths from knee‐length to full tights, and apply different pressures to support the flow of blood in the veins. 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 studies involving 1021 participants with varicose veins who had not experienced venous ulceration in this review (search run May 2020). Five studies assessed compression stocking versus no compression stocking (for example no treatment or placebo stocking with no graduated elastic). Three of these studies used knee‐length stockings, one used full‐length stockings and one used full tights. Eight studies compared different types or pressures of knee‐length stockings. The stockings used in the studies exerted different levels of pressure. One study included only pregnant women, while other studies included people who had sought medical intervention for their varicose veins by being on surgical waiting lists, or attending vascular surgery or dermatology (skin care) clinics or outpatient departments. 
Key results 
Participants considered their symptoms had improved when stockings were worn in the nine studies that assessed this outcome, but these assessments were not always made by comparing one treatment group of the trial with a control group in the same study and was therefore subject to bias. 
Two studies comparing stockings with placebo stockings measured physical signs; there was no clear difference between baseline and follow‐up for ankle circumference, while oedema was reduced in the stocking group compared with the placebo stocking group. Generally there were no clear differences between studies comparing two types of stockings for volume reduction and change in diameter (ways to measure oedema). 
Complications or side effects ranged from sweating, itching, irritation, skin dryness and a feeling of tightness. There were no severe or long‐lasting side effects. 
Two studies comparing stockings with different stockings, and four studies comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed compliance (whether the person used the stockings as directed). In the stocking versus different stocking studies, there was no clear difference between the stockings, with generally low levels of compliance reported. In the stocking versus placebo/no treatment group, three studies reported results. Of these, one study reported a high initial dropout rate with generally low levels of compliance. The other two studies reported generally good compliance in the stocking group. Some reasons provided for non‐compliance included discomfort, difficulty in putting the stockings on, appearance, not being effective and causing irritation. 
Four studies that compared stockings with different stockings and two studies that compared stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed comfort, tolerance and acceptability of stockings. Comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment, comfort, tolerance and acceptability was affected by the study population. Compression tights were increasingly rejected by pregnant women as their pregnancy progressed, while in a study of non‐pregnant women, the stockings group showed no more hindrance of normal activities and daytime discomfort when compared with placebo stockings. In the stocking versus different stockings studies, two studies reported similar levels of tolerance and discomfort between the types of stocking. Discomfort was the main reason for indicating a preference for one type of stocking over another. 
One study assessed quality of life, showing no clear differences between the stocking and no stocking groups. 
No conclusions regarding the optimum length or pressure of compression stockings could be made as there were no conclusive results from the included studies.  
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence was low or very low because of risk of bias due to poor reporting, not all studies assessed the same outcomes, they assessed them in different ways, or reported them in a way that they could be combined and analysed with other studies. Evidence from available trials is not sufficient to determine if compression stockings as the only and initial treatment are effective in managing and treating varicose veins in the early stages. 
","## Squeeze Away Varicose Veins? A Look at Compression Stockings

**Rationale**

Varicose veins are veins in your legs that are wide and twisty. You can see them under your skin. They don't usually cause big health problems. But many people still want to talk to a doctor about them.

These veins can make your legs hurt. Your ankles might swell. Your legs can feel tired or restless. You might get cramps at night. Your legs can feel heavy or itchy. Many people don't like how they look.

Sometimes, more problems can start. Fluid can build up in your legs. Your skin can change color. Your legs can get red and swollen. Sores can even form.

Compression stockings are often the first thing doctors suggest. They come in different lengths. They can be knee-high or full tights. They put pressure on your legs. This helps blood flow better in your veins.

This study looked at how well compression stockings work. We wanted to know if they could treat varicose veins by themselves. We focused on people who did not have open leg sores.

**Trial Design**

This study asked: ""How well do compression stockings work as the first and only treatment for varicose veins?"" We looked at people who did not have open sores on their legs.

We included 13 past studies. These studies had a total of 1021 people. All these people had varicose veins. They did not have leg sores. This review included studies found up to May 2020.

Five studies compared stockings to no stockings. Some of these studies used knee-high stockings. One used full-length stockings. One used full tights.

Eight studies looked at different types of knee-high stockings. They also looked at stockings with different pressure levels.

One study only looked at pregnant women. Other studies included people waiting for surgery. Some were seeing skin doctors or heart and blood vessel doctors.

People in these studies wore the stockings for different amounts of time. The studies checked how people felt about their symptoms. They also looked at swelling and how often people wore their stockings.

**Results**

Many people felt better when they wore stockings. Nine studies showed this. But these studies did not always compare one group to another group. So, it was hard to be sure.

Two studies looked at physical signs. They compared stockings to fake stockings. Ankle size did not change much. But swelling in the ankles went down for people wearing stockings.

Most studies compared different types of stockings. They looked at how much swelling went down. They also looked at vein size. There were no clear differences between the different types of stockings.

Some people had side effects. These were not serious or long-lasting. They included sweating, itching, dry skin, and feeling tight.

Many people did not wear their stockings all the time. This is called ""compliance."" In studies comparing stockings to different stockings, people did not wear them much.

In studies comparing stockings to no treatment, some people did not wear them at all. But two studies said people wore their stockings well.

Some reasons people gave for not wearing stockings were:
* They were not comfy.
* They were hard to put on.
* People did not like how they looked.
* They did not work well.
* They caused skin problems.

Some studies looked at how comfy stockings were. Pregnant women did not like wearing full tights as their pregnancy went on. But other women wearing stockings felt fine during their daily life.

Studies comparing different stockings found similar comfort levels. Feeling uncomfortable was the main reason people liked one type over another.

One study looked at how stockings affected daily life. It found no clear differences between wearing stockings and not wearing them.

We could not say which length of stocking was best. We also could not say which pressure was best. The studies did not give clear answers.

The results from these studies were not very strong. This is because the studies were set up differently. They did not always measure the same things. It was hard to put all the results together.

We cannot say for sure if compression stockings are the best first and only treatment for varicose veins in their early stages. More good studies are needed.","Wearing stockings to provide compression for the treatment of varicose veins

### Preventing Heavy Bleeding After Birth

**Rationale**

After giving birth, some women have very heavy bleeding. This is a big problem. It can be very bad for new mothers in many parts of the world. Even in rich countries, some women still have this risk.

Doctors try to stop this heavy bleeding. They often give a shot to help the womb squeeze tight. This helps the womb push out the ""afterbirth."" This shot often uses a drug like oxytocin. Oxytocin is a natural body helper. It makes the womb squeeze and stops bleeding.

This study looked at a new drug called carbetocin. Carbetocin acts like oxytocin. It may help stop bleeding after birth. We want to see if carbetocin works better than other drugs.

**Trial Design**

How was this study done?

Doctors looked at many past studies. They reviewed 11 studies in total. These studies included 2635 women. All these women had just given birth. Some had a natural birth. Some had surgery to deliver their baby.

In these studies, some women got carbetocin. Other women got oxytocin. Some women got another drug called syntometrine. Doctors then checked for heavy bleeding. They also checked for other problems.

**Results**

What did we find?

Carbetocin worked as well as oxytocin. Both drugs helped stop heavy bleeding. But women who had carbetocin after a C-section needed fewer extra drugs. These extra drugs also help the womb squeeze.

Carbetocin was better than syntometrine. Women who got carbetocin had less blood loss after a natural birth. They also felt less sick. They had less throwing up. Their blood pressure was better too.

In short, carbetocin is a good choice. It helps prevent heavy bleeding. It also has fewer bad side effects than some other drugs. This study helps doctors choose the best drug for new mothers.","Carbetocin for preventing postpartum haemorrhage

Review question 
Is cryotherapy (cooling) beneficial or harmful for local destruction of cancer (tumours) spread to the liver? 
Background 
When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancer affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die from complications. Cryotherapy is one of methods, used to destroy metastases in the liver. This method requires placing a special probe near the cancer site. The probe is used to deliver extreme cold to the site, which is produced by liquid nitrogen or argon gas. Placement of the probe can be guided using ultrasound or computed tomography (a special x‐ray). The rapid freezing process kills the cancer cells, and the size of the cancer is reduced. However, it is not clear if this treatment prolongs life or increases quality of life of affected people. 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of cryotherapy in destroying cancer metastases in the liver. We searched for studies assessing the effect of cryotherapy in comparison with no treatment or any other treatment in people with liver metastases from cancer of any location. We aimed to assess the effect of cryotherapy on the risk of death, quality of life, and adverse events (side effects caused by the treatment). 
Study characteristics 
We last searched for evidence in June 2018. We included only one trial conducted in Ukraine, and participants' primary cancer was colorectal (bowel) cancer in 66% of instances, but there were also people with stomach, breast, skin, and other tumours. All of them had cancer spread to the liver. In this trial, 123 participants were allocated at random to receive either cryotherapy (63 people) or conventional surgery (affected parts of the liver were removed; 60 people). 
Funding 
The trial did not provide information on funding.
Key results 
The trial was at high risk of bias. The participants were followed for up to 10 years (minimum five months). The trial reported that the mortality at 10 years was 81% (51/63) in the cryotherapy group and 92% (55/60) in the conventional surgery group. We judged the evidence as low‐certainty evidence. We found no evidence of a difference in proportion of participants with recurrence of the malignancy in the liver: 86% (54/63) of the participants in the cryotherapy group and 95% (57/60) of the participants in the conventional surgery group developed a new malignancy (low‐certainty evidence). The frequency of reported complications was similar between the cryotherapy group and the conventional surgery group, except for postoperative pain. Both insignificant and pronounced pain were reported to be more common in the cryotherapy group while intense pain was reported to be more common in the conventional surgery group. However, it was not reported whether there was any evidence of a difference. The frequency of unwanted effects (adverse events or complications) was mostly similar in both groups, but pain intensity and frequency seemed to differ between the groups. There were no intervention‐related mortality or bile leakages. The trial did not provide data on quality of life; cancer mortality, and time to progression of liver metastases. 
Reliability of the evidence 
The evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy versus conventional surgery in people with liver metastases is of low certainty. We are uncertain about our estimate and cannot determine whether cryotherapy compared with conventional surgery is beneficial or harmful. We found no evidence for the benefits or harms of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, or versus systemic treatments.

### 1. Plain Title: Freezing Cancer in the Liver

### 2. Rationale

Cancer can spread to other parts of the body. When it spreads, the liver is a common place for new growths, called metastases. Cancer in the liver can be very serious. It often leads to major health problems. More than half of people with liver cancer from other parts of the body die from it.

One way to fight these liver cancers is called cryotherapy. This method uses very cold temperatures to kill cancer cells. A doctor places a small tool, called a probe, near the cancer. The probe then creates extreme cold. This cold comes from things like liquid nitrogen. The cold freezes and kills the cancer cells. This helps make the cancer smaller.

But we don't know if cryotherapy helps people live longer. We also don't know if it makes their lives better. This study wanted to find out if freezing the cancer is good or bad. It wanted to see if it works better than other treatments.

### 3. Trial Design

This study wanted to answer a question. Is freezing cancer in the liver helpful or hurtful? It looked at past research. The researchers searched for studies up to June 2018.

They found only one study. This study was done in a country called Ukraine. It looked at 123 people. These people had cancer that had spread to their liver. For most people, the cancer came from their bowel. But some had cancer from their stomach, breast, or skin.

The study split the people into two groups by chance. One group had cryotherapy. This means 63 people had their liver cancer frozen. The other group had surgery. This means 60 people had parts of their liver with cancer cut out. The study followed these people for a long time. Some people were followed for up to 10 years. The shortest time anyone was followed was five months.

### 4. Results

The study had some important findings. It looked at how many people died over 10 years. In the freezing group, 51 out of 63 people died. That is about 8 out of 10 people. In the surgery group, 55 out of 60 people died. That is about 9 out of 10 people. The study did not clearly show a big difference in how long people lived.

The study also looked at new cancer growth in the liver. In the freezing group, 54 out of 63 people had new cancer. That is about 8 out of 10 people. In the surgery group, 57 out of 60 people had new cancer. That is about 9 out of 10 people. This also did not show a clear difference.

Both groups had problems after treatment. The number of problems was much the same. But there were some differences in pain. The freezing group had more mild pain. The surgery group had more strong pain. No one died from the treatment itself. There were also no issues with bile leaks.

The study did not give information about how people felt. It did not say if their quality of life got better.

Because there was only one study, it is hard to be sure about the results. The quality of the study was not very high. We cannot say if freezing cancer is better or worse than surgery. We also don't know how it compares to no treatment. More research is needed to understand this.","Cryotherapy for liver metastases

10.1002-14651858.CD008288.pub2,"Background
Patients with diabetes frequently use complimentary and alternative medications including Ayurvedic medications and hence it is important to determine their efficacy and safety. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus.
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Library (issue 10, 2011), MEDLINE (until 31 August 2011), EMBASE (until 31 August 2011), AMED (until 14 October 2011), the database of randomised trials from South Asia (until 14 October 2011), the database of the grey literature (OpenSigle, until 14 October 2011) and databases of ongoing trials (until 14 October 2011). In addition we performed hand searches of several journals and reference lists of potentially relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials of at least two months duration of Ayurvedic interventions for diabetes mellitus. Participants of both genders, all ages and any type of diabetes were included irrespective of duration of diabetes, antidiabetic treatment, comorbidity or diabetes related complications. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data. Risk of bias of trials was evaluated as indicated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention. 
Main results
Results of only a limited number of studies could be combined, in view of different types of interventions and variable quality of data. We found six trials of proprietary herbal mixtures and one of whole system Ayurvedic treatment. These studies enrolled 354 participants ( 172 on treatment, 158 on controls, 24 allocation unknown). The treatment duration ranged from 3 to 6 months. All these studies included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
With regard to our primary outcomes, significant reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood sugar (FBS) or both were observed with Diabecon, Inolter and Cogent DB compared to placebo or no additional treatment, while no significant hypoglycaemic response was found with Pancreas tonic and Hyponidd treatment. The study of whole system Ayurvedic treatment did not provide data on HbA1c and FBS values. One study of Pancreas tonic treatment did not detect a significant change in health‐related quality of life. The main adverse effects reported were drug hypersensitivity (one study, one patient in the treatment arm); hypoglycaemic episodes (one study, one participant in the treatment arm; none had severe hypoglycaemia) and gastrointestinal side effects in one study (1 of 20 in the intervention group and 0 of 20 participants in the control group). None of the included studies reported any deaths, renal, hematological or liver toxicity. 
With regard to our secondary outcomes, post prandial blood sugar (PPBS) was lower among participants treated with Diabecon, was unchanged with Hyponidd and was higher in patients treated with Cogent DB. Treatment with Pancreas tonic and Hyponidd did not affect lipid profile significantly, while patients treated with Inolter had significantly higher HDL‐ and lower LDL‐cholesterol as well as lower triglycerides. Cogent DB treated participants also had lower total cholesterol and triglycerides. 
Studies of treatment with Diabecon reported increased fasting insulin levels; one study of treatment with Diabecon reported higher stimulated insulin levels and fasting C‐peptide levels in the treatment group. There was no significant difference in fasting and stimulated C‐peptide and insulin levels with Hyponidd, Cogent DB and Pancreas tonic treatment. The study of Inolter did not assess these outcomes. 
No study reported on or was designed to investigate diabetic complications, death from any cause and economic data. 
Authors' conclusions
Although there were significant glucose‐lowering effects with the use of some herbal mixtures, due to methodological deficiencies and small sample sizes we are unable to draw any definite conclusions regarding their efficacy. Though no significant adverse events were reported, there is insufficient evidence at present to recommend the use of these interventions in routine clinical practice and further studies are needed.

### Plain Title
Studying Ancient Medicine for Diabetes

### Rationale
Diabetes is a common illness. It means your body has trouble controlling blood sugar. Over time, high blood sugar can cause many health problems. These include heart issues and nerve damage. Many people with diabetes try different kinds of medicine. Some use ancient Indian medicine called Ayurveda. We need to know if these old medicines really help. We also need to know if they are safe. This study looked at Ayurvedic treatments. We wanted to see if they could lower blood sugar. We also wanted to check for any bad side effects.

### Trial Design
We wanted to know ""How is this study designed?"" This study looked at many past studies. We searched large medical libraries. We looked for studies about Ayurvedic medicine for diabetes. We included studies that lasted at least two months. These studies had to compare an Ayurvedic treatment to something else. This ""something else"" could be a sugar pill (placebo) or no extra treatment. We included people of all ages. Both men and women were part of the studies. They had any type of diabetes. It did not matter how long they had diabetes. It also did not matter if they took other diabetes medicines. We looked at how these studies were set up. We checked for any issues that could make the results unclear.

### Results
We wanted to know ""What were the main results of the study?"" We found seven studies. Six studies looked at plant-based mixtures. One study looked at a full Ayurvedic plan. A total of 354 people were in these studies. About half got the Ayurvedic treatment. The other half got a sugar pill or no extra treatment. Most people in these studies had type 2 diabetes. Their treatments lasted from 3 to 6 months.

Some Ayurvedic medicines seemed to help lower blood sugar. These were names like Diabecon, Inolter, and Cogent DB. They lowered the main blood sugar markers. These markers are HbA1c and fasting blood sugar. Other medicines, like Pancreas tonic and Hyponidd, did not show clear results. The study about the full Ayurvedic plan did not have details on blood sugar levels.

We also looked at other health markers. Some treatments, like Inolter, helped improve good cholesterol. They also lowered bad cholesterol and other fats in the blood. Cogent DB also lowered some fats. Diabecon seemed to increase the body's own insulin levels. Other treatments did not show clear changes in insulin.

What about problems or side effects? Very few problems were reported. One person had an allergic reaction. One person had low blood sugar. Some people had stomach issues. No deaths were reported. No problems with kidneys or liver were found.

In the end, we saw some signs that these medicines might help. They might lower blood sugar. But the studies were small. They also had some weak points in how they were done. So, we cannot say for sure that they work well. We also need more study on safety. We need more and better studies. Then we can know if doctors should suggest these treatments.","Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus:
People with diabetes and other chronic diseases often use complementary and alternative medicines. This review examines the efficacy and safety of the use of various Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus. We found seven trials which included 354 participants (172 on treatment, 158 on control, 24 could not be classified). All these studies included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Six studies tested five different types of herbal mixtures (proprietary drugs) and only one tested 'whole system' Ayurvedic treatment. The duration of treatment ranged from three to six months. One study each of Diabecon, Inolter and Cogent DB (proprietary herbal mixtures) found significantly lower glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) levels at the end of the treatment period compared to controls. Two studies of Diabecon, and one study of Cogent DB (proprietary herbal mixtures) found significantly lower fasting blood sugar levels at the end of the study period in the treatment group. No deaths were observed in these trials and side effects did not differ significantly between intervention and control groups. One study of Pancreas tonic reported no significant change in health‐related quality of life. No study reported on or was designed to investigate diabetic complications, death from any cause and costs. Despite positive results in some studies, and absence of serious side effects, firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to weak methods and small number of participants in the evaluated studies. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of these treatments. Ayurvedic physicians generally use a mixture of various herbs or proprietary preparations along with diet, exercise and mode of living. The treatments are usually individualised taking into account the balance of three 'doshas'. It is possible that the interventions in the trials analysed have not replicated actual Ayurvedic practice but only assessed some components individually.

Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is the third leading cause of neonatal mortality globally constituting 13% of overall neonatal mortality. Despite the high burden of neonatal sepsis, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. Possibly due to the diagnostic challenges of sepsis and the relative immunosuppression of the newborn, many neonates receive antibiotics for suspected sepsis. Antibiotics have become the most used therapeutics in neonatal intensive care units. The last Cochrane Review was updated in 2004. Given the clinical importance, an updated systematic review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis is needed. 
Objectives
To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase Ovid; CINAHL; LILACS; Science Citation Index EXPANDED and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science on 12 March 2021. We searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis. We included participants from birth to 72 hours of life at randomisation. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcome was all‐cause mortality, and our secondary outcomes were: serious adverse events, respiratory support, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, necrotising enterocolitis, and ototoxicity. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow‐up. 
Main results
We included five RCTs (865 participants). All trials were at high risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence according to GRADE was very low. The included trials assessed five different comparisons of antibiotics. 
We did not conduct any meta‐analyses due to lack of relevant data.
Of the five included trials one trial compared ampicillin plus gentamicin with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin plus tazobactam with amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with piperacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin with ampicillin plus amikacin; and one trial compared ceftazidime with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin. 
None of the five comparisons found any evidence of a difference when assessing all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, or necrotising enterocolitis; however, none of the trials were near an information size that could contribute significantly to the evidence of the comparative benefits and risks of any particular antibiotic regimen. 
None of the trials assessed respiratory support or ototoxicity.
The benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the lack of well‐powered trials and the high risk of systematic errors. 
Authors' conclusions
Current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. Large RCTs assessing different antibiotic regimens in early‐onset neonatal sepsis with low risk of bias are warranted.

### Plain Title: Which Antibiotics Work Best for Sick Newborn Babies?

### Rationale

Newborn babies can get very sick from an infection called sepsis. This infection is a top cause of death for babies. It affects many babies around the world.

Doctors often give antibiotics to sick newborns. They do this even when they only suspect sepsis. This is because it is hard to tell for sure if a baby has sepsis. Also, babies' bodies are not very good at fighting off sickness yet.

Antibiotics are strong medicines. They kill germs that cause sickness. We need to know which antibiotics work best. We also need to know which ones cause the fewest problems. The last big review of this topic was a long time ago. We need new information to help doctors treat sick babies better.

This study looked at different antibiotic treatments. It wanted to see which ones help babies the most. It also looked at which ones cause harm.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies that were done before. It gathered information from these past studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means some babies got one type of antibiotic. Other babies got a different type.

The study looked at babies from birth up to 3 days old. These babies had sepsis or were thought to have sepsis.

The study aimed to find out which antibiotics were better. The main thing they looked at was if the babies lived or died. They also looked at other problems. These included serious bad effects from the medicine. They looked at if babies needed help breathing or with their heart. They checked for kidney problems or brain problems. They also looked for gut problems.

Three people checked all the studies. They made sure the information was correct. They also checked for any issues with how the studies were done.

### Results

The study looked at 5 past studies. These studies included 865 babies in total.

All of these past studies had some problems. This means we cannot be very sure about their results. The information gathered from them was not strong enough.

The studies compared five different kinds of antibiotic treatments. For example, one study compared two drugs called ampicillin and gentamicin. It compared them to two different drugs called benzylpenicillin and gentamicin.

The study found no clear proof that one antibiotic treatment was better than another. This was true for babies living or dying. It was also true for serious problems, heart support, kidney problems, brain problems, or gut problems. The studies were not big enough to show a real difference.

Some of the past studies did not even look at all the possible problems. For example, none of them checked for problems with breathing support or hearing.

It is still not clear which antibiotics are best for babies. This is because the studies were too small. Also, they had problems in how they were done.

Doctors need more and better studies. These new studies should be large and well-done. They will help us find the best antibiotic treatments for very sick newborn babies.","Antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis
Review question 
We reviewed available evidence on different antibiotic regimens for newborns (from birth to 72 hours of life), with early‐onset sepsis (as defined by trialists). 
Background 
Sepsis in newborns is a severe and potential lethal condition, caused by the body's response to an infection. Neonatal sepsis is the third leading cause of neonatal death globally. Despite the high burden of sepsis in newborns, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. This Cochrane Review was originally published in 2004. To identify the most appropriate antibiotic policies for neonatal sepsis, there is a need to base these policies on an updated well‐conducted review. Given the clinical importance, such a review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis is needed. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to August 2020. We included five trials randomising 865 participants. The included trials compared five different antibiotic regimens. 
Key results 
We included five trials: one trial compared ampicillin plus gentamicin with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin plus tazobactam with amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with piperacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin with ampicillin plus amikacin; and one trial compared ceftazidime with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin. 
None of the five comparisons showed any difference when assessing death from all causes, serious adverse events (i.e. major complications), respiratory support, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity (toxicity in the kidneys), neurological developmental impairment (disabilities in the functioning of the brain that affect a child's behaviour, memory, or ability to learn), necrotising enterocolitis (tissues in the gut become inflamed and start to die), or ototoxicity (toxic to the ear). Current evidence cannot confirm or reject one antibiotic regimen being superior to another. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence behind our conclusions is very‐low quality. The five trials had high risk of bias (i.e. the trials were conducted in a way that may have skewed results to the positive side). In addition, the five trials included few participants, making the results of this review imprecise.

10.1002-14651858.CD013304.pub2,"Background
Typical and atypical antipsychotics are widely used to treat agitation and psychosis in dementia. However, whether or not they are beneficial is uncertain. Some trials have yielded negative results and effectiveness may be outweighed by harms. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics for the treatment of agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid Sp), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 7 January 2021. Two review authors independently screened the title and abstract of the hits, and two review authors assessed the full text of studies that got through this screening. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐arm trials comparing the effects of antipsychotics and placebo for the treatment of agitation or psychosis in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, or both, irrespective of age, severity of cognitive impairment, and setting. (The majority of) participants had to have clinically significant agitation (including aggression) or psychosis or both at baseline. We excluded studies about antipsychotics that are no longer available in the USA or EU, or that are used for emergency short‐term sedation. We also excluded head‐to‐head trials and antipsychotic withdrawal trials. 
Data collection and analysis
The primary outcomes were (1) reduction in agitation or psychosis in participants with agitation or psychosis, respectively at baseline, and (2) the number of participants with adverse events: somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, any adverse event, any serious adverse event (SAE), and death. 
Two review authors independently extracted the necessary data and assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated the pooled effect on agitation and psychosis for typical and atypical antipsychotics separately, and the pooled risk of adverse effects independent of the target symptom (agitation or psychosis). We used RevMan Web for the analyses. 
Main results
The search yielded 8233 separate hits. After assessing the full‐text of 35 studies, we included 24 trials that met the eligibility criteria. Six trials tested a typical antipsychotic, four for agitation and two for psychosis. Twenty trials tested an atypical antipsychotic, eight for agitation and 12 for psychosis. Two trials tested both drug types. Seventeen of 26 comparisons were performed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease specifically. The other nine comparisons also included patients with vascular dementia or mixed dementia. Together, the studies included 6090 participants (12 to 652 per study). The trials were performed in institutionalised, hospitalised and community‐dwelling patients, or a combination of those. 
For typical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, thiothixene), we are uncertain whether these drugs improve agitation compared with placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.57 to ‐0.15, 4 studies, n = 361); very low‐certainty evidence, but typical antipsychotics may improve psychosis slightly (SMD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.55 to ‐0.03, 2studies, n= 240; low‐certainty evidence) compared with placebo. These drugs probably increase the risk of somnolence (risk ratio (RR) 2.62, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.56, 3 studies, n = 466; moderate‐certainty evidence) and increase extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.23, 3 studies, n = 467; high‐certainty) evidence. There was no evidence regarding the risk of any adverse event. The risks of SAEs (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.66, 1 study, n = 193) and death (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.00, 6 studies, n = 578) may be increased slightly, but these estimates were very imprecise, and the certainty was low. The effect estimates for haloperidol from five trials were in line with those of the drug class. 
Atypical antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) probably reduce agitation slightly (SMD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.30 to ‐0.12, 7 studies, n = 1971; moderate‐certainty evidence), but probably have a negligible effect on psychosis (SMD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.18 to ‐0.03, 12 studies, n = 3364; moderate‐certainty evidence). These drugs increase the risk of somnolence (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.39, 13 studies, n ‐ 3878; high‐certainty evidence) and are probably also associated with slightly increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.68, 15 studies, n = 4180; moderate‐certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.61, 15 studies, n= 4316; moderate‐certainty evidence) and death (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.05, 17 studies, n= 5032; moderate‐certainty evidence), although the latter estimate was imprecise. The drugs probably have a negligible effect on the risk of any adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09, 11 studies, n = 2785; moderate‐certainty evidence). The findings from seven trials for risperidone were in line with those for the drug class. 
Authors' conclusions
There is some evidence that typical antipsychotics might decrease agitation and psychosis slightly in patients with dementia. Atypical antipsychotics reduce agitation in dementia slightly, but their effect on psychosis in dementia is negligible. The apparent effectiveness of the drugs seen in daily practice may be explained by a favourable natural course of the symptoms, as observed in the placebo groups. Both drug classes increase the risk of somnolence and other adverse events. If antipsychotics are considered for sedation in patients with severe and dangerous symptoms, this should be discussed openly with the patient and legal representative. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Do Medicines for Mental Symptoms in Dementia Help or Harm?

### Rationale

Many people with dementia can become upset or see things that are not there. These issues are called agitation and psychosis. They make life harder for patients and their families. Doctors often give special medicines, called antipsychotics, to help with these problems.

But we are not sure if these medicines really work well. Some studies showed they might not help much. They also might cause harm. We need to know if the good parts of these medicines are better than the bad parts.

This study looked at how well these medicines work. We also checked how safe they are. We wanted to see if they help people with Alzheimer's and other kinds of dementia.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many past studies. We wanted to find out ""How is this study designed?"" We gathered facts from many research papers. All these papers compared these medicines to a sugar pill (placebo). A sugar pill has no medicine in it.

The people in these past studies had dementia. Most had Alzheimer's or a related type. They all had problems with agitation or psychosis. The studies included people of all ages. They were in hospitals, care homes, or living at home. We looked at how these people felt over time while taking the medicine or sugar pill.

We focused on two types of medicines: typical and atypical antipsychotics. We checked if they made agitation or psychosis better. We also looked for any bad effects. These bad effects included feeling sleepy, having shaky movements, or other health problems. We also checked for serious problems and even death.

### Results

We looked at a lot of research, over 8000 reports. We chose 24 studies that fit our rules. These studies involved a total of 6090 people. They tested different types of antipsychotic medicines.

**For typical antipsychotics (like haloperidol):**
* We are not sure if they help with agitation. The proof for this is very weak.
* They might help a little with psychosis.
* These medicines likely make people very sleepy. This happened in about 2 out of 5 people.
* They also likely cause shaky, stiff movements. This happened in about 2 out of 5 people.
* We are not sure if they cause other serious problems or death. The proof is weak.

**For atypical antipsychotics (like risperidone or olanzapine):**
* They likely reduce agitation a little bit.
* They probably do not help much with psychosis.
* These medicines likely make people sleepy. This happened in almost 2 out of 5 people.
* They probably cause a slightly higher chance of shaky movements.
* They also probably cause a slightly higher chance of serious health problems and death.

**What this means for patients:**
These medicines might help a little with feeling upset or seeing things. But they also come with risks. People might feel very sleepy or have shaky movements. There is also a small chance of serious health problems or death.

Sometimes, people with dementia get better on their own. The improvements we see with these medicines might be because of this natural healing, not just the drug.

Doctors should talk openly with patients and their families. They need to discuss the good and bad parts of these medicines. This is very important if the medicines are used for severe problems.","Do antipsychotic medicines reduce  agitated behaviour and psychotic symptoms in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia? 
 
Key messages 
It is uncertain whether older, first‐generation or ‘typical’ antipsychotic medicines such as haloperidol have an effect on agitated behaviour (for example, restlessness and aggression); the effect is moderate at best. Typical antipsychotic medicines may decrease delusions and hallucinations slightly in people with dementia.  
Newer, second‐generation ‘atypical’ antipsychotic medicines, such as risperidone, probably reduce agitated behaviour slightly. Atypical antipsychotic medicines probably have no effect on psychotic symptoms.  
Both first‐ and second‐generation antipsychotic medicines increase the risk of drowsiness and other unwanted events. When patients’ symptoms improve after antipsychotics have been prescribed, this is probably largely due to natural improvement in symptoms over time. 
What are antipsychotic medicines? 
Antipsychotics are medicines prescribed to treat psychotic symptoms and severely disturbed behaviour in some mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and severe depression. Psychotic symptoms are delusions (very strongly held beliefs in something which is not true) and hallucinations (sensing – usually seeing or hearing ‐ things which are not really there). 
Antipsychotic medicines are often divided into two groups:
1. first‐generation (older) or ‘typical’ antipsychotics, for example haloperidol;
2. second‐generation (newer) or ‘atypical’ antipsychotics, for example risperidone.
Both types can cause unwanted effects, such as drowsiness, movement disorders (for example, involuntary or uncontrollable movements, tremors, muscle contractions) and weight gain. 
Why do people with dementia need antipsychotics? 
People with dementia quite often experience hallucinations and delusions during their illness for some time. Particularly in the later stages of the illness, they may also show agitated behaviours such as restlessness, shouting out or aggression towards others. It is important to try to understand what is driving these behaviours and there are many ways to manage them which do not involve drugs. However, antipsychotic medicines have often been prescribed to people with dementia for these problems. In many countries, they are prescribed less often than in the past but are still used when the symptoms are severe. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know how well antipsychotic medicines reduce the severity of agitation and psychotic symptoms in people with the two commonest types of dementia, namely dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. We also wanted to know how many people experienced unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated antipsychotic medicines currently available in the USA or European Union by comparing them with placebo (a ’dummy’ pill), for treatment of persistent agitation or psychotic symptoms. People in the studies had to have Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. They could be any age and reside in a care home, a hospital, or the community. Most of the people in the studies had to be experiencing agitation (including aggression) or psychotic symptoms, or both, at the start of the study. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 24 studies with a total of 6090 people:
‐ six studies tested typical antipsychotics, mostly haloperidol; 
‐ 20 studies tested atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole; and  
‐ two studies tested both typical and atypical antipsychotics.
All the studies compared antipsychotics with placebo. The people were living in institutions, hospitals, the community, or a combination of these settings. 
Main results 
Typical antipsychotics (haloperidol, thiothixene) compared with placebo:
‐ may improve symptoms of psychosis slightly (2 studies, 240 people), but we are uncertain about their effect on agitation (4 studies, 361 people);  
‐ probably increase the risk of drowsiness (3 studies, 466 people), and movement disorders (3 studies, 467 people);  
‐ may slightly increase the risk of serious unwanted effects (1 study, 193 people) and of death (6 studies, 578 people).  
There was no evidence about the risk of non‐serious and serious unwanted effects combined.
Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) compared with placebo: 
‐ probably slightly reduce agitation (7 studies, 1971 people) and may slightly reduce aggression (1 study, 301 people), but probably make no important difference to symptoms of psychosis (12 studies, 3364 people); 
‐ increase the risk of drowsiness (13 studies, 2878 people) and probably slightly increase movement disorders (15 studies, 4180 people); 
‐ probably slightly increase the risk of experiencing any non‐serious or serious unwanted effect combined, the risk of serious unwanted effects, and the risk of death (17 studies, 5032 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Overall, our confidence in the evidence about typical antipsychotics is limited and our confidence in the evidence about atypical antipsychotics moderate. Typical antipsychotics have been investigated in just a few studies. In addition, the studies about typical and atypical antipsychotics did not always use the best methods to carry out their investigations, or did not report the results. Consequently, the effects on agitation or psychosis may have been overestimated, and the effects on adverse events underestimated. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 7 January 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013299.pub2,"Background
It is common for people not to take antidepressant medication as prescribed, with around 50% of people likely to prematurely discontinue taking their medication after six months. Community pharmacists may be well placed to have a role in antidepressant management because of their unique pharmacotherapeutic knowledge and ease of access for people. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to offer proactive interventions to people with depression or depressive symptoms. However, the effectiveness and acceptability of existing pharmacist‐based interventions is not yet well understood. The degree to which a pharmacy‐based management approach might be beneficial, acceptable to people, and effective as part of the overall management for those with depression is, to date, unclear. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) will help answer these questions and add important knowledge to the currently sparse evidence base. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of pharmacy‐based management interventions compared with active control (e.g. patient information materials or any other active intervention delivered by someone other than the pharmacist or the pharmacy team), waiting list, or treatment as usual (e.g. standard pharmacist advice or antidepressant education, signposting to support available in primary care services, brief medication counselling, and/or (self‐)monitoring of medication adherence offered by a healthcare professional outside the pharmacy team) at improving depression outcomes in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD‐CTR) to June 2016; the Cochrane Library (Issue 11, 2018); and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to December 2018. We searched theses and dissertation databases and international trial registers for unpublished/ongoing trials. We applied no restrictions on date, language, or publication status to the searches.  
Selection criteria
We included all RCTs and cluster‐RCTs where a pharmacy‐based intervention was compared with treatment as usual, waiting list, or an alternative intervention in the management of depression in adults over 16 years of age. Eligible studies had to report at least one of the following outcomes at any time point: depression symptom change, acceptability of the intervention, diagnosis of depression, non‐adherence to medication, frequency of primary care appointments, quality of life, social functioning, or adverse events.  
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently, and in duplicate, conducted all stages of study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment (including GRADE). We discussed disagreements within the team until we reached consensus. Where data did not allow meta‐analyses, we synthesised results narratively.  
Main results
Twelve studies (2215 participants) met the inclusion criteria and compared pharmacy‐based management with treatment as usual. Two studies (291 participants) also included an active control (both used patient information leaflets providing information about the prescribed antidepressant). Neither of these studies reported depression symptom change. A narrative synthesis of results on acceptability of the intervention was inconclusive, with one study reporting better acceptability of pharmacy‐based management and the other better acceptability of the active control. One study reported that participants in the pharmacy‐based management group had better medication adherence than the control participants. One study reported adverse events with no difference between groups. The studies reported no other outcomes. 
Meta‐analyses comparing pharmacy‐based management with treatment as usual showed no evidence of a difference in the effect of the intervention on depression symptom change (dichotomous data; improvement in symptoms yes/no: risk ratio (RR), 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 4 RCTs, 475 participants; moderate‐quality evidence; continuous data: standard mean difference (SMD) ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.10; 5 RCTs, 718 participants; high‐certainty evidence), or acceptability of the intervention (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.45; 12 RCTs, 2072 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The risk of non‐adherence was reduced in participants receiving pharmacy‐based management (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87; 6 RCTs, 911 participants; high‐certainty evidence). We were unable to meta‐analyse data on diagnosis of depression, frequency of primary care appointments, quality of life, or social functioning. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence of a difference between pharmacy‐based management for depression in adults compared with treatment as usual in facilitating depression symptom change. Based on numbers of participants leaving the trials early, there may be no difference in acceptability between pharmacy‐based management and controls. However, there was uncertainty due to the low‐certainty evidence.

### Plain Title
**Can Pharmacists Help People with Depression? A Look at How Well Pharmacy Care Works.**

### Rationale
Many people stop taking their depression medicine too soon. About half of people quit their medicine after six months. This can make it hard to get better. Pharmacists are experts on medicine. They are also easy to see. They might be able to help people manage their depression medicine.

We wanted to know if pharmacists helping with depression care really works. We also wanted to know if people like getting help from pharmacists. There was not much clear proof before now. This study gathered all the good research to find answers. We wanted to see if pharmacists could help people with depression feel better.

### Trial Design
This study looked at other studies. It gathered all the best studies that tested if pharmacists helping with depression worked. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. One group got help from a pharmacist. The other group got regular care.

The studies included adults older than 16. These adults had depression. The studies checked if people got better. They also checked if people liked the help they got. Other things were also checked. These included how well people took their medicine. We looked for studies up to December 2018. We searched many places for these studies.

### Results
We found 12 studies to include. These studies had a total of 2,215 people. These studies looked at pharmacy help versus regular care. Two studies also had another group. This group got only simple information about their medicine.

What did we find? We found no clear proof that pharmacy help made depression symptoms better. People seemed to like pharmacy help as much as regular care. There was no big difference.

However, one good thing did come out. People who got help from a pharmacist were more likely to take their medicine. This is called ""adherence."" They stuck with their medicine more often. This is good news. It means pharmacists can help people keep taking their medicine. This is very important for getting better from depression.

In short, pharmacists did not make depression symptoms go away faster. But they did help people take their medicine as they should. This is a very useful role for pharmacists. It can help people get the full benefit from their depression medicine.","Pharmacies might be able to support people with their depression medicines
Background 
Some people with depression find it difficult to take their depression medicines (often called 'antidepressants') as prescribed by their doctor. This can mean that the medicines do not work properly and people might not get better or might even get worse. It could be that pharmacists and their teams can help people with their depression treatment in ways that their family doctor (general practitioner (GP)) cannot. Pharmacies are based within the community, easier to get to, and people may feel more comfortable telling a pharmacist about their mood. However, there are not many studies to tell us if this works. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases for well‐designed studies that compared a group of adults with depression who received additional help with their depression medicines from their pharmacy with a group of adults with depression who received their treatment as usual. 
The evidence is current to 14 December 2018.
Key results and certainty of the evidence 
We found 12 studies with over 2000 adults taking part. They compared pharmacy‐based support with treatment as usual, for example, basic information about their medicines or signposting to other services only. We found that additional support given by the pharmacist was no better at reducing people's depression than their treatment as usual. The studies also showed that people may have liked both approaches the same, although we are uncertain about the results as the evidence was of low certainty. 
The studies did show that people who received support from their pharmacy were more likely to take their antidepressants as prescribed. We were not able to combine information from the included studies on other outcomes we were interested in (diagnosis of depression, frequency of healthcare appointments, quality of life, social functioning, or side effects). 
We found no difference in effectiveness when people with depression received additional support from a pharmacist compared with treatment as usual.

Remdesivir is an antiviral medicine with properties to inhibit viral replication of SARS‐CoV‐2. Positive results from early studies attracted media attention and led to emergency use authorisation of remdesivir in COVID‐19.  A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effects of remdesivir as a treatment for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is required. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of remdesivir compared to placebo or standard care alone on clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (which comprises the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv) as well as Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index) and WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions. We conducted the searches on 16 April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
We included RCTs evaluating remdesivir for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in hospitalised adults compared to placebo or standard care alone irrespective of disease severity, gender, ethnicity, or setting.  
We excluded studies that evaluated remdesivir for the treatment of other coronavirus diseases. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
To assess risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for outcomes that were reported according to our prioritised categories: all‐cause mortality at up to day 28, duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation, duration to liberation from supplemental oxygen, new need for mechanical ventilation (high‐flow oxygen, non‐invasive, or invasive mechanical ventilation), new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, new need for non‐invasive mechanical ventilation or high‐flow oxygen, new need for oxygen by mask or nasal prongs, quality of life, serious adverse events, and adverse events (any grade). 
Main results
We included five RCTs with 7452 participants diagnosed with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and a mean age of 59 years, of whom 3886 participants were randomised to receive remdesivir. Most participants required low‐flow oxygen (n=4409) or mechanical ventilation (n=1025) at baseline. Studies were mainly conducted in high‐ and upper‐middle‐income countries. We identified two ongoing studies, one was suspended due to a lack of COVID‐19 patients to recruit. 
Risk of bias assessments were considered to be some concerns or high risk for clinical status and safety outcomes because participants who had died did not contribute information to these outcomes. Without adjustment, this leads to an uncertain amount of missing values and the potential for bias due to missing data. 
Effects of remdesivir in hospitalised individuals  
Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to all‐cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.06; risk difference (RD) 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 21 fewer to 7 more; 4 studies, 7142 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  There was limited evidence for a beneficial effect of remdesivir on mortality in a subset of 435 participants who received low flow oxygen at baseline in one study (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.66). We could not confirm this finding due to restricted availability of relevant subgroup data from other studies. 
Remdesivir may have little or no effect on the duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1298 participants, data not pooled, low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether remdesivir increases or decreases the chance of clinical improvement in terms of duration to liberation from supplemental oxygen at up to day 28 (3 studies, 1691 participants, data not pooled, very low‐certainty evidence).   
We are very uncertain whether remdesivir decreases or increases the risk of clinical worsening in terms of new need for mechanical ventilation at up to day 28 (high‐flow oxygen or non‐invasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation) (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.24; RD 29 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 68 fewer to 32 more; 3 studies, 6696 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); new need for non‐invasive mechanical ventilation or high‐flow oxygen (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.98; RD 72 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 118 fewer to 5 fewer; 1 study, 573 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and new need for oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.22; RD 84 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 204 fewer to 98 more; 1 study, 138 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Remdesivir may decrease the risk of clinical worsening in terms of new need for invasive mechanical ventilation (67 fewer participants amongst 1000 participants; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.77; 2 studies, 1159 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
None of the included studies reported quality of life.
Remdesivir probably decreases the serious adverse events rate at up to 28 days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.90; RD 63 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 94 fewer to 25 fewer; 3 studies, 1674 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether remdesivir increases or decreases adverse events rate (any grade) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; RD 29 more per 1000, 95% CI 82 fewer to 158 more; 3 studies, 1674 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the currently available evidence remdesivir probably has little or no effect on all‐cause mortality at up to 28 days in hospitalised adults with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We are uncertain about the effects of remdesivir on clinical improvement and worsening. There were insufficient data available to examine the effect of remdesivir on mortality across subgroups defined by respiratory support at baseline.  
Future studies should provide additional data on efficacy and safety of remdesivir for defined core outcomes in COVID‐19 research, especially for different population subgroups. This could allow us to draw more reliable conclusions on the potential benefits and harms of remdesivir in future updates of this review. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically. 
","Here's a Plain Language Summary of the abstract:

## How Does Remdesivir Help People with COVID-19?

**Rationale**

COVID-19 is a sickness caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. This virus can make people very sick. It can cause problems like trouble breathing. Many people need to go to the hospital. It is a big problem for many patients.

Remdesivir is a medicine that fights viruses. It can stop the SARS-CoV-2 virus from making copies of itself. This medicine got a lot of public interest. It was approved quickly for use in COVID-19 patients.

Doctors need to know if remdesivir really helps sick people. We need to look at good studies. We want to know if remdesivir makes a real difference for people with COVID-19. This study gathered all the best information. We want to see if remdesivir is a good treatment.

**Trial Design**

This study looked at other studies. It gathered and checked many research papers. These papers were about remdesivir for COVID-19. These studies were ""randomized controlled trials."" This means some people got remdesivir. Other people got a fake medicine (placebo) or usual care.

The studies looked at adults in the hospital. These patients had COVID-19. They were different ages. They had different health needs. They were from all over the world. We looked at how remdesivir worked. We compared it to not getting the medicine.

We wanted to see how well remdesivir helped. We looked at things like if people died. We checked how long they needed breathing help. We also looked at any bad effects from the medicine. This review keeps looking for new information.

**Results**

We looked at five main studies. These studies included 7,452 people. All these people had COVID-19. Their average age was about 59 years. About half of them received remdesivir.

Most of these patients needed some oxygen. Some needed breathing machines. The studies were mostly in richer countries. Two more studies are still happening. One stopped because there were not enough patients.

We found that remdesivir likely does not change much. It probably does not change the number of people who die. This was true up to 28 days after treatment. For every 1,000 people, about 8 fewer might die. But this is not a big difference.

In one study, remdesivir seemed to help people on low oxygen. For every 100 people, about 32 fewer died. But we need more studies to be sure about this.

We are not sure if remdesivir helps people get off oxygen faster. We are also not sure if it stops people from needing more breathing help. It might lower the need for invasive breathing machines. For every 1,000 people, about 67 fewer might need one.

No studies talked about how remdesivir affected a person's quality of life.

Remdesivir probably lowers serious side effects. For every 1,000 people, about 63 fewer had serious problems. We are not sure if it changes other side effects.

Overall, remdesivir likely does not change how many people die. This is for adults in the hospital with COVID-19. We are not sure about other good or bad effects. We need more studies. These studies should look at different groups of patients. This will help us know more about remdesivir. This review will keep checking for new information.","Remdesivir to treat people with COVID‐19
Is remdesivir (an antiviral medicine) an effective treatment for COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
• For adults hospitalised with COVID‐19, remdesivir probably has little or no effect on deaths from any cause up to 28 days after treatment compared with placebo (sham treatment) or usual care.  
• We are uncertain whether remdesivir improves or worsens patients’ condition, based on whether they needed more or less help with breathing. 
• Researchers should agree on key outcomes to be used in COVID‐19 research, and future studies should investigate these areas. This would allow future updates of this review to draw more certain conclusions about the use of remdesivir to treat COVID‐19. 
What is remdesivir? 
Remdesivir is a medicine that fights viruses. It has been shown to prevent the virus that causes COVID‐19 (SARS‐CoV‐2) from reproducing. Medical regulators have approved remdesivir for emergency use to treat people with COVID‐19.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if remdesivir is an effective treatment for people in hospital with COVID‐19 and if it causes unwanted effects compared to placebo or usual care. 
People with COVID‐19 are given different kinds of breathing support, depending on how severe their breathing difficulties are. We used the types of breathing support people received as a measure of the success of remdesivir in treating COVID‐19. Types of breathing support included: 
• for severe breathing difficulties: invasive mechanical ventilation, when a breathing tube is put into patients’ lungs, and a machine (ventilator) breathes for them. Patients are given medicine to make them sedated whilst they are on a ventilator. 
• for moderate to severe breathing difficulties: non‐invasive mechanical ventilation through a mask over the nose and/or mouth, or a helmet. Air or oxygen is pushed through the mask. Patients are generally awake for this treatment. 
• for moderate breathing difficulties: oxygen via a mask or prongs that sit in the nostrils. Patients can still breathe room air. 
We were interested in the following outcomes:
• deaths from any cause in the 28 days after treatment;
• whether patients got better after treatment, measured by how long they spent on mechanical ventilation or oxygen; 
• whether patients’ condition worsened so that they needed oxygen or mechanical ventilation;
• quality of life;
• any unwanted effects; and 
• serious unwanted effects.
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that investigated remdesivir to treat adults with COVID‐19 compared to placebo or standard care. Patients were hospitalised with COVID‐19 and could be of any gender or ethnicity.   
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 5 studies with 7452 people hospitalised with COVID‐19. Of these, 3886 people were given remdesivir. The average age of patients was 59 years. Studies took place around the world, mainly in high‐ and upper‐middle‐income countries.  
Main results  
The included studies compared remdesivir to placebo or usual care in people hospitalised with COVID‐19 for up to 28 days. 
Deaths from any cause 
• Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to deaths from any cause (4 studies, 7142 people). In 1000 people, 8 fewer die with remdesivir compared to placebo or standard care. 
Did patients get better with remdesivir? 
• Remdesivir may have little or no effect on the length of time patients spent on invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1298 people).  
• We do not know whether remdesivir increases or decreases time on supplemental oxygen (3 studies, 1691 people). 
Did patients get worse with remdesivir? 
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need any mechanical ventilation (invasive or non‐invasive) with remdesivir (3 studies, 6696 people). 
• Patients may be less likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1159 people). 
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need non‐invasive mechanical ventilation (1 study, 573 people).  
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (1 study, 138 people). 
Quality of life 
• None of the included studies reported quality of life.
Unwanted effects 
• We do not know whether remdesivir leads to more or fewer unwanted effects of any level (3 studies, 1674 people).  
• Patients are probably less likely to experience serious unwanted effects with remdesivir than with placebo or standard care (3 studies, 1674 people). In 1000 people, 63 fewer would experience a serious unwanted effect compared to placebo or standard care. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are moderately confident in the evidence for deaths from any cause and serious unwanted effects; however, our confidence in the other evidence is limited because studies used different methods to measure and record their results, and we did not find many studies for some of our outcomes of interest.  
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is current to 16 April 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013488.pub2,"Background
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, life‐limiting, multisystem disease affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF suffer with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which if left untreated, leads to a poor nutritional status. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has been shown to be effective in improving nutritional status and subsequently associated with improved lung function. However, the timings of PERT administration in relation to a meal are subjective and not standardised, meaning that variations in the timing of PERT dosing persist. 
Objectives
The primary objective of the review is to compare the efficacy (fat absorption) and effectiveness (nutritional status, lung function and quality of life) of different PERT dosing strategies in terms of timing of administration for treating dietary malabsorption in all individuals with CF. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
Date of last search: 24 June 2021.
We also searched ongoing trials registers on 09 July 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over RCTs with a minimum washout period of two weeks, and quasi‐RCTs of PERT dosing regimens in people (of any age) with CF. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed and screened the studies identified from the searches. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for our pre‐specified critical outcomes, but we did not identify any eligible studies. 
Main results
No studies met the eligibility criteria and therefore we did not include any in this review. The excluded studies were either cross‐over in design (but lacking a sufficient washout period between treatments) or did not assess the timing of PERT. One study which was terminated early is awaiting assessment pending further information. 
Authors' conclusions
We were unable to determine whether one dosing schedule for PERT is better than another since we identified no eligible RCTs. While the introduction of PERT to people with CF can improve their nutritional status, there are a limited number of studies which address this review question, and none met our eligibility criteria. Since malnutrition and adverse gastrointestinal symptoms remain a common feature in CF, the assessment of the relative performance of dosing schedules may provide evidence to improve outcomes in people with CF who are pancreatic insufficient. 
Further research is needed to fully evaluate the role of dosing schedules for PERT in fat absorption. Research should also establish reliable outcome measures and minimal clinically important differences. While RCTs with a cross‐over design may have advantages over a parallel group design, an adequate washout period between intervention periods is essential. 
","## Better Timing for Medicine in Cystic Fibrosis

### Rationale

Cystic fibrosis, or CF, is a serious sickness. It harms many parts of the body. Over 70,000 people around the world have CF. Most people with CF have trouble with their pancreas. The pancreas helps digest food. When it does not work well, people do not get enough good food. This can make them weak and sick.

People with CF take medicine to help digest food. This medicine is called PERT. PERT helps people get more food into their bodies. This can make their lungs work better too. But doctors do not all agree on when to take PERT. Some take it before meals. Some take it during meals. Some take it after meals. We need to find the best time to take this medicine.

This study wants to find out the best time to take PERT. Finding the best time could help people with CF. It could help them get more food. This might make them feel much better.

### Trial Design

This study looked for other studies. It searched for studies that tested PERT medicine. It wanted to find studies that looked at when people took PERT. The studies needed to be strong and fair. We looked for studies where people were chosen by chance. This makes the results fair.

We wanted to find studies about people with CF. These people could be any age. They would take PERT medicine. The study would look at how well they took in fat from food. It would also look at how strong they were. It would check their lung health. And it would check how they felt about their lives.

The people in the studies would try different ways of taking PERT. For example, some might take it before eating. Others might take it during eating. We wanted to see which way worked best. Each person would be in a study for some time. If they switched treatments, there needed to be enough time in between. This makes sure the old medicine is out of their body.

### Results

We looked at many studies. But we could not find any studies that fit our rules. No studies tested when to take PERT in a good way. The studies we found were not designed well enough. Some studies did not wait long enough between different ways of taking medicine. Others did not even look at the timing of PERT.

So, we cannot say what the best time to take PERT is right now. We know PERT helps people with CF. It helps them get food into their bodies. But we do not know if one timing is better than another.

People with CF still have problems with food. They also have pain in their stomach. We need more research. We need good studies to find the best way to take PERT. This would help people with CF feel better. Doctors need to do more studies on this topic. These studies should be fair and clear. They need to measure things well.","Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy timings in cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the different timings of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in people (of any age) with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Background 
CF is an inherited condition affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF are not able to produce enough pancreatic enzymes to breakdown and absorb fat, protein and fat‐soluble vitamins from food. This can lead to fatty stools (poo) and weight loss. It is thought that if fat is not digested properly, it could contribute to a higher risk of developing constipation or other serious gut complications such as distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. 
PERT provides the enzymes required to breakdown fat and the dosage is based upon the fat content of a meal or the person's body weight. PERT has been shown to improve weight and is associated with improved lung function. Despite current dose guidance, there are differences in PERT doses and there is no set guidance for when the therapy should be taken in relation to a meal (i.e. before, during or after eating). 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 24 June 2021.
Study characteristics 
We did not find any studies where PERT was given to people with CF who were pancreatic insufficient at different timings relative to their meals. We excluded nine studies. Four of these assessed the timing of PERT administration, but they had a cross‐over design where participants had one intervention and then swapped to the second intervention. We excluded these studies because they did not leave enough time between the different interventions to be sure that the effects of the first intervention were not affecting the results from the second intervention. Four studies did not look at the timing of PERT and one study evaluated a new educational program for PERT. One study was terminated early and we will assess this again at the first update of this review if we are able to obtain more information from the investigators. 
Key results 
No studies met the eligibility criteria. Further research is needed to work out the best time to take PERT in relation to a meal.

10.1002-14651858.CD013315,"Background
High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of mainly cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 2500 metres (˜ 8200 feet). Acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE), and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as potential medical problems associated with high altitude ascent. In this, the third of a series of three reviews about preventive strategies for HAI, we assessed the effectiveness of miscellaneous and non‐pharmacological interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of miscellaneous and non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI in people who are at risk of developing high altitude illness in any setting. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) in January 2019. We adapted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other databases. We used a combination of thesaurus‐based and free‐text search terms. We scanned the reference lists and citations of included trials and any relevant systematic reviews that we identified for further references to additional trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials conducted in any setting where non‐pharmacological and miscellaneous interventions were employed to prevent acute HAI, including preacclimatization measures and the administration of non‐pharmacological supplements. We included trials involving participants who are at risk of developing high altitude illness (AMS or HACE, or HAPE, or both). We included participants with, and without, a history of high altitude illness. We applied no age or gender restrictions. We included trials where the relevant intervention was administered before the beginning of ascent. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures employed by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 20 studies (1406 participants, 21 references) in this review. Thirty studies (14 ongoing, and 16 pending classification (awaiting)) will be considered in future versions of this suite of three reviews as appropriate. We report the results for the primary outcome of this review (risk of AMS) by each group of assessed interventions. 
Group 1. Preacclimatization and other measures based on pressure 
Use of simulated altitude or remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) might not improve the risk of AMS on subsequent exposure to altitude, but this effect is uncertain (simulated altitude: risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.71; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 140 participants; low‐quality evidence. RIPC: RR 3.0, 95% CI 0.69 to 13.12; 1 trial, 40 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement of this risk using positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP), but this information was derived from a cross‐over trial with a limited number of participants (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.38 to 9.76; 1 trial, 8 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. 
Group 2. Supplements and vitamins 
Supplementation of antioxidants, medroxyprogesterone, iron or Rhodiola crenulata might not improve the risk of AMS on exposure to high altitude, but this effect is uncertain (antioxidants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.03; 1 trial, 18 participants; low‐quality evidence. Medroxyprogesterone: RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.05; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 32 participants; low‐quality evidence. Iron: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.11; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 65 participants; low‐quality evidence. R crenulata: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.29; 1 trial, 125 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement of this risk with the administration of erythropoietin, but this information was extracted from a trial with issues related to risk of bias and imprecision (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.84; 1 trial, 39 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Regarding administration of ginkgo biloba, we did not perform a pooled estimation of RR for AMS due to considerable heterogeneity between the included studies (I² = 65%). RR estimates from the individual studies were conflicting (from 0.05 to 1.03; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. 
Group 3. Other comparisons 
We found heterogeneous evidence regarding the risk of AMS when ginkgo biloba was compared with acetazolamide (I² = 63%). RR estimates from the individual studies were conflicting (estimations from 0.11 (95% CI 0.01 to 1.86) to 2.97 (95% CI 1.70 to 5.21); low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement when ginkgo biloba was administered along with acetazolamide, but this information was derived from a single trial with issues associated to risk of bias (compared to ginkgo biloba alone: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.71; 1 trial, 311 participants; low‐quality evidence). Administration of medroxyprogesterone plus acetazolamide did not improve the risk of AMS when compared to administration of medroxyprogesterone or acetazolamide alone (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.55; 1 trial, 12 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. 
Authors' conclusions
This Cochrane Review is the final in a series of three providing relevant information to clinicians, and other interested parties, on how to prevent high altitude illness. The assessment of non‐pharmacological and miscellaneous interventions suggests that there is heterogeneous and even contradictory evidence related to the effectiveness of these prophylactic strategies. Safety of these interventions remains as an unclear issue due to lack of assessment. Overall, the evidence is limited due to its quality (low to very low), the relative paucity of that evidence and the number of studies pending classification for the three reviews belonging to this series (30 studies either awaiting classification or ongoing). Additional studies, especially those comparing with pharmacological alternatives (such as acetazolamide) are required, in order to establish or refute the strategies evaluated in this review.

When people travel to very high places, like mountains, they can get sick. This sickness is called high altitude illness (HAI). It can cause problems with your brain or lungs. Some problems include acute mountain sickness (AMS), brain swelling (HACE), or fluid in the lungs (HAPE). These problems can make people feel very bad.

We wanted to see if things other than medicine could stop people from getting sick at high altitudes. We looked at different ways people try to prevent this illness. We also checked if these methods caused any bad side effects. This study helps us learn how to keep people safe when they go to high places.

**Trial Design**
This study looked at many past studies. These studies tested different ways to stop high altitude illness without using drugs. We included studies where people were chosen by chance for different groups. This is called a randomized controlled trial.

The studies included people who might get sick at high altitudes. This includes people who had been sick before and those who had not. People of any age or gender were included. We looked at methods used before a person went up to a high place. We did not set a time limit for how long people were in the original studies. We gathered and checked all the information in a careful way.

**Results**
We looked at 20 studies with over 1400 people. We found different results for preventing sickness.

Some studies looked at methods that change pressure, like using special air or squeezing parts of the body. These methods might not stop sickness, but it is hard to be sure. One study showed a special breathing mask might help, but it was a small study with only 8 people. We don't know much about the side effects of these methods.

Other studies tested vitamins and other added substances. Things like antioxidants, certain hormones, iron, or a plant called Rhodiola might not help. But we are not fully sure. One study showed a medicine called erythropoietin might help, but that study had some problems. We also looked at ginkgo biloba. The results for ginkgo biloba were not clear. Different studies showed different things. We don't know much about the side effects of these additions.

Some studies compared ginkgo biloba with a common altitude medicine called acetazolamide. The results were mixed. One study showed that taking ginkgo biloba with acetazolamide might help more than ginkgo biloba alone. Another study showed that a hormone with acetazolamide did not help more. We don't know much about the side effects of these mixes.

Overall, the information we found was not always clear. Some results were different from others. Also, the quality of many studies was low. This means we need more and better studies. We need to find out for sure what works and what does not work. We also need to know if these methods are safe. More studies are needed to compare these methods with medicines.","Diverse strategies for preventing high altitude illness
Background 
The term high altitude illness (HAI) is used to describe a group of brain and lung conditions that can occur when people travel to altitudes above approximately 2500 metres (approximately 8200 feet). Individuals can respond to high altitudes in different ways and experience a variety of symptoms. These include HAI‐related headache, nausea, vomiting and tiredness, often called acute mountain sickness. Drowsiness, confusion or unconsciousness can occur when the brain is particularly affected (high altitude cerebral oedema or HACE), and cough or breathlessness when it is the lungs (high altitude pulmonary oedema or HAPE). A number of different strategies are used to prevent HAI. In this review we assessed the evidence from randomized controlled trials on whether various approaches could prevent the onset of high altitude illness, with a focus on non‐drug approaches, herbs and natural supplements. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to January 2019. We included 20 randomized controlled studies involving 1406 participants. The studies looked at diverse approaches to HAI prevention. These approaches included strategies to acclimatize to high altitudes by mimicking quick ascents by reducing levels of oxygen in the air that participants are breathing, and herbal products or vitamin supplements available without a prescription. 
The participants ranged in age between 17 and 65 years. Only one study included people at high risk of developing HAI as they had a history of HAI. Four trials provided the intervention between one to three days before making the ascent (20% of the studies), and eight between four to 30 days before departure for the ascent (40% of the studies). The participants in all these studies reached a final altitude of between 3500 and 5500 metres above sea level. Most of the studies did not provide clear information on how they were funded (55% of studies). Thirty additional studies were classified as either ongoing (14 studies), or awaiting classification (16 studies), and they will be considered in future versions of this suite of three reviews as appropriate. 
Key results 
The evidence for any benefit of the various strategies is inconclusive, and even contradictory among the included studies. 
In three studies comparing normal levels of oxygen with low oxygen levels as a way of acclimatization before leaving for high altitudes, we found no differences in the risk of developing acute mountain sickness (3 trials, 140 participants; low‐quality evidence). Adverse events were not reported, nor were high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) or pulmonary oedema (HAPE). 
Ginkgo biloba was compared with taking an inactive placebo in seven studies (523 participants) looking at acute mountain sickness. There was no difference between ginkgo biloba and placebo in terms of the risk of developing HACE (3 studies, 371 participants), or in the risk of developing tingling or pricking, often described as 'pins and needles', as a side effect of treatment (2 studies, 352 participants). No HAPE events were reported (3 studies, 371 participants). 
Ginkgo biloba was compared with acetazolamide, which is a drug used to prevent acute mountain sickness, in four studies (397 participants). The findings differed between the studies, and no conclusions could be drawn. Acetazolamide increased the risk of developing pins and needles in two studies (354 participants). No HAPE or HACE events were reported. Overall, the limited information on the safety of the various interventions means that their safety remains unclear. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was low to very low. We could not obtain the full text reports of some of the studies we had identified, which limited the number of studies included in the review. Many of the studies had small numbers of participants; and for some outcomes few events occurred so that any findings were uncertain. Additional research is needed to clarify the effectiveness and safety of the various strategies to reduce HAI.

Review question 
We examined the effect of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen, for people with acute low back pain. Acute low back pain is defined as the presence of pain in the back, below the ribs and above the buttocks, for under 12 weeks. We compared NSAIDs to placebo, paracetamol, other NSAIDs, other drugs, and non‐drug treatments. 
Background 
Acute low back pain is common, and causes pain and disability. Physicians often prescribe NSAIDs to treat acute low back pain. Different types of NSAIDs are available, both over‐the‐counter and as prescription drugs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials that were published or registered before 7 January 2020. We included 32 trials with 5356 participants. Trial participants were 16 to 78 years old and had acute low back pain. Study length varied from one day to six months. The studies took place in many different countries. More than half of the studies was done in Europe and North‐America. 
Key results 
NSAIDs were slightly more effective than placebo for pain reduction in the first three weeks. On average, the pain intensity decreased by 7.3 points on a 100‐point scale. This means there was a small difference between the two treatments, but it was not clinically relevant. People receiving NSAIDs also scored 2.0 points better on a 24‐point disability scale than those receiving placebo. This is unlikely to be of real‐world benefit. There was a similar number of side effects between people receiving NSAIDs and people receiving placebo. However, the type of studies that we investigated are not designed to find side effects. Therefore, we should be careful about drawing conclusions based upon these findings. 
We also compared two different types of NSAIDs; non‐selective NSAIDs versus COX‐2 inhibitors. We found no clear differences in effect. There was also a similar number of reported side effects of the digestive system, such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, or stomach symptoms. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing short‐term pain, and high quality evidence that they are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing disability in acute low back pain. The magnitude of the effect is very small.

### Pain Meds for Quick Back Pain

**Rationale**

Many people get back pain. This pain is below your ribs and above your bottom. It can last a short time, less than 12 weeks. This is called acute low back pain. This pain makes it hard to move and do daily tasks.

Doctors often give pain medicines called NSAIDs. NSAIDs help with pain and swelling. Common NSAIDs are ibuprofen and naproxen. You can buy some NSAIDs without a prescription. Others need a doctor's note.

We wanted to see if NSAIDs really help with back pain. We looked at how well they work. We also checked if they cause problems. We thought NSAIDs might help people feel better.

**Trial Design**

We looked at many past studies. These studies were called randomized controlled trials. This means people were put into groups by chance. Some got NSAIDs, others got a fake pill (placebo). Some got other pain pills like paracetamol.

We found 32 studies. These studies included 5356 people. All these people had acute low back pain. Their ages ranged from 16 to 78 years old.

The studies lasted for different amounts of time. Some were just one day. Others lasted up to six months. The studies happened in many parts of the world. Most were in Europe and North America.

**Results**

NSAIDs helped a little bit with pain. People took NSAIDs for up to three weeks. Their pain went down a little more than those who took a fake pill. On a scale of 100, pain went down by 7 points. This small change may not feel much better in real life.

NSAIDs also helped a little with daily tasks. People on NSAIDs could do things a bit easier. But this small change may not be a big help in daily life.

People who took NSAIDs had side effects. People who took the fake pill also had side effects. The number of side effects was about the same. But these studies were not made to find all side effects. So, we cannot say much about side effects from these studies.

We also looked at two types of NSAIDs. We saw no big difference between them. They caused about the same stomach issues. These include belly pain or feeling sick.

In short, NSAIDs help a little with short-term back pain. They also help a little with moving better. But the help is very small. It might not make a big difference for people.","Anti‐inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain

10.1002-14651858.CD013433.pub2,"Background
Stem cell therapy (SCT) has been proposed as an alternative treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), nonetheless its effectiveness remains debatable. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of SCT in adults with non‐ischaemic DCM.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase for relevant trials in November 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers in May 2020. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing stem/progenitor cells with no cells in adults with non‐ischaemic DCM. We included co‐interventions such as the administration of stem cell mobilizing agents. Studies were classified and analysed into three categories according to the comparison intervention, which consisted of no intervention/placebo, cell mobilization with cytokines, or a different mode of SCT. 
The first two comparisons (no cells in the control group) served to assess the efficacy of SCT while the third (different mode of SCT) served to complement the review with information about safety and other information of potential utility for a better understanding of the effects of SCT. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened all references for eligibility, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. We undertook a quantitative evaluation of data using random‐effects meta‐analyses. We evaluated heterogeneity using the I² statistic. We could not explore potential effect modifiers through subgroup analyses as they were deemed uninformative due to the scarce number of trials available. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We created summary of findings tables using GRADEpro GDT. We focused our summary of findings on all‐cause mortality, safety, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), performance status, and major adverse cardiovascular events. 
Main results
We included 13 RCTs involving 762 participants (452 cell therapy and 310 controls). Only one study was at low risk of bias in all domains. There were many shortcomings in the publications that did not allow a precise assessment of the risk of bias in many domains. Due to the nature of the intervention, the main source of potential bias was lack of blinding of participants (performance bias). Frequently, the format of the continuous data available was not ideal for use in the meta‐analysis and forced us to seek strategies for transforming data in a usable format. 
We are uncertain whether SCT reduces all‐cause mortality in people with DCM compared to no intervention/placebo (mean follow‐up 12 months) (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.31; I² = 0%; studies = 7, participants = 361; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether SCT increases the risk of procedural complications associated with cells injection in people with DCM (data could not be pooled; studies = 7; participants = 361; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether SCT improves HRQoL (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.62, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.23; I² = 72%; studies = 5, participants = 272; very low‐certainty evidence) and functional capacity (6‐minute walk test) (mean difference (MD) 70.12 m, 95% CI –5.28 to 145.51; I² = 87%; studies = 5, participants = 230; very low‐certainty evidence). SCT may result in a slight functional class (New York Heart Association) improvement (data could not be pooled; studies = 6, participants = 398; low‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported major adverse cardiovascular events as defined in our protocol. SCT may not increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (data could not be pooled; studies = 8, participants = 504; low‐certainty evidence). 
When comparing SCT to cell mobilization with granulocyte‐colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF), we are uncertain whether SCT reduces all‐cause mortality (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.31; I² = 39%; studies = 3, participants = 195; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether SCT increases the risk of procedural complications associated with cells injection (studies = 1, participants = 60; very low‐certainty evidence). SCT may not improve HRQoL (MD 4.61 points, 95% CI –5.62 to 14.83; studies = 1, participants = 22; low‐certainty evidence). SCT may improve functional capacity (6‐minute walk test) (MD 140.14 m, 95% CI 119.51 to 160.77; I² = 0%; studies = 2, participants = 155; low‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported MACE as defined in our protocol or ventricular arrhythmia. 
The most commonly reported outcomes across studies were based on physiological measures of cardiac function where there were some beneficial effects suggesting potential benefits of SCT in people with non‐ischaemic DCM. However, it is unclear if this intermediate effects translates into clinical benefits for these patients. 
With regard to specific aspects related to the modality of cell therapy and its delivery, uncertainties remain as subgroup analyses could not be performed as planned, making it necessary to wait for the publication of several studies that are currently in progress before any firm conclusion can be reached. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether SCT in people with DCM reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality and procedural complications, improves HRQoL, and performance status (exercise capacity). SCT may improve functional class (NYHA), compared to usual care (no cells). 
Similarly, when compared to G‐CSF, we are also uncertain whether SCT in people with DCM reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality although some studies within this comparison observed a favourable effect that should be interpreted with caution. SCT may not improve HRQoL but may improve to some extent performance status (exercise capacity). Very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding procedural complications. These suggested beneficial effects of SCT, although uncertain due to the very low certainty of the evidence, are accompanied by favourable effects on some physiological measures of cardiac function. 
Presently, the most effective mode of administration of SCT and the population that could benefit the most is unclear. Therefore, it seems reasonable that use of SCT in people with DCM is limited to clinical research settings. Results of ongoing studies are likely to modify these conclusions. 
","## Stem Cells for a Weak Heart Muscle: What We Know So Far

### Rationale

Your heart is a strong pump. It sends blood all over your body. Sometimes, the heart muscle gets big and weak. This is called dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). When your heart is weak, it cannot pump blood well. This can make you feel tired and out of breath. It can also cause other serious health problems.

Doctors want to find new ways to help people with a weak heart muscle. Stem cells are special cells. They can grow into different kinds of cells. Some people think stem cells might help fix a weak heart. They might help the heart muscle get stronger.

This study looked at many other studies. We wanted to see if stem cells really help people with DCM. We also wanted to see if stem cells are safe. This information is important. It helps doctors decide how to treat patients.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many past studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means some people got stem cells. Other people got no stem cells, or a fake treatment. This helps us see if the stem cells made a difference.

The studies included adults with a weak heart muscle. Their heart problem was not due to blocked blood vessels. This study included 13 other studies. A total of 762 people were in these studies. About 452 people got stem cells. About 310 people did not.

We looked at how long people lived. We also checked for bad side effects. We wanted to see if people felt better. We checked how well they could do daily tasks. We looked at how far they could walk in six minutes. Most studies followed people for about one year.

### Results

We looked at many facts from all the studies. We found that we are not sure if stem cells help people live longer. We also are not sure if stem cells cause problems when they are put into the heart.

Some studies suggested that stem cells might help people feel better. They might help people walk further. But we are not very sure about these findings. More research is needed to confirm this.

We also compared stem cells to another treatment. This treatment uses a medicine to make more stem cells in the body. We are not sure if stem cells are better than this medicine.

Some tests showed that stem cells might help the heart work a little better. But we do not know if these small changes really help people in their daily lives. We are not sure if people feel much better.

Many studies did not have perfect designs. It was hard to tell if the stem cells were truly helping. We need more and better studies. These studies are happening now. They will help us learn more.

Right now, doctors should only use stem cells for weak heart muscle in research. We need more facts to know who might get the most help. We also need to know the best way to give stem cells.","Bone marrow cells in non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy
Review question 
Are bone marrow cells safe and effective as a treatment for non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)? 
Background 
DCM is a disorder of the heart muscle with heart dilation (heart muscle becomes stretched) and impaired contraction, in the absence of high blood pressure, damaged or diseased heart valves, or heart disease present at birth or related to myocardial infarction (heart attack). The current standard of treatment is based on medicines and cardiac devices. However, DCM is still one of the leading causes of heart transplantation in adults. 
Stem cells are special cells produced in the bone marrow that are able to develop into many different cell types. Giving stem cells directly into the heart muscle has been proposed as an alternative treatment to reduce or stop further deterioration in heart function in people with DCM. 
Study characteristics 
We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the infusion of bone marrow‐derived stem cells into the heart muscle with the usual‐care (control) treatment in people diagnosed with DCM. We searched multiple databases for trials up to 10 November 2020. 
We included 13 RCTs involving 762 participants (452 receiving stem cell therapy and 310 controls). The trials included people with severe symptoms of ischaemic (following a heart attack) and non‐ischaemic DCM. We selected only the data from non‐ischaemic DCM. 
The studies included an average of 60 people aged about 45 to 58.5 years and 50% to 89% men in each trial. Following therapy, the participants were assessed for six months to five years, with most at one year. One study declared a private funding whereas seven others had public or governmental funding, two had non‐profit funding, and four did not report this information. 
Key results 
SCT versus control: very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding mortality, procedural complications, health‐related quality of life and exercise capacity. Low‐quality evidence suggests that SCT may slightly improve deterioration of heart function and may not increase the risk of abnormal heartbeats in people with DCM. No studies reported other relevant outcomes such as major cardiac adverse events. 
STC plus cytokine versus control: very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding mortality. Low‐quality evidence suggests that SCT plus cytokine may not improve health‐related quality of life but may improve exercise capacity as well as some physiological measures related to cardiac function (although it is unclear to what extent these latter outcomes are associated with relevant clinical benefits for patients). Hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. Very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding procedural complications. No studies reported major cardiac adverse events or abnormal heartbeats. 
Due to the limited number of studies we could not perform analyses to identify which specific features of SCT and clinical characteristics of patients are associated with better results. Thus, more research is needed to establish the role of SCT in the treatment of DCM and the most effective therapies. 
Quality of evidence 
The evidence in this review is of low to very low quality due to the small number of events, results not similar across studies, risk of bias, and issues with study design. Furthermore, the limitations in the reporting of most studies made it difficult to obtain and use the information to reach clearer conclusions.

## Plain Title: Better Surgery for Ovarian Cancer Can Help Women Live Longer

### Rationale

Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that starts in a woman’s ovaries. It is a common cancer in women. This cancer can cause many health problems. It is a big challenge for women who have it.

Doctors try to remove as much of the cancer as possible with surgery. This is called ""cytoreduction."" How much cancer is left after surgery is very important. It tells us how long a woman might live. If less cancer is left, a woman usually lives longer.

But doctors do not always agree on the best way to do this surgery. This study looked at how much cancer should be removed. It aimed to see if better surgery truly helps women live longer and stay healthy. It wanted to know if removing more cancer during surgery makes a real difference.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past medical records. It found 11 studies that fit its needs. These studies included over 100 women each. All women had advanced ovarian cancer. This means their cancer had spread. It was either Stage III or Stage IV.

The studies looked at how long women lived. They also checked how long women lived without their cancer coming back. The study compared women who had more cancer removed to those who had less cancer removed.

Because it looked at old records, this study did not have people join it. It reviewed information that was already there. So, there was no set time for a person to be in the study.

### Results

The study found important things. When all visible cancer was removed, women lived much longer. They also went longer without their cancer coming back. This means a complete cancer removal during surgery is best.

When some cancer was left, but it was very small (less than 1 centimeter), women still did better. They lived longer than women who had bigger pieces of cancer left. So, even if all cancer cannot be removed, making the remaining pieces very small is good.

However, the study also saw a problem. If the leftover cancer was bigger than 2 centimeters, there was not much difference in how long women lived. This suggests that removing as much as possible, or at least leaving very small pieces, is key.

This study shows that removing most or all of the cancer is very good for women. It helps them live longer and healthier. But, because it looked at old records, we need more studies. Future studies should be done in a way that gives clearer answers. They should tell us if it’s the surgery itself or other things that lead to better survival. This will help doctors know the very best way to do these surgeries for women with ovarian cancer.","Clear survival benefit is achieved if all or most (< 1 cm remaining) of the tumour after primary surgical treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer is removed

What is the issue? 
Vaginal births are often associated with some form of trauma to the genital tract, and tears that affect the anal sphincter or mucosa (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears) can cause serious problems. Perineal trauma can occur spontaneously or result from a surgical incision (episiotomy). Different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head, and allow the perineum to stretch slowly to prevent injury. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. The objective of this updated review was to assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence of perineal trauma. This is an update of a review that was published in 2011. 
Why is this important? 
Trauma to the perineum can cause pain and other problems for women after the birth. The damage is described as first‐, second‐, third‐ and fourth‐degree tears – first‐degree tears being the least damage and fourth‐degree tears being the most. Third‐ and fourth‐degree tears, affect the anal sphincter or mucosa, thus causing the most problems. Reducing the use of episiotomies will reduce trauma to the perineum. Also, different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. It is important to know if these do indeed reduce trauma and pain for women. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies in September 2016. Twenty two trials were eligible for inclusion in this updated review but only twenty studies (involving 15,181 women), contributed results to the review. The participants in the studies were women without medical complications who were expecting a vaginal birth. The studies varied in their risk of bias, and the quality of the studies was very low to moderate. 
Hands off (or poised) compared to hands on  
Using 'hands off' the perineum resulted in fewer women having an episiotomy (low‐quality evidence), but made no difference to numbers of women with no tears (moderate‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), or third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There were considerable unexplained differences in results between the four studies. None of the studies provided data on the number of tears requiring suturing. 
Warm compresses versus control (hands off or no warm compress)  
Fewer women in the warm‐compress group experienced third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). A warm compress did not affect numbers of women with intact perineum (moderate‐quality evidence), tears requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compresses increase or reduce the incidence of first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). 
Massage versus control (hands off or routine care)  
There were more women with an intact perineum in the perineal massage group (low‐quality evidence), and fewer women with third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). Massage did not appear to make a difference to women with perineal trauma requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (very low‐quality evidence). 
Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care  
One small study found that women who had Ritgen's manoeuvre had fewer first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), but more second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in terms of the number of third‐ or fourth‐degree tears, or episiotomies (both low‐quality evidence). 
What does this mean? 
We found that massage and warm compresses may reduce serious perineal trauma (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears). Hands‐off techniques may reduce the number of episiotomies but it was not clear that these techniques had a beneficial effect on other perineal trauma. There remains uncertainty about the value of other techniques to reduce damage to the perineum during childbirth. 
More research is necessary, to evaluate different perineal techniques and to answer questions about how to minimise perineal trauma. There is insufficient evidence on women's experiences and views (only one included study collected information on this). It is important for future research to ascertain whether these interventions are acceptable to women.

### Plain Title
Helping Women Avoid Tears During Childbirth

### Rationale
Many women have some tears when they give birth. These tears can happen in the area between the vagina and the anus. This area is called the perineum. Some tears are small and heal fast. Other tears are big and can cause big problems.

Big tears can affect the muscles that control bowel movements. These are called third- and fourth-degree tears. They can cause pain and other issues for women after giving birth. Sometimes, doctors make a cut called an episiotomy. This can also cause problems.

Midwives and birth helpers use different ways to help babies be born slowly. They want the skin to stretch over time. This might help stop tears. These ways include massage and warm cloths. This study looked at these methods. We wanted to see if they truly help women avoid tears and pain.

### Trial Design
How is this study designed? This study looked at past studies. These studies checked different ways to help avoid tears. We looked for studies up to September 2016.

The studies included women who had a vaginal birth. These women did not have other health problems. In total, 20 studies gave us results. They included 15,181 women.

The studies compared different methods. For example, some compared using a warm cloth to not using one. Other studies compared massage to usual care. Some studies looked at how much the helpers touched the birthing area. We looked at how these methods affected tears.

### Results
What were the main results of the study? We found some important things.

**Warm Compresses:** Using a warm cloth helped. Fewer women had big tears (third- or fourth-degree tears). Warm cloths did not change other types of tears.

**Massage:** Massage also helped. More women had no tears at all. Fewer women had big tears (third- or fourth-degree tears). Massage did not change other types of tears.

**""Hands-off"" Care:** When helpers used a ""hands-off"" approach, fewer women had an episiotomy. This is a cut made by the doctor. But this method did not seem to change how many women had other types of tears.

**Other Methods:** One other method called Ritgen's manoeuvre was studied. It seemed to cause more small tears. It also caused fewer very small tears.

In short, massage and warm cloths may help stop big tears. The ""hands-off"" method may mean fewer women get a cut from the doctor. We need more studies to be sure. We also need to ask women what they think of these methods. This will help us learn the best ways to keep women safe and well.","Perineal techniques during the second stage of labour for reducing perineal trauma

Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) are severe and potentially sight‐threatening allergic eye diseases characterised by chronic inflammation of the ocular surface. Both topical and systemic treatments are used. This Cochrane Review focuses on systemic treatments. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of systemic treatments (including corticosteroids, NSAIDS, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies), alone or in combination, compared to placebo or other systemic or topical treatment, for severe AKC and VKC in children and young people up to the age of 16 years. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. We last searched the electronic databases on 17 February 2020. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that involved systemic treatments in children aged up to 16 years with a clinical diagnosis of AKC or VKC. We planned to include studies that evaluated a single systemic medication versus placebo, and studies that compared two or multiple active treatments. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods expected by Cochrane.
Main results
No trial met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane Review. No RCTs have been carried out on this topic. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently no evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the safety and efficacy of systemic treatments for VKC and AKC. Trials are required to test efficacy and safety of current and future treatments. Outcome measures need to be developed which can capture both objective clinical and patient‐reported aspects of the condition and treatments.

Looking for the Best Way to Treat Bad Eye Allergies in Kids

### Rationale
Some kids get very bad eye allergies. These are called AKC and VKC. They make eyes red, itchy, and hurt a lot. These can even make it hard to see. It is a big problem for many children.

Doctors use different ways to treat these eye problems. Some are eye drops. Others are pills or shots. These are called systemic treatments. They work throughout the body.

This study wants to find out which pills or shots work best. We want to know if they are safe for kids. We need to find good ways to help children with these eye issues. These medicines could make their eyes feel much better.

### Trial Design
This study looks for other studies. It wants to find strong studies about eye allergy treatments. It looks for studies where doctors give kids different medicines. Some kids might get a sugar pill. This helps us know if the medicine works.

The study looked for kids up to 16 years old. They had to have AKC or VKC. We wanted to see if pills or shots helped them. We looked for studies that compared one medicine to no medicine. We also looked for studies that compared different medicines.

We looked in many places for these studies. We searched in big medical databases. We looked for studies written in any language. We kept searching until early 2020. This study did not put people into a trial. It only looked at other trials.

### Results
We looked for many studies. But we did not find any studies that fit our rules. No strong studies have looked at pills or shots for these bad eye allergies in kids. This means we do not know which treatments are best. We also do not know if they are safe for children.

This shows that we need more research. Doctors need to do studies on these medicines. They need to find out what works and what does not. They also need to ask kids how they feel. This will help us find the best ways to treat these eye problems. Right now, we do not have clear answers from good studies.","What medicines, taken by mouth or given as an injection, work best to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people under 16 years old? 
What is allergic eye disease? An immune response is how the body recognises and defends itself against substances that appear harmful, usually by producing specific blood proteins (antibodies) against them. An allergy is a reaction by the body's immune system to a particular substance (an allergen) that is usually harmless, such as grass or tree pollens in the air. Different allergens affect different tissues, and their effects can be mild or serious. 
In the eye, allergic reactions can cause conjunctivitis: the conjunctiva (the tissue covering the white of the eye and lining the inside of the eyelids) becomes swollen and sore. Severe allergic eye disease may also affect the cornea (the clear, front part of the eye), causing keratoconjunctivitis. 
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) are rare types of severe allergic eye disease. VKC usually develops in children and is more common in boys; AKC can affect children and adults. These conditions usually affect both eyes and make them red, itchy, sore, watery and sensitive to light. Both conditions can damage the cornea, which can affect eyesight and lead to blindness. Treatment is essential to save eyesight. 
Treatments for severe allergic eye disease Both conditions are treated with medicines that try to block the allergic reaction and reduce swelling. Symptoms may get better with medicines given as eye drops, but if these don't work, other medicines may be taken by mouth or given as an injection (systemic medicines). Systemic medicines that are often used to treat severe allergic eye disease include ones that target or suppress the immune response, such as anti‑inflammatory medicines and antibodies. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to find out which systemic treatments work best for severe allergic eye disease in children and young people. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that looked at systemic medicines to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people under 16 years of age. We wanted to find studies that compared a single medicine with a placebo (dummy) medicine, or studies that compared two or more medicines against each other. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
Search date: We searched for evidence published up to 17 February 2020. 
What we foundWe found no randomised controlled studies in children and young people with severe allergic eye disease treated by systemic medicines. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence from randomised controlled studies about how well systemic medicines work for severe allergic eye disease in children and young people aged under 16 years. 
Research is needed to investigate how well systemic medicines work to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people, and to learn about any unwanted effects these medicines might cause.

The balance of benefits and harms associated with enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia is not clear. An increasing number of guidelines highlight the lack of evidenced benefit and potential risks of enteral tube feeding. In some areas of the world, the use of enteral tube feeding is decreasing, and in other areas it is increasing. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia who develop problems with eating and swallowing or who have reduced food and fluid intake. 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases and two trials registers on 14 April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or controlled non‐randomised studies. Our population of interest was adults of any age with a diagnosis of primary degenerative dementia of any cause, with severe cognitive and functional impairment, and poor nutritional intake. Eligible studies evaluated the effectiveness and complications of enteral tube feeding via a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, or via jejunal post‐pyloric feeding, in comparison with standard care or enhanced standard care, such as an intervention to promote oral intake. Our primary outcomes were survival time, quality of life, and pressure ulcers. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors screened citations and two review authors assessed full texts of potentially eligible studies against inclusion criteria. One review author extracted data, which were then checked independently by a second review author. We used the 'Risk Of Bias In Non‐randomised Studies of Interventions' (ROBINS‐I) tool to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. Risk of confounding was assessed against a pre‐agreed list of key potential confounding variables. Our primary outcomes were survival time, quality of life, and pressure ulcers. Results were not suitable for meta‐analysis, so we presented them narratively. We presented results separately for studies of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding, nasogastric tube feeding and studies using mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding methods. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall certainty of the evidence related to each outcome for each study. 
Main results
We found no eligible RCTs. We included fourteen controlled, non‐randomised studies. All the included studies compared outcomes between groups of people who had been assigned to enteral tube feeding or oral feeding by prior decision of a healthcare professional. Some studies controlled for a range of confounding factors, but there were high or very high risks of bias due to confounding in all studies, and high or critical risks of selection bias in some studies. 
Four studies with 36,816 participants assessed the effect of PEG feeding on survival time. None found any evidence of effects on survival time (low‐certainty evidence). 
Three of four studies using mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding methods in 310 participants (227 enteral tube feeding, 83 no enteral tube feeding) found them to be associated with longer survival time. The fourth study (1386 participants: 135 enteral tube feeding, 1251 no enteral tube feeding) found no evidence of an effect. The certainty of this body of evidence is very low. 
One study of PEG feeding (4421 participants: 1585 PEG, 2836 no enteral tube feeding) found PEG feeding increased the risk of pressure ulcers (moderate‐certainty evidence). Two of three studies reported an increase in the number of pressure ulcers in those receiving mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding (234 participants: 88 enteral tube feeding, 146 no enteral tube feeding). The third study found no effect (very‐low certainty evidence).  
Two studies of nasogastric tube feeding did not report data on survival time or pressure ulcers. 
None of the included studies assessed quality of life.
Only one study, using mixed methods of enteral tube feeding, reported on pain and comfort, finding no difference between groups. In the same study, a higher proportion of carers reported very heavy burden in the enteral tube feeding group compared to no enteral tube feeding. 
Two studies assessed the effect of nasogastric tube feeding on mortality (236 participants: 144 nasogastric group, 92 no enteral tube feeding). One study of 67 participants (14 nasogastric, 53 no enteral tube feeding) found nasogastric feeding was associated with increased mortality risk. The second study found no difference in mortality between groups. The certainty of this evidence is very low. Results on mortality for those using PEG or mixed methods of enteral tube feeding were mixed and the certainty of evidence was very low. There was some evidence from two studies for enteral tube feeding improving nutritional parameters, but this was very low‐certainty evidence. Five studies reported a variety of harm‐related outcomes with inconsistent results. The balance of evidence suggested increased risk of pneumonia with enteral tube feeding. 
None of the included studies assessed behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence that tube feeding improves survival; improves quality of life; reduces pain; reduces mortality; decreases behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia; leads to better nourishment; improves family or carer outcomes such as depression, anxiety, carer burden, or satisfaction with care; and no indication of harm. We found some evidence that there is a clinically significant risk of pressure ulcers from enteral tube feeding. Future research should focus on better reporting and matching of control and intervention groups, and clearly defined interventions, measuring all the outcomes referred to here.

## Plain Title
Tube Feeding for People with Severe Memory Loss: Does It Help?

## Rationale
People with severe memory loss, also called dementia, often have trouble eating and swallowing. This can make it hard for them to get enough food and water. When this happens, doctors sometimes use a tube to give food and fluids directly into the stomach. This is called tube feeding.

But doctors are not sure if tube feeding truly helps people with severe memory loss. Some guidelines suggest it might not be helpful and could even cause problems. We wanted to see if tube feeding helps people live longer, feel better, or prevents sores. This study looked at past research to understand if tube feeding is a good choice.

## Trial Design
This study looked at other studies that compared tube feeding to regular care. Regular care means people got food and drinks by mouth, sometimes with extra help to eat.

The studies we looked at included adults of any age with severe memory loss. These people also had serious problems with thinking and doing daily tasks. They were not eating or drinking enough.

We wanted to see if tube feeding, through a tube in the nose or stomach, worked better than regular care. We looked at how long people lived, their quality of life, and if they got pressure sores.

## Results
We did not find any perfect studies that set people randomly to tube feeding or regular care. We looked at 14 studies that had already decided who got tube feeding and who did not.

For many studies, it was hard to tell if tube feeding truly made a difference because other factors could have played a role. It was hard to compare groups fairly.

We found no clear proof that tube feeding helped people with severe memory loss live longer. Some studies suggested a small link to longer life with some types of tube feeding, but this was not strong evidence.

One study found that tube feeding through the stomach might increase the chance of getting pressure sores. Other studies also showed a higher number of sores with tube feeding.

No studies looked at how tube feeding affected people's quality of life. One study found no difference in pain or comfort. This study also found that caregivers of people with tube feeding felt more burdened.

For people with tubes in their nose, one study found it might increase the risk of dying, but another study did not.

Overall, we found no strong proof that tube feeding helps people with severe memory loss live longer, feel better, or reduces pain. It also did not seem to help with behavior problems or make people more nourished. There was a risk of pressure sores.

More studies are needed. These new studies should be designed better to compare tube feeding and regular care more fairly. They should also look at how tube feeding affects quality of life and other important outcomes.","Enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia
What are the advantages and problems of tube feeding people with severe dementia?  
Key messages 
Tube feeding may not increase the length of time people with severe dementia live compared to no tube feeding. The risk of developing a pressure sore is probably higher with a feeding tube than with no tube. No studies looked at quality of life.We need more and better studies to investigate tube feeding people with severe dementia. Future studies should focus on a broader range of outcomes including, pain, quality of life and the impact on carers 
What is tube feeding? 
Somebody who can’t eat or drink through their mouth may be given liquid food through a tube into their stomach. This is called enteral tube feeding. The tube passes through their nose into their stomach (a nasogastric tube), or is inserted into the stomach through a small cut in their belly (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or PEG).  
Why is this important for people with dementia? 
People with dementia often have difficulties eating and drinking. During the early stages of dementia, they may forget to eat, chew food without swallowing, or be confused at mealtimes. Some people experience changes in the taste and smell of food. In the later stages of dementia, people often have difficulties swallowing.  It can be difficult to ensure they receive appropriate food and fluids.  
People with severe dementia need full‐time care, and it is often their families who care for them. It is difficult to decide whether or not to tube‐feed someone with dementia because the feeding tube can be uncomfortable or even painful, and may cause other unwanted effects such as pneumonia, worsen bowel or bladder control, as well as bleeding, swelling and infection. People with severe dementia may be confused or distressed by the tube and may try to remove it.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether tube feeding helps people with severe dementia who have problems with eating and swallowing.  
We were interested in the effect of tube feeding on:
how long people lived; 
their quality of life (well‐being); and 
the development or healing of pressure sores (also known as bed sores).
What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated whether: 
PEG compared to no tube; a nasogastric tube compared to no tube; orPEG, nasogastric and other types of tube feeding compared to no tube 
was effective and whether tube feeding caused any unwanted effects in adults of any age with severe dementia and poor intake of food and drink.  
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We included 14 studies that included 49,714 participants. Of these, 6203 were tube‐fed and 43,511 were not. Participants with no feeding tube were given standard care or standard care with extra treatments to encourage eating and drinking. 
Main results 
In people with severe dementia, compared to no tube feeding:
PEG may make no difference to how long people live (4 studies, 36,816 people), and leads to a small increase in the chance of developing pressure sores (1 study, 4421 people). we don’t know if nasogastric tube feeding increases the length of time people live or increases their chance of developing pressure sores, because none of our included studies gave information about these points. Studies of people with either PEG or nasogastric tubes showed tube feeding may increase the length of time people live (4 studies, 1696 people), and may slightly increase the chance of developing pressure sores (3 studies, 351 people).  
None of our included studies reported quality of life.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We have moderate confidence in our finding that pressure ulcers were more common in people who were fed with a PEG tube. However, we have little to very little confidence for our other findings.  
Three main factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Firstly, people in the studies were not randomly placed into different treatment groups. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between people rather than between the treatments. However, due to ethical considerations it would be very difficult to do this in future studies. Secondly, results were very inconsistent across the different studies. Finally, some studies were very small.  
The results of further research could differ from the results of this review.
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 14 April 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013693.pub2,"Background
Globally, children under 15 years represent approximately 12% of new tuberculosis cases, but 16% of the estimated 1.4 million deaths. This higher share of mortality highlights the urgent need to develop strategies to improve case detection in this age group and identify children without tuberculosis disease who should be considered for tuberculosis preventive treatment. One such strategy is systematic screening for tuberculosis in high‐risk groups. 
Objectives
To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the presence of one or more tuberculosis symptoms, or symptom combinations; chest radiography (CXR); Xpert MTB/RIF; Xpert Ultra; and combinations of these as screening tests for detecting active pulmonary childhood tuberculosis in the following groups. 
– Tuberculosis contacts, including household contacts, school contacts, and other close contacts of a person with infectious tuberculosis. 
– Children living with HIV.
– Children with pneumonia.
– Other risk groups (e.g. children with a history of previous tuberculosis, malnourished children). 
– Children in the general population in high tuberculosis burden settings.
Search methods
We searched six databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase, on 14 February 2020 without language restrictions and contacted researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Cross‐sectional and cohort studies where at least 75% of children were aged under 15 years. Studies were eligible if conducted for screening rather than diagnosing tuberculosis. Reference standards were microbiological (MRS) and composite reference standard (CRS), which may incorporate symptoms and CXR. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using QUADAS‐2. We consolidated symptom screens across included studies into groups that used similar combinations of symptoms as follows: one or more of cough, fever, or poor weight gain and one or more of cough, fever, or decreased playfulness. For combination of symptoms, a positive screen was the presence of one or more than one symptom. 
We used a bivariate model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and performed analyses separately by reference standard. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Nineteen studies assessed the following screens: one symptom (15 studies, 10,097 participants); combinations of symptoms (12 studies, 29,889 participants); CXR (10 studies, 7146 participants); and Xpert MTB/RIF (2 studies, 787 participants). Several studies assessed more than one screening test. No studies assessed Xpert Ultra. For 16 studies (84%), risk of bias for the reference standard domain was unclear owing to concern about incorporation bias. Across other quality domains, risk of bias was generally low. 
Symptom screen (verified by CRS) 
One or more of cough, fever, or poor weight gain in tuberculosis contacts (4 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 2% to 13%): pooled sensitivity was 89% (95% CI 52% to 98%; 113 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 69% (95% CI 51% to 83%; 2582 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 339 would be screen‐positive, of whom 294 (87%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (false positives); 661 would be screen‐negative, of whom five (1%) would have pulmonary tuberculosis (false negatives). 
One or more of cough, fever, or decreased playfulness in children aged under five years, inpatient or outpatient (3 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 3% to 13%): sensitivity ranged from 64% to 76% (106 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and specificity from 37% to 77% (2339 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 251 to 636 would be screen‐positive, of whom 219 to 598 (87% to 94%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 364 to 749 would be screen‐negative, of whom 12 to 18 (2% to 3%) would have pulmonary tuberculosis. 
One or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis close contact (World Health Organization four‐symptom screen) in children living with HIV, outpatient (2 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 3% and 8%): pooled sensitivity was 61% (95% CI 58% to 64%; 1219 screens; moderate‐certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 94% (95% CI 86% to 98%; 201,916 screens; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 symptom screens where 50 of the screens are on children with pulmonary tuberculosis, 88 would be screen‐positive, of which 57 (65%) would be on children who do not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 912 would be screen‐negative, of which 19 (2%) would be on children who have pulmonary tuberculosis. 
CXR (verified by CRS) 
CXR with any abnormality in tuberculosis contacts (8 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 2% to 25%): pooled sensitivity was 87% (95% CI 75% to 93%; 232 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 99% (95% CI 68% to 100%; 3281 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children, where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 63 would be screen‐positive, of whom 19 (30%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 937 would be screen‐negative, of whom 6 (1%) would have pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Xpert MTB/RIF (verified by MRS) 
Xpert MTB/RIF, inpatient or outpatient (2 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 1% and 4%): sensitivity was 43% and 100% (16 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and specificity was 99% and 100% (771 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children, where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 31 to 69 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 to 19 (28% to 29%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 931 to 969 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative, of whom 0 to 28 (0% to 3%) would have tuberculosis. 
Studies often assessed more symptoms than those included in the index test and symptom definitions varied. These differences complicated data aggregation and may have influenced accuracy estimates. Both symptoms and CXR formed part of the CRS (incorporation bias), which may have led to overestimation of sensitivity and specificity. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that in children who are tuberculosis contacts or living with HIV, screening tests using symptoms or CXR may be useful, but our review is limited by design issues with the index test and incorporation bias in the reference standard. 
For Xpert MTB/RIF, we found insufficient evidence regarding screening accuracy.
Prospective evaluations of screening tests for tuberculosis in children will help clarify their use. In the meantime, screening strategies need to be pragmatic to address the persistent gaps in prevention and case detection that exist in resource‐limited settings. 
","## Finding TB in Kids: Better Ways to Screen

### Rationale

Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious illness. It causes many deaths in kids under 15. In fact, children make up a large part of all TB deaths. This shows we need better ways to find TB in children. We also need to find kids who do not have TB but could get it. These children should get medicine to stop TB.

One way to find TB is to screen kids who are at high risk. This study looked at different ways to screen children for TB. We want to know if these tests can find TB well. We looked at symptoms, chest X-rays, and a special test called Xpert. These tests could help treat more children and save lives.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past research. It asked: ""How good are different screening tests for TB in children?""

The study looked at research where most kids were under 15. These studies focused on screening for TB, not just finding it in sick kids. The children in these studies were from different groups, such as:
* Kids who spent time with someone who had TB. This includes family or school friends.
* Kids who have HIV.
* Kids with lung sickness.
* Other kids at risk, like those who had TB before or are not eating enough.
* Kids in places where TB is common.

We looked at studies that used different ways to find TB. These included:
* Looking for TB signs, like a cough or fever.
* Taking a picture of the chest (X-ray).
* Using a test called Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra.

We looked at how often these tests correctly found TB. We also checked how often they said someone had TB when they did not. Each child was in the original studies for a short time, just long enough for the screening tests.

### Results

We looked at 19 studies. These studies checked different screening methods.
* Many studies looked at just one TB sign (15 studies, over 10,000 kids).
* Some looked at a mix of signs (12 studies, almost 30,000 kids).
* A few studies used chest X-rays (10 studies, over 7,000 kids).
* A couple of studies used the Xpert MTB/RIF test (2 studies, almost 800 kids). No studies used Xpert Ultra.

**When looking for symptoms:**

* **Cough, fever, or not gaining weight in kids around someone with TB:**
    * This screening found TB in about 9 out of 10 kids who had it.
    * It said 339 out of 1000 kids had TB. But 294 of those 339 did not really have TB.
    * Only 5 out of 1000 kids who had TB were missed by this screen.

* **Cough, fever, or less playfulness in kids under five:**
    * This screen found TB in about 6 to 8 out of 10 kids who had it.
    * It said 251 to 636 out of 1000 kids had TB. But 219 to 598 of those did not really have TB.
    * 12 to 18 out of 1000 kids who had TB were missed.

* **Cough, fever, not gaining weight, or close contact with TB in kids with HIV:**
    * This screen found TB in about 6 out of 10 kids who had it.
    * It said 88 out of 1000 screens were positive. But 57 of those 88 were for kids who did not have TB.
    * 19 out of 1000 kids who had TB were missed.

**When using a chest X-ray:**

* **Any unusual finding on X-ray in kids around someone with TB:**
    * This test found TB in about 9 out of 10 kids who had it.
    * It said 63 out of 1000 kids had TB. But 19 of those 63 did not really have TB.
    * Only 6 out of 1000 kids who had TB were missed.

**When using the Xpert MTB/RIF test:**

* This test found TB in about 4 to 10 out of 10 kids who had it.
* It said 31 to 69 out of 1000 kids had TB. But 9 to 19 of those did not really have TB.
* 0 to 28 out of 1000 kids who had TB were missed.
* We need more studies to be sure about this test.

**What we learned:**

Looking at symptoms or using a chest X-ray can be helpful for finding TB in kids. This is true for children who have been near someone with TB or who have HIV. But we need more studies to be very sure. Some past studies had problems that make it hard to be fully certain of the results.

It is important to find better ways to screen children for TB. This is especially true in places where it is hard to get medical care. We need to keep working to find and stop TB in children.","Screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children
Why is improving screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in children important? 
Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Most children who die from tuberculosis are never diagnosed or treated. Screening may be useful to identify children with possible tuberculosis and refer them for further testing. As well, screening could be used to identify children without tuberculosis, who should be considered for preventive treatment. A false‐positive result means that children may undergo unnecessary testing and treatment and may not receive preventive treatment promptly. A false‐negative result means that children have tuberculosis, but may miss further testing to confirm the diagnosis. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children in high‐risk groups, such as children with HIV and close contacts of people with tuberculosis. 
What was studied in this review? 
Screening tests were: one tuberculosis symptom; one or more of a combination of tuberculosis symptoms; the World Health Organization (WHO) four‐symptom screen (one or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis contact) in children with HIV, recommended at each healthcare visit; chest radiography (CXR); and Xpert MTB/RIF. 
What are the main results in this review? 
Nineteen studies assessed the following screening tests: one symptom (15 studies, 10,097 participants); more than one symptom (12 studies, 29,889 participants); CXR (10 studies, 7146 participants); and Xpert MTB/RIF (two studies, 787 participants). 
Symptom screening 
For every 1000 children screened, if 50 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard: 
One or more of cough, fever, or poor weight gain in tuberculosis contacts (composite reference standard (CRS) (4 studies) 
– 339 would screen positive, of whom 294 (87%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 661 would screen negative, of whom 5 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
One or more of cough, fever, or decreased playfulness in children under five, inpatient or outpatient (CRS) (3 studies) 
– 251 to 636 would screen positive, of whom 219 to 598 (87% to 94%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 364 to 749 would screen negative, of whom 12 to 18 (2% to 3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). 
One or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis close contact (WHO four‐symptom screen) in children with HIV, outpatient (CRS) (2 studies) 
– 88 would screen positive, of which 57 (65%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive).
– 912 would screen negative, of which 19 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
Abnormal CXR in tuberculosis contacts (CRS) (8 studies) 
– 63 would screen positive, of whom 19 (30%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive).
– 937 would screen negative, of whom 6 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
Xpert MTB/RIF in children, inpatient or outpatient microbiologic reference standard (MRS) (2 studies) 
– 31 to 69 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 to 19 (28% to 29%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 931 to 969 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative, of whom 0 to 28 (0% to 3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
Diagnosing tuberculosis in children is difficult. This may lead to screening tests appearing more or less accurate than they actually are. For Xpert MTB/RIF, there were few studies and children tested to be confident about results. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Children at risk for pulmonary tuberculosis. Results likely do not apply to children in the general population. Studies mainly took place in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis. 
What are the implications of this review? 
In children who are tuberculosis contacts or living with HIV, screening tests using symptoms or CXR may be useful. However, symptoms and CXR formed part of the reference standard, which may falsely elevate the accuracy of the results. We urgently need better screening tests for tuberculosis in children to better identify children who should be considered for tuberculosis preventive treatment and to increase the timeliness of treatment in those with tuberculosis disease. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
To 14 February 2020.

Warfarin is used as an oral anticoagulant. However, there is wide variation in patient response to warfarin dose. This variation, as well as the necessity of keeping within a narrow therapeutic range, means that selection of the correct warfarin dose at the outset of treatment is not straightforward. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of different initiation doses of warfarin in terms of time in‐range, time to INR in‐range and effect on serious adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, DARE and the NHS Health economics database on The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to April 2012) and EMBASE (1974 to April 2012). 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials which compared different initiation regimens of warfarin.
Data collection and analysis
Review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Authors also assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. 
Main results
We identified 12 studies of patients commencing warfarin for inclusion in the review. The overall risk of bias was found to be variable, with most studies reporting adequate methods for randomisation but only two studies reporting adequate data on allocation concealment. Four studies (355 patients) compared 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses. All four studies reported INR in‐range by day five. Although there was notable heterogeneity, pooling of these four studies showed no overall difference between 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77, P = 0.46, I2 = 83%). Two of these studies used two consecutive INRs in‐range as the outcome and showed no difference between a 5 mg and 10 mg dose by day five (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19, P = 0.37, I2 = 22%); two other studies used a single INR in‐range as the outcome and showed a benefit for the 10 mg initiation dose by day 5 (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21, P = 0.05, I2 = 72%). Two studies compared a 5 mg dose to other doses: a 2.5 mg initiation dose took longer to achieve the therapeutic range (2.7 versus 2.0 days; P < 0.0001), but those receiving a calculated initiation dose achieved a target range quicker (4.2 days versus 5 days, P = 0.007). Two studies compared age adjusted doses to 10 mg initiation doses. More elderly patients receiving an age adjusted dose achieved a stable INR compared to those receiving a 10 mg initial dose (and Fennerty regimen). Four studies used genotype guided dosing in one arm of each trial. Three studies reported no overall differences; the fourth study, which reported that the genotype group spent significantly more time in‐range (P < 0.001), had a control group whose INRs were significantly lower than expected. No clear impacts from adverse events were found in either arm to make an overall conclusion. 
Authors' conclusions
The studies in this review compared loading doses in several different situations. There is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate, leading to fewer high INRs. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype guided initiation. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study:

### **Finding the Best Starting Dose for Warfarin**

**Rationale**

Warfarin is a medicine that helps thin your blood. It stops blood clots from forming. This is very important for many people. But finding the right dose for each person is hard.

Too much warfarin can cause serious bleeding. Too little warfarin can mean blood clots still form. Doctors need to find a dose that is just right. This right dose keeps your blood within a safe range. This is called the ""therapeutic range.""

This study looked at different ways to start warfarin. We wanted to see which way works best. We wanted to find a way to get people into the safe range faster. We also wanted to see if some ways caused fewer side effects. This study helps doctors give the best care from the start.

**Trial Design**

This study looked at many other studies. We gathered all studies that compared different starting doses of warfarin. These were studies where people were chosen by chance for different doses. This is like flipping a coin to decide. This helps make the study fair.

We searched big medical databases. These databases hold lots of research papers. We looked for papers up to April 2012. We found 12 studies that met our rules. These studies included people who were just starting warfarin. We looked at how long it took them to reach the safe range. We also checked for any serious problems. We wanted to see if certain doses were better or worse.

**Results**

We looked at 12 studies. These studies looked at how people start warfarin.

Four studies compared a 5 mg dose to a 10 mg dose. Both doses got people into the safe range by day five. There was no big difference between the two doses overall.

Two studies found that a 10 mg dose might be better by day five. But two other studies found no real difference.

Other studies looked at different doses. One study found that a 2.5 mg dose took longer to work. It took 2.7 days to reach the safe range. A 5 mg dose took 2.0 days. Another study showed a special calculated dose worked faster. It took 4.2 days instead of 5 days.

Some studies looked at older patients. They found that lower doses were better for older people. These lower doses helped them reach a stable, safe range. It also led to fewer times when their blood was too thin.

Some studies tried using a gene test to pick the dose. They looked at people's genes to decide the best dose. Three of these studies found no clear benefit from gene testing. One study said gene testing helped. But the group they compared it to had very low numbers. This means that part of the study might not be clear.

We did not find clear proof that one dose caused more serious side effects than another.

So, for older patients, a lower starting dose might be safer. It can help them avoid blood that is too thin. But for most people, we still do not know if a 5 mg or 10 mg starting dose is better. There is not enough proof to say that gene tests help choose the first dose. We need more research to find the very best way to start warfarin for everyone.","The optimal warfarin dose for patients beginning therapy
Warfarin is commonly prescribed to prevent blot clots in patients with medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation, heart valve replacement or previous blood clots. Warfarin is an effective treatment which has been used for many years but needs to be closely monitored, especially at the beginning of treatment, as there is a wide variation in response to dose. Monitoring of the response to dose is done using an International Normalized Ratio (INR) and it is important that patients remain within a narrow range (typically 2 to 3 INR) due to the need to balance the goal of preventing blood clots with the risk of causing excessive bleeding. 
This review included 12 randomised controlled trials comparing different warfarin doses given to patients beginning warfarin treatment. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias so the results were interpreted with caution. 
Those trials that were included compared loading doses in several different situations. The review authors divided the trials into four categories, 5 mg versus 10 mg initial doses (four studies), 5 mg versus other doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus age adjusted doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus genotype adjusted doses (four studies). 
The review authors concluded that there is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype adjusted dosing. We also found no data to suggest that any one method was safer than another.

Ultrasound examination of pregnancy before 24 weeks gestation may lead to more accurate dating and earlier diagnosis of pathology, but may also give false reassurance. It can be used to monitor development or diagnose conditions of an unborn baby. This review compares the effect of routine or universal, ultrasound examination, performed before 24 completed weeks' gestation, with selective or no ultrasound examination.  
Objectives
To assess the effect of routine pregnancy ultrasound before 24 weeks as part of a screening programme, compared to selective ultrasound or no ultrasound, on the early diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy location, termination for fetal congenital abnormality, multiple pregnancy, maternal outcomes and later fetal compromise. 
To assess the effect of first trimester (before 14 weeks) and second trimester (14 to 24 weeks) ultrasound, separately. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 11 August 2020. We also examined the reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs and RCTs published in abstract form. We included all trials with pregnant women who had routine or revealed ultrasound versus selective ultrasound, no ultrasound, or concealed ultrasound, before 24 weeks' gestation. All eligible studies were screened for scientific integrity and trustworthiness. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, extracted data and checked extracted data for accuracy. Two review authors independently used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome 
Main results
Our review included data from 13 RCTs including 85,265 women. The review included four comparisons. Four trials were assessed to be at low risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation concealment and two as high risk. The nature of the intervention made it impossible to blind women and staff providing care to treatment allocation.  Sample attrition was low in the majority of trials and outcome data were available for most women. Many trials were conducted before it was customary for trials to be registered and protocols published. 
First trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: four studies, 1791 women, from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). 
First trimester scans probably reduce short‐term maternal anxiety about pregnancy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; moderate‐certainty evidence). We do not have information on whether the reduction was sustained.  
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of first trimester scans on perinatal loss (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73; 648 participants; one study; low‐certainty evidence) or induction of labour for post‐maturity (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.37; 1474 participants; three studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
The effect of routine first trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or termination of pregnancy for fetal abnormality was not reported. 
Second trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: seven studies, 36,053 women, from Finland, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and the US. 
Second trimester scans probably make little difference to perinatal loss (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.20; 17,918 participants, three studies; moderate‐certainty evidence) or intrauterine fetal death (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.42; 29,584 participants, three studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
Second trimester scans may reduce induction of labour for post‐maturity (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73; 24,174 participants, six studies; low‐certainty evidence), presumably by more accurate dating. 
Routine second trimester ultrasound may improve detection of multiple pregnancy (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16; 274 participants, five studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
Routine second trimester ultrasound may increase detection of major fetal abnormality before 24 weeks (RR 3.45, 95% CI 1.67 to 7.12; 387 participants, two studies; low‐certainty evidence) and probably increases the number of women terminating pregnancy for major anomaly (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.93; 26,893 participants, four studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Long‐term follow‐up of children exposed to scans before birth did not indicate harm to children's physical or intellectual development (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.34; 603 participants, one study; low‐certainty evidence). 
The effect of routine second trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or maternal anxiety was not reported. 
Standard care plus two ultrasounds and referral for complications versus standard care: one cluster‐RCT, 47,431 women, from Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan and Zambia. 
This trial included a co‐intervention, training of healthcare workers and referral for complications and was, therefore, assessed separately. 
Standard pregnancy care plus two scans, and training and referral for complications, versus standard care probably makes little difference to whether women with complications give birth in a risk appropriate setting with facilities for caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.19; 11,680 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  The intervention also probably makes little to no difference to low birthweight (< 2500 g) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13; 47,312 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about whether the community intervention (including ultrasound) makes any difference to maternal mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.55; 46,768 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Revealed ultrasound results (communicated to both patient and doctor) versus concealed ultrasound results (blinded to both patient and doctor at any time before 24 weeks): one study, 1095 women, from the UK. 
The evidence was very uncertain for all results relating to revealed versus concealed ultrasound scan (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Early scans probably reduce short term maternal anxiety. 
Later scans may reduce labour induction for post‐maturity. They may improve detection of major fetal abnormalities and increase the number of women who choose termination of pregnancy for this reason. They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies. All these findings accord with observational data.  
Neither type of scan appears to alter other important maternal or fetal outcomes, but our review may underestimate the effect in modern practice because trials were mostly  from relatively early in the development of the technology, and many control participants also had scans. The trials were also underpowered to show an effect on other important maternal or fetal outcomes.

## Checking on Your Baby: Why Early Ultrasounds Matter

### Rationale

When a woman is pregnant, it is important to know how her baby is growing. Sometimes, problems can happen before the baby is born. These problems can be hard on the mother and the baby. One way to check on the baby is with an ultrasound. An ultrasound uses sound waves to make pictures of the baby inside the womb.

We wanted to learn if having an ultrasound early in pregnancy, before 24 weeks, helps. We looked at whether it helps find problems sooner. We also checked if it helps the mother and baby stay healthy. This study is needed to know the best way to use ultrasounds during pregnancy.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies about ultrasounds. These studies included pregnant women. The women had different kinds of ultrasounds. Some had a routine ultrasound early in pregnancy. This means everyone got one. Others only had an ultrasound if there was a problem. Some had no ultrasound at all.

We looked at studies with women of all ages and health. The goal was to see what happens when ultrasounds are used in different ways. We wanted to see how this affects mothers and their babies.

### Results

We looked at 13 studies. These studies included over 85,000 women.

**First Trimester Ultrasounds (before 14 weeks):**
* Early ultrasounds likely make mothers feel less worried in the short term. We do not know if this feeling lasts.
* We are not sure if early ultrasounds change the risk of losing the baby.
* We are not sure if early ultrasounds affect when labor starts for babies born late.

**Second Trimester Ultrasounds (14 to 24 weeks):**
* Later ultrasounds likely do not change the risk of losing the baby.
* Later ultrasounds might help prevent labor from starting too late. This is likely because they help doctors know the baby's due date better.
* Later ultrasounds might help find twin or triplet pregnancies earlier.
* Later ultrasounds might help find serious problems with the baby sooner. This also means more women might choose to end their pregnancy because of these problems.
* Ultrasounds do not seem to harm how children grow or learn later on.

**Two Ultrasounds Plus Extra Care:**
* In some places, women got two ultrasounds and extra help for problems. This care did not change if mothers with problems gave birth in a safer place.
* This care also did not change the number of babies born too small.
* We are not sure if this care changed the risk of mothers dying.

**Sharing Ultrasound Results:**
* We are not sure what happens when mothers and doctors know the ultrasound results compared to when they do not.

**What We Learned:**
Early ultrasounds can make mothers feel less worried. Later ultrasounds can help find problems with the baby sooner. They can also help set the correct due date. Ultrasounds do not seem to hurt children. However, some of the studies were older. Also, many women in the ""no ultrasound"" groups still had ultrasounds for other reasons. This can make it hard to see the full benefits of routine ultrasounds today.","Routine ultrasound scans for babies before 24 weeks of pregnancy.
We set out to determine the effect of routine ultrasound scans early in pregnancy (before 24 weeks). This was in comparison to no scan at all, or scans only when a clinical problem was suspected, such as if the woman has vaginal bleeding, or the baby is at high risk of having an abnormality. 
What is the issue? 
Ultrasound scans send out high‐frequency sound waves directed to the area being examined, and use the reflected sound to make an image. This review considers two types of scan in the first half of pregnancy.  Early scans (before 14 weeks) mainly aim to count the number of babies, to check they are growing in the correct place and check the pregnancy dates.  Later scans, typically done around 18 to 24 weeks, recheck all the above, and also examine the baby's anatomy and whether the placenta (afterbirth) is in the correct place. Both types of scan may cause parental anxiety and a false positive diagnoses could lead to harm. The aim of this review is to compare routine with selective or no scans. 
Why is this important? 
It has been assumed that routine scans before 24 weeks' gestation will result in the earlier detection of problems and improve management and the pregnancy outcome. The alternative is selective scans for specific reasons. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials. We found 13 studies including 85,265 women. We included two main comparisons. 
Routine early scanning  
Ultrasound scans in the first 14 weeks reduced short‐term maternal worries about the pregnancy. There was no evidence of a clear effect on induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue, loss of the baby, early birth (before 34 weeks) or mothers choosing termination for baby abnormalities. 
Routine later scanning  
Second trimester scans, at 14 to 24 weeks, increased detection of baby abnormalities, and more women chose termination of pregnancy for this reason. There was no evidence of an effect on perinatal loss. Induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue was reduced. No studies reported how it affected maternal anxiety. Multiple pregnancies were more likely to be detected by 24 weeks. Long‐term follow‐up of children exposed to these scans did not indicate that they were harmful to children's physical or intellectual development. 
We also found one trial from a group of low and middle income countries, comparing a combination of two scans and specialist training of health professionals and referral of women with complications, with selective scans and routine care. The intervention did not alter the number of women delivering in a hospital with caesarean section facility. Nor did it appear to reduce maternal deaths or the numbers of low‐birthweight babies, although the evidence was very uncertain. 
We also found one trial where all women underwent scans but the results were revealed to the health care professionals in half the cases. This trial showed no important effect of revealing the scan results but the evidence was very uncertain. 
Most studies were carried out relatively early in the development of scan technology and when training in its use was less advanced. In most trials a large proportion of women in the control groups received a scan too. 
What does this mean? 
Early scans probably reduce maternal worries about the baby in the short term. Later scans may reduce labour induction to prevent the pregnancy going overdue. They may also improve detection of major abnormalities in the baby and increase the number of women who choose pregnancy termination for this reason. They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies. All these findings accord with common sense.  
Although neither type of scan appears to alter other important outcomes, our review may underestimate the effect in modern practice because the trials were mostly from relatively early in the development of scan technology, and many participants in the control arms also had scans.

Health services have traditionally been developed to focus on specific diseases or medical specialties. Involving consumers as partners in planning, delivering and evaluating health services may lead to services that are person‐centred and so better able to meet the needs of and provide care for individuals. Globally, governments recommend consumer involvement in healthcare decision‐making at the systems level, as a strategy for promoting person‐centred health services. However, the effects of this 'working in partnership' approach to healthcare decision‐making are unclear. Working in partnership is defined here as collaborative relationships between at least one consumer and health provider, meeting jointly and regularly in formal group formats, to equally contribute to and collaborate on health service‐related decision‐making in real time. In this review, the terms 'consumer' and 'health provider' refer to partnership participants, and 'health service user' and 'health service provider' refer to trial participants. 
This review of effects of partnership interventions was undertaken concurrently with a Cochrane Qualitative Evidence Synthesis (QES) entitled Consumers and health providers working in partnership for the promotion of person‐centred health services: a co‐produced qualitative evidence synthesis. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership, as an intervention to promote person‐centred health services. 
Search methods
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases from 2000 to April 2019; PROQUEST Dissertations and Theses Global from 2016 to April 2019; and grey literature and online trial registries from 2000 until September 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster‐RCTs of ‘working in partnership’ interventions meeting these three criteria: both consumer and provider participants meet; they meet jointly and regularly in formal group formats; and they make actual decisions that relate to the person‐centredness of health service(s). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened most titles and abstracts. One review author screened a subset of titles and abstracts (i.e. those identified through clinical trials registries searches, those classified by the Cochrane RCT Classifier as unlikely to be an RCT, and those identified through other sources). Two review authors independently screened all full texts of potentially eligible articles for inclusion. In case of disagreement, they consulted a third review author to reach consensus. One review author extracted data and assessed risk of bias for all included studies and a second review author independently cross‐checked all data and assessments. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion, or by consulting a third review author to reach consensus. Meta‐analysis was not possible due to the small number of included trials and their heterogeneity; we synthesised results descriptively by comparison and outcome. We reported the following outcomes in GRADE ‘Summary of findings’ tables: health service alterations; the degree to which changed service reflects health service user priorities; health service users' ratings of health service performance; health service users' health service utilisation patterns; resources associated with the decision‐making process; resources associated with implementing decisions; and adverse events. 
Main results
We included five trials (one RCT and four cluster‐RCTs), with 16,257 health service users and more than 469 health service providers as trial participants. For two trials, the aims of the partnerships were to directly improve the person‐centredness of health services (via health service planning, and discharge co‐ordination). In the remaining trials, the aims were indirect (training first‐year medical doctors on patient safety) or broader in focus (which could include person‐centredness of health services that targeted the public/community, households or health service delivery to improve maternal and neonatal mortality). Three trials were conducted in high income‐countries, one was in a middle‐income country and one was in a low‐income country. Two studies evaluated working in partnership interventions, compared to usual practice without partnership (Comparison 1); and three studies evaluated working in partnership as part of a multi‐component intervention, compared to the same intervention without partnership (Comparison 2). No studies evaluated one form of working in partnership compared to another (Comparison 3). 
The effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership compared to usual practice without partnership are uncertain: only one of the two studies that assessed this comparison measured health service alteration outcomes, and data were not usable, as only intervention group data were reported. Additionally, none of the included studies evaluating this comparison measured the other primary or secondary outcomes we sought for the 'Summary of findings' table. 
We are also unsure about the effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership as part of a multi‐component intervention compared to the same intervention without partnership. Very low‐certainty evidence indicated there may be little or no difference on health service alterations or health service user health service performance ratings (two studies); or on health service user health service utilisation patterns and adverse events (one study each). No studies evaluating this comparison reported the degree to which health service alterations reflect health service user priorities, or resource use. 
Overall, our confidence in the findings about the effects of working in partnership interventions was very low due to indirectness, imprecision and publication bias, and serious concerns about risk of selection bias; performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias in most studies. 
Authors' conclusions
The effects of consumers and providers working in partnership as an intervention, or as part of a multi‐component intervention, are uncertain, due to a lack of high‐quality evidence and/or due to a lack of studies. Further well‐designed RCTs with a clear focus on assessing outcomes directly related to partnerships for patient‐centred health services are needed in this area, which may also benefit from mixed‐methods and qualitative research to build the evidence base. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title
**How Patients and Doctors Working Together Change Health Care**

### Rationale
Health care often focuses on one sickness. It does not always see the whole person. This can make it hard for people to get the care they need.

Some people think that if patients help plan care, it will be better. This means patients and doctors work as a team. They make choices together. This is called ""working in partnership.""

This study looked at how this team approach works. We wanted to see if it made health care better for patients. We wanted to know if health services fit a person's needs more. This study helps us learn if working together truly helps.

### Trial Design
**How is this study designed?**
This study looked at other studies. We searched many health databases. We looked for studies published between 2000 and 2019.

We picked studies where patients and doctors worked together. They met often in groups. They made choices about health services. These choices aimed to make care more about the person.

We included different types of studies. Some were strict tests called RCTs. Others were similar tests. We looked for studies with many patients and health care staff.

We wanted to see if changes were made to health services. We also looked at how patients felt about their care. We checked if services fit what patients needed. We looked at how often people used health services. We also checked for any problems that came up.

### Results
**What were the main results of the study?**
We found five studies to include. These studies had over 16,000 patients. They also had more than 469 health care staff.

Two studies wanted to make health care more about the person. This was done through planning and discharge help. Other studies had wider goals. These included training doctors. They also worked on helping mothers and babies.

Some studies compared working together to usual care. Usual care means no teamwork. We could not be sure if working together made a difference. The studies did not give enough clear facts.

Other studies looked at teamwork as part of a bigger plan. This was compared to the same plan without teamwork. We are also not sure about the effects here. The evidence was not strong. It seemed there might be little change. This was true for how services changed. It was also true for how patients felt about services.

We did not find strong proof that working together helps. This is because the studies were not perfect. They had some weaknesses. There was not enough good evidence.

More research is needed. We need better studies. These studies should focus on how teamwork helps patients. They should also look at what patients need. This will help us learn more about working together in health care.","When healthcare consumers (patients, carers and family members) and healthcare providers work together as partners to plan, deliver and evaluate health services, what effects does this have? 
What are person‐centred health services? 
Traditionally, health services have been developed by healthcare providers and focus on specific diseases or medical specialties. Involving consumers as partners in planning, delivering and evaluating health services may lead to services that are better able to meet the needs of and provide care for individuals.  
Why we did this Cochrane review 
Governments worldwide recommend that healthcare providers work with consumers to promote person‐centred health services. However, the effects of healthcare providers and consumers working together are unclear. 
We reviewed the evidence from research studies to find out about the effects of healthcare providers and consumers working together to plan, deliver and evaluate health services. 
Specifically, we wanted to know if consumers and healthcare providers working together in partnership – in the form of regular meetings in which consumers and providers were invited to contribute as equals to decisions about health services – had an impact on: 
‐ changes to health services;
‐ the extent to which changes to health services reflected service users’ priorities;
‐ users’ ratings of health services;
‐ health service use; and
‐ time and money needed to make or act on decisions about health services.
We also wanted to find out if there were any unwanted (adverse) effects.    
What did we do? 
First, we searched the medical literature for studies that compared:
‐ consumers and healthcare providers working in partnership against usual practice or other strategies with no partnership; or 
‐ different ways of working in partnership (for example, with fewer or more consumers, or with online or face‐to‐face meetings). 
We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find? 
We found five studies that involved a total of 16,257 health service users and more than 469 health service providers. Three studies took place in high income‐countries and one each in middle‐ and low‐income countries. 
The studies compared:
‐ working in partnership against usual practice without partnership working (2 studies); and 
‐ working in partnership as part of a wider strategy to promote person‐centred health services, against the same wider strategy without partnership working (3 studies).   
No studies evaluated one form of working in partnership compared to another.
What are the main results of our review? 
The studies provided insufficient evidence to determine if working in partnership had any effects compared to usual practice or wider strategies with no working in partnership. 
No studies investigated:
‐ impacts on the extent to which changes to health services reflected service users’ priorities, or 
‐ the resources needed to make or act on decisions about health services.
Few studies investigated:
‐ impacts on changes to health services;
‐ users’ ratings of health services;
‐ health service use; and
‐ adverse events.
The few studies that did investigate these outcomes either did not report usable information or produced findings in which we have very little confidence. These studies were small, used methods likely to introduce errors in their results and focused on specific settings or populations. Their results are unlikely to reflect the results of all the studies that have been conducted in this area, some of which have not made their results public yet. 
What does this mean? 
There is not enough robust evidence to determine the effects of consumers and providers working in partnership to plan, deliver or evaluate health services. 
This review highlights the need for well‐designed studies with a clear focus on evaluating the effects of partnerships for promoting person‐centred care in health services. This area of research may also benefit from studies that investigate why certain partnerships between consumers and healthcare providers may be more successful than others, and an accompanying qualitative evidence synthesis addressing this aspect is forthcoming. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to April 2019.

10.1002-14651858.CD013217.pub2,"Background
The prevalence of substance use, both prescribed and non‐prescribed, is increasing in many areas of the world. Substance use by women of childbearing age contributes to increasing rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is a newer term describing the subset of NAS related to opioid exposure. Non‐pharmacological care is the first‐line treatment for substance withdrawal in newborns. Despite the widespread use of non‐pharmacological care to mitigate symptoms of NAS, there is not an established definition of, and standard for, non‐pharmacological care practices in this population. Evaluation of safety and efficacy of non‐pharmacological practices could provide clear guidance for clinical practice. 
Objectives
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of non‐pharmacological treatment of infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal on the length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment for symptom management. 
Comparison 1: in infants at risk for, or having early symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal, does non‐pharmacological treatment reduce the length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment? 
Comparison 2: in infants receiving pharmacological treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, does concurrent non‐pharmacological treatment reduce duration of pharmacological treatment, maximum and cumulative doses of opioid medication, and length of hospitalization? 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search CENTRAL (2019, Issue 10); Ovid MEDLINE; and CINAHL on 11 October 2019. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster trials. 
Selection criteria
We included trials comparing single or bundled non‐pharmacological interventions to no non‐pharmacological treatment or different single or bundled non‐pharmacological interventions. We assessed non‐pharmacological interventions independently and in combination based on sufficient similarity in population, intervention, and comparison groups studied. We categorized non‐pharmacological interventions as: modifying environmental stimulation, feeding practices, and support of the mother‐infant dyad. We presented non‐randomized studies identified in the search process narratively. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes in infants at risk for, or having early symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal included length of hospitalization and pharmacological treatment with one or more doses of opioid or sedative medication. Primary outcomes in infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal included length of hospitalization, length of pharmacological treatment with opioid or sedative medication, and maximum and cumulative doses of opioid medication. 
Main results
We identified six RCTs (353 infants) in which infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal participated between 1975 and 2018. We identified no RCTs in which infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal participated. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low to low. We also identified and excluded 34 non‐randomized studies published between 2005 and 2018, including 29 in which infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal participated and five in which infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal participated. We identified seven preregistered interventional clinical trials that may qualify for inclusion at review update when complete. 
Of the six RCTs, four studies assessed modifying environmental stimulation in the form of a mechanical rocking bed, prone positioning, non‐oscillating waterbed, or a low‐stimulation nursery; one study assessed feeding practices (comparing 24 kcal/oz to 20 kcal/oz formula); and one study assessed support of the maternal‐infant dyad (tailored breastfeeding support). 
There was no evidence of a difference in length of hospitalization in the one study that assessed modifying environmental stimulation (mean difference [MD) –1 day, 95% confidence interval [CI) –2.82 to 0.82; 30 infants; very low‐certainty evidence) and the one study of support of the maternal‐infant dyad (MD –8.9 days, 95% CI –19.84 to 2.04; 14 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). No studies of feeding practices evaluated the length of hospitalization. 
There was no evidence of a difference in use of pharmacological treatment in three studies of modifying environmental stimulation (typical risk ratio [RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; 92 infants; low‐certainty evidence), one study of feeding practices (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.33; 49 infants; very low‐certainty evidence), and one study of support of the maternal‐infant dyad (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.90; 14 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Reported secondary outcomes included neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, days to regain birth weight, and weight nadir. One study of support of the maternal‐infant dyad reported NICU admission (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.90; 14 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). One study of feeding practices reported days to regain birth weight (MD 1.10 days, 95% CI 2.76 to 0.56; 46 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). One study that assessed modifying environmental stimulation reported weight nadir (MD –0.28, 95% CI –1.15 to 0.59; 194 infants; very low‐certainty evidence) and one study of feeding practices reported weight nadir (MD –0.8, 95% CI –2.24 to 0.64; 46 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns affects important clinical outcomes including length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment based on the six included studies. The outcomes identified for this review were of very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence. Combined analysis was limited by heterogeneity in study design and intervention definitions as well as the number of studies. Many prespecified outcomes were not reported. Although caregivers are encouraged by experts to optimize non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns prior to initiating pharmacological care, we do not have sufficient evidence to inform specific clinical practices. Larger well‐designed studies are needed to determine the effect of non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Helping Babies Born with Opioid Withdrawal

### Rationale

More people are using drugs, both prescribed and illegal. This includes women who can have babies. When a pregnant woman uses opioids, her baby can be born with withdrawal symptoms. This is called neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, or NOWS. Babies with NOWS need help to get better.

The first way to help these babies is often ""non-drug care."" This means using things like gentle touch or quiet rooms. But we do not have clear rules for what this care should be. We do not know for sure which types of non-drug care work best or are safe.

This study wanted to find out if non-drug care truly helps babies with NOWS. We wanted to see if it could make their hospital stay shorter. We also wanted to see if it could lower their need for strong medicines.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many past studies. We searched for studies that were well-designed and compared different types of care. These studies were about babies born between 1975 and 2018.

The babies in these studies were at risk for NOWS. Or they already showed signs of NOWS. These babies were new, from birth up to a few weeks old. Both boys and girls were included.

We looked at different kinds of non-drug care. This included changing the baby's room to be more calm. It also included how babies were fed. And it included how mothers and babies were supported together. We wanted to see if these types of care helped.

We wanted to know how long babies stayed in the hospital. We also wanted to know if they needed medicine for withdrawal. We were interested in how much medicine they needed and for how long.

### Results

We found six good studies that included 353 babies. These studies looked at babies who were at risk for or had signs of NOWS. These studies were done between 1975 and 2018.

We did not find any good studies about babies who were already getting medicine for withdrawal. The quality of the evidence we found was low. This means we are not very sure about the results.

The studies looked at different non-drug care. Some looked at changing the room to be calmer. One looked at how babies were fed. One looked at supporting the mother and baby together.

We found no clear proof that non-drug care changed how long babies stayed in the hospital. We also found no clear proof that it changed if babies needed medicine. Or how much medicine they needed.

For example, one study looked at calming the room. It showed no clear difference in hospital stay. Another study looked at supporting the mother and baby. It also showed no clear difference in hospital stay.

Some studies looked at other things. They looked at if babies went to a special care unit. Or how long it took them to gain weight. Again, we found no clear proof that non-drug care made a difference.

We are not sure if non-drug care helps babies with opioid withdrawal. It is hard to compare studies because they were done in different ways. We need more and better studies. These studies should be designed well. They need to clearly define what non-drug care means. This will help doctors and nurses know the best way to care for these babies.","Non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns
Review question 
Do one or more specific non‐pharmacological (treatments other than medicines) care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth? 
Background 
Newborns of mothers who take opioids during pregnancy often experience symptoms of withdrawal after delivery, such as high‐pitched cry, tremors, and high tone. Non‐pharmacological care is the first treatment for symptoms of withdrawal. If symptoms worsen despite non‐pharmacological care, a medication such as morphine, methadone, or buprenorphine is the second treatment to reduce symptoms. Though non‐pharmacological care is the first approach to symptom management, it is not the same at every hospital. We wanted to discover whether one or more non‐pharmacological care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth. 
Study characteristics 
We looked at randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of opioid‐exposed newborns treated with one or more non‐pharmacological care practice. Non‐pharmacological care practices include changes to the environment to reduce stimulation or provide soothing, changes to feeding frequency or type, changes that increase maternal care of the newborn or maternal wellness, and multiple changes such as occur in a new site or system of care. Search is up to date as of October 2019. 
Key results 
This review included six RCTs that enrolled 353 opioid‐exposed newborns. The studies were published between 1975 and 2018. We also identified seven ongoing studies that may qualify for inclusion at review update when complete. 
Of the six RCTs, four assessed changes to the environment to reduce stimulation or provide soothing. These studies examined the effect of a mechanical rocking bed, prone positioning (lying on tummy), non‐oscillating waterbed, and a low‐stimulation nursery. We are uncertain whether modifying environmental stimulation is associated with length of hospitalization based on one study with 30 infants. Modifying environmental stimulation may be associated with little or no difference in use of pharmacological treatment based on three studies with 92 infants. We are uncertain whether modifying environmental stimulation is associated with weight nadir (lowest weight recorded during birth hospitalization) based on one study with 194 infants. 
One study assessed a change to the feeding type comparing higher‐calorie formula to standard‐calorie formula. We are uncertain whether feeding practices are associated with use of medicines, days to regain birth weight, or weight nadir based on one study with 46 infants. 
One study assessed changes to support the mother with tailored breastfeeding support. We are uncertain whether support of the mother‐infant dyad is associated with length of hospitalization, use of medicines, or neonatal intensive care unit admission based on one study with 14 infants. 
Many potential important effects were not reported, and others were not reported in all studies. 
Quality of evidence 
We are uncertain whether one or more specific non‐pharmacological care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth. The quality of evidence for all outcomes is very low to low and provides limited information to inform individual non‐pharmacological care practices or combinations of non‐pharmacological care practices.

10.1002-14651858.CD003315.pub3,"Feeding interventions for growth and development in infants with cleft lip, cleft palate or cleft lip and palate 
Cleft lip and cleft palate (the roof of the mouth) are common defects. The severity of the cleft (opening) varies and it can occur on one (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral). It can be difficult to feed babies enough nutritious food when they have this condition, and there is evidence of delayed development in children born with cleft. 
This review aimed to compare the effects of different feeding interventions such as maternal advice and support, modified bottles and/or teats, obturating or maxillary plates (plates placed in the roof of the mouth to artificially close the cleft palate) and supplemental breastfeeding in babies with cleft lip and/or palate prior to, or following, closure. Interventions in the first 6 months from term and used with breast milk or formula feeding only were considered, but outcomes (measures of growth, development and parental satisfaction) may have been measured at any time including adulthood. 
Maternal advice and support on feeding techniques and breastfeeding positions are often provided, but no studies evaluated the effectiveness of this intervention. Squeezable rather than rigid bottles may be easier to use for feeding babies with cleft lip and/or palate, and breastfeeding may have growth advantages over spoon‐feeding following cleft lip surgery. Only five studies (including 292 babies) compared the effects of feeding interventions in babies with cleft lip and/or palate on growth, development or parental satisfaction. Evidence for breastfeeding rather than spoon‐feeding following surgery was weak and there was a suggestion that squeezable bottles may be more manageable than rigid ones. No evidence was found to support the use of maxillary plates in babies with unilateral clefts and no studies assessed the effects of maternal advice or support.

","Here's a Plain Language Summary based on the provided abstract:

## Plain Title
Helping babies with a cleft eat and grow well

## Rationale
Babies can be born with an opening in their lip or the roof of their mouth. This is called a cleft lip or cleft palate. It can be a small or large opening.

When babies have a cleft, it is hard for them to eat enough food. This can make it hard for them to grow. It can also make it hard for them to learn and grow like other babies.

We wanted to see what ways of feeding these babies work best. We looked at different ways to help them eat. We wanted to find ways that help them grow and develop better. We also wanted to know if these ways make parents happy.

## Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies. We wanted to compare how different feeding methods work. We looked at babies with a cleft lip or cleft palate. Some had both.

We looked at feeding help given in the first six months of life. This was before or after surgery to close the cleft. We looked at things like advice for mothers. We also looked at special bottles. Some studies looked at plates put in the mouth. Some looked at extra help with breastfeeding.

We checked how much babies grew. We also checked how well they learned new things. We asked parents how they felt about the feeding methods. The studies could check these things at any time, even when the babies became adults.

## Results
We found only five studies that looked at these feeding methods. These studies included 292 babies.

One idea was that giving mothers advice helps. No studies checked this. We do not know if it helps.

Some people think soft, squeezable bottles are better. They may be easier to use than hard bottles. The studies gave a hint that this might be true. But we need more proof.

After surgery, some babies were breastfed. Some were fed with a spoon. Breastfeeding seemed a bit better for growth. But this proof was not strong.

Some doctors use plates in the roof of the mouth. These plates close the cleft for a while. No studies showed these plates help babies with a cleft on one side.

Overall, we need to learn more. We need to find the best ways to help babies with a cleft. This will help them grow and learn well. It will also help parents.","Feeding interventions for growth and development in infants with cleft lip, cleft palate or cleft lip and palate

10.1002-14651858.CD009868.pub3,"Background
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet ASCVD risk factor control and secondary prevention rates remain low. A fixed‐dose combination of blood pressure‐ and cholesterol‐lowering and antiplatelet treatments into a single pill, or polypill, has been proposed as one strategy to reduce the global burden of ASCVD. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of fixed‐dose combination therapy on all‐cause mortality, fatal and non‐fatal ASCVD events, and adverse events. We also sought to determine the effect of fixed‐dose combination therapy on blood pressure, lipids, adherence, discontinuation rates, health‐related quality of life, and costs. 
Search methods
We updated our previous searches in September 2016 of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and DARE, HTA, and HEED. We also searched two clinical trials registers in September 2016. We used no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of a fixed‐dose combination therapy including at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one lipid‐lowering component versus usual care, placebo, or an active drug comparator for any treatment duration in adults 18 years old or older, with no restrictions on presence or absence of pre‐existing ASCVD. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted the data for this update. We evaluated risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed‐effect models when heterogeneity was low (I2 < 50%) and random‐effects models when heterogeneity was high (I2 ≥ 50%). We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality of evidence. 
Main results
In the initial review, we identified nine randomised controlled trials with a total of 7047 participants and four additional trials (n = 2012 participants; mean age range 62 to 63 years; 30% to 37% women) were included in this update. Eight of the 13 trials evaluated the effects of fixed‐dose combination (FDC) therapy in populations without prevalent ASCVD, and the median follow‐up ranged from six weeks to 23 months. More recent trials were generally larger with longer follow‐up and lower risk of bias. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Compared with the comparator groups (placebo, usual care, or active drug comparator), the effects of the fixed‐dose combination treatment on mortality (FDC = 1.0% versus control = 1.0%, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.89,  I2 = 0%, 5 studies, N = 5300) and fatal and non‐fatal ASCVD events (FDC = 4.7% versus control = 3.7%, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66, I2 = 0%, 6 studies, N = 4517) were uncertain (low‐quality evidence). The low event rates for these outcomes and indirectness of evidence for comparing fixed‐dose combination to usual care versus individual drugs suggest that these results should be viewed with caution. Adverse events were common in both the intervention (32%) and comparator (27%) groups, with participants randomised to fixed‐dose combination therapy being 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25, 11 studies, 6906 participants, moderate‐quality evidence) more likely to report an adverse event . The mean differences in systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control arms was ‐6.34 mmHg (95% CI ‐9.03 to ‐3.64, 13 trials, 7638 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). The mean differences (95% CI) in total and LDL cholesterol between the intervention and control arms were ‐0.61 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.88 to ‐0.35, 11 trials, 6565 participants, low‐quality evidence) and ‐0.70 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.41, 12 trials, 7153 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), respectively. There was a high degree of statistical heterogeneity in comparisons of blood pressure and lipids (I2 ≥ 80% for all) that could not be explained, so these results should be viewed with caution. Fixed‐dose combination therapy improved adherence to a multidrug strategy by 44% (26% to 65%) compared with usual care (4 trials, 3835 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
The effects of fixed‐dose combination therapy on all‐cause mortality or ASCVD events are uncertain. A limited number of trials reported these outcomes, and the included trials were primarily designed to observe changes in ASCVD risk factor levels rather than clinical events, which may partially explain the observed differences in risk factors that were not translated into differences in clinical outcomes among the included trials. Fixed‐dose combination therapy is associated with modest increases in adverse events compared with placebo, active comparator, or usual care but may be associated with improved adherence to a multidrug regimen. Ongoing, longer‐term trials of fixed‐dose combination therapy will help demonstrate whether short‐term changes in risk factors might be maintained and lead to expected differences in clinical events based on these changes. 
","## Taking One Pill to Help Your Heart

### Rationale

Heart disease is a major problem. It can lead to death and other health issues. Many people do not get enough help for it.

Doctors use many pills to treat heart disease. These pills lower blood pressure and cholesterol. They also help prevent blood clots. Taking many pills can be hard for people.

This study looked at a ""polypill."" A polypill puts many key heart medicines into one pill. The idea is that one pill might be easier to take. This could help more people control their heart disease.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past research. It gathered results from many studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. One group got the polypill. Other groups got a fake pill, usual care, or other medicines.

The studies included adults. All people were 18 years or older. They either had heart disease or were at risk for it. Some studies looked at people without heart disease. Others looked at people with heart disease already.

The studies lasted different amounts of time. Some lasted a few weeks. Others lasted almost two years.

### Results

The study gathered data from many people. There were 13 studies in all. Over 7,000 people took part. The average age was around 62 or 63. About one-third of the people were women.

The study found a few key things:

*   **Death and heart problems:** It was not clear if the polypill stopped people from dying. It was also not clear if it stopped heart attacks or strokes. The studies had too few deaths and heart problems to be sure. More studies are needed to understand this better.

*   **Side effects:** People who took the polypill had more side effects. About 32 out of 100 people on the polypill had side effects. This was compared to about 27 out of 100 people in other groups. So, the polypill might cause more small problems.

*   **Blood pressure:** The polypill helped lower blood pressure. It lowered the top number of blood pressure by about 6 points. This is a good change for heart health.

*   **Cholesterol:** The polypill also helped lower cholesterol. It lowered ""bad"" cholesterol. This is also good for heart health.

*   **Taking medicine:** People who took the polypill were much better at taking their medicine. They were 44% more likely to take their medicine as told. This is a big benefit.

The experts said that the polypill's effect on death or heart problems is still not certain. But it does help lower risk factors like blood pressure and cholesterol. It also helps people take their medicine. Longer studies are being done now. These new studies will help us learn more about the polypill's full impact.","Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke
Review question: We reviewed the evidence about the effect of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. We found 13 studies including 9059 participants. 
Background: We wanted to discover whether using fixed‐dose combination therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care, placebo, or giving drugs separately, for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. This report represents an update from a previous review published in 2014. 
Study characteristics: The evidence is current to September 2016. Four studies included individuals with a prior heart attack or stroke or with a high predicted risk for having an initial heart attack and five studies had long‐term (12 months or more) follow‐up. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Most study participants were middle‐aged men with moderate elevations in blood pressure or cholesterol. Two studies specifically included ethnic Aboriginal or Maori minorities in half of the study participants. The fixed‐dose combinations ranged from two to five drugs; all studies included at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one cholesterol‐lowering drug. 
Key results: The effects of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on all‐cause mortality and fatal and non‐fatal heart attacks and strokes are uncertain, primarily due to the low number of participants experiencing these events in these studies (fewer than 5% for both) and comparisons with usual care (low‐quality evidence). Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy leads to more adverse events than control (32% versus 27%), including placebo (moderate‐quality evidence). This information is not surprising since aspirin, blood pressure‐lowering drugs and cholesterol drugs are known to increase the risk for side effects compared with placebo. Fixed‐dose combination therapy may modestly lower blood pressure (˜6 mmHg) and cholesterol (‐0.6 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol), but these effects were not consistent (moderate‐quality evidence for blood pressure and LDL cholesterol but low‐quality evidence of total cholesterol). Fixed‐dose combination therapy appears to improve adherence to medications to prevent ASCVD (moderate‐quality evidence). 
Quality of the evidence: The quality of evidence from these studies generally ranged from moderate to low. Ongoing trials of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy will likely inform clinical endpoints to guide decision‐making.

10.1002-14651858.CD013836.pub2,"Background
Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is the third leading cause of neonatal mortality globally constituting 13% of overall neonatal mortality. Despite the high burden of neonatal sepsis, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. Due to the diagnostic challenges of sepsis and the relative immunosuppression of the newborn, many neonates receive antibiotics for suspected sepsis. Antibiotics have become the most used therapeutics in neonatal intensive care units, and observational studies in high‐income countries suggest that 83% to 94% of newborns treated with antibiotics for suspected sepsis have negative blood cultures. The last Cochrane Review was updated in 2005. There is a need for an updated systematic review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Objectives
To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL (2021, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase Ovid; CINAHL; LILACS; Science Citation Index EXPANDED and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science on 12 March 2021. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. We included participants older than 72 hours of life at randomisation, suspected or diagnosed with neonatal sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, or necrotising enterocolitis. We excluded trials that assessed treatment of fungal infections. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcome was all‐cause mortality, and our secondary outcomes were: serious adverse events, respiratory support, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, necrotising enterocolitis, and ototoxicity. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow‐up. 
Main results
We included five RCTs (580 participants). All trials were at high risk of bias, and had very low‐certainty evidence. 
The five included trials assessed five different comparisons of antibiotics.
We did not conduct a meta‐analysis due to lack of relevant data.
Of the five included trials one trial compared cefazolin plus amikacin with vancomycin plus amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with flucloxacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared cloxacillin plus amikacin with cefotaxime plus gentamicin; one trial compared meropenem with standard care (ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime plus gentamicin); and one trial compared vancomycin plus gentamicin with vancomycin plus aztreonam. 
None of the five comparisons found any evidence of a difference when assessing all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, or necrotising enterocolitis; however, none of the trials were near an information size that could contribute significantly to the evidence of the comparative benefits and risks of any particular antibiotic regimen. 
None of the trials assessed respiratory support or ototoxicity.
The benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the lack of well‐powered trials and the high risk of systematic errors. 
Authors' conclusions
Current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. RCTs assessing different antibiotic regimens in late‐onset neonatal sepsis with low risks of bias are warranted. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study abstract:

## Plain Title: Finding the Best Antibiotics for Sick Newborns

### Rationale

Being a newborn baby can be hard. Some babies get very sick with an infection called sepsis. Sepsis means the body has a strong reaction to an infection. This infection can be very dangerous for babies. It is a main cause of babies getting very sick or even dying. About 13 out of every 100 baby deaths are due to sepsis.

It is hard for doctors to tell if a baby has sepsis. Babies also have weak immune systems. This means they cannot fight off sickness very well. So, many sick babies get medicine called antibiotics. Doctors give these medicines to stop the infection.

Antibiotics are used a lot in hospitals for sick babies. Studies show that most babies who get antibiotics for a possible infection do not actually have one. But we need to know which antibiotics work best for babies who do have sepsis. We also need to know if some antibiotics cause more harm than good. This study looked at different antibiotic medicines for sick newborns. It aimed to see which ones work best and are safest.

### Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This study looked at many other studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This is a strong type of study. In these studies, sick babies got different antibiotic medicines. Then, doctors watched to see how the babies did.

We looked for studies that compared different antibiotic medicines. These studies included babies older than 3 days of life. These babies had signs of infection. This could be sepsis or other serious infections like meningitis. We did not look at studies about infections caused by fungi.

Three doctors checked each study very carefully. They looked at things like if the studies were fair. They also checked what happened to the babies. The main thing we looked for was if babies died. We also looked for other problems. These included if babies needed help breathing or if their hearts had problems. We also checked for issues with kidneys, brain problems, or bowel issues. We looked at how babies were doing for as long as the studies followed them.

### Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

We found five studies that fit our needs. These studies included 580 babies. But, all these studies had some problems. They were not designed in a way that gave clear answers.

Each of the five studies compared different antibiotics. For example, one study compared two types of antibiotics to two other types. Another study compared one antibiotic to what doctors normally give.

After looking at all the studies, we could not find a clear answer. None of the comparisons showed that one antibiotic was better or worse. This was true for babies dying or having other serious problems. The studies were not big enough to give strong proof. They did not have enough information to show if one antibiotic was truly better or safer.

None of the studies looked at if babies needed help breathing. They also did not check for ear problems.

Because of problems in how the studies were done, we still do not know. We do not know if some antibiotics are better or worse than others for sick newborns.

The people who did this study concluded that we need more research. We need new, well-designed studies. These studies should be big enough to find clear answers. They need to show which antibiotics are best for sick babies. They also need to be careful not to have errors. This will help doctors give the best care to newborns with sepsis.","Antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis
Review question 
We reviewed the available evidence on different antibiotic regimens for newborns (from 72 hours of life to one month of life) with late‐onset sepsis. 
Background 
Sepsis in newborns is a severe and potential lethal condition, caused by the body's response to an infection. Neonatal sepsis is the third leading cause of neonatal death globally. Despite this high burden of sepsis in newborns, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. This Cochrane Review was originally published in 2005. To identify the most appropriate antibiotic policies for neonatal sepsis, there is a need to base these policies on an updated well‐conducted review. Therefore, there is a need for such a review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to March 2021. We included five trials randomising 580 participants. The five trials compared five different antibiotic regimens. 
Key results 
We included five trials: one trial compared cefazolin plus amikacin with vancomycin plus amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with flucloxacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared cloxacillin plus amikacin with cefotaxime plus gentamicin; one trial compared meropenem with standard care (ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime plus gentamicin); and one trial compared vancomycin plus gentamicin with vancomycin plus aztreonam. 
None of the five antibiotic comparisons showed that the choice of antibiotics influenced the effects on death from all‐causes, serious adverse events (i.e. major complications), circulatory support, nephrotoxicity (toxicity in the kidneys), neurological developmental impairment (disabilities in the functioning of the brain that affect a child's behaviour, memory, or ability to learn), or necrotising enterocolitis (tissues in the gut become inflamed and start to die). Current evidence cannot confirm or reject, one antibiotic regimen being superior to another due to scarce data. 
Quality of the evidence 
Our conclusions are based on very low‐quality evidence. The five trials were at high risk of bias (i.e. the trials were conducted in a way that may have skewed results to the positive side). In addition, the five trials included few participants, making the results of this review imprecise. 
"
10.1002-14651858.CD013717.pub2,"Background
In late 2019, the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) were reported in Wuhan, China, followed by a worldwide spread. Numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, travel restrictions, screening at borders, and quarantine of travellers. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of international travel‐related control measures during the COVID‐19 pandemic on infectious disease transmission and screening‐related outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID‐19‐specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the WHO Global Database on COVID‐19 Research to 13 November 2020. 
Selection criteria
We considered experimental, quasi‐experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel‐related control measures affecting human travel across international borders during the COVID‐19 pandemic. In the original review, we also considered evidence on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In this version we decided to focus on COVID‐19 evidence only. Primary outcome categories were (i) cases avoided, (ii) cases detected, and (iii) a shift in epidemic development. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts. For studies included in the analysis, one review author extracted data and appraised the study. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of data. To assess the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed these GRADE judgements. 
Main results
Overall, we included 62 unique studies in the analysis; 49 were modelling studies and 13 were observational studies. Studies covered a variety of settings and levels of community transmission. 
Most studies compared travel‐related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of stringency of the measures (including relaxation of restrictions), or a combination of measures. 
Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to the selection of travellers and the reference test, and unclear reporting of certain methodological aspects. 
Below we outline the results for each intervention category by illustrating the findings from selected outcomes. 
Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel (31 modelling studies) 
The studies assessed cases avoided and shift in epidemic development. We found very low‐certainty evidence for a reduction in COVID‐19 cases in the community (13 studies) and cases exported or imported (9 studies). Most studies reported positive effects, with effect sizes varying widely; only a few studies showed no effect. 
There was very low‐certainty evidence that cross‐border travel controls can slow the spread of COVID‐19. Most studies predicted positive effects, however, results from individual studies varied from a delay of less than one day to a delay of 85 days; very few studies predicted no effect of the measure. 
Screening at borders (13 modelling studies; 13 observational studies) 
Screening measures covered symptom/exposure‐based screening or test‐based screening (commonly specifying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing), or both, before departure or upon or within a few days of arrival. Studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Studies generally predicted or observed some benefit from screening at borders, however these varied widely. 
For symptom/exposure‐based screening, one modelling study reported that global implementation of screening measures would reduce the number of cases exported per day from another country by 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72% to 95%) (moderate‐certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted delays in epidemic development, although there was wide variation in the results between the studies (very low‐certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted that the proportion of cases detected would range from 1% to 53% (very low‐certainty evidence). Nine observational studies observed the detected proportion to range from 0% to 100% (very low‐certainty evidence), although all but one study observed this proportion to be less than 54%. 
For test‐based screening, one modelling study provided very low‐certainty evidence for the number of cases avoided. It reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases as well as secondary cases. Five observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90% (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Quarantine (12 modelling studies) 
The studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. All studies suggested some benefit of quarantine, however the magnitude of the effect ranged from small to large across the different outcomes (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence). Three modelling studies predicted that the reduction in the number of cases in the community ranged from 450 to over 64,000 fewer cases (very low‐certainty evidence). The variation in effect was possibly related to the duration of quarantine and compliance. 
Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies; 4 observational studies) 
The studies assessed shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Most studies predicted positive effects for the combined measures with varying magnitudes (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence). Four observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected for quarantine and screening at borders ranged from 68% to 92% (low‐certainty evidence). The variation may depend on how the measures were combined, including the length of the quarantine period and days when the test was conducted in quarantine. 
Authors' conclusions
With much of the evidence derived from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real‐world' evidence. The certainty of the evidence for most travel‐related control measures and outcomes is very low and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Symptom/exposure‐based screening measures at borders on their own are likely not effective; PCR testing at borders as a screening measure likely detects more cases than symptom/exposure‐based screening at borders, although if performed only upon arrival this will likely also miss a meaningful proportion of cases. Quarantine, based on a sufficiently long quarantine period and high compliance is likely to largely avoid further transmission from travellers. Combining quarantine with PCR testing at borders will likely improve effectiveness. Many studies suggest that effects depend on factors, such as levels of community transmission, travel volumes and duration, other public health measures in place, and the exact specification and timing of the measure. Future research should be better reported, employ a range of designs beyond modelling and assess potential benefits and harms of the travel‐related control measures from a societal perspective. 
","## Stopping the Spread: How Travel Rules Fought COVID-19

### Rationale

The world faced a new sickness called COVID-19. It started in China and spread quickly. This sickness made many people sick. It put a big strain on hospitals. It also caused many deaths.

Because of this, many countries put rules in place for travel. They closed borders. They stopped people from traveling. They checked people at borders. They also asked travelers to stay home for a time.

This study wanted to see if these travel rules truly helped. Did they stop the sickness from spreading? Did they find sick people? We needed to know if these rules worked. We also wanted to know which rules worked best.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. It searched big health databases. These databases have lots of medical papers. We looked for studies about travel rules and COVID-19. We also looked at rules used for similar sicknesses.

We included studies that looked at how travel rules worked. These studies looked at people moving between countries. Some studies used math models to guess what would happen. Other studies looked at real-life events.

We wanted to see if travel rules:
* Stopped sick people from getting into a country.
* Found sick people at borders.
* Slowed down the spread of the sickness.

We also looked at other things. Did these rules use up too many health resources? Did they have bad side effects?

Two people checked all the studies. They made sure the information was correct. They also checked how good the studies were. This helped us trust the results.

### Results

We looked at 62 different studies. Most of them (49) were math models. These models tried to predict what would happen. The other 13 studies looked at real situations.

Most studies compared travel rules to not having any rules. Some studies also looked at how strict the rules were.

We found that most studies had problems. The math models made guesses that might not be right. The real-life studies had issues with who they checked.

Here is what we found for different rules:

**Travel Rules That Stop Travel**
* 31 math models looked at this.
* They found it likely reduced COVID-19 cases. But we are not very sure of this.
* It might also slow down the sickness. Some studies said it could delay the spread by a few days. Others said it could delay it by many weeks.
* We need more proof for these effects.

**Checking People at Borders**
* 13 math models and 13 real-life studies looked at this.
* Checking people for sickness or if they were around sick people:
    * One model said it could stop 82 out of 100 sick people from coming into a country. This seems quite good.
    * It might also slow down the sickness. But the studies did not agree on how much.
    * Some studies found it missed many sick people. It only found 1 to 53 out of 100 sick people. Real-life studies often found it missed more than half of sick people.
* Using tests, like PCR tests, at borders:
    * One model said testing helped stop cases.
    * Real-life studies found tests could find 58 to 90 out of 100 sick people. This is better than just checking symptoms.
* Overall, checking people at borders showed some help. But the results were very different.

**Staying Home (Quarantine)**
* 12 math models looked at this.
* All studies said staying home helped. It could stop many cases. It could even stop tens of thousands of cases.
* How well it worked depended on how long people stayed home. It also depended on if people followed the rules.
* We are not very sure how much it helped.

**Staying Home and Checking at Borders Together**
* 7 math models and 4 real-life studies looked at this.
* Most studies said doing both worked better. It could find 68 to 92 out of 100 sick people.
* How well it worked depended on how the rules were used together. This included how long people stayed home. It also included when tests were done.

**What Does This Mean?**

Most of what we know comes from math models. We need more real-life studies. The proof for most travel rules is not very strong. The real effects might be different from what we found.

But generally, travel rules can help limit the spread of sickness.
* Just checking symptoms at borders might not work well.
* Using PCR tests at borders likely finds more sick people. But tests done only when people arrive might miss many cases.
* Staying home (quarantine) works best if it's long enough. It also works if people follow the rules. It can stop sick travelers from spreading the sickness.
* Doing both staying home and testing at borders probably works best.

How well these rules work depends on many things. It depends on how much sickness is already in a country. It depends on how many people are traveling. It also depends on other health rules that are in place.

Future studies should be better. They should look at real situations. They should also think about the good and bad points for everyone.","Can international travel‐related control measures contain the spread of the COVID‐19 pandemic? 
What are international travel‐related control measures? 
International travel control measures are methods to manage international travel to contain the spread of COVID‐19. Measures include: 
‐ closing international borders to stop travellers crossing from one country to another;
‐ restricting travel to and from certain countries, particularly those with high infection levels; 
‐ screening or testing travellers entering or leaving a country if they have symptoms or have been in contact with an infected person; 
‐ quarantining newly‐arrived travellers from another country, that is, requiring travellers to stay at home or in a specific place for a certain time. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how effective international travel‐related control measures are in containing the COVID‐19 pandemic. 
What we did 
We searched for studies on the effects of these measures on the spread of COVID‐19. Studies had to report how many cases these measures prevented or detected, or whether they changed the course of the pandemic. The studies could include people of any age, anywhere. They could be of any design including those that used ‘real‐life’ data (observational studies) or hypothetical data from computer‐generated simulations (modelling studies). 
This is the first update of our review. This update includes only studies on COVID‐19, published up to 13 November 2020. 
What we found 
We found 62 studies. Most (49 studies) were modelling studies; only 13 used real‐life data (observational studies). Studies took place across the world and at different times during the pandemic. Levels of COVID‐19 within countries varied. 
Most studies compared current travel‐related control measures with no travel‐related controls. However, some modelling studies also compared current measures against possible measures, for example, to see what might happen if controls were more or less relaxed or were combined with other measures. 
Main results 
Below we summarise the findings of some outcomes.
Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel (31 modelling studies) 
Most studies showed that travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel were beneficial, but this beneficial effect ranged from small to large. Additionally, some studies found no effect. Studies also predicted that these restrictions would delay the outbreak, but the delay ranged from one day to 85 days in different studies. 
Screening at borders (13 modelling studies and 13 observational studies) 
These studies assessed screening at borders, including screening people with symptoms or who had potentially been exposed to COVID‐19, or testing people, before or after they travelled. 
For screening based on symptoms or potential exposure to COVID‐19, modelling studies found that screening reduced imported or exported cases and delayed outbreaks. Modelling studies predicted that 1% to 53% of cases would be detected. Observational studies reported a wide range of cases detected, from 0% to 100%, with the majority of studies reporting less than 54% of cases detected. 
For screening based on testing, studies reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases, and cases detected. Observational studies reported that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90%. This variation might be due to the timing of testing. 
Quarantine (12 modelling studies) 
All studies suggested that quarantine may be beneficial, but the size of this effect ranged from small to large in the different studies. Modelling studies, for example, predicted that quarantine could lead to between 450 and over 64,000 fewer cases in the community. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how well they followed the rules. 
Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies and 4 observational studies) 
For quarantine and screening at borders, most studies suggested some benefit, however the size of this effect differed between studies. For example, observational studies reported that between 68% and 92% of cases would be detected. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how often they were tested while in quarantine. 
How reliable are these results? 
Our confidence in these results is limited. Most studies were based on mathematical predictions (modelling), so we lack real‐life evidence. Further, we were not confident that models used correct assumptions, so our confidence in the evidence on travel restrictions and quarantine, in particular, is very low. Some studies were published quickly online as ‘preprints’. Preprints do not undergo the normal rigorous checks of published studies, so we are not certain how reliable they are. Also, the studies were very different from each other and their results varied according to the specification of each travel measure (e.g. the type of screening approach), how it was put into practice and enforced, the amount of cross‐border travel, levels of community transmission and other types of national measures to control the pandemic. 
What this means 
Overall, international travel‐related control measures may help to limit the spread of COVID‐19 across national borders. Restricting cross‐border travel can be a helpful measure. Screening travellers only for symptoms at borders is likely to miss many cases; testing may be more effective but may also miss cases if only performed upon arrival. Quarantine that lasts at least 10 days can prevent travellers spreading COVID‐19 and may be more effective if combined with another measure such as testing, especially if people follow the rules. 
Future research needs to be better reported. More studies should focus on real‐life evidence, and should assess potential benefits and risks of travel‐related control measures to individuals and society as a whole.

Remote cognitive assessments are increasingly needed to assist in the detection of cognitive disorders, but the diagnostic accuracy of telephone‐ and video‐based cognitive screening remains unclear. 
Objectives
To assess the test accuracy of any multidomain cognitive test delivered remotely for the diagnosis of any form of dementia. 
To assess for potential differences in cognitive test scoring when using a remote platform, and where a remote screener was compared to the equivalent face‐to‐face test. 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov/) databases on 2 June 2021. We performed forward and backward searching of included citations. 
Selection criteria
We included cross‐sectional studies, where a remote, multidomain assessment was administered alongside a clinical diagnosis of dementia or equivalent face‐to‐face test. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data; a third review author moderated disagreements. Our primary analysis was the accuracy of remote assessments against a clinical diagnosis of dementia. Where data were available, we reported test accuracy as sensitivity and specificity. We did not perform quantitative meta‐analysis as there were too few studies at individual test level. 
For those studies comparing remote versus in‐person use of an equivalent screening test, if data allowed, we described correlations, reliability, differences in scores and the proportion classified as having cognitive impairment for each test. 
Main results
The review contains 31 studies (19 differing tests, 3075 participants), of which seven studies (six telephone, one video call, 756 participants) were relevant to our primary objective of describing test accuracy against a clinical diagnosis of dementia. All studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain, but were low risk in applicability to the review question. Overall, sensitivity of remote tools varied with values between 26% and 100%, and specificity between 65% and 100%, with no clearly superior test. 
Across the 24 papers comparing equivalent remote and in‐person tests (14 telephone, 10 video call), agreement between tests was good, but rarely perfect (correlation coefficient range: 0.48 to 0.98). 
Authors' conclusions
Despite the common and increasing use of remote cognitive assessment, supporting evidence on test accuracy is limited. Available data do not allow us to suggest a preferred test. Remote testing is complex, and this is reflected in the heterogeneity seen in tests used, their application, and their analysis. More research is needed to describe accuracy of contemporary approaches to remote cognitive assessment. While data comparing remote and in‐person use of a test were reassuring, thresholds and scoring rules derived from in‐person testing may not be applicable when the equivalent test is adapted for remote use.

### Plain Title
How well do phone or video tests find memory problems?

### Rationale
It is important to find memory problems early. These problems can be a sign of dementia. Dementia makes it hard to think, remember, and do daily tasks. It can be a heavy burden for patients and their families.

Sometimes, people cannot go to a clinic for a memory test. They might live far away. Or it might be hard for them to travel. So, doctors want to use tests over the phone or video calls. This study wanted to see if these remote tests work as well as tests done in person.

We wanted to know if remote tests can accurately tell if someone has dementia. We also wanted to see if people score the same on a test, whether they take it remotely or in person. If remote tests work well, more people can get help early.

### Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies. We gathered information from all these studies. We included studies where people took a memory test over the phone or video. They also had a doctor's check to see if they had dementia. Some studies also compared remote tests to in-person tests.

We looked at how good the remote tests were at finding dementia. We also checked if the scores on remote tests were similar to scores on in-person tests. We wanted to see if the tests were reliable.

We included studies that looked at different age groups and health conditions. The studies included both men and women. We did not involve new patients in this study. Instead, we reviewed existing research. The time a person was in the original studies varied.

### Results
We looked at 31 studies in total. These studies included 3,075 people. They used 19 different memory tests.

Seven of these studies checked how well remote tests found dementia. These studies included 756 people. Six studies used phone calls, and one used video calls.

The results showed that remote tests varied in how well they found dementia. Some tests were very good, and some were not as good. We could not find one remote test that was clearly the best.

We also looked at 24 studies that compared remote tests to in-person tests. These studies included phone and video calls. Most of the time, the remote and in-person tests gave similar results. This means that remote tests are often good enough. But they are not always perfect.

The main takeaway is that we need more research. We need to know more about how well remote memory tests work. It is also important to remember that a score on a remote test might mean something different than the same score on an in-person test. Doctors might need new rules for scoring remote tests.

Even though remote tests are used a lot, we still need more proof that they are accurate. This study shows that remote testing can be complex. We need to do more work to make sure remote tests are as good as they can be. This will help more people get the right care for memory problems.","How accurate are remote, virtual assessments at diagnosing dementia?
Why is this question important? 
Dementia is a chronic and progressive condition that affects peoples' memory and ability to function day‐to‐day. A clinical diagnosis of dementia usually involves brain scans, physical examinations and history taking. As a first step, we often use memory and thinking tests to identify people who need further assessment. Traditionally these tests are performed in‐person, but modifications of the tests allow them to be used over the telephone or via video calls – sometimes called 'remote assessment'. 
The need for remote assessment has become particularly urgent due to COVID‐19. However, there are potential benefits of remote assessment beyond the COVID‐19 pandemic. Physically attending appointments can be difficult for some people and remote assessments offer greater convenience. Remote assessments are also useful in research, as a large number of people can be reached in a fairly short amount of time. 
A test delivered by telephone may not be as good as the in‐person equivalent, and getting these tests right is important. One the one hand, If a test suggests someone has dementia when they do not (called a false positive), this can have an emotional impact on the person and their family. On the other hand, not identifying memory and thinking problems when they are present (called a false negative), mean that the person does not get the treatment and support that they need. 
What was the aim of this review? 
We aimed to assess whether memory and thinking tests carried out by telephone or video call can detect dementia. 
What was studied in this review? 
We looked at various memory and thinking tests. Many tests have been developed over time and they differ in their content and application, but most are based on a modification of a traditional in‐person test. 
What were the main results of this review? 
The review included 31 studies, using 19 different memory tests, with a total of 3075 participants. 
Only seven tests were relevant to our question regarding accuracy of remote testing. With the limited number of studies, estimates on the accuracy of these tests are imprecise. Our review suggests that remote tests could correctly identify people with dementia between 26% and 100% of the time, and could correctly rule out dementia 65% to 100% of the time. 
The remaining 24 studies compared a remote test with the face‐to‐face equivalent. These studies suggested that remote test scores usually agreed with in‐person testing, but this was not perfect. 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
In these studies, a clinical diagnosis of dementia was used as the reference (gold) standard. We identified a number of issues in the design, conduct and reporting of the studies. A particular issue was around the selection of participants for the studies. Studies often did not include people with hearing or language impairments that may have complicated remote testing. 
Who do the results of this study apply to? 
Most studies investigated older adults (over 65 years). The findings may not be representative of all older adults with dementia, as some studies only examined specific groups of people, for example, after stroke. The studies were usually performed in specialist centres by experts. So, we do not know how well these tests identify dementia in routine community practice. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The review highlights the lack of high‐quality research describing accuracy of telephone‐ and video call‐based memory and thinking tests. There were many differences between the studies included in this review such as the type of test used, participants included, the setting in which the study is carried out and language studied. This made comparisons between studies difficult. Our review suggests that remote assessments and in‐person assessments are not always equivalent. In situations where access to in‐person assessment is difficult, remote testing could be used as a useful first step. Ideally, this should be followed up with an in‐person assessment before a diagnosis is made. Due to limited studies, and differences in the way studies were carried out, we cannot recommend one particular remote test for the assessment of dementia.

Labour induction is the artificial stimulation of uterine contractions in order to bring about birth. It is commonly used in late pregnancy to address maternal and fetal problems.

### Plain Title
Hypnosis to Start Labor: Is it Safe and Does it Work?

### Rationale

Having a baby is a big deal. Sometimes, doctors need to start labor early. This is called ""inducing labor."" They do this if mom or baby has problems.

Current ways to start labor can cause issues. These include bleeding or more pain. It can also lead to C-sections. These are big operations.

Hypnosis is a way to relax deeply. It helps you focus your mind. It might help women feel less pain when they give birth. It could also make them less worried.

We wanted to see if hypnosis could help start labor. It might be a safer way. It might also cost less money. We need to know if it works and is safe.

### Trial Design

This study looked for other studies. We searched for studies that used hypnosis to start labor. We wanted to find studies that compared hypnosis to other ways. These are called ""randomized controlled trials.""

We looked for studies with pregnant women. These women needed their labor to be started. We looked for studies that tested if hypnosis helped.

We wanted to know how hypnosis was used. How long did it last? What did staff need to learn? What did women think about it?

We looked for any study that used hypnosis for this reason. We wanted to see what happened to moms and babies.

### Results

We looked for studies about hypnosis to start labor. We searched very carefully.

We did not find any studies. There are no studies yet that have tested this idea.

This means we do not know if hypnosis works to start labor. We also do not know if it is safe.

More research is needed. Doctors need to do studies on this topic. They need to see if hypnosis helps start labor. They also need to check if it is safe for moms and babies.

Future studies should ask women about their feelings. They should also look at how long hypnosis is used. And how staff are taught. Hypnosis might be good for women who are very anxious. But doctors must think carefully about each patient. This is because hypnosis should not stop other needed care.","Hypnosis for induction of labour

10.1002-14651858.CD013339.pub2,"Background
People with dementia in nursing homes often experience pain, but often do not receive adequate pain therapy. The experience of pain has a significant impact on quality of life in people with dementia, and is associated with negative health outcomes. Untreated pain is also considered to be one of the causes of challenging behaviour, such as agitation or aggression, in this population. One approach to reducing pain in people with dementia in nursing homes is an algorithm‐based pain management strategy, i.e. the use of a structured protocol that involves pain assessment and a series of predefined treatment steps consisting of various non‐pharmacological and pharmacological pain management interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of algorithm‐based pain management interventions to reduce pain and challenging behaviour in people with dementia living in nursing homes. 
To describe the components of the interventions and the content of the algorithms.
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 30 June 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of algorithm‐based pain management interventions for people with dementia living in nursing homes. All interventions had to include an initial pain assessment, a treatment algorithm (a treatment plan consisting of at least two different non‐pharmacological or pharmacological treatment steps to reduce pain), and criteria to assess the success of each treatment step. The control groups could receive usual care or an active control intervention. Primary outcomes for this review were pain‐related outcomes, e.g. the number of participants with pain (self‐ or proxy‐rated), challenging behaviour (we used a broad definition that could also include agitation or behavioural and psychological symptoms assessed with any validated instrument), and serious adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected the articles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of all included studies. We reported results narratively as there were too few studies for a meta‐analysis. We used GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the results. 
Main results
We included three cluster‐randomised controlled trials with a total of 808 participants (mean age 82 to 89 years). In two studies, participants had severe cognitive impairment and in one study mild to moderate impairment. The algorithms used in the studies varied in the number of treatment steps. The comparator was pain education for nursing staff in two studies and usual care in one study. 
We judged the risk of detection bias to be high in one study. The risk of selection bias and performance bias was unclear in all studies. 
Self‐rated pain (i.e. pain rated by participants themselves) was reported in two studies. In one study, all residents in the nursing homes were included, but fewer than half of the participants experienced pain at baseline, and the mean values of self‐rated and proxy‐rated pain at baseline and follow‐up in both study groups were below the threshold of pain that may require treatment. We considered the evidence from this study to be very low‐certainty and therefore are uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had an effect on self‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education (MD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.05, 170 participants; Verbal Descriptor Scale, range 0 to 3). In the other study, all participants had mild to moderate pain at baseline. Here, we found low‐certainty evidence that an algorithm‐based pain management intervention may have little to no effect on self‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education (MD 0.4, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 1.38, 246 participants; Iowa Pain Thermometer, range 0 to 12). 
Pain was rated by proxy in all three studies. Again, we considered the evidence from the study in which mean pain scores indicated no pain, or almost no pain, at baseline to be very low‐certainty and were uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had an effect on proxy‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education. For participants with mild to moderate pain at baseline, we found low‐certainty evidence that an algorithm‐based pain management intervention may reduce proxy‐rated pain intensity in comparison with usual care (MD ‐1.49, 95% CI ‐2.11 to ‐0.87, 1 study, 128 participants; Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale‐Chinese version, range 0 to 10), but may not be more effective than pain education (MD ‐0.2, 95% CI ‐0.79 to 0.39, 1 study, 383 participants; Iowa Pain Thermometer, range 0 to 12). 
For challenging behaviour, we found very low‐certainty evidence from one study in which mean pain scores indicated no pain, or almost no pain, at baseline. We were uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had any more effect than education for nursing staff on challenging behaviour of participants (MD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐1.88 to 1.46, 1 study, 170 participants; Cohen‐Mansfield Agitation Inventory‐Chinese version, range 7 to 203). 
None of the studies systematically assessed adverse effects or serious adverse effects and no study reported information about the occurrence of any adverse effect. None of the studies assessed any of the other outcomes of this review. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no clear evidence for a benefit of an algorithm‐based pain management intervention in comparison with pain education for reducing pain intensity or challenging behaviour in people with dementia in nursing homes. We found that the intervention may reduce proxy‐rated pain compared with usual care. However, the certainty of evidence is low because of the small number of studies, small sample sizes, methodological limitations, and the clinical heterogeneity of the study populations (e.g. pain level and cognitive status). The results should be interpreted with caution. Future studies should also focus on the implementation of algorithms and their impact in clinical practice. 
","## Understanding Pain in People with Memory Loss

### Rationale

Many older adults live in nursing homes. Some of these folks have memory loss, also known as dementia. They often hurt, but their pain is not always treated well.

Pain makes life harder for people with memory loss. It can also lead to other health problems. Sometimes, pain can make people act out. They might become restless or angry.

We want to find new ways to help these people. One idea is to use a step-by-step plan. This plan would help nurses find and treat pain. It uses different ways to ease pain. Some ways do not use medicine. Others do.

This study looks at how well this plan works. We want to see if it lessens pain. We also want to see if it helps with difficult behaviors. This plan could make a big difference for people with memory loss.

### Trial Design

We looked at past studies. These studies tested a step-by-step plan for pain. The plan included checking for pain first. Then, it had at least two steps to treat pain. These steps could be without medicine or with medicine. It also checked if the treatment worked.

The studies compared this plan to normal care. Some studies compared it to teaching nurses about pain. We looked for studies where people were chosen by chance.

We included studies about people with memory loss in nursing homes. We looked at how much pain they felt. We also looked at how they acted. We wanted to know if the plan caused any bad effects.

Two people checked each study. They made sure the studies were good. We wrote down what we found. We did not have enough studies to put all the numbers together. So, we told the story of what we learned.

### Results

We found three studies. These studies included 808 people in total. Their ages ranged from 82 to 89 years old. Some had severe memory loss. Others had mild to moderate memory loss.

The step-by-step plans were a bit different in each study. Two studies compared the plan to teaching nurses about pain. One study compared it to normal care.

In one study, many people did not have much pain to start with. So, it was hard to tell if the plan helped their pain.

Another study looked at people who had some pain. We saw that the plan might not change their pain much. This was when compared to teaching nurses.

When nurses or family members rated pain, we saw something new. For people with some pain, the plan might reduce pain. This was when compared to normal care. But, it might not be better than teaching nurses about pain.

For difficult behaviors, we were not sure. We did not find clear proof that the plan helped more than teaching nurses.

No study looked closely at bad side effects. So, we do not know if the plan caused any harm.

In short, we did not find strong proof that the step-by-step plan works better than teaching nurses. It might help reduce pain when compared to normal care. But we need more studies to be sure. The studies we found were small. They also had some weak points. So, we must be careful with these results. More studies should look at how these plans work in real life.","Step‐by‐step (algorithm‐based) pain management for people with dementia living in nursing homes 
What is the aim of this review? 
We were interested in how nurses can best manage pain in people with dementia living in nursing homes. Pain management involves measuring pain and providing pain treatment if necessary. We aimed to find out whether step‐by‐step guidance (an algorithm) for nurses on how to manage pain can reduce pain or behaviours that may indicate someone is in distress (such as hitting, shouting or wandering). 
What was studied in the review? 
People with dementia in nursing homes often experience pain. However, they cannot always tell their caregivers if they are in pain, so it can be difficult to recognise, and we know that nursing home residents with dementia receive less pain medication than those without dementia. Untreated pain can have a negative impact on well‐being and health, and can also be one reason for challenging behaviour, such as aggression. The use of detailed step‐by‐step guidance for nursing staff, in this review called an algorithm, is designed to improve pain management. Algorithms start with a structured pain assessment and then set out different treatment steps, which can be non‐medication or medication treatments for reducing pain. If pain is detected, the treatment described in the first step is applied. If this treatment does not reduce pain, the treatment from the next step is applied, and so on. 
Studies included in the review 
In June 2021 we searched for trials that investigated pain management based on the use of an algorithm. We found three studies including 808 participants. Two of these studies compared algorithm‐based pain management with education for the nursing staff on pain and dementia, and one study compared algorithm‐based pain management with usual care. 
The level of pain and the severity of the participants' dementia differed in the three studies. One study included all the residents in the nursing homes, most of whom had no pain, or almost no pain, at the start of the study (fewer than half of the included people experienced pain), and two studies included only people with mild to moderate pain. In one study the participants' dementia was of mild or moderate severity and in two studies the participants had severe dementia. 
In two studies, those people with dementia who were able to do so reported on their own pain and the nursing staff also judged whether the participants showed signs of pain. In the third study, pain was rated by members of the research team, but not by the participants themselves. The nurses and the researchers used observations of things like facial expressions, gestures and breathing to judge whether someone was in pain. 
What are the key findings? 
When we looked at the study in which people started out on average with no pain, or almost no pain, we could not be certain whether algorithm‐based pain management had an effect on the intensity of pain they experienced during the study. This was true whether the study participants reported on their own pain or whether nurses judged pain intensity. We also could not tell from this study whether algorithm‐based pain management reduced challenging behaviour. 
For people who started out with mild to moderate pain, we found that, compared to education for nursing staff, algorithm‐based pain management may have little or no effect on pain intensity reported by the people themselves (based on the results from one study). When the pain was rated by somebody else (a 'proxy', who was a nurse or research assistant), we found that algorithm‐based pain management may be better than usual care, although it may not be more effective than pain education. However, it is difficult to be sure about the accuracy of pain ratings made by other people. 
Our confidence in the results was limited because of the small number of included studies, the variation in the intensity of pain and in the severity of the participants' dementia at the start of the trials, and the quality of the studies. 
No study looked for harmful effects, and no study described that any harmful effects occurred. 
What is the conclusion? 
We found no good evidence that introducing an algorithm to guide pain management for people with dementia in nursing homes is any better than education for nursing staff for reducing pain or challenging behaviours, but it may be better than usual care at reducing pain (rated by observers). The amount of evidence was small, and we could not be certain of the results. More research in this area would be valuable.

10.1002-14651858.CD013465.pub2,"Background
Human milk as compared to formula reduces morbidity in preterm infants but requires fortification to meet their nutritional needs and to reduce the risk of extrauterine growth failure. Standard fortification methods are not individualized to the infant and assume that breast milk is uniform in nutritional content. Strategies for individualizing fortification are available; however it is not known whether these are safe, or if they improve outcomes in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To determine whether individualizing fortification of breast milk feeds in response to infant blood urea nitrogen (adjustable fortification) or to breast milk macronutrient content as measured with a milk analyzer (targeted fortification) reduces mortality and morbidity and promotes growth and development compared to standard, non‐individualized fortification for preterm infants receiving human milk at < 37 weeks' gestation or at birth weight < 2500 grams. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 9), in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Daily and Versions(R); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), on September 20, 2019. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for pertinent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomized trials. 
Selection criteria
We considered randomized, quasi‐randomized, and cluster‐randomized controlled trials of preterm infants fed exclusively breast milk that compared a standard non‐individualized fortification strategy to individualized fortification using a targeted or adjustable strategy. We considered studies that examined any use of fortification in eligible infants for a minimum duration of two weeks, initiated at any time during enteral feeding, and providing any regimen of human milk feeding. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were collected using the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. Two review authors evaluated the quality of the studies and extracted data. We reported analyses of continuous data using mean differences (MDs), and dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
Data were extracted from seven RCTs, resulting in eight publications (521 total participants were enrolled among these studies), with duration of study interventions ranging from two to seven weeks. As compared to standard non‐individualized fortification, individualized (targeted or adjustable) fortification of enteral feeds probably increased weight gain during the intervention (typical mean difference [MD] 1.88 g/kg/d, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26 to 2.50; 6 studies, 345 participants), may have increased length gain during the intervention (typical MD 0.43 mm/d, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.53; 5 studies, 242 participants), and may have increased head circumference gain during the intervention (typical MD 0.14 mm/d, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.23; 5 studies, 242 participants). Compared to standard non‐individualized fortification, targeted fortification probably increased weight gain during the intervention (typical MD 1.87 g/kg/d, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.58; 4 studies, 269 participants) and may have increased length gain during the intervention (typical MD 0.45 mm/d, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57; 3 studies, 166 participants). Adjustable fortification probably increased weight gain during the intervention (typical MD 2.86 g/kg/d, 95% CI 1.69 to 4.03; 3 studies, 96 participants), probably increased gain in length during the intervention (typical MD 0.54 mm/d, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.7; 3 studies, 96 participants), and increased gain in head circumference during the intervention (typical MD 0.36 mm/d, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.5; 3 studies, 96 participants). We are uncertain whether there are differences between individualized versus standard fortification strategies in the incidence of in‐hospital mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, culture‐proven late‐onset bacterial sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, osteopenia, length of hospital stay, or post‐hospital discharge growth. No study reported severe neurodevelopmental disability as an outcome. One study that was published after our literature search was completed is awaiting classification. 
Authors' conclusions
We found moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence suggesting that individualized (either targeted or adjustable) fortification of enteral feeds in very low birth weight infants increases growth velocity of weight, length, and head circumference during the intervention compared with standard non‐individualized fortification. Evidence showing important in‐hospital and post‐discharge clinical outcomes was sparse and of very low certainty, precluding inferences regarding safety or clinical benefits beyond short‐term growth. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Better Milk for Tiny Babies

### Plain Title
Making Breast Milk Better for Preterm Babies

### Rationale
Babies born too early, called preterm babies, often need special care. Their bodies are still growing and need extra help. Giving these babies human milk is very good for them. It helps them avoid getting sick. But human milk alone may not have all the food tiny babies need to grow big and strong. This can cause them to grow too slowly.

To help them grow, we add extra food to the milk. This is called fortification. But often, we give all babies the same amount of extra food. We do not check what each baby needs. We also do not check what is in the mother's milk. We think each baby's milk and needs might be different.

This study looked at new ways to add food to milk. These new ways try to give each baby the right amount of extra food. One way looks at the baby's blood. Another way checks the milk itself. We want to see if these new ways help babies grow better. We also want to know if they are safe for these tiny babies.

### Trial Design
This study asked: ""How do we make sure tiny babies get the right food?"" We looked at many past studies. These studies looked at preterm babies. These babies were born before 37 weeks. Or they weighed less than 5.5 pounds at birth. All these babies drank only human milk.

The studies compared two ways of feeding. One way was the usual way. It gave all babies the same extra food. The new ways gave babies special food. This was based on their needs or their mother's milk. The babies in these studies got extra food for at least two weeks. We looked at how well babies grew. We also looked at if they got sick. We collected all this information to see what worked best.

### Results
We looked at seven studies. These studies included 521 babies. The studies lasted from two to seven weeks. We found some good news.

When babies got special, tailored milk, they grew more. They gained more weight each day. They also grew longer and their heads grew bigger. This was better than the usual way of adding food to milk.

The special milk helped babies gain about 1.88 grams more weight each day. They also grew about 0.43 millimeters longer each day. Their heads grew about 0.14 millimeters bigger each day. These are small amounts but very important for tiny babies.

We also found that looking at the milk itself helped. Babies gained more weight and grew longer. Checking the baby's blood also helped a lot. These babies gained even more weight and length. Their heads also grew bigger.

We are not sure yet if these new ways stop babies from getting sick. We do not know if they help babies after they leave the hospital. More studies are needed to learn about these things.

But what we do know is important. Giving babies special, tailored milk helps them grow better in the short term. This is a big step forward for our tiny babies.","Individualized versus standard diet fortification for growth and development in very low birth weight infants receiving human milk 
Review question: does individualized rather than standard, non‐individualized addition of nutrients and calories to breast milk feeds safely improve growth and other outcomes in preterm infants? 
Background: preterm infants are at risk for poor growth following birth. Breast milk reduces their risk of illness but does not meet their nutritional needs. Therefore, breast milk fed to preterm infants must be fortified with extra nutrients. Usual methods of fortifying breast milk treat all breast milk and all preterm infants the same. However, two methods are available for individualizing fortification for each preterm infant. Targeted fortification adds nutrients to breast milk based on the results of breast milk analysis. Adjustable fortification adds nutrients based on the results of preterm infant laboratory results. Individualized fortification may improve preterm infant growth or other outcomes. However, it is not known whether targeted or adjustable fortification is safe or improves outcomes for preterm infants compared with the standard method. 
Study characteristics: through literature searches updated to September 2019, we found seven studies that tested the effects of targeted or adjustable fortification of breast milk feeds compared to standard fortification in preterm infants, yielding eight publications (521 total participants were enrolled in these studies). One study that was published after our literature search was completed is awaiting classification. 
Key results: targeted or adjustable fortification improves short‐term growth compared to standard fortification in preterm infants. Determining the best way to customize breast milk feeds is necessary, as is clarifying its safety and effects on other clinical outcomes. 
Certainty of evidence: very low to moderate. Moderate certainty means that the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants is likely to be close to the result of this review but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty means that the true effect may be substantially different from the results of this review. Very low certainty means that the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants is likely to be substantially different from the results of this review. Certainty of evidence was downgraded most often in this review due to small numbers of participants in included studies and significant differences in study design and outcome measures among included studies.

Leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg that can last weeks, months or even years. Most leg ulcers are the result of venous diseases. First‐line treatment options often include the use of compression bandages or stockings. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of using compression bandages or stockings, compared with no compression, on the healing of venous leg ulcers in any setting and population. 
Search methods
In June 2020 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions by language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that compared any types of compression bandages or stockings with no compression in participants with venous leg ulcers in any setting. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, and risk‐of‐bias assessment using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool. We assessed the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE methodology. 
Main results
We included 14 studies (1391 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 51 participants). Participants were recruited from acute‐care settings, outpatient settings and community settings, and a large proportion (65.9%; 917/1391) of participants had a confirmed history or clinical evidence of chronic venous disease, a confirmed cause of chronic venous insufficiency, or an ankle pressure/brachial pressure ratio of greater than 0.8 or 0.9. The average age of participants ranged from 58.0 to 76.5 years (median: 70.1 years). The average duration of their leg ulcers ranged from 9.0 weeks to 31.6 months (median: 22.0 months), and a large proportion of participants (64.8%; 901/1391) had ulcers with an area between 5 and 20 cm2. Studies had a median follow‐up of 12 weeks. Compression bandages or stockings applied included short‐stretch bandage, four‐layer compression bandage, and Unna's boot (a type of inelastic gauze bandage impregnated with zinc oxide), and comparator groups used included 'usual care', pharmacological treatment, a variety of dressings, and a variety of treatments where some participants received compression (but it was not the norm). Of the 14 included studies, 10 (71.4%) presented findings which we consider to be at high overall risk of bias. 
Primary outcomes 
There is moderate‐certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias) (1) that there is probably a shorter time to complete healing of venous leg ulcers in people wearing compression bandages or stockings compared with those not wearing compression (pooled hazard ratio for time‐to‐complete healing 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 3.10; I2 = 59%; 5 studies, 733 participants); and (2) that people treated using compression bandages or stockings are more likely to experience complete ulcer healing within 12 months compared with people with no compression (10 studies, 1215 participants): risk ratio for complete healing 1.77, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.21; I2 = 65% (8 studies with analysable data, 1120 participants); synthesis without meta‐analysis suggests more completely‐healed ulcers in compression bandages or stockings than in no compression (2 studies without analysable data, 95 participants). 
It is uncertain whether there is any difference in rates of adverse events between using compression bandages or stockings and no compression (very low‐certainty evidence; 3 studies, 585 participants). 
Secondary outcomes 
Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that people using compression bandages or stockings probably have a lower mean pain score than those not using compression (four studies with 859 participants and another study with 69 ulcers): pooled mean difference −1.39, 95% CI −1.79 to −0.98; I2 = 65% (two studies with 426 participants and another study with 69 ulcers having analysable data); synthesis without meta‐analysis suggests a reduction in leg ulcer pain in compression bandages or stockings, compared with no compression (two studies without analysable data, 433 participants). Compression bandages or stockings versus no compression may improve disease‐specific quality of life, but not all aspects of general health status during the follow‐up of 12 weeks to 12 months (four studies with 859 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
It is uncertain if the use of compression bandages or stockings is more cost‐effective than not using them (three studies with 486 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
If using compression bandages or stockings, people with venous leg ulcers probably experience complete wound healing more quickly, and more people have wounds completely healed. The use of compression bandages or stockings probably reduces pain and may improve disease‐specific quality of life. There is uncertainty about adverse effects, and cost effectiveness. 
Future research should focus on comparing alternative bandages and stockings with the primary endpoint of time to complete wound healing alongside adverse events including pain score, and health‐related quality of life, and should incorporate cost‐effectiveness analysis where possible. Future studies should adhere to international standards of trial conduct and reporting. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title

Compression helps leg sores heal faster and hurt less.

### Rationale

Leg ulcers are open sores on the lower leg. These sores can last a long time, even years. They often come from vein problems. These sores can be painful and make it hard to do daily tasks. They are a big problem for many patients.

Doctors often use tight bandages or stockings to treat these sores. These are called compression. We wanted to see if compression helps these sores heal better. We also wanted to see if it makes them hurt less. We believe compression helps blood flow better and reduces swelling. This could help the sores close up.

This study looks at how well compression works. It compares compression to not using it. We want to know if it helps people get better.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many small studies. These studies compared people who used compression to people who did not.

The people in these studies had open leg sores. Their age ranged from 58 to 76 years old. Most were around 70 years old. Many of them had vein problems. Their sores had been open for a long time, from a few weeks to almost three years. Most sores were about the size of a small candy bar.

The studies followed people for about three months. Some types of compression used were tight bandages or special stockings. Some people got ""usual care,"" which means they did not get special compression.

### Results

We looked at 14 studies with a total of 1391 people.

**What we found:**

*   **Faster healing:** People who used compression healed faster. Their sores closed up more quickly.
*   **More healing:** More people had their sores fully heal within a year if they used compression. For every 100 people without compression, about 177 people with compression had their sores fully heal.
*   **Less pain:** People who used compression had less pain. Their pain scores were lower.
*   **Better daily life:** Compression might help people feel better about their leg sores. This means it could improve their quality of life.

**What we are not sure about:**

*   We do not know if compression causes more side effects. We need more study on this.
*   We also do not know if compression is cheaper in the long run.

**In summary:**

If you have leg sores, compression bandages or stockings will likely help them heal faster. More people will also see their sores close up completely. Compression also helps reduce pain. It might make your daily life better too. More research is needed to learn about side effects and cost.","Compression bandages or stockings versus no compression for treating venous leg ulcers
Key messages 
Compared with not using compression, compression therapy that uses bandages or stockings to treat venous leg ulcers: 
‐ probably heals venous leg ulcers more quickly;
‐ probably increases the number of people whose ulcer has completely healed after 12 months; 
‐ probably reduces pain; and
‐ may improve some aspects of people’s quality of life.
However, there is still uncertainty about whether or not compression therapy causes unwanted side effects, and if the health benefits of using compression outweigh its cost. 
What are leg ulcers? 
Leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg that can last weeks, months or even years. Most leg ulcers are caused by venous diseases that affect the circulation of blood in leg veins. Venous leg ulcers can cause distress and pain to patients, and can be very costly to the health service. 
What did we want to find out? 
Standard treatment options for venous leg ulcers often include compression therapy. This involves applying external pressure around the lower leg to help the return of blood from the legs to the heart. Compression therapy uses bandages, stockings or other devices. 
We wanted to find out if compression therapy delivered by bandages and stockings compared with no compression: 
‐ heals venous leg ulcers;
‐ has any unwanted effects;
‐ improves people’s quality of life;
‐ has health benefits that outweigh the costs (cost‐effectiveness); and
‐ reduces pain.
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where the treatment or care people receive is chosen at random). This type of study design provides the most reliable health evidence about the effects of a treatment. We searched for studies that evaluated the effects of any types of compression bandages or stockings compared with no compression in people affected with venous leg ulcers in any care setting. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 14 studies (1391 people, average age: 70.1 years) that lasted on average for 12 weeks. People in eight of the 14 studies were treated in outpatient and community settings. People had venous leg ulcers that had lasted for 22 months on average, and most ulcers had an area between 5 and 20 cm2. 
The studies used three types of compression therapy: short‐stretch bandage, four‐layer compression bandage, and Unna's boot (a type of compression bandage containing zinc oxide). These therapies were compared with no compression in forms of 'usual care', pharmacological treatment, a variety of dressings, and a variety of treatments where only some participants received compression (but it was not the norm). 
(1) Venous leg‐ulcer healing and unwanted effects  
Compared with no compression, the evidence suggests that:
‐ people wearing compression bandages or stockings probably experience complete ulcer healing more quickly; and 
‐ more people treated using the compression bandages or stockings are likely to experience complete ulcer healing within 12 months. 
However, we did not find clear evidence to tell if using compression bandages or stockings causes any unwanted effects. 
(2) Other effects  
The evidence suggests that, compared with not using compression, the use of compression bandages or stockings: 
‐ probably reduces pain more than not using compression; and
‐ may improve some aspects of people’s quality of life in 12 weeks to 12 months.
However, we are uncertain if the use of compression bandages or stockings results in health benefits that outweigh their costs. 
What limited our confidence in the evidence? 
Most studies were small (51 people on average) and 10 of the 14 included studies used methods that could introduce errors in their results.

10.1002-14651858.CD011749.pub2,"Medicines to treat delirium in critically ill adult patients
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence from randomized controlled trials for the benefits and safety of all prescription medicines used to treat critically ill adult patients with delirium in the intensive care units (ICUs) of hospitals. 
Background 
Delirium is commonly associated with surgery, infection, or critical illness. It is experienced as new‐onset, generally short‐term inability to think clearly. Patients with delirium shift between periods of clear thinking and periods of agitation and/or great sleepiness and confusion. Lack of sleep, pain, a noisy environment, physical restraint, and the use of sedatives and strong analgesics are some of the contributing factors. Delirium affects both immediate and longer‐term health outcomes of critically ill patients as it can increase the length of time a breathing machine is required, time spent in the ICU and in hospital, and the chance of functional weakening and death. The odds of a poor outcome with delirium are increased with frail patients and those of advanced age and already present cognitive difficulties. Frequently, delirious ICU patients are given medicines to help treat symptoms such as agitation. 
Study characteristics 
This review is current to 21 March 2019. We found 14 randomized controlled studies that enrolled a total of 1844 adult participants. Six different classes of medicines were tested. These were antipsychotic drugs used as tranquillizers in ten studies; the sedative alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine in three studies; statins that reduce cholesterol in two studies; opioids as part of pain management in one study; serotonin antagonists for nausea and vomiting in one study; and cholinesterase inhibitors, which are medicines for Alzheimer's disease, in one study. Ten studies compared medicine to placebo ‐ an inactive medicine also known as a sugar pill; four studies compared different drugs. Eleven studies with 1153 participants reported on the main outcome of this review ‐ duration of delirium. 
Key findings 
When drug classes were directly compared with placebo, only the alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine was found to reduce the duration of delirium, and the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine was found to prolong the duration of delirium. Each of these results is based on findings from a single small study. The other drugs when compared to placebo did not change delirium duration. The Review authors used the statistical method of network meta‐analysis to compare the six different drug classes. Dexmedetomidine was ranked most effective in reducing delirium duration, followed by atypical antipsychotics. However, network meta‐analysis of delirium duration failed to rule out the possibility of no difference for all six drug classes compared to placebo. Using this method, we did not find that any drug improved the duration of coma, length of stay, long‐term cognitive outcomes, or death. The alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine shortened time spent on a breathing machine. Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or were rare when reported. An analysis of reported events showed that events were similar to those reported with placebo. We found 10 ongoing studies and six studies awaiting classification that, once published and assessed, may change the conclusions of this review. 
Quality of the evidence 
Most of the included studies were small but of good design. Nine of the 14 studies were considered to have low risk of bias. 
","## Plain Title
Medicines to Treat Confusion in Very Sick Adults

## Rationale
Being very sick can cause a problem called delirium. This means a person has trouble thinking clearly. They may switch between being awake and restless, or very sleepy and confused. Delirium can happen after surgery or due to an infection. It makes it hard for people to rest and heal.

This problem can make people stay in the hospital longer. It can also make it harder for them to get better. Older people or those who already have trouble thinking are more at risk. Doctors often give medicines to help with the confusion or restlessness.

This study looked at different medicines. We wanted to see if they help treat delirium. We also checked if these medicines were safe to use. We hoped to find a medicine that could help people think clearly sooner.

## Trial Design
This study reviewed other studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means they compared a medicine to a fake medicine (a sugar pill) or to another medicine.

The studies included sick adults. These adults were in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital. They all had delirium. We looked at 14 studies in total. There were 1844 adult patients in these studies.

The studies tested six kinds of medicines. These included medicines used for calm, sleep, cholesterol, pain, nausea, and Alzheimer's disease. We looked at how long people had delirium. We also checked for any bad side effects. This review included studies up to March 21, 2019. Each person in these studies was there for the time it took to see how the medicine worked. This could be days or weeks.

## Results
We looked at all the different medicines. One medicine, called dexmedetomidine, seemed to help. It made delirium shorter for patients. This medicine is a type of sleep aid. However, this finding came from only one small study. Another medicine, rivastigmine (for Alzheimer's), actually made delirium last longer. This also came from one small study.

Other medicines did not change how long people had delirium. We also used a special method to compare all the medicines. This method suggested dexmedetomidine was best. But we could not be sure if any medicine was truly better than a sugar pill.

We did not find any medicine that helped with a coma, how long someone stayed in the hospital, or thinking problems later on. Dexmedetomidine did help people spend less time on a breathing machine.

Most studies did not report many bad side effects. When they did, the side effects were about the same as with a sugar pill. This means the medicines were generally safe.

Overall, many studies were small. But they were well-designed. This review helps us know more about treating delirium. We need more studies to be certain. We found 10 new studies that are still going on. Their results might change what we know in the future.","Medicines to treat delirium in critically ill adult patients

10.1002-14651858.CD013297.pub2,"Background
Epiretinal membrane is an abnormal sheet of avascular fibrocellular tissue that develops on the inner surface of the retina. Epiretinal membrane can cause impairment of sight as a consequence of progressive distortion of retinal architecture. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of surgery compared to no intervention for epiretinal membrane.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, ISRCTN registry, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. The databases were last searched on 20 May 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing surgical removal of idiopathic epiretinal membrane compared to placebo, no treatment or sham treatment. Paired or within‐person studies were included, as well as those where both eyes of a single participant were treated. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods expected by Cochrane, and assessed certainty using the GRADE system. We considered the following five outcome measures: mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study eye between baseline (before randomisation), 6 months and 12 months later; proportion of people with a gain of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity in the study eye as measured by a logMAR chart at a starting distance of 4 m at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation; proportion of people with a loss of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity in the study eye as measured by a logMAR chart at a starting distance of 4 m at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation; mean quality of life score at 6 months and 12 months following surgery, measured using a validated questionnaire; and any harm identified during follow‐up. 
Main results
We included one study in the review. This was a RCT including 53 eyes of 53 participants with mild symptomatic epiretinal membrane and BCVA of 65 or more Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. Participants were randomly allocated to immediate surgery or to watchful waiting with deferred surgery if indicated by evidence of disease progression. The study was limited by imprecision owing to the small number of participants and was at some risk of bias owing to inconsistencies in the time points for outcome assessment and in the management of lens opacity. 
At 12 months, the visual acuity in the immediate surgery group was higher by a mean of 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.0 to 6.2 ETDRS letters; 53 participants; low‐certainty evidence) than the watchful waiting/deferred surgery group. 
The evidence of the effect of immediate surgery on gains of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.93; 53 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
At 12 months, no participant in either group sustained a loss of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity (53 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
The included study did not measure quality of life.
At 12 months, no serious adverse event was identified in any participant. One participant developed chronic minimal cystoid macular oedema following immediate surgery (53 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We found no RCT that directly investigated the effect of surgery compared to no intervention. For severe disabling epiretinal membrane, the lack of a RCT comparing surgery to no intervention may reflect evidence from non‐randomised studies in favour of surgery; a RCT may be considered unnecessary and ethically unacceptable because a superior effect of surgery is widely accepted. For mild symptomatic epiretinal membrane, however, the value of surgery is uncertain. Low‐certainty evidence from this review suggests that watchful waiting or deferred surgery may offer outcomes as favourable as immediate surgery. However, this finding needs to be confirmed in further RCTs with appropriate statistical power, masking of treatment allocation, consistent management of cataract, and measurement of outcomes including patient‐reported quality of life over a more extended time frame. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study abstract:

## Clear Vision: Surgery for Eye Membrane Study

### Rationale

Your eye has a thin layer at the back called the retina. This layer helps you see. Sometimes, a thin film or ""membrane"" can grow on the retina. This is called an epiretinal membrane. It can pull on the retina. This pulling can make your vision blurry or distorted. It can make it hard to see clearly. This problem can make it hard to do daily tasks.

Doctors are not sure if surgery is always the best choice for this eye problem. For severe cases, surgery is often done. But for mild cases, it's not clear. This study wanted to see if surgery helps more than not having surgery right away. We wanted to know if surgery can make vision better.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies that were done before. We looked for studies that compared surgery to not having surgery. These studies are called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people are put into groups by chance. One group might get surgery. The other group might not get surgery right away.

We looked for studies that included adults with epiretinal membrane. The studies checked their vision before and after. They also looked at their quality of life. This means how the problem affects their daily life. We looked for any problems or side effects from the surgery. We searched many places for these studies. We looked for studies up to May 20, 2020.

### Results

We found only one study that fit our needs. This study looked at 53 people. Each person had one eye with a mild epiretinal membrane. Their vision was only a little blurry.

Some people had surgery right away. Others waited to see if their vision got worse. If their vision got worse, they could have surgery later.

After 12 months, vision was slightly better in the group that had surgery right away. But this difference was very small. It was not clear if surgery really made a big change.

No one in either group lost a lot of vision. We did not find any big problems from surgery. One person had a minor swelling in their eye after surgery. This swelling went away. The study did not ask people about their daily quality of life.

The study had a small number of people. It was hard to be sure about the results. The doctors concluded that for mild cases, waiting to see might be as good as having surgery right away. More studies are needed to be sure. These studies need more people. They also need to look at how people's daily lives are affected.","What are the benefits and risks of surgery for epiretinal membrane (a disease of the eye)? 
Why is this question important?An epiretinal membrane is an abnormal layer of tissue that develops at the back of the eye. It affects around one in five people aged 75 years and older. In most people, the development of an epiretinal membrane is linked to the normal ageing processes in the eye and is described as 'idiopathic'. In other instances, epiretinal membrane is caused by a pre‐existing condition affecting the retina, such as inflammation or poor circluation. Epiretinal membrane can also develop after eye surgery. 
Epiretinal membrane typically forms over the part of the eye responsible for seeing fine detail (the macula). In some people, this does not affect vision. In others, it causes distorted or blurred vision, which can affect people’s quality of life. For example, an epiretinal membrane may impair people’s ability to read or drive. 
If an epiretinal membrane affects vision, it is commonly removed by surgery. A local anaesthetic (medication) is used to numb the eye area. As with any procedure, this surgery carries risks of harm from side effects. These include potential problems such as cataract, detached retina, infection and bleeding in the eye. 
To understand when the benefits of surgery outweigh its risks, we reviewed the research evidence. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched the medical literature for studies: 
‐ in which epiretinal membrane was not caused by a pre‐existing condition or surgery;
‐ that compared the effects of surgery against no surgery or a placebo (sham) procedure; and 
‐ where people were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a group that underwent surgery for epiretinal membrane, and a group that did not have surgery for epiretinal membrane. 
We then summarised the evidence and rated our confidence in it, based on factors such as study methods and size. 
What did we find?We found only one study that met our criteria. This study took place in Denmark and included 53 people who had epiretinal membranes causing mild impairment of sight. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Those in one group had immediate surgery. Those in the other group were watched closely and in the event of any deterioration in their condition were invited to have surgery. People in both groups were followed up for one year. 
The study results suggest that immediate surgery for epiretinal membrane causing mild impairment of sight: 
‐ may not benefit vision 12 months after surgery; and
‐ may not lead to serious unwanted effects. One person treated with immediate surgery experienced an unwanted effect that was not considered serious. This was the development of an eye condition caused by fluid building up at the back of the eye. 
The study did not investigate the impact of surgery on participants’ quality of life.
How confident are we in the evidence?We are not confident in the evidence, because: 
‐ it is based on one small study; and
‐ some of the methods used by the researchers who conducted it may have introduced errors in its results. 
What does this mean?For epiretinal membrane causing severe disabling impairment of sight, we found no carefully‐controlled study that measured the effect of surgery. For severe epiretinal membrane, surgery is widely considered to improve the outcome and is routine practice. A carefully controlled trial comparing surgery to no treatment is considered unecessary and ethically inappropriate. 
For epiretinal membrane causing mild impairment of sight, however, the effect of surgery is uncertain. There is some evidence that the outcome of watchful waiting may be as good as the effect of immediate surgery. However, the evidence is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions. Further studies that use robust methods and measure outcomes including quality of life in the longer term would help to determine effect of surgery with more confidence. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to May 2020.

Drowning is responsible for an estimated 320,000 deaths a year, and over 90% of drowning mortality occurs in low‐ to middle‐income countries (LMICs), with peak drowning rates among children aged 1 to 4 years. In this age group, mortality due to drowning is particularly common in rural settings and about 75% of drowning accidents happen in natural bodies of water close to the home. Providing adequate child supervision can protect children from drowning, and organized formal day care programs could offer a way to achieve this. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
• To assess the effects of day care programs for children under 6 years of age on drowning‐related mortality or morbidity, or on total drowning accidents (fatal and non‐fatal), in LMICs, compared to no day care programs or other drowning prevention interventions 
Secondary objectives 
• To assess the effects of day care programs in LMICs for children under 6 years of age on unsafe water exposure 
• To assess safety within these programs (e.g. transmission of infection within day care, physical or sexual abuse of children within day care) 
• To assess the incidence of unintentional injury within these programs
• To describe the cost‐effectiveness of such programs, in relation to averted drowning‐related mortality or morbidity 
Search methods
On November 23, 2019, and for an update on August 18, 2020, we searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, CENTRAL, ERIC, and CINAHL, as well as two trial registries. On December 16, 2019, and for an update on February 9, 2021, we searched 12 other resources, including websites of organizations that develop programs targeted to children. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized, quasi‐randomized, and non‐randomized controlled studies (with explicitly listed specific study design features) that implemented formal day care programs as a single program or combined with additional out‐of‐day care components (such as educational activities aimed at preventing injury or drowning or early childhood development activities) for children of preschool age (below 6 years of age) in LMICs for comparison with no such programs or with other drowning prevention interventions. Studies had to report at least one outcome related to drowning or injury prevention for the children enrolled. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection and data extraction, as well as risk of bias and GRADE assessment. 
Main results
Two non‐randomized observational studies, conducted in rural Bangladesh, involving a total of 252,631 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review. One of these studies compared a formal day care program combined with parent education, playpens provided to parents, and community‐based activities as additional out‐of‐day care components versus no such program. Overall we assessed this study to be at moderate risk of bias (moderate risk of bias due to confounding, low risk of bias for other domains). This study showed that implementation of a formal day care program combined with parent education, provision of playpens to parents, and community‐based activities, in a rural area with a high drowning incidence, likely reduces the risk of death from drowning over the study period of 4 years and 8 months compared to no day care program (hazard ratio 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06 to 0.58; 1 study, 136,577 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Drowning morbidity (non‐fatal drowning resulting in complications), total drowning (fatal and non‐fatal), unsafe water exposure, and program safety (e.g. transmission of infection within day care, physical or sexual abuse of children within day care) were not reported, nor was the incidence of other unintentional injuries. Cost‐effectiveness was reported as 812 USD (95% CI 589 to 1777) per disability‐adjusted life‐year averted as a consequence of drowning (moderate‐certainty evidence). The second study compared day care programs with or without playpens provided to parents as an additional component versus only playpens provided to parents as an alternative drowning prevention intervention. Overall we assessed the study to be at critical risk of bias because we judged bias due to confounding to be at critical risk. As the certainty of evidence was very low, we are uncertain about the effects on drowning mortality rate of implementing a day care program compared to providing playpens (rate ratio 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study; 76,575 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Likewise, we are uncertain about the effects of a day care program with playpens provided as an additional component versus playpens provided alone (rate ratio 0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.12; 1 study, 45,460 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The other outcomes of interest ‐ drowning morbidity, total drowning, unsafe water exposure, program safety, incidence of other unintentional injuries, and cost‐effectiveness ‐ were not reported. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides evidence suggesting that a day care program with additional out‐of‐day care components such as community‐based education, parent education, and playpens provided to parents likely reduces the drowning mortality risk in regions with a high burden of drowning compared to no intervention. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Day Care Can Help Keep Young Kids Safe From Drowning

### Rationale

Each year, about 320,000 people die from drowning. Most of these deaths happen in poor countries. Young children, ages 1 to 4, are most at risk. Many drowning accidents happen near their homes, in water like ponds or rivers.

Parents watching their kids closely can help prevent drowning. Day care programs could be a good way to keep kids safe. This study looked at if day care helps protect young children from drowning in poor countries.

### Trial Design

This study asked: ""How do day care programs keep kids safe?""

We looked at past studies. These studies checked day care programs for children under 6 years old. These kids lived in poorer countries. The studies compared kids in day care to kids not in day care. Some day care programs also taught parents about safety or gave them playpens.

We looked for studies that reported how many kids drowned or got hurt. We also checked if the day care programs were safe. We checked how much the programs cost.

We looked at research from big medical websites. We searched for studies up to early 2021.

### Results

We found two studies from Bangladesh. These studies looked at over 250,000 children. The children lived in farming areas.

One study looked at a day care program. This program also taught parents, gave them playpens, and did things in the community. This program likely lowered the risk of kids dying from drowning over nearly 5 years. This was compared to having no day care. For every 100 kids who might drown without day care, only 18 would drown with this program. This is good news for kids.

This program also cost about $812 to prevent one year of disability due to drowning. This means it was a good value. This study did not report on other things, like how many kids had close calls with drowning. It also did not report on how safe the day care itself was.

The second study looked at day care with or without playpens. It compared this to only giving parents playpens. It is not clear if day care by itself helps more than just giving playpens. We cannot be sure because this study had some issues.

Our main finding is that day care, especially with extra support for families, seems to make a big difference. It can lower the risk of drowning deaths for young kids. This is important in places where many kids drown.","Can day care programs for children under 6 years of age in low‐ to middle‐income countries reduce their risk of drowning? 
Key message 
A day care program with extra features such as community‐based education, parent education, and playpens provided to parents outside the day care facility probably reduces the risk of death by drowning for children under 6 years living in areas where large numbers of children drown each year. 
Why did we do this Cochrane Review? 
Children living in rural areas near open water are at risk of drowning, particularly if they are not attending school or are left unsupervised. Child supervision is recommended to prevent drowning accidents, and organized day care at a center outside the home could help. 
We wanted to know if a day care program for children under 6 years of age in low‐ to middle‐income countries might help to reduce the number of drowning accidents (fatal and non‐fatal). 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the effects of a day care program on drowning accidents in children under 6 years of age. The day care program could include features such as educational activities aimed at preventing injuries or drowning and early childhood development activities. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We included evidence published up to August 18, 2020.
What did we find? 
We found 2 studies that involved 252,631 children and took place in rural Bangladesh.
One study lasted 4 years and 8 months. It assessed the effects of a day care program that combined parent education, playpens provided to parents, and community education as compared to the effects of no day care program. 
The other study lasted 3 years and 4 months. The effects of a day care program alone and the effects of a combined program of day care with playpens provided to parents were each compared with the effects of only playpens provided to parents. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Compared with no day care program, a day care program for children under 6 years of age, combined with parent education, playpens for parents, and community education, probably reduces the risk of death from drowning (evidence from 1 study in 136,577 children). For every 100,000 children under 6 years of age who were not in the day care program, 77 children might die from drowning, compared with 14 children included in the day care program. 
Providing this day care program with additional activities was cheaper than the cost of every year lost to illness, disability, or early death by drowning (evidence from 1 study in 136,577 children). 
We are uncertain about the effects of a day care program when compared with playpens provided to parents, and we are uncertain about the effects of a day care program combined with playpens for parents when compared with playpens alone. 
Neither study reported results on non‐fatal drowning accidents, unsafe water exposure, the safety of the program, or other accidental injuries. 
Limitations of the evidence 
The results were from two observational studies in which researchers observed the effects of a factor (such as a day care program) without trying to change who did, or did not, experience it. Evidence from observational studies is not as reliable as evidence from randomized controlled studies, in which the programs people receive are decided at random. 
We are moderately confident about the effects of a day care program (with extra features) on the risk of death by drowning in children under 6 years of age. Further research is likely to increase our confidence in these results.

10.1002-14651858.CD013756.pub2,"Background
Implanted spinal neuromodulation (SNMD) techniques are used in the treatment of refractory chronic pain. They involve the implantation of electrodes around the spinal cord (spinal cord stimulation (SCS)) or dorsal root ganglion (dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS)), and a pulse generator unit under the skin. Electrical stimulation is then used with the aim of reducing pain intensity. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness, adverse events, and cost‐effectiveness of implanted spinal neuromodulation interventions for people with chronic pain. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Web of Science (ISI), Health Technology Assessments, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry from inception to September 2021 without language restrictions, searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SNMD interventions with placebo (sham) stimulation, no treatment or usual care; or comparing SNMD interventions + another treatment versus that treatment alone. We included participants ≥ 18 years old with non‐cancer and non‐ischaemic pain of longer than three months duration. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were disability, analgesic medication use, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and health economic outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened database searches to determine inclusion, extracted data and evaluated risk of bias for prespecified results using the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Outcomes were evaluated at short‐ (≤ one month), medium‐ four to eight months) and long‐term (≥12 months). Where possible we conducted meta‐analyses. We used the GRADE system to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included 15 unique published studies that randomised 908 participants, and 20 unique ongoing studies. All studies evaluated SCS. We found no eligible published studies of DRGS and no studies comparing SCS with no treatment or usual care. We rated all results evaluated as being at high risk of bias overall. For all comparisons and outcomes where we found evidence, we graded the certainty of the evidence as low or very low, downgraded due to limitations of studies, imprecision and in some cases, inconsistency. 
Active stimulation versus placebo  
SCS versus placebo (sham)  
Results were only available at short‐term follow‐up for this comparison.
Pain intensity 
Six studies (N = 164) demonstrated a small effect in favour of SCS at short‐term follow‐up (0 to 100 scale, higher scores = worse pain, mean difference (MD) ‐8.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐15.67 to ‐1.78, very low certainty). The point estimate falls below our predetermined threshold for a clinically important effect (≥10 points). No studies reported the proportion of participants experiencing 30% or 50% pain relief for this comparison. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
The quality and inconsistency of adverse event reporting in these studies precluded formal analysis. 
Active stimulation + other intervention versus other intervention alone  
SCS + other intervention versus other intervention alone (open‐label studies)  
Pain intensity 
Mean difference  
Three studies (N = 303) demonstrated a potentially clinically important mean difference in favour of SCS of ‐37.41 at short term (95% CI ‐46.39 to ‐28.42, very low certainty), and medium‐term follow‐up (5 studies, 635 participants, MD ‐31.22 95% CI ‐47.34 to ‐15.10 low‐certainty), and no clear evidence for an effect of SCS at long‐term follow‐up (1 study, 44 participants, MD ‐7 (95% CI ‐24.76 to 10.76, very low‐certainty). 
Proportion of participants reporting ≥50% pain relief  
We found an effect in favour of SCS at short‐term (2 studies, N = 249, RR 15.90, 95% CI 6.70 to 37.74, I2 0% ; risk difference (RD) 0.65 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.74, very low certainty), medium term (5 studies, N = 597, RR 7.08, 95 %CI 3.40 to 14.71, I2 = 43%; RD 0.43, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.73, low‐certainty evidence), and long term (1 study, N = 87, RR 15.15, 95% CI 2.11 to 108.91 ; RD 0.35, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.49, very low certainty) follow‐up. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
Device related  
No studies specifically reported  device‐related adverse events at short‐term follow‐up. At medium‐term follow‐up, the incidence of lead failure/displacement (3 studies N = 330) ranged from 0.9 to 14% (RD 0.04, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.11, I2 64%, very low certainty). The incidence of infection (4 studies, N = 548) ranged from 3 to 7% (RD 0.04, 95%CI 0.01, 0.07, I2 0%, very low certainty). The incidence of reoperation/reimplantation (4 studies, N =5 48) ranged from 2% to 31% (RD 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.21, I2 86%, very low certainty). One study (N = 44) reported a 55% incidence of lead failure/displacement (RD 0.55, 95% CI 0.35, 0 to 75, very low certainty), and a 94% incidence of reoperation/reimplantation (RD 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07, very low certainty) at five‐year follow‐up. No studies provided data on infection rates at long‐term follow‐up. 
We found reports of some serious adverse events as a result of the intervention. These included autonomic neuropathy, prolonged hospitalisation, prolonged monoparesis, pulmonary oedema, wound infection, device extrusion and one death resulting from subdural haematoma. 
Other  
No studies reported the incidence of other adverse events at short‐term follow‐up. We found no clear evidence of a difference in otherAEs at medium‐term (2 studies, N = 278, RD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.06, I2 0%) or long term (1 study, N = 100, RD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.02) follow‐up. 
Very limited evidence suggested that SCS increases healthcare costs. It was not clear whether SCS was cost‐effective. 
Authors' conclusions
We found very low‐certainty evidence that SCS may not provide clinically important benefits on pain intensity compared to placebo stimulation. We found low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence that SNMD interventions may provide clinically important benefits for pain intensity when added to conventional medical management or physical therapy. SCS is associated with complications including infection, electrode lead failure/migration and a need for reoperation/re‐implantation. The level of certainty regarding the size of those risks is very low. SNMD may lead to serious adverse events, including death. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of DRGS for chronic pain. 
","## Plain Title
Looking at Nerve Stimulation for Long-Term Pain

## Rationale
Many people live with chronic pain. This pain lasts for a long time. It can make daily life very hard. It stops people from doing things they enjoy. This pain is not from cancer or blood flow problems.

Doctors use special devices to help this pain. These devices are put under the skin. They send small electric pulses to nerves. This is called spinal neuromodulation (SNMD). It aims to lower pain.

This study looked at how well these devices work. We also checked for bad side effects. We wanted to see if they help people with long-term pain. We also looked at the cost.

## Trial Design
This study looked at other studies. These were good quality studies. They compared SNMD to other treatments. Some studies gave a fake treatment. This is like a sugar pill.

We looked at people age 18 or older. All had pain for more than three months. The pain was not from cancer. It was not from a lack of blood flow.

We looked at how much pain people had. We also looked at bad events. We checked how pain affected their life. We checked if they used less pain medicine. We looked at how long people felt better. This was short term (1 month or less). This was medium term (4 to 8 months). This was long term (12 months or more).

## Results
We looked at 15 studies that were done. These studies had 908 people. All studies looked at spinal cord stimulation (SCS). We found no studies on a different type of nerve stimulation. We also found no studies that compared SCS to no treatment.

All the studies we looked at had some problems. The results were not very clear. We do not know for sure how much these devices help.

When SCS was used alone, pain relief was small. This was compared to the fake treatment. It was not enough to make a big difference for most people. This was only looked at for a short time.

When SCS was added to other treatments, it helped more. People had less pain. This was true for short and medium times. It did not seem to help as much for a long time. Many more people felt much better with SCS. About 15 out of 100 people felt a lot better in the short term. About 7 out of 100 people felt a lot better in the medium term.

These devices can cause problems. Some common problems were:
* The wires moved or broke. About 1 to 14 out of 100 people had this.
* Infections. About 3 to 7 out of 100 people got an infection.
* More surgeries were needed. About 2 to 31 out of 100 people needed another surgery.

Some very serious problems happened. These included nerve damage. Some people stayed in the hospital longer. One person died from a bleeding in the brain.

We did not find clear proof that SCS saves money.

In short, SCS may help with pain for some people. This is especially when it is added to other care. But the benefits are not always clear. There are also risks of problems. Some of these can be serious. We need more and better studies to be sure.","What are the benefits and risks of electrical spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain in adults? 
Why this question is important 
Persistent (chronic) pain is a common problem that affects people from all walks of life. It can be the result of a wide range of different medical conditions and is sometimes unexplained, but it often causes substantial suffering, distress and disability and can have major impacts on a person's quality of life. 
Implanted spinal neuromodulation (SNMD) interventions involve surgically implanting wires (electrodes) into the space around nerves or the spinal cord that are connected to a ""pulse generator"" device which is usually implanted under the patient's skin. This delivers electrical stimulation to the nerves or spinal cord. It is thought that this stimulation interferes with danger messages being sent to the spinal cord and brain with the goal of reducing the perception of pain. Once implanted with a SNMD device people live with the device implanted, potentially on a permanent basis. We reviewed the evidence to find out whether these interventions were effective at reducing pain, disability and medication use, at improving quality of life and to find out the risk and type of complications they might cause. There are two broad types of SNMD: spinal cord stimulation (SCS), where electrodes are placed near the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) where electrodes are placed near the nerve root, where the nerve branches off from the spinal cord. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed the certainty of the evidence. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we rated the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found 15 published studies that included 908 people with persistent pain due to a variety of causes including nerve disease, chronic low back pain, chronic neck pain and complex regional pain syndrome. All of these studies evaluated SCS; no studies evaluated DRGS. 
Eight studies (that included 205 people) compared SCS with a sham (placebo) stimulation, where the electrodes were implanted, but no stimulation was delivered. Six studies that included 684 people compared SCS added with either medical management or physical therapy with medical management or physical therapy on its own. We rated the evidence as being of low, or very low certainty. Limitations in how the studies were conducted and reported, the amount of evidence we found and inconsistency between studies in some instances means that our confidence in the results is limited. 
The evidence suggests the following.
Compared to receiving medical management or physical therapy alone, people treated with the addition of SCS may experience less pain and higher quality of life after one month or six months of stimulation. There is limited evidence to draw conclusions in the long term of one year or more. It is unclear whether SCS reduces disability or medication use. 
Compared to a sham (placebo) stimulation, SCS may result in small reductions in pain intensity in the short term that may not be clinically important, but this is currently unclear. There is no evidence at medium or long‐term follow‐up points. 
SCS can result in complications. These include movement or malfunction of the electrode wires, wound infections and the need for further surgical procedures to fix issues with the implanted devices. We also found instances of serious complications that included one death, nerve damage, lasting muscle weakness, lung injury, serious infection, prolonged hospital stay and the extrusion of a stimulation device through the skin. 
Very limited evidence around the costs and economics of SCS suggested that SCS increases the costs of healthcare. It was not clear whether SCS was cost‐effective. 
What this means 
SCS may reduce pain intensity in people with chronic pain. It is currently not clear how much of this effect is due to the SCS itself and how much is due to so‐called ""placebo"" effects, which are the result of the experience of undergoing the procedure and the person's expectations that it will help them. Receiving SCS does present a risk of relatively common complications and less common serious complications. We are currently unsure of the precise degree of this risk. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this review is current to September 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013307.pub3,"Background
Delirium is an acute neuropsychological disorder that is common in hospitalised patients. It can be distressing to patients and carers and it is associated with serious adverse outcomes. Treatment options for established delirium are limited and so prevention of delirium is desirable. Non‐pharmacological interventions are thought to be important in delirium prevention.  
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of non‐pharmacological interventions designed to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients outside intensive care units (ICU). 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, with additional searches conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization Portal/ICTRP to 16 September 2020. There were no language or date restrictions applied to the electronic searches, and no methodological filters were used to restrict the search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single and multicomponent non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised adults cared for outside intensive care or high dependency settings. We only included non‐pharmacological interventions which were designed and implemented to prevent delirium.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently examined titles and abstracts identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data from full‐text articles. Any disagreements on eligibility and inclusion were resolved by consensus. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcomes were: incidence of delirium; inpatient and later mortality; and new diagnosis of dementia. We included secondary and adverse outcomes as pre‐specified in the review protocol. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes and between‐group mean differences for continuous outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. A complementary exploratory analysis was undertaker using a Bayesian component network meta‐analysis fixed‐effect model to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the individual components of multicomponent interventions and describe which components were most strongly associated with reducing the incidence of delirium. 
Main results
We included 22 RCTs that recruited a total of 5718 adult participants. Fourteen trials compared a multicomponent delirium prevention intervention with usual care. Two trials compared liberal and restrictive blood transfusion thresholds. The remaining six trials each investigated a different non‐pharmacological intervention. Incidence of delirium was reported in all studies.  
Using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, we identified risks of bias in all included trials. All were at high risk of performance bias as participants and personnel were not blinded to the interventions. Nine trials were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors and three more were at unclear risk in this domain.  
Pooled data showed that multi‐component non‐pharmacological interventions probably reduce the incidence of delirium compared to usual care (10.5% incidence in the intervention group, compared to 18.4% in the control group, risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.71, I2 = 39%; 14 studies; 3693 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias).  
There may be little or no effect of multicomponent interventions on inpatient mortality compared to usual care (5.2% in the intervention group, compared to 4.5% in the control group, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.74, I2 = 15%; 10 studies; 2640 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision).  
No studies of multicomponent interventions reported data on new diagnoses of dementia. 
Multicomponent interventions may result in a small reduction of around a day in the duration of a delirium episode (mean difference (MD) ‐0.93, 95% CI ‐2.01 to 0.14 days, I2 = 65%; 351 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of multicomponent interventions on delirium severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.49, 95% CI ‐1.13 to 0.14, I2=64%; 147 participants; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and serious imprecision). Multicomponent interventions may result in a reduction in hospital length of stay compared to usual care (MD ‐1.30 days, 95% CI ‐2.56 to ‐0.04 days, I2=91%; 3351 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and inconsistency), but little to no difference in new care home admission at the time of hospital discharge (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.07; 536 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). Reporting of other adverse outcomes was limited.  
Our exploratory component network meta‐analysis found that re‐orientation (including use of familiar objects), cognitive stimulation and sleep hygiene were associated with reduced risk of incident delirium. Attention to nutrition and hydration, oxygenation, medication review, assessment of mood and bowel and bladder care were probably associated with a reduction in incident delirium but estimates included the possibility of no benefit or harm.  Reducing sensory deprivation, identification of infection, mobilisation and pain control all had summary estimates that suggested potential increases in delirium incidence, but the uncertainty in the estimates was substantial.  
Evidence from two trials suggests that use of a liberal transfusion threshold over a restrictive transfusion threshold probably results in little to no difference in incident delirium (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.36; I2 = 9%; 294 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias).  
Six other interventions were examined, but evidence for each was limited to single studies and we identified no evidence of delirium prevention.  
Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence regarding the benefit of multicomponent non‐pharmacological interventions for the prevention of delirium in hospitalised adults, estimated to reduce incidence by 43% compared to usual care. We found no evidence of an effect on mortality. There is emerging evidence that these interventions may reduce hospital length of stay, with a trend towards reduced delirium duration, although the effect on delirium severity remains uncertain. Further research should focus on implementation and detailed analysis of the components of the interventions to support more effective, tailored practice recommendations.  
","Here's a Plain Language Summary of the study abstract:

### Plain Title
Helping Hospital Patients Avoid Confusion and Stay Clear-Headed

### Rationale
Sometimes, people in the hospital get confused. This is called delirium. It can make them feel scared or upset. Their family may also worry. Delirium can cause other health problems. It is hard to treat once it starts. So, stopping it before it happens is key.

Doctors often use drugs to treat problems. But for delirium, simple actions may help a lot. This study looked at ways to prevent delirium without using medicines. We wanted to see if these actions could keep people from getting confused. We thought these simple steps could make a big difference for patients.

### Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies. We gathered information from these past studies. They were all about how to stop delirium. These studies included grown-up patients in the hospital. These patients were not in the intensive care unit. Each study tried different ways to prevent delirium. They compared these new ways to the usual care. Usual care is what hospitals normally do. The patients in these studies stayed in the hospital for different lengths of time. We checked to see if the new ways helped them avoid confusion.

### Results
We looked at 22 studies. These studies included over 5,700 adult patients. Many studies tested a few simple steps all at once. These steps helped stop delirium. Patients who got these steps were less likely to get confused. About 1 out of 10 patients in this group got delirium. In the usual care group, almost 2 out of 10 patients got delirium. This means the simple steps cut the chance of delirium by almost half.

These simple steps did not change how many patients died. They also did not cause new memory problems. Patients who got these steps might have been confused for a bit less time. They also might have stayed in the hospital for a shorter time. But more study is needed to be sure about this.

We also looked at what specific steps helped most. Things like helping patients know where they are, giving them mental tasks, and aiding good sleep seemed to help a lot. Making sure patients eat well, drink enough, get oxygen, and have their medicines checked also helped. Things like getting patients to move and managing their pain might need more study.

In short, simple actions that do not use medicine can greatly reduce delirium. These actions make a big difference for people in the hospital. We need to learn more about the best ways to use these steps. This can help hospitals keep patients clear-headed and healthy.","Non‐drug approaches for preventing delirium in adults receiving care in hospital outside of intensive care and high dependency units 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for non‐pharmacological (non‐medication‐based) approaches to prevent delirium in adults in hospital, not including those treated in intensive care units (ICU, specialised wards for the care of critically ill patients). 
Background 
Delirium is an important illness which is common among adults, especially older adults who are in hospital. It is sometimes referred to as an 'acute confusional state'. Typically, a person with delirium has sudden onset of confusion, which fluctuates, and often includes impaired concentration, memory and thinking skills; reduced awareness of surroundings; drowsiness or agitation and restlessness; and hallucinations, which are usually visual (seeing things which are not really there). It can be distressing for the individual with delirium and their family. It is also associated with increased risks of complications, such as dying in hospital, having a longer hospital stay, and requiring more care after discharge. Increasingly, there is evidence that delirium is associated with an increased risk of permanent worsening of memory and thinking skills, including development or worsening of dementia.  
Non‐pharmacological approaches are approaches which do not use medications, but which focus on other aspects of care. They are already recognised as important in reducing the risk of delirium, particularly multicomponent interventions which target several of the common risk factors for delirium. It is not known which components of these complex interventions are most important in preventing delirium and this was something we wanted to find out.  
Study characteristics 
We searched up to 16 September 2020 for reports of studies in which people in hospital were randomly allocated to a non‐pharmacological intervention intended to prevent delirium or to usual hospital care.  We found 22 studies with 5718 participants. Fourteen of the studies were of multicomponent approaches; two studies looked at different cut‐offs for giving a blood transfusion after an orthopaedic operation; the remaining six studies all considered different approaches. 
Key findings 
Multicomponent approaches probably reduce occurrence of delirium by 43% compared to usual hospital care. This means that two in five cases of delirium in adults in hospital wards (other than ICU) can be prevented by multicomponent, non‐pharmacological approaches. These interventions may also reduce the length of time people stay in hospital and, if delirium does occur, they may reduce the duration of the delirium episode by about a day. However, these approaches may have little or no effect on the risk of dying in hospital. The studies did not investigate the effect of multicomponent interventions on the development or worsening of dementia. There was little information about whether the interventions had any harmful effects.  
Using a new statistical technique, we found  that the following components within each intervention were most important for preventing delirium:  (a) trying to keep people well‐oriented to their surroundings and making their surroundings more familiar, (b) providing stimulation to memory and thinking skills, and (c) trying to improve sleep (through sleep hygiene measures). We could not be so certain about the effect of other components, largely because not enough evidence was available. More research is needed comparing the specific components included in multicomponent interventions to help determine the most effective and efficient ways to prevent delirium.  
The evidence for other, single‐component, non‐pharmacological interventions was very limited.  
Certainty of the evidence 
There were some limitations in the studies which may affect the results. In many included studies the people in the study and sometimes researchers were aware of who was and was not receiving the intervention.  
There was very little information about people living with dementia, who are at greater risk of experiencing delirium.

10.1002-14651858.CD009949.pub2,"Aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fractures
What is a radial head fracture? 
The radial head is the topmost part of the radius, which is one of the two forearm bones. The radial head is part of the elbow joint. Fracture or breaking of the radial head is the most common elbow fracture. This injury usually results from a fall onto an outstretched arm. The symptoms of a radial head fracture are pain, swelling and bruising around the elbow, as well as restricted movement. 
What is aspiration? 
One treatment for radial head fracture is aspiration. This is a procedure where a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain excess fluid and blood from the elbow joint to relieve pressure and thus, in theory, relieve pain and improve clinical outcome. However, aspiration is an invasive procedure that puts the patient at further risk of complications, such as infection and injury to nerves and vessels. The procedure is typically done in the first few days after injury. 
Aim of the review 
We aimed to assess the effects (benefits and harms) of aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fracture in adults. 
Description of the studies included in the review  We searched the medical literature up to April 2014 and found two relevant studies that reported results for a total of 108 people with radial head fractures. Most participants were adults, aged 30 or over. They generally had less serious fractures and were all treated without surgery. The two studies were small, poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Neither study used reliable measures to assess function or pain. Consequently, we are very unsure of the findings of these trials. 
Summary of the evidence 
Very low quality evidence showed little difference between those who had joint aspiration and those who did not in being unable to carry heavy loads or having discomfort when carrying loads using their previously injured arm at one year after injury. Very low quality evidence shows that aspiration often provides immediate pain relief and may still provide pain relief at three weeks. Neither trial reported on adverse events from the procedure, but aspiration was reported as being unsuccessful in three participants of one study. Very low quality evidence shows little effect of aspiration on being able to extend the elbow at either six weeks or one year. The reporting of adverse events was incomplete, but one trial reported the absence of three common complications of radial head fractures. 
Conclusions 
Overall, there is not enough evidence to say whether aspiration gives better short‐term or longer‐term results than no aspiration in treating radial head fractures or how safe it is. We suggest that further research is needed to examine the use of aspiration for the initial treatment of radial head fractures. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Draining Your Elbow for a Broken Bone

### Rationale

Your elbow has two main bones in your forearm. One of these bones is called the radius. The top part of the radius is called the radial head. This part is inside your elbow joint.

Sometimes, people break their radial head. This is the most common elbow break. It often happens when you fall and put your arm out to stop yourself. A broken radial head can cause a lot of pain. Your elbow might swell and bruise. It can also be hard to move your arm.

One way to treat a broken radial head is to drain the elbow. This is called aspiration. A doctor uses a clean needle and syringe. They pull out extra fluid and blood from your elbow. The idea is that this will lower pressure. This should help with pain. It might also help your arm heal better.

However, draining the elbow is a medical step. It can cause problems. You might get an infection. The needle could hurt nerves or blood vessels. Doctors usually do this a few days after the injury.

We wanted to learn if draining the elbow really helps. We looked at the good things and bad things about this treatment. We wanted to see if it makes a difference for adults with a broken radial head.

### Trial Design

This study looked at old research. We searched for medical papers until April 2014. We found two studies that fit what we were looking for. These studies included 108 people in total. All of them had a broken radial head.

Most people in these studies were adults. They were 30 years old or older. Their breaks were not too bad. No one in these studies had surgery for their break.

The two studies were small. They did not share enough details. It was hard to tell how good their results were. They did not use good ways to check for pain or how well people could move. So, we are not sure about what these studies found.

### Results

We found very weak evidence. It showed small differences for people who had their elbow drained. It also showed small differences for people who did not.

One year after the injury, people were checked. We looked at if they could lift heavy things. We also looked at if it hurt when they lifted things. There was not much difference between the two groups.

Very weak evidence showed that draining the elbow often helps with pain right away. It might still help with pain after three weeks.

The studies did not say if there were problems from the draining procedure. But in one study, draining did not work for three people.

Very weak evidence showed little effect on how far people could straighten their elbow. This was true at six weeks and at one year.

The studies did not fully report problems. But one study said that three common problems from a broken radial head did not happen.

In the end, we do not have enough proof. We cannot say if draining the elbow works better. We do not know if it helps in the short or long term. We also do not know how safe it is. More research is needed to learn about draining the elbow for new radial head breaks.","Aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fractures

10.1002-14651858.CD013876.pub3,"Background
Olfactory dysfunction is a common consequence of COVID‐19 infection and persistent symptoms can have a profound impact on quality of life. At present there is little guidance on how best to treat this condition. A variety of interventions have been suggested to promote recovery, including medication and olfactory training. However, it is uncertain whether any intervention is of benefit. This is an update of the 2021 review with one additional study added.  
Objectives
1) To evaluate the benefits and harms of any intervention versus no treatment for people with persisting olfactory dysfunction due to COVID‐19 infection.  
2) To keep the evidence up‐to‐date, using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the latest search was 20 October 2021.   
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with COVID‐19 related olfactory disturbance that had persisted for at least four weeks. We included any intervention compared to no treatment or placebo.  
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were the recovery of sense of smell, disease‐related quality of life and serious adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were the change in sense of smell, general quality of life, prevalence of parosmia and other adverse effects (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included two studies with 30 participants. The studies evaluated the following interventions: systemic corticosteroids plus intranasal corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant and palmitoylethanolamide plus luteolin.  
Systemic corticosteroids plus intranasal corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant compared to no intervention  
We included a single RCT with 18 participants who had anosmia for at least 30 days following COVID‐19 infection. Participants received a 15‐day course of oral corticosteroids combined with nasal irrigation (consisting of an intranasal corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant solution) or no intervention. Psychophysical testing was used to assess olfactory function at 40 days. This is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
Palmitoylethanolamide plus luteolin compared to no intervention  
We included a single RCT with 12 participants who had anosmia or hyposmia for at least 90 days following COVID‐19 infection. Participants received a 30‐day course of palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin or no intervention. Psychophysical testing was used to assess olfactory function at 30 days. This is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
Authors' conclusions
There is very limited evidence available on the efficacy and harms of treatments for persistent olfactory dysfunction following COVID‐19 infection. However, we have identified a number of ongoing trials in this area. As this is a living systematic review we will update the data regularly, as new results become available. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the abstract:

## 1. Plain Title

Finding Ways to Help People Smell Again After COVID-19

## 2. Rationale

Many people lose their sense of smell after getting sick with COVID-19. This problem is called olfactory dysfunction. It can make life much harder. It can change how food tastes. It can make it hard to enjoy daily life. People also worry about danger if they cannot smell smoke or gas.

Right now, doctors do not have clear ways to treat this problem. Some ideas have been tried. These include special medicines or smell training. But we do not know if these ideas truly help.

This study looked at different ways to help people get their sense of smell back. We wanted to see if any treatment worked better than no treatment. We also wanted to see if any treatments caused harm. This study helps doctors learn what works best.

## 3. Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This study is like a big look at many small studies. We call it a ""systematic review."" We searched for studies that were well-designed. These are called ""randomized controlled trials."" In these studies, some people get a treatment. Other people get no treatment or a dummy pill. This helps us see if the treatment really works.

We looked for studies about people who had lost their sense of smell. This problem had to be due to COVID-19. Their smell loss had to last for at least four weeks. We included people of different ages and health conditions. We did not specify gender in our search.

We wanted to see if a treatment helped people get their smell back. We also looked at how it changed their daily life. We checked for any bad effects from the treatments. We searched many places for these studies. We checked medical journals and study registries. The last search for new studies was on October 20, 2021.

## 4. Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

We found only two small studies that fit our rules. These studies looked at a total of 30 people.

One study had 18 people. They had lost their sense of smell for at least 30 days. Some people took steroid pills. They also used a special nose wash with medicine. Other people got no treatment. This study checked their sense of smell after 40 days.

The other study had 12 people. They had lost some or all of their sense of smell for at least 90 days. Some people took two special pills. These were called palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin. Other people got no treatment. This study checked their sense of smell after 30 days.

**What did we learn?**

Both studies were very small. Because of this, we cannot say much about the results. The quality of the information was very low. This means we cannot be sure if the treatments helped. We also cannot say if they caused harm.

**What do the researchers think?**

Right now, we do not have good proof that any treatment helps people get their sense of smell back after COVID-19. We also do not have good proof about any harms.

But there are more studies happening right now. We will keep looking for new information. As new results come out, we will update what we know. This will help doctors and patients in the future.","Interventions for the treatment of persistent smell disorders (olfactory dysfunction) after COVID‐19 infection 
Why this is important 
The sense of smell is critical to one's enjoyment of odours and tastes, and is important for safety. During the COVID‐19 pandemic there has been an increasing focus on change in sense of smell as one of the early symptoms associated with infection. This can be a reduction, change or complete loss of the sense of smell. For most people this is temporary, however for some this lasts weeks or even months. If a person has lost their sense of smell for a long time (over four weeks after having COVID‐19), we do not know if there are any treatments that might help it to recover.  
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
We searched the medical literature, identifying relevant studies and summarising the results. We assessed the quality of the studies as well as the certainty of the evidence. Factors influencing this included the size of the studies, the methods used to perform them and how results were reported by researchers. Based on this, we classed the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found two small studies to include in the review, including a total of 30 people. All participants had problems with their sense of smell that had lasted for at least four weeks, and started after a COVID‐19 infection. Problems with the sense of smell were identified using special smell identification tests carried out by the research team. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: those who would receive treatment and those who would not.  
The treatment in one study was a course of corticosteroid tablets ('systemic') and nasal irrigation (with a wash consisting of a mix of corticosteroids, decongestant and an agent that breaks down mucus). The second study used a course of a supplement known as palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin.  
Systemic corticosteroids and nasal irrigation (intranasal corticosteroids/decongestant/mucolytic) compared to no treatment 
We do not know whether corticosteroid tablets with nasal irrigation is better or worse than no treatment at: 
 ‐ restoring the sense of smell back to normal after 40 days; ‐ changing the sense of smell after 40 days; ‐ causing any unwanted side effects. 
This is because the evidence that we found was of very low certainty, mainly due to the fact that only one study was identified and it included a small number of patients. 
Palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin compared to no treatment 
We do not know whether palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin is better or worse than no treatment at: 
 ‐ restoring the sense of smell back to normal after 30 days; ‐ changing the sense of smell after 30 days; ‐ causing any unwanted side effects. 
This is because the evidence that we found was of very low certainty, mainly due to the fact that only one study was identified and it included a small number of patients. 
We did find a number of other studies that are being carried out, but no results from these studies are yet available to be included in this review. 
What this means 
It is unclear whether using corticosteroids with nasal irrigation, or using a palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin supplement, might treat problems with the sense of smell after COVID‐19, or whether these treatments can potentially cause harm. 
Other treatments are under investigation. This review is a 'living systematic review', meaning that we will keep checking for new studies that might be relevant, and the review will be continually updated when any extra results are available. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to October 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD012948,"Background
Pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) have increased rates of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Current clinical guidelines support elective birth, at or near term, because of increased perinatal mortality during the third trimester of pregnancy. 
This review replaces a review previously published in 2001 that included ""diabetic pregnant women"", which has now been split into two reviews. This current review focuses on pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) and a sister review focuses on women with gestational diabetes. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of planned birth (either by induction of labour or caesarean birth) at or near term gestation (37 to 40 weeks’ gestation) compared with an expectant approach, for improving health outcomes for pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes and their infants. The primary outcomes relate to maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (15 August 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised trials (including those using a cluster‐randomised design) and non‐randomised trials (e.g. quasi‐randomised trials using alternate allocation) which compared planned birth, at or near term, with an expectant approach for pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two of the review authors independently assessed study eligibility. In future updates of this review, at least two of the review authors will extract data and assess the risk of bias in included studies. We will also assess the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified no eligible published trials for inclusion in this review.
We did identify one randomised trial which examined whether expectant management reduced the incidence of caesarean birth in uncomplicated pregnancies of women with gestational diabetes (requiring insulin) and with pre‐existing diabetes. However, published data from this trial does not differentiate between pre‐existing and gestational diabetes, and therefore we excluded this trial. 
Authors' conclusions
In the absence of evidence, we are unable to reach any conclusions about the health outcomes associated with planned birth, at or near term, compared with an expectant approach for pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes. 
This review demonstrates the urgent need for high‐quality trials evaluating the effectiveness of planned birth at or near term gestation for pregnant women with pre‐existing (Type 1 or Type 2) diabetes compared with an expectant approach. 
","## Plain Title: When Should Moms with Diabetes Give Birth?

### Rationale

Moms who have diabetes before they get pregnant can have problems. These problems can hurt both the mom and her baby. Sometimes, babies born to moms with diabetes don't survive. This often happens in the last three months of pregnancy.

Doctors want to know the best time for these moms to have their babies. They want to know if planning the birth helps. Planning the birth means either starting labor or doing a C-section. This is usually done between 37 and 40 weeks of pregnancy. Or, is it better to wait for labor to start on its own? This is called waiting it out.

This study wants to find out which way is safer. It wants to know what helps moms and babies the most. We need to know if planning the birth stops problems from happening.

### Trial Design

This study looked for other studies. It looked for studies that compared two groups of pregnant women. One group had planned births. The other group waited for labor to start. All women in these studies had diabetes before pregnancy.

The study looked for tests called ""randomized trials."" These are studies where people are put into groups by chance. This makes the groups fair. The study also looked for other types of trials.

The goal was to see if planned birth was better. We wanted to see if it lowered harm to moms and babies. We looked for things like moms dying or getting very sick. We also looked for babies dying or getting very sick. This study searched many medical databases for past research.

### Results

We looked for many studies. We searched in many places. But we did not find any studies that fit our needs. We did not find any good studies that compared these two ways of birth. There was one study we found. But it did not tell us what we needed to know. It mixed up moms with diabetes before pregnancy with other moms. So we could not use it.

Because we found no studies, we cannot say what is best. We cannot say if planned birth is better. We also cannot say if waiting it out is better. We need more research to answer this question.

This means doctors do not yet know the best advice for these moms. We need good studies to find this out. We need studies that look at moms with diabetes before pregnancy. We need to know if planning birth at 37 to 40 weeks is safer. Or if waiting for labor to start on its own is safer. This will help many moms and babies.","Planned birth at or near term for improving health outcomes for pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes and their infants 
What is the issue? 
The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out if planning an elective birth at or near the term of pregnancy, compared to waiting for labour to start spontaneously, has an impact on the health of women with diabetes and the health of their babies. This review focuses on women who have diabetes before becoming pregnant (pre‐existing diabetes). Elective birth is carried out either by induction of labour or caesarean section, and 'at or near term' means 37 to 40 weeks' gestation. 
To answer this question, we searched for all relevant studies (date of search: 15 August 2017), with the aim of collecting and analysing them together. 
Why is this important? 
When women with diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) become pregnant they are at higher risk of complications than women who do not have diabetes. For example, their babies may be larger and have a higher risk of death in the later weeks of pregnancy. Because of these risks, many clinicians have recommended that women with diabetes have an elective birth (usually by induction) at or near term (37 to 40 weeks' gestation), rather than waiting for labour to start spontaneously or until 41 weeks' gestation if all is well. Induction has the disadvantage of increasing the incidence of forceps or ventouse births, and women often find it difficult to cope with an induced labour. Caesarean section is a major operation which can lead to blood loss, infections and increased chance of problems with subsequence births. Early birth can increase the chance of breathing problems for babies. It is important to know which approach to birth has a better impact on the health outcomes of women with pre‐existing diabetes and their babies. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found no studies that addressed our specific question.
What does this mean? 
In the absence of randomised studies, we are unable to say if women with pre‐existing diabetes and their babies experience better health outcomes if they have a planned birth (by induction of labour or caesarean section at 37 to 40 weeks' gestation) compared to waiting for labour to begin spontaneously or until 41 weeks' gestation if all is well. More research is needed to answer this question.

10.1002-14651858.CD011899.pub2,"Background
Chronic exposure to stress has been linked to several negative physiological and psychological health outcomes. Among employees, stress and its associated effects can also result in productivity losses and higher healthcare costs. In‐person (face‐to‐face) and computer‐based (web‐ and mobile‐based) stress management interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing stress in employees compared to no intervention. However, it is unclear if one form of intervention delivery is more effective than the other. It is conceivable that computer‐based interventions are more accessible, convenient, and cost‐effective. 
Objectives
To compare the effects of computer‐based interventions versus in‐person interventions for preventing and reducing stress in workers. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, NIOSHTIC, NIOSHTIC‐2, HSELINE, CISDOC, and two trials registers up to February 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled studies that compared the effectiveness of a computer‐based stress management intervention (using any technique) with a face‐to‐face intervention that had the same content. We included studies that measured stress or burnout as an outcome, and used workers from any occupation as participants. 
Data collection and analysis
Three authors independently screened and selected 75 unique studies for full‐text review from 3431 unique reports identified from the search. We excluded 73 studies based on full‐text assessment. We included two studies. Two review authors independently extracted stress outcome data from the two included studies. We contacted study authors to gather additional data. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to report study results. We did not perform meta‐analyses due to variability in the primary outcome and considerable statistical heterogeneity. We used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
Two studies met the inclusion criteria, including a total of 159 participants in the included arms of the studies (67 participants completed computer‐based interventions; 92 participants completed in‐person interventions). Workers were primarily white, Caucasian, middle‐aged, and college‐educated. Both studies delivered education about stress, its causes, and strategies to reduce stress (e.g. relaxation or mindfulness) via a computer in the computer‐based arm, and via small group sessions in the in‐person arm. Both studies measured stress using different scales at short‐term follow‐up only (less than one month). Due to considerable heterogeneity in the results, we could not pool the data, and we analysed the results of the studies separately. The SMD of stress levels in the computer‐based intervention group was 0.81 standard deviations higher (95% CI 0.21 to 1.41) than the in‐person group in one study, and 0.35 standard deviations lower (95% CI ‐0.76 to 0.05) than the in‐person group in another study. We judged both studies as having a high risk of bias. 
Authors' conclusions
We found very low‐quality evidence with conflicting results, when comparing the effectiveness of computer‐based stress management interventions with in‐person stress management interventions in employees. We could include only two studies with small sample sizes. We have very little confidence in the effect estimates. It is very likely that future studies will change these conclusions. 
","## A Look at Stress Help: Online vs. In-Person

### Rationale

Being stressed for a long time can harm your body and mind. Workers who feel stressed may not work as well. They may also cost more in health care.

Many ways help workers with stress. Some ways are face-to-face with a person. Other ways use computers or phones. Both ways can lower stress.

But we do not know which way works better. Computer-based help might be easier to use. It could also cost less money. This study looked at which way helps more. We wanted to see if computer help works as well as in-person help.

### Trial Design

This study asked: ""Which stress help works better for workers, online or in person?""

We looked for other studies that had already compared these two ways. We only picked studies that randomly put people into groups. One group got help online. The other group got help face-to-face. Both groups got the same kind of help.

We looked at studies where people were workers. They could be from any job. The studies had to measure stress or feeling burnt out.

We looked through many research papers. We found over 3,000 papers. Then we picked 75 studies to read more closely. In the end, we only used two studies for our review.

These two studies had a total of 159 workers. About 67 people used computer help. About 92 people used in-person help. The workers were mostly white, middle-aged, and had been to college. The studies lasted less than one month.

### Results

We found two studies that met our rules. These studies taught workers about stress. They also taught ways to lower stress. This included things like relaxing or being mindful. One study taught this online. The other study taught it in small groups.

Both studies checked stress levels. They used different ways to measure stress. They only checked stress for a short time.

The results from the two studies were very different. In one study, computer help led to more stress than in-person help. In the other study, computer help led to less stress than in-person help.

Because the results were so different, we could not combine them. We looked at each study by itself. We also found that both studies had problems that could affect their results.

We have very little trust in these findings. There were only two small studies. Their results did not agree. It is very likely that future studies will find different answers. We need more and better studies to know which method is truly better for workers.","Computer‐based versus in‐person stress management programmes for workers
What is the aim of this review? 
We wanted to find out if stress management programmes at work had a different effect if they were given via a computer, compared to being given in person. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. We found two studies that studied the effect of the delivery method on stress reduction in workers. 
Key messages 
The effects of the delivery method on stress reduction were unclear. More research should be conducted to directly compare equivalent stress management programmes delivered via a computer and in‐person. Any future studies will likely affect the conclusions of this review. 
What was studied in the review?  Many employers wish to reduce stress in their employees and are willing to invest in stress management programmes. It has been shown that workplace stress management programmes can reduce stress in employees, either when delivered by a computer or mobile device, or by a live person. However, it is unclear if the delivery method itself impacts how effective the programme is. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the intervention delivery method (computer or in person) to reduce stress in workers. 
What are the results of the review? 
We found two studies, involving 159 employees, that looked at stress levels in workers after completing stress management programmes on a computer, compared to workers receiving that same programme content from a live person. Both studies taught participants, individually or in small groups, how to recognise and reduce stress, but had conflicting results. 
How up to date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to February 2017.

10.1002-14651858.CD014641,"Background
Tuberculosis is the primary cause of hospital admission in people living with HIV, and the likelihood of death in the hospital is unacceptably high. The Alere Determine TB LAM Ag test (AlereLAM) is a point‐of‐care test and the only lateral flow lipoarabinomannan assay (LF‐LAM) assay currently commercially available and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). A 2019 Cochrane Review summarised the diagnostic accuracy of LF‐LAM for tuberculosis in people living with HIV. This systematic review assesses the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on mortality and other patient‐important outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on mortality in adults living with HIV in inpatient and outpatient settings. 
To assess the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on other patient‐important outcomes in adults living with HIV, including time to diagnosis of tuberculosis, and time to initiation of tuberculosis treatment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (Ovid); Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), BIOSIS Previews, Scopus, LILACS; ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the WHO ICTRP up to 12 March 2021. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials that compared a diagnostic intervention including LF‐LAM with diagnostic strategies that used smear microscopy, mycobacterial culture, a nucleic acid amplification test such as Xpert MTB/RIF, or a combination of these tests. We included adults (≥ 15 years) living with HIV. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility, extracted data, and analysed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized studies. We contacted study authors for clarification as needed. We used risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a fixed‐effect model except in the presence of clinical or statistical heterogeneity, in which case we used a random‐effects model. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included three trials, two in inpatient settings and one in outpatient settings. All trials were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa and assessed the impact of diagnostic strategies that included LF‐LAM on mortality when the test was used in conjunction with other tuberculosis diagnostic tests or clinical assessment for clinical decision‐making in adults living with HIV. 
Inpatient settings  
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy likely reduces mortality in people living with HIV at eight weeks compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (pooled RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.94; 5102 participants, 2 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence). That is, people living with HIV who received LF‐LAM had 15% lower risk of mortality. The absolute effect was 34 fewer deaths per 1000 (from 14 fewer to 55 fewer). 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy probably results in a slight increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (pooled RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.69; 5102 participants, 2 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Outpatient settings 
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality in people living with HIV at six months compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11; 2972 participants, 1 trial; low‐certainty evidence). Although this trial did not detect a difference in mortality, the direction of effect was towards a mortality reduction, and the effect size was similar to that in inpatient settings.  
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may result in a large increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (RR 5.44, 95% CI 4.70 to 6.29, 3022 participants, 1 trial; low‐certainty evidence). 
Other patient‐important outcomes 
Assessment of other patient‐important and implementation outcomes in the trials varied. The included trials demonstrated that a higher proportion of people living with HIV were able to produce urine compared to sputum for tuberculosis diagnostic testing; a higher proportion of people living with HIV were diagnosed with tuberculosis in the group that received LF‐LAM; and the incremental diagnostic yield was higher for LF‐LAM than for urine or sputum Xpert MTB/RIF. 
Authors' conclusions
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic testing strategy likely reduces mortality and probably results in a slight increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. The reduction in mortality may be due to earlier diagnosis, which facilitates prompt treatment initiation. In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality and may result in a large increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. Our results support the implementation of LF‐LAM to be used in conjunction with other WHO‐recommended tuberculosis diagnostic tests to assist in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis in people living with HIV. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title
A Quick Test Can Help People with HIV Who Also Have TB

### Rationale
Tuberculosis, or TB, is a serious illness. It makes many people with HIV sick enough to go to the hospital. Sadly, too many of these patients die in the hospital.

Doctors need faster ways to find TB in people with HIV. A quick urine test called AlereLAM might help. This test can find signs of TB in a person's pee. The World Health Organization (WHO) says this test is good.

This study looked at how using AlereLAM affects patients. We wanted to see if it helps people with HIV live longer. We also wanted to see if it helps them start TB treatment sooner. A quicker diagnosis could mean faster treatment. This might save lives.

### Trial Design
We wanted to know how well the AlereLAM test works. So, we looked at other studies. These studies were good quality research. They compared AlereLAM to other ways of finding TB. These other ways include looking at spit under a microscope or other lab tests.

The studies we looked at included adults. These adults were 15 years old or older. They all had HIV. Some studies looked at patients in the hospital. Others looked at patients visiting a clinic. We gathered all the information from these studies. Then we looked for patterns in the results.

### Results
We found three main studies to include. Two studies looked at people in the hospital. One study looked at people visiting a clinic. All studies were in Africa. They looked at how AlereLAM changed patient care.

**For Patients in the Hospital:**
Using AlereLAM likely saved lives. People with HIV who got the AlereLAM test were less likely to die. Their risk of dying was 15% lower. This means 34 fewer deaths for every 1000 patients. This is good news. Also, more patients likely started TB treatment. The AlereLAM test helped doctors find TB faster. This led to quicker treatment.

**For Patients Visiting a Clinic:**
Using AlereLAM may also help save lives. While not a huge difference, fewer people died. The results were similar to those in the hospital. Even better, many more patients started TB treatment. The AlereLAM test helped find TB in more people. This meant more people got the medicine they needed.

**Other Good News:**
It was easier for people to give a pee sample than a spit sample. The AlereLAM test found more cases of TB. It was better than some other quick tests.

In short, using AlereLAM with other tests is helpful. It can help doctors find TB fast in people with HIV. This can lead to quick treatment. This quick treatment helps save lives.","Impact of diagnostic strategies for tuberculosis using lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan test in people living with HIV 
What was the aim of this review? 
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in people living with HIV. The disease is particularly difficult to diagnose in people living with HIV, in part because it is often challenging to produce sputum for diagnosis. The lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan test (LF‐LAM) is a World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended rapid test to assist in the detection of active tuberculosis in people living with HIV. This review is limited to studies that used the Alere Determine TB LAM Ag test (AlereLAM), which is the only LF‐LAM test currently recommended by the WHO; thus LF‐LAM refers only to AlereLAM in this review. Rapid and early tuberculosis diagnosis may allow for prompt treatment and prevent severe illness and death. The aim of this review was to determine whether the use of LF‐LAM testing had an effect on death and other patient‐important outcomes in people living with HIV. 
Key messages 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic testing strategy likely reduces deaths and probably results in a slight increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV.  
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce deaths and may result in a large increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. 
What was studied in the review? 
We searched for trials in adults (15 years and older) that evaluated the effect of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy that included the LF‐LAM test compared to standard care using other WHO‐recommended diagnostic tests in adults living with HIV. 
What were the main results of the review? 
We identified three trials, two in inpatient settings and one in outpatient settings.
Inpatient settings 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy likely reduces mortality in people living with HIV at eight weeks compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (2 trials, 5102 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy probably results in a slight increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (2 trials, 5102 participants moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Outpatient settings 
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality in people living with HIV at six months compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (1 trial, 2972 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may result in a large increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (1 trial, 3022 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Other patient‐important outcomes 
The included studies assessed other patient‐important outcomes in different ways. The studies demonstrated that more people living with HIV were able to produce urine compared to sputum for tuberculosis diagnostic testing, and more people living with HIV were diagnosed with tuberculosis in the group that received LF‐LAM. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
We searched for relevant trials up to 12 March 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013817.pub2,"Background
Glaucoma is a group of optic neuropathies characterized by progressive degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells, axonal loss and irreversible visual field defects. Glaucoma is classified as primary or secondary, and worldwide, primary glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Several subtypes of glaucoma exist, and primary open‐angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common. The etiology of POAG is unknown, but current treatments aim to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP), thus preventing the onset and progression of the disease. Compared with traditional antiglaucomatous treatments, rho kinase inhibitors (ROKi) have a different pharmacodynamic. ROKi is the only current treatment that effectively lowers IOP by modulating the drainage of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal. As ROKi are introduced into the market more widely, it is important to assess the efficacy and potential AEs of the treatment. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of ROKi with placebo or other glaucoma medication in people diagnosed with open‐angle glaucoma (OAG), primary open‐angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). 
Search methods
We used standard Cochrane methods and searched databases on 11 December 2020.
Selection criteria
We included randomized clinical trials examining commercially available ROKi‐based monotherapy or combination therapy compared with placebo or other IOP‐lowering medical treatments in people diagnosed with (P)OAG or OHT. We included trials where ROKi were administered according to official glaucoma guidelines. There were no restrictions regarding type, year or status of the publication. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias by using Cochrane's RoB 2 tool.  
Main results
We included 17 trials with 4953 participants diagnosed with (P)OAG or OHT. Fifteen were multicenter trials and 15 were masked trials. All participants were aged above 18 years. Trial duration varied from 24 hours to 12 months. Trials were conducted in the USA, Canada and Japan. Sixteen trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies, and one trial provided no information about funding sources. The trials compared ROKi monotherapy (netarsudil or ripasudil) or combination therapy with latanoprost (prostaglandin analog) or timolol (beta‐blocker) with placebo, timolol, latanoprost or netarsudil. Reported outcomes were IOP and safety. Meta‐analyses were applied to 13 trials (IOP reduction from baseline) and 15 trials (ocular AEs).  
Of the trials evaluating IOP, seven were at low risk, three had some concerns, and three were at high risk of bias. Three trials found that netarsudil monotherapy may be superior to placebo (mean difference [MD] 3.11 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.59 to 3.62; I2 = 0%; 155 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Evidence from three trials found that timolol may be superior to netarsudil with an MD of 0.66 mmHg (95% CI 0.41 to 0.91; I2 = 0%; 1415 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Evidence from four trials found that latanoprost may be superior to netarsudil with an MD of 0.97 mmHg (95% CI 0.67 to 1.27; I2 = 4%; 1283 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Evidence from three trials showed that, compared with monotherapy with latanoprost, combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost probably led to an additional pooled mean IOP reduction from baseline of 1.64 mmHg (95% CI −2.16 to −1.11; 1114 participants). Evidence from three trials showed that, compared with monotherapy with netarsudil, combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost probably led to an additional pooled mean IOP reduction from baseline of 2.66 mmHg (95% CI −2.98 to −2.35; 1132 participants). The certainty of evidence was moderate. One trial showed that,  compared with timolol monotherapy, combination therapy with ripasudil and timolol may lead to an IOP reduction from baseline of 0.75 mmHg (95% −1.29 to −CI 0.21; 208 participants). The certainty of evidence was moderate. 
Of the trials assessing total ocular AEs, three were at low risk, four had some concerns, and eight were at high risk of bias.  
We found very low‐certainty evidence that netarsudil may lead to more ocular AEs compared with placebo, with 66 more ocular AEs per 100 person‐months (95% CI 28 to 103; I2 = 86%; 4 trials, 188 participants). We found low‐certainty evidence that netarsudil may lead to more ocular AEs compared with latanoprost, with 29 more ocular AEs per 100 person‐months (95% CI 17 to 42; I2 = 95%; 4 trials, 1286 participants).  
We found moderate‐certainty evidence that, compared with timolol, netarsudil probably led to 21 additional ocular AEs (95% CI 14 to 27; I2 = 93%; 4 trials, 1678 participants). Data from three trials (1132 participants) showed no evidence of differences in the incidence rate of AEs between combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost and netarsudil monotherapy (1 more event per 100 person‐months, 95% CI 0 to 3); however, the certainty of evidence was low. Similarly, we found low‐certainty evidence that, compared with latanoprost, combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost may cause 29 more ocular events per 100 person‐months (95% CI 11 to 47; 3 trials, 1116 participants). We found moderate‐certainty evidence that, compared with timolol monotherapy, combination therapy with ripasudil and timolol probably causes 35 more ocular events per 100 person‐months (95% CI 25 to 45; 1 trial, 208 participants). In all included trials, ROKi was reportedly not associated with any particular serious AEs. 
Authors' conclusions
The current evidence suggests that in people diagnosed with OHT or (P)OAG, the hypotensive effect of netarsudil may be inferior to latanoprost and slightly inferior to timolol. Combining netarsudil and latanoprost probably further reduces IOP compared with monotherapy. Netarsudil as mono‐ or combination therapy may result in more ocular AEs. However, the certainty of evidence was very low or low for all comparisons except timolol. In general, AEs were described as mild, transient, and reversible upon treatment discontinuation. ROKi was not associated with any particular serious AEs. Future trials of sufficient size and follow‐up should be conducted to provide reliable information about glaucoma progression, relevant IOP measurements and a detailed description of AEs using similar terminology. This would ensure the robustness and confidence of the results and assess the intermediate‐ and long‐term efficacy and safety of ROKi.

## Eye Drop Medicine for Glaucoma

### Rationale

Glaucoma is a serious eye problem. It harms the nerve that connects your eye to your brain. This damage can lead to lost eyesight. Sadly, this vision loss cannot be fixed. Many people around the world go blind from glaucoma.

The most common type is called primary open-angle glaucoma. Doctors do not know why it happens. But they do know how to treat it. The main goal is to lower the pressure inside your eye. This helps stop the disease from getting worse.

New medicines called ROKi eye drops work in a different way. They help drain fluid from your eye. This lowers the pressure. We need to study these new drops to see how well they work. We also need to know if they cause problems.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. These studies tested ROKi eye drops. They compared ROKi drops to a fake drop (placebo). They also compared ROKi drops to other glaucoma medicines.

The studies included people with open-angle glaucoma or high eye pressure. All of these people were over 18 years old.

The studies lasted for different amounts of time. Some were as short as one day. Others lasted up to one year. The studies happened in the USA, Canada, and Japan.

### Results

We looked at 17 studies. They included almost 5,000 people. Most of the studies were done in many places. Most also hid which treatment people received.

The studies checked how much eye pressure dropped. They also looked for side effects in the eye.

Some studies showed that netarsudil (a ROKi) lowered eye pressure. It worked better than a fake drop. But other medicines, like timolol and latanoprost, worked even better. They lowered eye pressure more than netarsudil did on its own.

However, using netarsudil with latanoprost worked very well. This mix lowered eye pressure even more. It worked better than using latanoprost alone. It also worked better than using netarsudil alone. Using ripasudil (another ROKi) with timolol also helped lower pressure more.

ROKi eye drops did cause more eye side effects. For example, netarsudil caused more eye problems than fake drops. It also caused more problems than latanoprost and timolol.

Using netarsudil with latanoprost did not cause more side effects than netarsudil alone. But it did cause more side effects than latanoprost alone. Using ripasudil with timolol also caused more eye problems than timolol alone.

The good news is that these side effects were usually mild. They did not last long. They went away if people stopped using the drops. No serious problems were linked to ROKi eye drops.

In short, ROKi drops by themselves may not lower eye pressure as much as other common medicines. But ROKi drops can be a good addition to other medicines. They help lower eye pressure even more. They may cause more mild eye side effects. More studies are needed to learn more about how well ROKi drops work over a long time.","Rho kinase inhibitors for primary open‐angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension
Question 
What are the benefits and risks of rho kinase inhibitor eye drops to treat people with either glaucoma or increased eye pressure? 
Key messages 
Antiglaucomatous eye drops such as latanoprost and timolol may reduce the eye pressure more compared with treatment with a rho kinase inhibitor, but the difference with timolol is small. When combining rho kinase inhibitors with different types of medicine, the eye pressure may be reduced more. People treated with a rho kinase inhibitor experience more adverse events (side effects) compared with other treatments. Future research in this area should focus on reporting disease progression (how the glaucoma gets worse over time). 
What is glaucoma? 
Glaucoma is a sight‐threatening eye disease that can lead to blindness if left untreated. There are different types of glaucoma and the most common is called primary open‐angle glaucoma. High eye pressure is a known risk factor for developing glaucoma.  
Medical glaucoma treatment 
There are different types of eye drops that can be used to treat glaucoma. All medical treatments of glaucoma work by reducing eye pressure. Latanoprost and timolol are two glaucoma medications, and one of the new types of glaucoma medicine is called a rho kinase inhibitor.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to examine whether the effectiveness and safety of rho kinase inhibitor eye drops were better or worse than other medicines. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared:
‐ rho kinase inhibitor with placebo (a treatment with no therapeutic effect);
‐ rho kinase inhibitor with other types of glaucoma treatments (latanoprost and timolol).
Search date  
We searched medical databases on 11 December 2020.
What did we find? 
We found 17 studies examining 4953 people aged at least 18 years diagnosed with primary open‐angle glaucoma or high eye pressure and treated with a rho kinase inhibitor. The studies varied in treatment duration from 24 hours to 12 months. They were conducted in the USA, Canada and Japan. Of the studies, 16  were funded by pharmaceutical companies and one did not provide information about potential funding sources. The effect of treatment was evaluated by measuring the eye pressure and assessing the adverse events of treatment. 
The studies did not report data disease progression, but they reported data on the lowering of the pressure within the eye and adverse events. Treatment with latanoprost may be better than rho kinase inhibitor. Treatment with timolol may be slightly better than treatment with rho kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, treatment with both rho kinase inhibitor and latanoprost or timolol probably reduces the eye pressure even more. Overall, the studies reported adverse events very differently. More people treated with rho kinase inhibitors may have experienced eye‐related adverse events; however, we are not very certain about these findings. There were no serious adverse events reported for treatment with rho kinase inhibitor. 
Main limitations of the evidence 
The studies did not report all the outcomes that we were interested in. The studies focused on specific outcomes such as eye pressure and adverse events, whereas we wanted to answer other questions as well. The current evidence was based on few studies. Some studies were conducted in a way that may have introduced errors into the results. Studies varied in the way they measured the outcomes and thus may not be comparable to each other.

10.1002-14651858.CD011462.pub2,"Use of shorter radiation treatments for prostate cancer
Review question 
We asked if giving radiation therapy (cancer treatment with high energy x‐rays) for localized prostate cancer in fewer fractions (treatment visits for radiation) and shorter overall treatment time with a larger dose (more than 2 Gray) given each day, works as well as the usual (conventional) number of fractions (1.8 Gray per day to 2 Gray per day) for cancer control and had similar side effects. 
Background 
Using fewer fractions, with a larger dose given at each visit is possibly better for treating prostate cancer with radiation. Radiation therapy for prostate cancer can cause bladder and bowel side effects, and affect sexual function. If using larger doses for each treatment, with fewer treatments overall (called hypofractionation), works as well for cancer control, and the side effects and effects on certainty of life are about the same, then hypofractionation may benefit men with prostate cancer contained within the prostate (localized) who are treated with radiation therapy. If cancer control is as good, and the side effects about the same, then using fewer (but larger dose) radiation treatments may be more convenient for men with prostate cancer, use fewer resources and save money. 
Study characteristics 
This evidence is current to 15 March 2019. The men studied were ages 64 years and over and had prostate cancer limited to the pelvis. 
Key results 
We studied the use of fewer, but larger doses of radiation to treat 8278 men with prostate cancer. We found 10 studies. 
We found that using hypofractionation may result in similar risk of dying from prostate cancer (low‐certainty evidence) but are uncertain how it affects late bowel side effects (very low‐certainty evidence). It probably results in similar rates of late bladder side effects (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Using hypofractionation results in similar overall survival (high‐certainty evidence) and may be similar for metastasis‐free survival (low‐certainty evidence). Acute bladder side effects may be similar (moderate‐certainty evidence).

### Plain Title
Shorter Radiation Treatment for Prostate Cancer

### Rationale

**What is prostate cancer?**
Prostate cancer is a disease where cancer cells form in the prostate. The prostate is a small gland in men. It is found below the bladder. It makes fluid that is part of semen.

**Why is it a problem?**
Prostate cancer can spread to other parts of the body. It can cause pain and other health problems. Treating it is important for men's health.

**How is it treated now?**
Radiation therapy is a common way to treat prostate cancer. This uses strong X-rays to kill cancer cells. But it can cause problems. It can hurt the bladder and bowels. It can also change sexual health.

**Why did we do this study?**
Doctors want to find better ways to treat prostate cancer. Current treatments need many visits. These visits take a lot of time. They also cost money. We wanted to see if fewer, stronger radiation treatments could work. This new way is called hypofractionation.

**What did we hope to find?**
We thought that fewer, stronger treatments might work as well. We hoped they would kill cancer cells just as well. We also hoped they would cause the same or fewer side effects. If so, this would be better for men. It would mean fewer trips to the hospital. It could also save money.

### Trial Design

**How was this study done?**
This study looked at many other studies. We gathered all the information from those studies. We wanted to see what the results showed together.

**Who was in these studies?**
The studies included men with prostate cancer. Their cancer was only in the prostate. It had not spread to other body parts. The men were 64 years old or older.

**What was compared?**
We looked at two types of radiation treatment.
1.  **Standard treatment:** This means many small doses of radiation. Each dose was 1.8 to 2 Gray. Patients had many treatment visits.
2.  **Shorter treatment (hypofractionation):** This means fewer, larger doses of radiation. Each dose was more than 2 Gray. Patients had fewer treatment visits.

**How long were patients studied?**
The studies followed men for some time. This was to see how well the treatment worked. They also checked for side effects over time.

### Results

**What did we find?**
We looked at 10 studies. These studies included 8278 men with prostate cancer.

**Cancer control:**
*   **Dying from cancer:** We found that fewer, stronger treatments may lead to a similar risk of dying from prostate cancer. This finding needs more study to be sure.
*   **Overall survival:** Both types of treatment led to similar overall survival. This means men lived for a similar amount of time with both treatments. This finding is very certain.
*   **Cancer spread:** Fewer, stronger treatments may also be similar for stopping cancer from spreading. This finding needs more study to be sure.

**Side effects:**
*   **Late bowel problems:** We are not sure how shorter treatments affect bowel problems that happen later. More study is needed here.
*   **Late bladder problems:** Shorter treatments likely cause similar bladder problems that happen later. This finding is quite certain.
*   **Early bladder problems:** Shorter treatments may cause similar bladder problems that happen soon after treatment. This finding is quite certain.

**What do these results mean?**
The main finding is good news. Shorter radiation treatments can kill prostate cancer cells as well as standard treatments. They also seem to cause similar side effects. This means men can get fewer treatments. They can finish treatment faster. This makes treatment easier for them. It also saves resources and money.

**Conclusion from the doctors:**
Shorter, stronger radiation treatments for prostate cancer are a good option. They work as well as standard treatments. They also cause similar side effects. This can make life easier for men with prostate cancer.","Use of shorter radiation treatments for prostate cancer

We found that using hypofractionation may result in similar risk of dying from prostate cancer (low‐certainty evidence) but are uncertain how it affects late bowel side effects (very low‐certainty evidence). It probably results in similar rates of late bladder side effects (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Using hypofractionation results in similar overall survival (high‐certainty evidence) and may be similar for metastasis‐free survival (low‐certainty evidence). Acute bladder side effects may be similar (moderate‐certainty evidence).

10.1002-14651858.CD014877.pub2,"Rapid molecular tests for tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance: the views and experiences of people who are tested and healthcare providers 
What is the aim of this review? 
We aimed to understand the experiences and opinions of people using rapid automated tests that identify tuberculosis and resistance to tuberculosis drugs (molecular diagnostic tests). Users include people who might have tuberculosis and their families or caregivers, doctors, nurses, laboratory staff, and managers of services or programmes. 
What was studied in this review?  
Rapid molecular diagnostic tests were designed to make diagnosis easier and faster for people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, because they do not require a well‐equipped laboratory, but can be done in clinics closer to where people live. Since these tests can also suggest whether an individual suffers from drug‐resistant tuberculosis (including multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis (MDR‐TB)), the right treatment can be started earlier. We collected and analysed all relevant studies and found 32 studies conducted in areas where tuberculosis is common in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
MDR‐TB is tuberculosis caused by resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective first‐line drugs used to treat tuberculosis.  
This qualitative evidence synthesis links to another Cochrane Review that examines the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid molecular test for tuberculosis drug resistance. Yet, diagnostic tests only have an impact on health if they are put to use in a correct and timely manner. Accuracy studies do not reveal what users think of or how they experience the test in question. We need to understand the perspectives and experiences of all users. Otherwise, we risk these tests not fitting settings where they are to be used or not being accessible for those in need. 
What are the main findings? 
People with tuberculosis value knowing what is wrong with them. People valued having an accurate diagnosis, avoiding delays in being diagnosed, having accessible testing facilities, and keeping cost low. Similarly, healthcare providers value having accurate tests that give them confidence in the diagnosis, rapid results, and keeping cost low, being able to use different specimens (such as sputum and stool)  and receiving information about drug resistance as part of the test results. Laboratory personnel appreciated that laboratory work was made easier and that staff was more satisfied thanks to rapid molecular diagnostic tests. 
Our review also identified several challenges to realizing these values. Some people with tuberculosis and some healthcare providers were reluctant to use rapid molecular diagnostic tests because of fears of testing positive, concerns of stigma or discredit in the community, or expenses related to the testing. Additional support is required to overcome these barriers that are common to other approaches to testing for tuberculosis. Other challenges that led to delays and underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests were health system inefficiencies; poor quality of specimens; difficulty in transporting specimens; lack of sufficient resources such as staff or equipment; increased workload for providers; inefficiencies in integrating the test into routines at clinics; the complicated or lengthy steps involved in obtaining a tuberculosis diagnosis; clinicians relying too much on the test result while neglecting their own experience with diagnosing tuberculosis; and processes of implementing the test in national programmes that lacked data about real‐life situations and did not include all relevant stakeholders such as local decision‐makers, providers or people seeking a diagnosis. 
Lastly, people expressed concerns about unsustainable funding, maintenance requirements of the tests, lengthy delays in diagnosis, underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests, lack of tuberculosis diagnostic facilities in local communities, conflicts of interest between donors and people who utilize the tests, and too many restrictions on who was allowed to access the test. These concerns hampered access to prompt and accurate testing and treatment. This was particularly the case for vulnerable people, such as children, people with MDR‐TB, or those with limited ability to pay. 
Overall, these challenges risk undoing the added value of rapid molecular diagnostic tests. They risk leading to less frequent use of these tests. Implementation of new diagnostic tests, like those considered in this review, will need to tackle the challenges identified in this review including weak infrastructure and systems, as well as insufficient data about real‐life situations before and during implementation in order to ensure the tests are accessible for those in need. 
How up to date is this review? 
We included studies published between 1 January 2007 and 20 October 2021. We limited all searches to 2007 onward because the development of Xpert MTB/RIF, the first rapid molecular diagnostic test in this review, was completed in 2009. 
","## A Closer Look at Fast TB Tests: What Patients and Doctors Think

### Rationale

Tuberculosis, or TB, is a serious sickness. It is caused by germs that mostly attack the lungs. It can make people cough, have fevers, and lose weight. TB can be hard to treat, especially if the germs are strong and resist common medicines. This is called drug-resistant TB, or MDR-TB. It is a big problem for many people.

Doctors need to know quickly if someone has TB. They also need to know if the TB is drug-resistant. If they know this fast, they can give the right medicine sooner. This helps people get better faster. It also stops the sickness from spreading to others.

New fast tests can find TB and drug resistance. These tests are called rapid molecular tests. They do not need a fancy lab. They can be used in clinics close to where people live. This study looked at what people think about these fast tests. We wanted to see if they help people get better care.

### Trial Design

This study looked at what people think and feel about fast TB tests. We wanted to know their thoughts and feelings. This included people who might have TB. It also included their family and caregivers. We also asked doctors, nurses, and lab staff. Managers of health programs also shared their views.

We looked at many other studies. We gathered all the important studies we could find. We found 32 studies. These studies were done in places where TB is common. These places are often low-income or middle-income countries.

We studied what people said about these fast tests. We wanted to know if the tests were used well. We also wanted to know if they were easy to get. This helps us see if the tests really help people. We looked at studies published between 2007 and 2021.

### Results

People who had TB liked knowing what was wrong with them. They wanted an exact diagnosis. They also liked getting tested without long waits. They valued tests that were easy to reach. Keeping the cost low was also important to them.

Doctors and nurses also liked these tests. They liked tests that gave clear answers. They wanted fast results. They also wanted tests that cost little. They liked being able to use different samples, like spit or poop. Knowing if the TB was drug-resistant was also very helpful. Lab staff said the tests made their work easier. They were happier with the new tests.

But, there were problems too. Some people were scared to get tested. They worried about being sick. They worried about what others would think. They also worried about the cost.

Some health places had problems. They did not have enough staff or tools. It was hard to get samples to the lab. The steps to get a TB diagnosis were sometimes long. These things made it hard to use the fast tests.

People also worried about money for the tests. They worried about keeping the machines working. They were concerned about long waits for results. They also worried that not everyone could get the tests. These problems made it hard for people to get quick, good care. This was especially true for kids. It was also true for people with drug-resistant TB. And for people who could not pay much.

To make these fast tests work well, we need to fix these problems. We need better health systems. We also need to know more about how people use the tests in real life. This will help make sure everyone who needs a test can get one.","Rapid molecular tests for tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance: the views and experiences of people who are tested and healthcare providers

10.1002-14651858.CD013404.pub2,"Background
Hip fractures are a major healthcare problem, presenting a considerable challenge and burden to individuals and healthcare systems. The number of hip fractures globally is rising rapidly. The majority of intracapsular hip fractures are treated surgically. 
Objectives
To assess the relative effects (benefits and harms) of all surgical treatments used in the management of intracapsular hip fractures in older adults, using a network meta‐analysis of randomised trials, and to generate a hierarchy of interventions according to their outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and five other databases in July 2020. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, reference lists of retrieved articles and conducted backward‐citation searches. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing different treatments for fragility intracapsular hip fractures in older adults. We included total hip arthroplasties (THAs), hemiarthroplasties (HAs), internal fixation, and non‐operative treatments. We excluded studies of people with hip fracture with specific pathologies other than osteoporosis or resulting from high‐energy trauma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. One review author completed data extraction which was checked by a second review author. We collected data for three outcomes at different time points: mortality and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) ‐ both reported within 4 months, at 12 months, and after 24 months of surgery, and unplanned return to theatre (at end of study follow‐up). 
We performed a network meta‐analysis (NMA) with Stata software, using frequentist methods, and calculated the differences between treatments using risk ratios (RRs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also performed direct comparisons using the same codes. 
Main results
We included 119 studies (102 RCTS, 17 quasi‐RCTs) with 17,653 participants with 17,669 intracapsular fractures in the review; 83% of fractures were displaced. The mean participant age ranged from 60 to 87 years and 73% were women.  
After discussion with clinical experts, we selected 12 nodes that represented the best balance between clinical plausibility and efficiency of the networks: cemented modern unipolar HA, dynamic fixed angle plate, uncemented first‐generation bipolar HA, uncemented modern bipolar HA, cemented modern bipolar HA, uncemented first‐generation unipolar HA, uncemented modern unipolar HA, THA with single articulation, dual‐mobility THA, pins, screws, and non‐operative treatment. Seventy‐five studies (with 11,855 participants) with data for at least two of these treatments contributed to the NMA. 
We selected cemented modern unipolar HA as a reference treatment against which other treatments were compared. This was a common treatment in the networks, providing a clinically appropriate comparison. In order to provide a concise summary of the results, we report only network estimates when there was evidence of difference between treatments. 
We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for serious and very serious risks of bias and when estimates included possible transitivity, particularly for internal fixation which included more undisplaced fractures. We also downgraded for incoherence, or inconsistency in indirect estimates, although this affected few estimates. Most estimates included the possibility of benefits and harms, and we downgraded the evidence for these treatments for imprecision.  
We found that cemented modern unipolar HA, dynamic fixed angle plate and pins seemed to have the greatest likelihood of reducing mortality at 12 months. Overall, 23.5% of participants who received the reference treatment died within 12 months of surgery. Uncemented modern bipolar HA had higher mortality than the reference treatment (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.85; derived only from indirect evidence; low‐certainty evidence), and THA with single articulation also had higher mortality (network estimate RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.32; derived from direct evidence from 2 studies with 225 participants, and indirect evidence; very low‐certainty evidence). In the remaining treatments, the certainty of the evidence ranged from low to very low, and we noted no evidence of any differences in mortality at 12 months.  
We found that THA (single articulation), cemented modern bipolar HA and uncemented modern bipolar HA seemed to have the greatest likelihood of improving HRQoL at 12 months. This network was comparatively sparse compared to other outcomes and the certainty of the evidence of differences between treatments was very low. We noted no evidence of any differences in HRQoL at 12 months, although estimates were imprecise. 
We found that arthroplasty treatments seemed to have a greater likelihood of reducing unplanned return to theatre than internal fixation and non‐operative treatment. We estimated that 4.3% of participants who received the reference treatment returned to theatre during the study follow‐up. Compared to this treatment, we found low‐certainty evidence that more participants returned to theatre if they were treated with a dynamic fixed angle plate (network estimate RR 4.63, 95% CI 2.94 to 7.30; from direct evidence from 1 study with 190 participants, and indirect evidence). We found very low‐certainty evidence that more participants returned to theatre when treated with pins (RR 4.16, 95% CI 2.53 to 6.84; only from indirect evidence), screws (network estimate RR 5.04, 95% CI 3.25 to 7.82; from direct evidence from 2 studies with 278 participants, and indirect evidence), and non‐operative treatment (RR 5.41, 95% CI 1.80 to 16.26; only from indirect evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence of a tendency for an increased risk of unplanned return to theatre for all of the arthroplasty treatments, and in particular for THA, compared with cemented modern unipolar HA, with little evidence to suggest the size of this difference varied strongly between the arthroplasty treatments. 
Authors' conclusions
There was considerable variability in the ranking of each treatment such that there was no one outstanding, or subset of outstanding, superior treatments. However, cemented modern arthroplasties tended to more often yield better outcomes than alternative treatments and may be a more successful approach than internal fixation. There is no evidence of a difference between THA (single articulation) and cemented modern unipolar HA in the outcomes measured in this review. THA may be an appropriate treatment for a subset of people with intracapsular fracture but we have not explored this further.  
","**Plain Title: Best Surgery for Broken Hips in Older Adults**

**Rationale**
Breaking a hip is a very serious health problem. It causes a lot of pain and can make it hard to move. Many older people break their hips, and this number is growing fast. Most of these broken hips need surgery.

This study wanted to find the best way to fix a broken hip. We looked at all the different types of surgery. We wanted to see which ones worked best and which ones had more problems.

Finding the best surgery can help people recover better. It can also help doctors choose the right treatment. We hoped to find which surgeries led to a better life after a hip break.

**Trial Design**
This study looked at many other studies. It combined their results to get a clearer picture. We looked at studies where people were randomly given different treatments.

We included older adults who broke the top part of their hip bone. This is called an intracapsular hip fracture. The people in these studies were between 60 and 87 years old. Most of them, about 7 out of 10, were women.

The treatments we looked at included:
*   Total hip replacement (THA)
*   Partial hip replacement (HA)
*   Fixing the bone with pins or screws (internal fixation)
*   Not having surgery at all (non-operative treatment)

We looked at how people were doing for up to two years after surgery. We checked if they were alive, how good their life felt, and if they needed another surgery.

**Results**
We looked at 119 studies with over 17,000 people. Most of these people had a bad break. We found some key things about the different surgeries.

One common surgery is a cemented partial hip replacement (modern unipolar HA). We used this as a standard to compare other surgeries.

*   **Staying Alive:** Some surgeries seemed better for staying alive. Cemented modern unipolar HA, certain plates, and pins seemed to lower the risk of dying in the first year. About 1 out of 4 people who had the standard surgery died within a year. Some other partial and total hip replacements had a higher death risk.

*   **Quality of Life:** Total hip replacement (single articulation) and some modern partial hip replacements seemed to make life feel better after one year. However, we were not very sure about these results. More research is needed here.

*   **Needing More Surgery:** Hip replacements seemed to lower the chance of needing another surgery. People who had pins, screws, or no surgery at all were more likely to need another operation. For example, people with certain plates were about 4 times more likely to need another surgery than those with the standard partial hip replacement.

**Conclusion:**
There was no single best surgery for all people. Each treatment had its own good points and bad points. However, modern cemented hip replacements often led to better results than other options. They might be better than using pins or screws to fix the bone.

For some people, a total hip replacement might be a good choice. We could not say for sure if it was better or worse than the standard cemented partial hip replacement. This study did not look at specific types of people who might benefit most from a total hip replacement.","Which are the best treatments for hip fractures in older adults?
Why is this question important? 
A hip fracture is a break at the top of the leg bone. We included people with a break just below the ball and socket joint. These types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. They often happen after a fall from a standing or sitting position. The broken hip can be treated in different ways, and we don't know whether some treatments are better than others. 
What are the treatments? 
‐ Replacing the broken hip with an artificial one. This can be done using a hemiarthroplasty (HA), which replaces only the ball part of the joint, and can be unipolar (a single artificial joint) or bipolar which has an additional joint within the HA. A total hip arthroplasty (THA) replaces all of the hip joint, including the socket, and usually has just one artifical joint between the ball and the socket (single articulation) or sometimes two (dual‐mobility). All types of artificial joints can be fixed in place with or without bone cement. 
‐ Using metal implants to fix the broken parts of the bones. Pins or screws may be inserted through the two parts of broken bone, or the surgeon may use a 'fixed angle plate' which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone and is attached to the bone with screws or pins.  
‐ Treatment without an operation, usually requiring a period of rest in bed whilst the leg is held in position using traction with weights. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared one or more of these treatments. We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of these different treatments. We combined the findings from studies, and created a 'network' (which is used when researchers perform a 'network meta‐analysis' on the results from studies) to see if we could find out if some treatments were better than others. 
What did we find? 
We found 119 studies, involving 17,653 participants with 17,669 fractures. The average age of study participants ranged from 60 to 87 years; 73% were women, which is usual for people who have this type of hip fracture. We included 75 of these studies in our 'network'. 
We found that a modern design of unipolar HA fixed with bone cement, or some of the metal implants (fixed angle plates and pins), seem to have the greatest chance of reducing the number of deaths within 12 months of injury. Compared to people having these treatments, more people who were treated with an uncemented modern bipolar design of HA or with a THA (single articulation) died.  
We didn't find as many studies to include in our 'network' for health‐related quality of life, and none of the treatments made a meaningful improvement to people's quality of life.  
We also found that people treated with any of the hip replacements were less likely to need additional surgery on their broken hip than people treated with metal implants or treated without an operation. Amongst all the designs of hip replacements, fewer people needed additional surgery after treatment with a cemented modern unipolar design of HA ‐ but there was not a big difference in the findings for these hip replacement treatments. 
So, overall, cemented modern hip replacements tended to produce better outcomes and may be a more successful approach than attempting to fix the broken bone. THA (single articulation) may have increased the risk of death compared with cemented HA, without leading to an important difference in quality of life ‐ but we are not sure about this finding. This type of THA may be an appropriate treatment for some people with these fractures, but we have not studied this in this review. 
Are we confident in what we found? 
The true effects of these treatments might be very different to what we have found in this review. Many of the studies in this review were published before general reporting standards for research were improved, and so we could not be certain whether or not these studies were well‐conducted. Sometimes, the types of fractures were different (particularly between participants treated with metal implants and those treated with hip replacements), and this might have affected the results in the 'network'. We also found that the results included risks of potential benefits and harms, and this is often because there are not enough study participants to find a precise result. 
How up to date is this review?

10.1002-14651858.CD013190,"Background
Melanoma has one of the fastest rising incidence rates of any cancer. It accounts for a small percentage of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. Early detection and treatment is key to improving survival; however, anxiety around missing early cases needs to be balanced against appropriate levels of referral and excision of benign lesions. Used in conjunction with clinical or dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, or both, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) may reduce unnecessary excisions without missing melanoma cases. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of reflectance confocal microscopy for the detection of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in adults with any lesion suspicious for melanoma and lesions that are difficult to diagnose, and to compare its accuracy with that of dermoscopy. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; and seven other databases. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design that evaluated RCM alone, or RCM in comparison to dermoscopy, in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities per algorithm and threshold using the bivariate hierarchical model. To compare RCM with dermoscopy, we grouped studies by population (defined by difficulty of lesion diagnosis) and combined data using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) methods. Analysis of studies allowing direct comparison between tests was undertaken. To facilitate interpretation of results, we computed values of specificity at the point on the SROC curve with 90% sensitivity as this value lies within the estimates for the majority of analyses. We investigated the impact of using a purposely developed RCM algorithm and in‐person test interpretation. 
Main results
The search identified 18 publications reporting on 19 study cohorts with 2838 lesions (including 658 with melanoma), which provided 67 datasets for RCM and seven for dermoscopy. Studies were generally at high or unclear risk of bias across almost all domains and of high or unclear concern regarding applicability of the evidence. Selective participant recruitment, lack of blinding of the reference test to the RCM result, and differential verification were particularly problematic. Studies may not be representative of populations eligible for RCM, and test interpretation was often undertaken remotely from the patient and blinded to clinical information. 
Meta‐analysis found RCM to be more accurate than dermoscopy in studies of participants with any lesion suspicious for melanoma and in participants with lesions that were more difficult to diagnose (equivocal lesion populations). Assuming a fixed sensitivity of 90% for both tests, specificities were 82% for RCM and 42% for dermoscopy for any lesion suspicious for melanoma (9 RCM datasets; 1452 lesions and 370 melanomas). For a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the median observed melanoma prevalence of 30%, this equated to a reduction in unnecessary excisions with RCM of 280 compared to dermoscopy, with 30 melanomas missed by both tests. For studies in equivocal lesions, specificities of 86% would be observed for RCM and 49% for dermoscopy (7 RCM datasets; 1177 lesions and 180 melanomas). At the median observed melanoma prevalence of 20%, this reduced unnecessary excisions by 296 with RCM compared with dermoscopy, with 20 melanomas missed by both tests. Across all populations, algorithms and thresholds assessed, the sensitivity and specificity of the Pellacani RCM score at a threshold of three or greater were estimated at 92% (95% confidence interval (CI) 87 to 95) for RCM and 72% (95% CI 62 to 81) for dermoscopy. 
Authors' conclusions
RCM may have a potential role in clinical practice, particularly for the assessment of lesions that are difficult to diagnose using visual inspection and dermoscopy alone, where the evidence suggests that RCM may be both more sensitive and specific in comparison to dermoscopy. Given the paucity of data to allow comparison with dermoscopy, the results presented require further confirmation in prospective studies comparing RCM with dermoscopy in a real‐world setting in a representative population. 
","## Better Skin Scans for Spotting Skin Cancer

### Rationale

Skin cancer is a big worry for many people. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer. It is not common, but it causes most skin cancer deaths. Finding it early can save lives. But doctors do not want to remove healthy skin by mistake.

This study looked at a new skin scan. It is called Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM). Doctors use RCM to get a close look at skin cells. It can help tell if a spot is cancer or not.

The study aimed to see if RCM is good at finding skin cancer. It also wanted to see if RCM is better than another common scan. That scan is called dermoscopy. RCM might help avoid unneeded skin removals.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many past studies. It combined their results. We wanted to see how well RCM works. We also wanted to compare it to dermoscopy.

The studies included adults of any age. They had skin spots that looked like cancer. Or they had spots that were hard to tell. Doctors checked these spots with RCM or dermoscopy. Then they removed the spot or watched it over time. This showed if the spot was cancer.

The study looked at how many times RCM found cancer correctly. It also looked at how many times it said a spot was not cancer when it was not.

### Results

The study looked at 18 reports. These reports had data from 19 groups of patients. In total, 2838 skin spots were checked. 658 of these spots were melanoma.

The study found that RCM was better than dermoscopy. RCM was better at finding cancer in most skin spots. It was also better for spots that were hard to diagnose.

For every 1000 skin spots that might be cancer, 300 were actual melanomas. RCM helped avoid 280 unneeded skin removals. Both RCM and dermoscopy missed 30 melanomas.

For spots that were hard to tell, RCM was also better. For every 1000 hard-to-tell spots, 200 were melanoma. RCM helped avoid 296 unneeded skin removals. Both RCM and dermoscopy missed 20 melanomas.

One way to score RCM, called the Pellacani score, was very good. It found 92 out of 100 melanomas. Dermoscopy found 72 out of 100 melanomas.

This means RCM can help doctors make better choices. It may help find more skin cancers. It may also help remove less healthy skin.

More studies are needed to confirm these findings. These new studies should look at RCM in real-life settings. They should also compare RCM and dermoscopy directly.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of the imaging test reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) for the detection of melanoma in adults? 
What was the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) was on its own and used in addition to dermoscopy compared to dermoscopy alone for diagnosing melanoma. Review authors in Cochrane included 18 publications to answer this question. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of melanoma important? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. Not recognising a melanoma when it is present (called a false negative test result) delays surgery to remove it, risking cancer spreading to other parts in the body and possibly death. Diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not present (called a false positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery, further investigations, and patient anxiety. 
What did the review study? 
Microscopic techniques are used by skin cancer specialists to allow a more detailed, magnified examination of suspicious skin lesions than can be achieved using the naked eye alone. Currently, dermoscopy (a handheld device using natural light) can be used as part of the clinical examination of suspicious skin lesions. RCM is a new microscopic technique (a handheld device or static unit using infrared light) that can visualise deeper layers of the skin compared to dermoscopy. Both techniques are painless procedures, but RCM is more expensive, time consuming, and requires additional training. Dermoscopy can be used by general practitioners whereas RCM is likely to only be used by secondary care specialists in people who have been referred with a lesion suspicious for skin cancer. We sought to find out whether RCM should be used instead of, or in addition to, dermoscopy, to diagnose melanoma in any suspicious skin lesion or only in particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions. 
What were the main results of the review? 
The review included 18 publications reporting data for 19 groups of participants with lesions suspected of melanoma. The main results were based on 16 of the 19 datasets (sets of information and results). 
The review included nine datasets with 1452 lesions in people with any suspicious skin lesion, three of which compared RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that in 1000 lesions, of which 300 (30%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ an estimated 396 would have an RCM result indicating melanoma was present, and of these, 126 (32%) would not be melanoma (false positive results); ‐ in the same group of 1000 lesions, dermoscopy would produce 406 false positive results, meaning RCM would avoid unnecessary surgery in 280 lesions compared to dermoscopy; ‐ of the 604 lesions with an RCM result indicating that melanoma was not present (and 324 lesions with a dermoscopy result indicating that melanoma was not present), 30 would actually be melanoma (false negative results). This equated to a false negative rate of 5% for RCM and 9% for dermoscopy. 
The review also included seven datasets with 1177 lesions in people with particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions, three of which compared RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that if skin specialists used RCM in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 200 (20%) were actually melanoma: 
‐ an estimated 292 would have an RCM result indicating melanoma was present, and of these, 112 (38%) would not be melanoma (false positive results); ‐ in the same group of 1000 lesions, dermoscopy would produce 408 false positive results, meaning RCM would avoid unnecessary surgery in 296 lesions compared to dermoscopy; ‐ of the 708 lesions with an RCM result indicating that melanoma was not present (and 412 lesions with a dermoscopy result indicating that melanoma was not present), 20 would actually have melanoma (false negative results). This equates to a false negative rate of 3% for RCM and 5% for dermoscopy. 
How reliable were the results of the studies of this review? 
In all included studies, the diagnosis of melanoma was made by lesion biopsy (RCM/dermoscopy positive) (a biopsy involves taking a sample of body cells and examining them under a microscope), and the absence of melanoma was confirmed by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma (RCM/dermoscopy negative)*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had melanoma. Only a small number of studies compared the accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM. Most were conducted by specialist research teams with high levels of experience with RCM. Therefore, RCM may have appeared more accurate than it actually was. Participants in the nine studies of any suspicious lesion may have had very obvious disease compared to that seen in practice leading to a lower number of false positive results than would actually occur. It is not possible to recommend a definition of a positive RCM test that will reliably produce the results presented here due to differences between studies. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Eleven studies were undertaken in Europe (61%), with the remainder undertaken in Oceania, North America, or more than one continent. Mean age ranged from 39 to 54.7 years. The percentage of people with melanoma ranged between 1.9% and 41.5% (a median (midpoint reading) of 19% for difficult to diagnose skin lesions and 32% for any suspicious lesion). The majority of studies only included people with certain types of skin lesion. In many studies, it was not clear what tests participants had received before RCM. 
What are the implications of this review? 
RCM appears to be an accurate test for identifying melanoma, and it may reduce the number of people receiving unnecessary surgery by up to three‐quarters compared to dermoscopy. There is considerable variation and uncertainty in results and in study conduct, reducing the reliability of findings. Use of RCM may be of most benefit in people with particularly difficult to diagnose lesions rather than people with any lesion suspicious for melanoma. Further research comparing RCM and dermoscopy in well described groups of people with difficult to diagnose skin lesions is needed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses).

Hypertension is a major public health challenge affecting more than one billion people worldwide; it disproportionately affects populations in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), where health systems are generally weak. The increasing prevalence of hypertension is associated with population growth, ageing, genetic factors, and behavioural risk factors, such as excessive salt and fat consumption, physical inactivity, being overweight and obese, harmful alcohol consumption, and poor management of stress. Over the long term, hypertension leads to risk for cardiovascular events, such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, disability, and premature mortality. 
Cardiovascular events can be preventable when high‐risk populations are targeted, for example, through population‐wide screening strategies. When available resources are limited, taking a total risk approach whereby several risk factors of hypertension are taken into consideration (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle factors, diabetes, blood cholesterol) can enable more accurate targeting of high‐risk groups. Targeting of high‐risk groups can help reduce costs in that resources are not spent on the entire population. 
Early detection in the form of screening for hypertension (and associated risk factors) can help identify high‐risk groups, which can result in timely treatment and management of risk factors. Ultimately, early detection can help reduce morbidity and mortality linked to it and can help contain health‐related costs, for example, those associated with hospitalisation due to severe illness and poorly managed risk factors and comorbidities. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of different screening strategies for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. 
Search methods
An Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS‐Web), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) Bireme, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) without language, publication year, or publication status restrictions. The searches were conducted from inception until 9 April 2020. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐RCTs (NRCTs), that is, controlled before and after (CBA), interrupted time series (ITS), and prospective analytic cohort studies of healthy adolescents, adults, and elderly people participating in mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening of hypertension. 
Data collection and analysis
Screening of all retrieved studies was done in Covidence. A team of reviewers, in pairs, independently assessed titles and abstracts of identified studies and acquired full texts for studies that were potentially eligible. Studies were deemed to be eligible for full‐text screening if two review authors agreed, or if consensus was reached through discussion with a third review author. It was planned that at least two review authors would independently extract data from included studies, assess risk of bias using pre‐specified Cochrane criteria, and conduct a meta‐analysis of sufficiently similar studies or present a narrative synthesis of the results. 
Main results
We screened 9335 titles and abstracts. We identified 54 potentially eligible studies for full‐text screening. However, no studies met the eligibility criteria. 
Authors' conclusions
There is an implicit assumption that early detection of hypertension through screening can reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality, but this assumption has not been tested in rigorous research studies. High‐quality evidence from RCTs or programmatic evidence from NRCTs on the effectiveness and costs or harms of different screening strategies for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce hypertension‐related morbidity and mortality is lacking.

### Plain Title
Looking for the Best Ways to Check for High Blood Pressure

### Rationale
High blood pressure affects over one billion people. This health problem is more common in poorer countries. Things like age, what we eat, and how much we move can make it worse. Over time, high blood pressure can cause serious issues. These issues include heart problems, strokes, and kidney failure. It can also lead to disability or early death.

Finding high blood pressure early can help. We can treat it before it causes big problems. If we find people at high risk, we can use our care more wisely. This saves money and helps more people. It is important to know which ways of checking for high blood pressure work best. We want to see if checking everyone, checking only certain people, or checking when people visit the doctor helps most. This study looks at different ways to find high blood pressure. We want to see if these checks lower health problems and deaths.

### Trial Design
How is this study designed?
This study looked at past research. We searched for studies about checking for high blood pressure. We looked for studies that compared different ways to check. These ways included checking everyone (mass), checking certain groups (targeted), or checking when someone saw a doctor (opportunistic).

We wanted studies that included healthy teens, adults, and older people. These studies needed to look at how well these checks worked. They also needed to see if they lowered health problems or deaths. We looked for studies that randomly assigned people to groups. We also looked for other kinds of careful studies. We searched many health databases until April 2020. Our team read thousands of titles and summaries. We then looked at full papers for those that seemed right.

### Results
What were the main results of the study?
We looked at 9335 study titles and summaries. We found 54 studies that seemed promising. But, none of these 54 studies met all our rules.

This means we found no studies that truly tested this idea. There is a common belief that finding high blood pressure early helps people. But we do not have strong proof from research studies. We need good studies to show if checking for high blood pressure works. We need to know if it lowers health problems and deaths. We also need to know the costs and any harms. Right now, this key information is missing.","Screening strategies for hypertension
Review question 
What effects do the different ways of screening for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) have in decreasing illness and death? 
Background 
Hypertension is a long‐term non‐communicable disease (NCD), also known as high, raised, or elevated blood pressure. Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements (systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) pressures), which are the maximum and minimum pressures. High blood pressure is generally diagnosed when resting blood pressure is persistently at SBP ≥ 130/140 millimetres mercury (mmHg) or at DBP ≥ 80/90 mmHg for adults. 
Even though blood pressure in the arteries is continuously raised, in many cases, high blood pressure does not cause symptoms. Nonetheless, hypertension can increase the risk for heart failure, stroke, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease, and so on, in the long term. People who have unhealthy diets, consume harmful amounts of alcohol and/or tobacco, and are physically inactive are at higher risk of hypertension. 
Early detection, adequate treatment, and good control of high blood pressure can lower the risk of complications associated with hypertension. Although early detection through screening of hypertension has the potential to contain health‐related costs, reducing the burden of hypertension will to some extent involve addressing behavioural and socioeconomic risk factors (such as income, occupation, and level of education). Therefore, it is unclear whether early detection of mild hypertension can positively impact health‐related costs in the long term and improve health outcomes by reducing the need for hospitalisation and management of hypertension‐related complications, which can be severe. 
Review methods 
We searched various electronic databases on this topic until 9 April 2020. We searched for studies written in any language, whether published or not. We planned to include studies that compared one type of screening strategy for hypertension versus no screening strategy, that is, mass screening versus no screening, targeted screening versus no screening, and opportunistic screening versus no screening. We were interested in studies in which participants were healthy adolescents, adults, and elderly people, and in which researchers measured clinical outcomes, health system outcomes, and adverse events. 
Key results 
We found no studies that met the criteria described above.
Quality of the evidence 
High‐certainty evidence that can tell us whether mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening strategies are effective for reducing illness and death associated with hypertension is lacking.

Diet plays a major role in the aetiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and as a modifiable risk factor is the focus of many prevention strategies. Recently vegan diets have gained popularity and there is a need to synthesise existing clinical trial evidence for their potential in CVD prevention. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of following a vegan dietary pattern for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases on 4 February 2020: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov in January 2021. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) and those with established CVD (secondary prevention). A vegan dietary pattern excludes meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey; the intervention could be dietary advice, provision of relevant foods, or both. The comparison group received either no intervention, minimal intervention, or another dietary intervention. Outcomes included clinical events and CVD risk factors. We included only studies with follow‐up periods of 12 weeks or more, defined as the intervention period plus post‐intervention follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risks of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We conducted three main comparisons: 
1. Vegan dietary intervention versus no intervention or minimal intervention for primary prevention;2. Vegan dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for primary prevention;3. Vegan dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for secondary prevention. 
Main results
Thirteen RCTs (38 papers, 7 trial registrations) and eight ongoing trials met our inclusion criteria. Most trials contributed to primary prevention: comparisons 1 (four trials, 466 participants randomised) and comparison 2 (eight trials, 409 participants randomised). We included only one secondary prevention trial for comparison 3 (63 participants randomised). 
None of the trials reported on clinical endpoints. Other primary outcomes included lipid levels and blood pressure. 
For comparison 1 there was moderate‐certainty evidence from four trials with 449 participants that a vegan diet probably led to a small reduction in total cholesterol (mean difference (MD) −0.24 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.36 to −0.12) and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (MD −0.22 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.32 to −0.11), a very small decrease in high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (MD −0.08 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.11 to −0.04) and a very small increase in triglyceride levels (MD 0.11 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21). The very small changes in HDL and triglyceride levels are in the opposite direction to that expected. There was a lack of evidence for an effect with the vegan dietary intervention on systolic blood pressure (MD 0.94 mmHg, 95% CI −1.18 to 3.06; 3 trials, 374 participants) and diastolic blood pressure (MD −0.27 mmHg, 95% CI −1.67 to 1.12; 3 trials, 372 participants) (low‐certainty evidence). 
For comparison 2 there was a lack of evidence for an effect of the vegan dietary intervention on total cholesterol levels (MD −0.04 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.28 to 0.20; 4 trials, 163 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There was probably little or no effect of the vegan dietary intervention on LDL (MD −0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.21 to 0.11; 4 trials, 244 participants) or HDL cholesterol levels (MD −0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.08 to 0.05; 5 trials, 256 participants) or triglycerides (MD 0.21 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.49; 5 trials, 256 participants) compared to other dietary interventions (moderate‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about any effect of the vegan dietary intervention on systolic blood pressure (MD 0.02 mmHg, 95% CI −3.59 to 3.62)  or diastolic blood pressure (MD 0.63 mmHg, 95% CI −1.54 to 2.80; 5 trials, 247 participants (very low‐certainty evidence)). 
Only one trial (63 participants) contributed to comparison 3, where there was a lack of evidence for an effect of the vegan dietary intervention on lipid levels or blood pressure compared to other dietary interventions (low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence). 
Four trials reported on adverse events, which were absent or minor.
Authors' conclusions
Studies were generally small with few participants contributing to each comparison group. None of the included studies report on CVD clinical events. There is currently insufficient information to draw conclusions about the effects of vegan dietary interventions on CVD risk factors. The eight ongoing studies identified will add to the evidence base, with all eight reporting on primary prevention. There is a paucity of evidence for secondary prevention.

## Plain Title: Can a Vegan Diet Help Your Heart?

### Rationale

Heart disease is a big health problem. It can lead to serious issues like heart attacks and strokes. Eating a healthy diet is one way to keep your heart well. Some people believe a vegan diet might help. A vegan diet means no meat, fish, eggs, milk products, or honey. We wanted to see if eating a vegan diet could help prevent heart disease. We also wanted to know if it could help people who already have heart disease.

### Trial Design

We looked at many past studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. One group ate a vegan diet. Another group ate a different diet or no special diet. The studies included healthy adults. They also included adults at high risk for heart disease. And they included adults who already had heart disease. We looked for studies that lasted at least 12 weeks. We wanted to see how a vegan diet changed things like cholesterol and blood pressure. We also looked for any bad side effects.

### Results

We found 13 studies that fit our needs. Most of these studies looked at preventing heart disease. Only one study looked at people who already had heart disease.

None of the studies reported on actual heart attacks or strokes. They mainly looked at things like:
* **Cholesterol:** This is a waxy substance in your blood. High levels can be bad for your heart.
* **Blood Pressure:** This is the force of your blood against your artery walls. High blood pressure is bad for your heart.

In studies where a vegan diet was compared to no special diet:
* A vegan diet likely lowered total cholesterol a little.
* It also likely lowered ""bad"" cholesterol (LDL) a little.
* It caused a very small drop in ""good"" cholesterol (HDL).
* It caused a very small rise in triglycerides. Triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood.
* We did not see a clear effect on blood pressure.

In studies where a vegan diet was compared to another healthy diet:
* We did not see much change in cholesterol levels.
* We also did not see much change in blood pressure.

Only one small study looked at people who already had heart disease. It did not show a clear benefit from a vegan diet.

A few studies reported minor side effects. Most people had no problems.

Overall, the studies were small. We need more research. We cannot say for sure that a vegan diet prevents heart events. We also cannot say for sure that it helps people who already have heart disease. More studies are ongoing. These studies will give us more answers.","Vegan diets for the prevention of cardiovascular disease
Background 
It is well known that diet plays a major role in cardiovascular disease risk. This review assesses the effects of providing dietary advice to follow a vegan diet (excluding all meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey) or providing foods relevant to the diet (or both) to healthy adults, to people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and to those with cardiovascular disease, in order to prevent new or recurrent cardiovascular disease, and to reduce the risk factors associated with it. 
Study characteristics 
We searched key databases of medical studies up to February 2020 and found 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (in 38 papers) that met our criteria. We grouped studies into the following three categories to help us with our interpretation of the results: 
1. Vegan dietary intervention compared to no intervention or a minimal intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;2. Vegan dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;3. Vegan dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention for people with existing cardiovascular disease, to prevent recurrence. 
Key results 
None of the trials reported on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease either in those with or without disease to begin with. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease were reported in the included studies. There was moderate‐certainty evidence for some small reductions in lipid levels with the vegan diet compared to no or minimal intervention in people without disease, but also some very small changes in measures in the opposite direction for cardiovascular benefit. In people who already had cardiovascular disease there was very limited information, as only one trial met our criteria. Four trials reported on side effects of the diet, which were either absent or minor. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Most studies had limitations in study design, so the evidence should be interpreted cautiously. In particular, the overall number of people who took part in the studies was too small to rule out the possibility of chance findings, and too small to pick up any differences in effect on our measures. 
Conclusions 
The review concludes that there is no information currently about the effects of a vegan diet on cardiovascular disease occurrence. There is limited information on the effects of the diet on those who already have cardiovascular disease, and mixed results about risk factors for those without disease. We found eight studies that are still ongoing, and when we have the results from these we will incorporate them into the review to help reduce the uncertainty.

10.1002-14651858.CD010789.pub2,"Whole‐body cryotherapy for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise
Background and aim of the review 
Delayed onset muscle soreness describes the muscular pain, tenderness and stiffness experienced after high‐intensity or unaccustomed exercise. Various therapies are in use to prevent or reduce muscle soreness after exercise and to enhance recovery. One more recent therapy that is growing in use is whole‐body cryotherapy (WBC). This involves single or repeated exposure(s) to extremely cold dry air (below ‐100°C) in a specialised chamber or cabin for two to four minutes per exposure. This review aimed to find out whether WBC reduced muscle soreness, improved recovery and was safe for those people for whom it can be used. 
Results of the search 
We searched medical databases up to August 2015 for studies that compared WBC with a control intervention such as passive rest or no treatment; or with another active intervention such as cold water immersion. We found four small studies. These reported results for a total of 64 physically active young adults. All but four participants were male. The studies were very varied such as the type, temperature, duration and frequency of the WBC and the exercises used to induce muscle soreness. There were two comparisons: WBC compared with a control intervention; and WBC compared with far‐infrared therapy. 
Key results 
All four studies compared WBC with either passive rest or no treatment. These provided some evidence that WBC may reduce muscle soreness (pain at rest) at 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours after exercise. However, the evidence also included the possibility that WBC may not make a difference or may make the pain worse. There was some weak evidence that WBC may improve well‐being at 24 hours. There was no report and probably no monitoring of adverse events in these four studies. 
One very small study also compared WBC with far‐infrared therapy and reported lower levels of muscle soreness one hour after the treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
All four studies had aspects that could undermine the reliability of their results. We decided that the evidence was of very low quality for all outcomes. Thus, the findings remain very uncertain and further research may provide evidence that could change our conclusions. 
Conclusions 
The currently available evidence is insufficient to support the use of WBC for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise in adults. Furthermore, the best prescription of WBC and its safety are not known. 
","## Plain Title: Cold Air Therapy for Sore Muscles After Exercise

### Rationale

After strong exercise, muscles can feel sore, tender, and stiff. This is called ""delayed onset muscle soreness."" It can make it hard to move and feel well. Many things are used to try and make this pain better or go away.

One new way is called ""whole-body cryotherapy"" (WBC). This means being in a very cold, dry room for a few minutes. The air is colder than -100 degrees Celsius. People use this a few times.

This study wanted to see if WBC can help sore muscles. It also looked if it helps people feel better and if it is safe to use. We need to know if this cold air can truly help people feel less pain after they work out.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies that were already done. We looked for studies that compared WBC to other things. This included just resting or doing nothing. It also included other ways to treat pain, like cold water baths.

We found four small studies. These studies looked at a total of 64 young people. Most of them were men. All of them were active and worked out. The studies used different types of WBC. The cold was at different temperatures and used for different amounts of time. The type of exercise to make muscles sore was also different in each study.

The studies compared WBC with resting. One study also compared WBC with a type of heat therapy. We looked at what happened at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours after exercise. The goal was to see if WBC helped with muscle pain at these times.

### Results

All four studies looked at WBC versus just resting. They showed a small hint that WBC might make muscles less sore. This was seen at 1 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after exercise.

However, the results also showed that WBC might not change the pain at all. It might even make the pain worse for some people. There was also a small hint that WBC might make people feel better at 24 hours.

These studies did not look closely at bad effects. It is not clear if WBC caused any problems.

One very small study also looked at WBC versus a heat therapy. It showed that WBC might make muscles less sore after 1 hour.

The information from these studies was not very strong. There were things in all four studies that could make the results less true. So, we are not very sure about these findings. We need more studies to be sure.

Right now, we do not have enough proof to say that WBC helps with sore muscles after exercise. We also do not know the best way to use WBC. We do not know if it is truly safe for everyone. More research is needed to answer these questions.","Whole‐body cryotherapy for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise

10.1002-14651858.CD013505,"Background
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by infrequent or absent ovulation, and high levels of androgens and insulin (hyperinsulinaemia). Hyperinsulinaemia occurs secondary to insulin resistance and is associated with an increased biochemical risk profile for cardiovascular disease and an increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus. Insulin‐sensitising agents such as metformin may be effective in treating PCOS‐related anovulation. This is an update of Morley 2017 and only includes studies on metformin. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of metformin in combination with or in comparison to clomiphene citrate (CC), letrozole and laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) in improving reproductive outcomes and associated gastrointestinal side effects for women with PCOS undergoing ovulation induction. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases from inception to December 2018: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL. We searched registers of ongoing trials and reference lists from relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of metformin compared with placebo, no treatment, or in combination with or compared with CC, letrozole and LOD for women with PCOS subfertility. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and bias. Primary outcomes were live birth rate and gastrointestinal adverse effects. Secondary outcomes included other pregnancy outcomes and ovulation. We combined data to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I2 statistic and reported quality of the evidence for primary outcomes and reproductive outcomes using GRADE methodology. 
Main results
We included 41 studies (4552 women). Evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate based on GRADE assessment. Limitations were risk of bias (poor reporting of methodology and incomplete outcome data), imprecision and inconsistency. 
Metformin versus placebo or no treatment 
The evidence suggests that metformin may improve live birth rates compared with placebo (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.51; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 435 women; low‐quality evidence). For a live birth rate of 19% following placebo, the live birth rate following metformin would be between 19% and 37%. The metformin group probably experiences more gastrointestinal side effects (OR 4.00, 95% CI 2.63 to 6.09; I2 = 39%; 7 studies, 713 women; moderate‐quality evidence). With placebo, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 10% whereas with metformin this risk is between 22% and 40%. There are probably higher rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.65; I2 = 30%; 11 studies, 1213 women; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be higher rates of ovulation with metformin (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.85 to 3.75; I2 = 61%; 13 studies, 684 women; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect on miscarriage rates (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.35; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 748 women; low‐quality evidence). 
Metformin plus CC versus CC alone 
We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rates compared to CC alone (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.65; I2 = 28%; 10 studies, 1219 women; low‐quality evidence), but gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common with combined therapy (OR 4.26, 95% CI 2.83 to 6.40; I2 = 8%; 6 studies, 852 women; moderate quality evidence). The live birth rate with CC alone is 24%, which may change to between 23% to 34% with combined therapy. With CC alone, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 9%, which increases to between 21% to 37% with combined therapy. The combined therapy group probably has higher rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.99; I2 = 31%; 19 studies, 1790 women; moderate‐quality evidence). The combined group may have higher rates of ovulation (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.03; I2 = 63%;21 studies, 1568 women; low‐quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of an effect on miscarriage (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.00; I2 = 0%; 10 studies, 1206 women; low‐quality evidence). 
Metformin versus CC 
When all studies were combined, findings for live birth were inconclusive and inconsistent (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.01; I2 = 86%; 5 studies, 741 women; very low‐quality evidence). In subgroup analysis by obesity status, obese women had a lower birth rate in the metformin group (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.52; 2 studies, 500 women), while the non‐obese group showed a possible benefit from metformin, with high heterogeneity (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.94; I2 = 78%, 3 studies, 241 women; very low‐quality evidence). However, due to the very low quality of the evidence we cannot draw any conclusions. Among obese women taking metformin there may be lower rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.55; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 500 women; low‐quality evidence) and ovulation (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.43; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 500 women; low‐quality evidence) while among non‐obese women, the metformin group may have more pregnancies (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.29; I2 = 26%; 6 studies, 530 women; low‐quality evidence) and no clear difference in ovulation rates (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.25; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 352 women; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in miscarriage rates between the groups (overall: OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.66; I2 = 36%; 6 studies, 781 women; low‐quality evidence) and no studies reported gastrointestinal side effects. 
Authors' conclusions
Our updated review suggests that metformin may be beneficial over placebo for live birth however, more women probably experience gastrointestinal side effects. We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rates compared to CC alone, but gastrointestinal side effects are probably increased with combined therapy. When metformin was compared with CC, data for live birth were inconclusive, and the findings were limited by lack of evidence. Results differed by body mass index (BMI), emphasising the importance of stratifying results by BMI. No studies reported gastrointestinal side effects in this comparison. Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain of the effect of metformin on miscarriage in all three comparisons.

How Metformin Helps Women with PCOS Get Pregnant

### Rationale
Some women have a health issue called Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). This problem can make it hard to get pregnant. Women with PCOS often do not release eggs well. They also have high levels of certain hormones and too much insulin.

Too much insulin can be bad for the heart. It can also lead to diabetes. Metformin is a drug that helps the body use insulin better. We wanted to see if metformin could help women with PCOS get pregnant. We also looked at how safe it was.

### Trial Design
We looked at many past studies. These studies checked how metformin worked. We compared metformin to a sugar pill (placebo) or no treatment. We also looked at metformin used with other drugs. These drugs were clomiphene citrate (CC) and letrozole. We also looked at a surgery called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD).

All studies included women with PCOS who wanted to get pregnant. We checked if metformin helped them have a baby. We also looked for side effects like stomach problems. We gathered all the results. Then we looked at the good and bad points of each study. We aimed to see how strong the proof was.

### Results
We looked at 41 studies in total. These studies included 4,552 women. The proof we found was from ""very low"" to ""medium"" quality. Some studies did not share all their steps. Some results were not clear.

**Metformin versus sugar pill or no treatment:**
Metformin may help more women have a live baby. For every 100 women who had a baby with a sugar pill (19 women), metformin could help up to 37 women have a baby.

However, metformin often caused more stomach problems. About 10 in 100 women had stomach problems with a sugar pill. This number went up to 22 to 40 in 100 women with metformin. Metformin likely helped more women get pregnant. It also may help more women release eggs. We are not sure if metformin changed the rate of miscarriage.

**Metformin plus CC versus CC alone:**
We are not sure if metformin with CC helped more women have a live baby than CC alone. About 24 in 100 women had a baby with CC alone. With metformin and CC, this could be 23 to 34 in 100 women.

But, taking both drugs often led to more stomach problems. About 9 in 100 women had stomach problems with CC alone. This went up to 21 to 37 in 100 women with both drugs. The two drugs together likely led to more pregnancies. They also may help more women release eggs. We saw no clear proof about miscarriage rates.

**Metformin versus CC:**
It was not clear if metformin was better than CC for having a baby. The results were not all the same. For women who were overweight, metformin seemed to lead to fewer babies. For women not overweight, metformin might have helped more women have a baby. But the proof was weak.

We cannot make strong claims here due to the weak proof. Overweight women on metformin may have had fewer pregnancies. They also may have released fewer eggs. Women not overweight on metformin may have had more pregnancies. It was not clear if there was a difference in releasing eggs. We are not sure about miscarriage rates. No studies talked about stomach problems in this group.

**Our conclusion:**
Metformin might help women with PCOS have a baby more often than no treatment. But it likely causes more stomach issues. We are not sure if metformin plus CC is better than CC alone for having a baby. But the two drugs together often cause more stomach issues. When we compared metformin to CC alone, the results were not clear. We need more and better studies. Future studies should look at women with different body weights. We are not sure how metformin affects miscarriage rates in any of these comparisons.","Metformin for ovulation induction in women with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome and subfertility 
Review question 
Researchers reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of metformin compared with other ovulation induction agents, for inducing ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Of interest were live birth rate, gastrointestinal side effects and additional reproductive outcomes. 
Background 
Women with PCOS often have infrequent or no periods because they do not ovulate (release an egg), which can result in infertility. They may also develop problems such as obesity and diabetes. High levels of insulin, a hormone that allows the body to use sugar for energy, may be a cause of PCOS and levels are generally higher in obese women. Metformin helps the body use insulin more effectively and improves ovulation in women with PCOS. However, metformin may cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea or constipation (gastrointestinal side effects). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies in women with PCOS that compared metformin alone or with CC, letrozole or LOD, against CC, letrozole, LOD, placebo (sham treatment) or no treatment. This review updates the previous version of the review. We included 41 randomised controlled trials (where women were randomly allocated to a treatment) with 4552 women. 13 studies are new for this update. We combined results from the studies and assessed the quality of the studies to judge how confident we could be in their results. The evidence is current up to December 2018. 
Key results 
Metformin versus placebo/no treatment 
Metformin may increase the chances of having a live birth compared with no treatment or placebo, however women taking metformin probably experience more gastrointestinal side effects. With placebo, the live birth rate is 19%, and it would be between 19% and 37% with metformin. The risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 10% with placebo, but higher with metformin, between 22% and 40%. Women taking metformin are probably more likely to get pregnant and may be more likely to ovulate. We are uncertain about the effect of metformin compared to placebo or no treatment on miscarriage. 
Metformin plus CC versus CC alone 
We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rate compared to CC alone, but gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common. The live birth rate with CC alone is 24% which may change to between 23% to 34% with metformin and CC combined. With CC alone, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 9%, which increases to between 21% to 37% with metformin and CC combined. However, pregnancy rate is probably improved with metformin and CC. Ovulation rates may be improved with metformin and CC. There was no clear evidence of an effect on miscarriage. 
Metformin versus CC 
We combined all the studies and found that the quality of evidence was very low, results were inconsistent, and we could not confidently draw conclusions. Obese women had a lower birth rate with metformin, while non‐obese women showed a possible benefit from metformin. The live birth rate of non‐obese women with CC is 26%, which may increase to between 26% and 50% with metformin. However, in obese women, the live birth rate is 22% which may decrease to between 5% to 13% with metformin. Similarly, among obese women taking metformin there may be lower rates of clinical pregnancy and ovulation while, non‐obese women taking metformin may have more pregnancies; there was no clear difference in ovulation rates. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in miscarriage rates between women taking metformin or CC. No studies reported gastrointestinal side effects. It is possible that a woman's body mass index (a measure of healthy weight based on height and weight) affects which treatment she should take, although further research is required to establish this. The limited improvement in outcomes such as diabetes with metformin highlights the importance of weight loss and lifestyle adjustment, particularly in overweight women with PCOS. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main problems were that the studies’ methods were poor or unclear, or they did not report all their results (risk of bias), or they were inaccurate and inconsistent.

### A Look at Omega-3 for Cystic Fibrosis

### Rationale

Cystic fibrosis is a sickness that harms the lungs. It causes many infections and swelling. This can make it hard to breathe. It can also make lung health worse over time.

Some people think fish oil, which has omega-3, might help. Omega-3 may fight swelling in the body. This could be good for people with long-term swelling, like in cystic fibrosis.

We need to know if omega-3 can help people with cystic fibrosis. We want to see if it can make them feel better. We also want to know if it can help their lungs.

### Trial Design

This study asked, ""Do omega-3 supplements help people with cystic fibrosis?""

We looked at five small studies. These studies gave some people omega-3. They gave others a fake pill or a different supplement.

In total, 106 people joined these studies. Both kids and adults took part. The studies lasted from six weeks to one year.

### Results

We are not sure if omega-3 helps or not. The studies were too small.

One study, lasting one year, found something good. People who took omega-3 had fewer lung flare-ups. They also used less medicine.

Another study, lasting three months, saw no change. People used the same amount of medicine.

A few people had side effects. But most studies reported very few problems.

One six-week study saw good things. People taking omega-3 had better lung health. They also felt better. This study also said there was less thick fluid in their lungs.

But three studies found no change in lung health. This was true even with omega-3.

Two longer studies showed something clear. People taking omega-3 had more good fats in their blood. These fats are important for cells.

We cannot say for sure if omega-3 helps people with cystic fibrosis. We also cannot say if it causes problems. We need bigger studies to know for sure. We need to know the best amount to take.","The use of omega‐3 supplements in people with cystic fibrosis

## Plain Title
Antibiotic Use for Lung Infection in Cystic Fibrosis Patients

## Rationale

People with cystic fibrosis often get chest infections. These infections can hurt their lungs. Sometimes, a group of germs called Burkholderia cepacia complex infects the lungs. This germ can be hard to treat. Many common medicines do not work against it. It can make lung health worse quickly.

We wanted to see if long-term antibiotic use could help. This study looked at people with cystic fibrosis. They also had this specific lung germ. We wanted to know if a special medicine could make them better.

This medicine might fight these hard-to-treat germs. It could slow down lung damage. Finding a good treatment is very important for these patients.

## Trial Design

This study asked: ""How can we help people with this lung infection?"" We looked at past research. The research was up-to-date as of April 12, 2021.

Only one study met our needs. It included 100 people. Their ages ranged from 6 to 57 years old. All of them had cystic fibrosis. They also had the Burkholderia cepacia complex germ.

The study gave people an inhaled medicine. This medicine was called aztreonam. Some people got aztreonam. Others got a dummy medicine. This dummy medicine had no drug in it. This is called a placebo. Who got which medicine was decided by chance.

The study lasted for 52 weeks. This is about one year. We looked to see how each group did.

## Results

We looked at the results from the one study. The inhaled medicine, aztreonam, did not help. It did not make lung function better. It also did not lower chest infections. People who got aztreonam did not do better. People who got the dummy medicine did not do worse.

There was no difference in how soon people got sick again. The number of hospital stays was also the same. Side effects were similar in both groups. This means the medicine did not cause more problems.

There was no change in death rates. Life quality was also the same. The thickness of mucus in the lungs did not change either.

So, this inhaled antibiotic did not help. We need more studies. We need to find out if other inhaled medicines might work. The quality of this evidence was fair. This means new studies could change what we know.","Antibiotic treatments for long‐term Burkholderia cepacia infections in people with cystic fibrosis

Review question 
We sought to determine if any advanced sperm selection techniques used for assisted reproduction, except for ultra‐high magnification, alter the rates of live birth, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, or foetal abnormalities. 
Background 
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a commonly used treatment for subfertile couples. It is thought that the selection of high‐quality sperm may improve outcomes for these couples. Advanced sperm selection techniques use complex methods to select healthy, mature, and structurally sound sperm for fertilisation. Despite the use of these techniques in many centres worldwide, their effectiveness is unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) with a total of 4147 women. Four studies evaluated sperm selection by their ability to bind to hyaluronic acid during the ICSI process (HA‐ICSI) against ICSI. One study compared HA‐ICSI versus SpermSlow. One study compared HA‐ICSI versus magnetic‐activated cell sorting (MACS) versus ICSI. Three studies compared MACS versus ICSI. One study compared sperm selection by surface charge Zeta potential versus ICSI. Six of the included studies reported rates of live birth; seven reported clinical pregnancy; six reported miscarriage per clinical pregnancy and per woman randomly assigned; and none reported on foetal abnormalities. 
Key results 
The current evidence suggests that advanced sperm selection strategies in assisted reproductive technologist (ART) may not result in an increase in the likelihood of live birth. The only sperm selection technique that potentially increases live birth and clinical pregnancy rates is Zeta sperm selection, yet these results were of very low quality and derived from a single study, therefore we are uncertain of the effect. There is low‐quality evidence that HA‐ICSI decreases miscarriage rates when compared with ICSI. We are uncertain whether the other sperm selection techniques alter clinical pregnancy or miscarriage rates. No studies reported on foetal abnormalities, and further studies of suitable quality are required before any of these advanced sperm selection techniques can be recommended for use in clinical practice. 
Evidence quality 
The evidence gathered was of very low to low quality. The main limitations were imprecision associated with low numbers of participants or events and high risk of performance bias. Data on important clinical outcomes such as foetal abnormalities were absent. 
","## Picking the Best Sperm for Pregnancy

### Rationale

Many couples have trouble getting pregnant. This is called subfertility.
Doctors use a treatment called IVF. This helps a sperm meet an egg.
Sometimes, doctors inject sperm right into an egg. This is called ICSI.

Some doctors think picking the best sperm can help.
They use special ways to find strong and healthy sperm.
These advanced methods aim to pick mature sperm.
They want sperm that can lead to a baby.

But we do not know if these special ways work well.
Many clinics use them around the world.
We need to know if they truly help couples have a baby.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many research papers.
We wanted to see if special sperm picking methods help.
We looked at different ways to choose sperm.
We did not look at very high-power zoom methods.

We wanted to know if these methods change:
* How many babies are born alive.
* How many women get pregnant.
* How many pregnancies end too soon (miscarriage).
* If babies have any problems.

We found eight studies to review.
These studies were ""randomized controlled trials.""
This means people were put into groups by chance.
One group got the new sperm picking method. The other got standard care.

A total of 4,147 women were in these studies.
Some studies looked at sperm that stick to a sugar called hyaluronic acid. This is called HA-ICSI.
They compared it to regular ICSI.
Other studies looked at methods like MACS. This sorts sperm using magnets.
One study looked at a method called Zeta potential. This sorts sperm by their electric charge.

We checked how many studies reported on important things.
Six studies reported on live births.
Seven studies reported on clinical pregnancies.
Six studies reported on miscarriages.
No studies reported on problems with babies.

### Results

What did we find from all these studies?
The results show that most special sperm picking methods may not help.
They may not make it more likely to have a baby born alive.
It seems they do not change the chance of getting pregnant.

One method, called Zeta sperm selection, might help.
It might make live births and pregnancies more likely.
But we are not sure about this.
Only one study looked at Zeta selection.
The proof was not very strong.

One special method, HA-ICSI, might lower miscarriages.
This means fewer pregnancies might end too soon.
This was compared to standard ICSI.
The proof for this was not very strong either.

We still do not know if other methods change pregnancy or miscarriage rates.
No studies checked if these methods caused problems for babies.
We need more good studies to be sure.
Until then, doctors cannot say these methods are best.
More research is needed before they are used often.","Advanced sperm selection techniques for assisted reproduction

10.1002-14651858.CD013678.pub2,"Background
Lamellar macular holes (LMHs) are small, partial‐thickness defects of the macula defined by characteristic features on optical coherence tomography (OCT), including a newly recognised type of epiretinal membrane termed ‘epiretinal proliferation’. There may be a rationale to recommend surgery for individuals with LMHs, particularly those with functional or anatomical deterioration, or poor baseline vision causing significant disability, to stabilise the LMH and prevent further visual deterioration; however, there is currently no evidence‐based consensus. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of surgical interventions on post‐operative visual and anatomical outcomes in people with a confirmed LMH. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Scopus SciVerse, ISRCTN registry, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We also searched reference lists of included trials to identify other eligible trials which our search strategy may have missed. The date of the search was 20 July 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants with a confirmed LMH diagnosis which reported one or more surgical intervention(s), alone or in combination, in at least one arm of the RCT. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods as expected by Cochrane. Two study authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for included trials. Trial authors were contacted for further information and clarification. 
Main results
A single RCT was eligible for inclusion. Thirty‐six participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio; 24 were allocated to undergo surgery (pars plana vitrectomy, peeling of the epiretial proliferation followed by fovea‐sparing removal of the internal limiting membrane) and 12 (10 following two participant dropouts) to observation. 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence was low for all outcomes due to selection and detection bias, and the low number of participants enrolled in the study which may affect the accuracy of results and reliability of conclusions. 
At six‐month follow‐up, change in vision was better in the surgery group (‐0.27 logMAR improvement) than observation (0.02 worsening) (mean difference (MD): ‐0.29 logMAR, 95% confidence intervals (CI): ‐0.33 to ‐0.25). Central retinal thickness increased in the surgery group over 6 months 126 μm increase) compared with observation group (decrease by 11μm) (MD: 137 μm, 95% CI: 125.87 μm to 148.13 μm). Finally, at six‐month follow‐up, retinal sensitivity was better in the surgery group (3.03 dB increase) compared with the observation group (0.06 dB decrease) (MD: 3.09 dB, 95% CI: 2.07 to 4.11 dB). 
Vision‐related quality of life and metamorphopsia were not reported. No adverse outcomes or complications were reported in the study, however, authors could not provide information on whether any individuals developed deterioration in vision of 0.2 logMAR or worse. 
Authors' conclusions
The included single trial demonstrated improvements in visual and anatomical outcome measures for participants with a LMH who underwent surgery compared with observation only. Therefore, we can conclude that participants who undergo surgery may achieve superior post‐operative best corrected visual acuity and anatomical outcomes compared with observation only. However, the results of a single and small RCT provides limited evidence to support or refute surgery as an effective management option for LMHs. Future RCTs with a larger number of participants and with fewer methodological limitations and biases are necessary to inform future clinical practice. 
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study:

### Plain Title: Surgery May Help People with a Special Eye Condition

### Rationale

Your eye has a part called the macula. This part helps you see clearly and read. Sometimes, a small tear or hole can form in the macula. This is called a lamellar macular hole (LMH).

An LMH can make it hard to see clearly. It can also cause your vision to get worse over time. Doctors are not sure if surgery is the best way to help people with an LMH. Some doctors think surgery might stop vision from getting worse. They also think it might make vision better.

This study looked at past research to see if surgery helps people with LMH. We wanted to find out if surgery improves vision and how the eye looks inside. This study is important because we need to know the best way to treat LMHs.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies that tested surgery for LMH. We searched many medical databases to find these studies. We looked for studies that randomly put people into groups. One group would get surgery, and another group would not. These are called ""randomized controlled trials.""

We were looking for studies with people who had an LMH. These studies needed to report on vision or how the eye looked after surgery.

We found only one study that fit our rules. It included 36 people with LMHs. These people were of different ages and health conditions. We do not know their exact ages or if there were more men or women.

In that study, 24 people had surgery. This surgery fixed the hole in their macula. 12 people did not have surgery. They were just watched by doctors. The study followed these people for six months.

### Results

The study found that surgery helped people with LMHs.

After six months, people who had surgery saw better. Their vision improved. People who did not have surgery saw a little worse. The people who had surgery also had better eye health inside their eye. The inside of their eye looked better after surgery.

The study did not report on how surgery affected daily life or if people saw wavy lines less often. No one in the study had bad side effects from the surgery.

We learned that surgery might make vision better for people with LMHs. It might also improve how the eye looks inside. However, this was only one small study. We need more and larger studies to be sure that surgery is the best choice for people with LMHs.","The effectiveness of surgery for treating lamellar macular holes
Why is this question important?Lamellar macular holes are small partial‐thickness defects affecting the centre of the retina, called the macula. The retina is the layer at the back of the eye that detects light, and the macula is essential for detailed vision. It has been suggested that surgery can prevent vision loss (or improve vision) in people with lamellar macular holes, but there is no current consensus. We reviewed published research to determine whether surgery improves vision for people with a lamellar macular hole. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of treatment. We then planned to compare the results, and summarise the evidence from the studies. Finally, we then aimed to rate our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and how similar the findings of the different studies were. 
What did we find?We found one study that involved a total of 36 people with a diagnosis of a lamellar macular hole. This study showed that people who underwent surgery may achieve better vision six months after their surgery compared with people who were observed without receiving surgery. However, limitations in the study design and its small size means that our confidence in the evidence was low. 
What does this mean?It remains unclear whether surgery is effective for people with lamellar macular holes. Further research is required. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 20 July 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013739.pub2,"Background
The primary manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is respiratory insufficiency that can also be related to diffuse pulmonary microthrombosis and thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or arterial thrombosis. People with COVID‐19 who develop thromboembolism have a worse prognosis. 
Anticoagulants such as heparinoids (heparins or pentasaccharides), vitamin K antagonists and direct anticoagulants are used for the prevention and treatment of venous or arterial thromboembolism. Besides their anticoagulant properties, heparinoids have an additional anti‐inflammatory potential. However, the benefit of anticoagulants for people with COVID‐19 is still under debate. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention in people hospitalised with COVID‐19. 
Search methods
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and IBECS databases, the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and medRxiv preprint database from their inception to 14 April 2021. We also checked the reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews identified, and contacted specialists in the field for additional references to trials. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs and cohort studies that compared prophylactic anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention for the management of people hospitalised with COVID‐19. We excluded studies without a comparator group and with a retrospective design (all previously included studies) as we were able to include better study designs. Primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality and necessity for additional respiratory support. Secondary outcomes were mortality related to COVID‐19, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, adverse events, length of hospital stay and quality of life. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used Cochrane RoB 1 to assess the risk of bias for RCTs, ROBINS‐I to assess risk of bias for non‐randomised studies (NRS) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We meta‐analysed data when appropriate. 
Main results
We included seven studies (16,185 participants) with participants hospitalised with COVID‐19, in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. Studies were from Brazil (2), Iran (1), Italy (1), and the USA (1), and two involved more than country. The mean age of participants was 55 to 68 years and the follow‐up period ranged from 15 to 90 days. The studies assessed the effects of heparinoids, direct anticoagulants or vitamin K antagonists, and reported sparse data or did not report some of our outcomes of interest: necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, and quality of life. 
Higher‐dose versus lower‐dose anticoagulants (4 RCTs, 4647 participants) 
Higher‐dose anticoagulants result in little or no difference in all‐cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.16, 4489 participants; 4 RCTs) and increase minor bleeding (RR 3.28, 95% CI 1.75 to 6.14, 1196 participants; 3 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (high‐certainty evidence). Higher‐dose anticoagulants probably reduce pulmonary embolism (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.70, 4360 participants; 4 RCTs), and slightly increase major bleeding (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.80, 4400 participants; 4 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (moderate‐certainty evidence). Higher‐dose anticoagulants may result in little or no difference in deep vein thrombosis (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.03, 3422 participants; 4 RCTs), stroke (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.03, 4349 participants; 3 RCTs), major adverse limb events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.99, 1176 participants; 2 RCTs), myocardial infarction (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.55, 4349 participants; 3 RCTs), atrial fibrillation (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.70, 562 participants; 1 study), or thrombocytopenia (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.24, 2789 participants; 2 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (low‐certainty evidence). It is unclear whether higher‐dose anticoagulants have any effect on necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, and quality of life (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). 
Anticoagulants versus no treatment (3 prospective NRS, 11,538 participants) 
Anticoagulants may reduce all‐cause mortality but the evidence is very uncertain due to two study results being at critical and serious risk of bias (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.74, 8395 participants; 3 NRS; very low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain if anticoagulants have any effect on necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, stroke, myocardial infarction and quality of life (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). 
Ongoing studies 
We found 62 ongoing studies in hospital settings (60 RCTs, 35,470 participants; 2 prospective NRS, 120 participants) in 20 different countries. Thirty‐five ongoing studies plan to report mortality and 26 plan to report necessity for additional respiratory support. We expect 58 studies to be completed in December 2021, and four in July 2022. From 60 RCTs, 28 are comparing different doses of anticoagulants, 24 are comparing anticoagulants versus no anticoagulants, seven are comparing different types of anticoagulants, and one did not report detail of the comparator group. 
Authors' conclusions
When compared to a lower‐dose regimen, higher‐dose anticoagulants result in little to no difference in all‐cause mortality and increase minor bleeding in people hospitalised with COVID‐19 up to 30 days. Higher‐dose anticoagulants possibly reduce pulmonary embolism, slightly increase major bleeding, may result in little to no difference in hospitalisation time, and may result in little to no difference in deep vein thrombosis, stroke, major adverse limb events, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, or thrombocytopenia.  
Compared with no treatment, anticoagulants may reduce all‐cause mortality but the evidence comes from non‐randomised studies and is very uncertain. It is unclear whether anticoagulants have any effect on the remaining outcomes compared to no anticoagulants (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). 
Although we are very confident that new RCTs will not change the effects of different doses of anticoagulants on mortality and minor bleeding, high‐quality RCTs are still needed, mainly for the other primary outcome (necessity for additional respiratory support), the comparison with no anticoagulation, when comparing the types of anticoagulants and giving anticoagulants for a prolonged period of time.

## Plain Title: Blood Thinners for People in the Hospital with COVID-19

### Rationale

When people get very sick with COVID-19, their lungs can have trouble working. This is the main problem from the virus. Sometimes, people with COVID-19 also get blood clots. These clots can form in the lungs or in other parts of the body. Blood clots can make people even sicker. They can even make it harder for people to get better.

Doctors sometimes use medicines called blood thinners. These medicines stop blood clots from forming. They can also break up clots that are already there. Heparins are a type of blood thinner. They also help calm down swelling in the body. We wanted to see if blood thinners help people in the hospital with COVID-19. We hoped these medicines could make people feel better and help them heal.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. It combined what they found out about blood thinners. We looked for studies that had people in the hospital with COVID-19. These people were in intensive care, regular hospital rooms, or emergency rooms.

We looked at studies that compared blood thinners to not getting blood thinners. We also looked at studies that compared different doses of blood thinners. The people in these studies were often between 55 and 68 years old. They stayed in the studies for about 15 to 90 days. We wanted to know if blood thinners changed how many people died. We also looked at if people needed extra help to breathe.

### Results

We found seven studies to include. These studies had a total of 16,185 people. The studies were from different countries.

**Higher dose versus lower dose of blood thinners:**

Giving more blood thinner did not change how many people died. This was compared to giving a lower dose. But, a higher dose did cause more minor bleeding. This is bleeding that is not very serious. A higher dose likely lowered the chance of blood clots in the lungs. It also slightly increased serious bleeding. This is bleeding that needs medical help.

A higher dose might not change other problems. These include clots in the legs or heart attacks. We are not sure if a higher dose affects breathing help or quality of life. The studies did not give enough information on these things.

**Blood thinners versus no treatment:**

Some studies looked at blood thinners versus no blood thinners. These studies suggest that blood thinners might lower the number of people who die. However, we are not very sure about this. The studies had some problems with how they were done. We cannot say for sure if blood thinners help with breathing or other problems. More research is needed here.

**Our main findings are these:**

*   Higher doses of blood thinners do not lower deaths.
*   Higher doses cause more minor bleeding.
*   Higher doses might lower lung clots, but increase serious bleeding.
*   We need more good studies to be sure about many things.

Many new studies are happening now. They will help us learn more. These new studies will look at different doses of blood thinners. They will also compare blood thinners to no treatment. We expect most of these studies to finish by the end of 2021.","Do blood thinners prevent people who are hospitalised with COVID‐19 from developing blood clots? 
Key messages 
‐ High‐dose blood thinners result in little or no difference in death rate and increase minor bleeding compared to low‐dose blood thinners for people hospitalised with COVID‐19. Giving blood thinners compared to not giving blood thinners might reduce the death rate. 
‐ It is very likely that new studies will not change the evidence about the effects of different doses of blood thinners on death rate and minor bleeding. High‐quality studies are still needed to analyse the need for additional respiratory support, giving blood thinners compared to no blood thinners, comparing different blood thinners, and giving blood thinners for extended periods. 
What is COVID‐19? 
COVID‐19 typically affects the lungs and airways; however, in addition to respiratory problems, about 16% of people hospitalised with COVID‐19 experience problems with their blood vessels, leading to blood clots forming in the arteries, veins and lungs. Nearly half of all people with severe COVID‐19 in intensive care units develop clots in their veins or arteries. 
What are blood thinners? 
Blood thinners are medicines that prevent harmful blood clots from forming (deep vein thrombosis). However, they can cause unwanted effects such as bleeding. Some guidelines recommend giving blood thinners when people are first admitted to hospital with COVID‐19 to prevent blood clots from developing, rather than waiting to see whether blood clots develop and then treating them with blood thinners. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether giving blood thinners to people hospitalised with COVID‐19 as a preventive measure reduced the number of deaths compared to people who received no treatment or those who received a placebo treatment (an identical‐seeming treatment but with no active ingredient). We also wanted to determine whether these individuals needed less support with breathing, whether they still developed harmful blood clots, whether they experienced bleeding and whether they experienced any other unwanted events. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed blood thinners given to people hospitalised with COVID‐19 to prevent blood clots. Studies could be of any design as long as they compared a blood thinner with another blood thinner, no treatment or a placebo. Studies could take place anywhere in the world and participants could be any age as long as they were in hospital with confirmed COVID‐19 disease. We pooled the results when appropriate. 
What did we find? 
We included seven studies with 16,185 people hospitalised with COVID‐19 in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. Studies were from Brazil (2), Iran (1), Italy (1), and the USA (1), and two involved more than country. People in the studies were aged from 55 to 68 years on average. Studies lasted from 15 to 90 days and provided evidence on deaths, bleeding, blood clotting, length of hospital stay and unwanted effects. There was little or no evidence on need for respiratory support (help with breathing), deaths related to COVID‐19, and quality of life. 
Higher‐dose of blood thinners compared with lower‐dose (4 studies, 4647 people)  In people who received higher compared to lower doses of blood thinners there was little to no difference in death rate. However, people on higher doses were more likely to experience minor bleeding compared to in those on lower doses. People who received higher doses of blood thinners likely had reduced pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung or blood vessel leading to the lung), slightly increased major (more severe) bleeding, and probably had little to no difference in time spent in hospital compared to those who received the lower doses of blood thinners. In people who received higher doses of blood thinners, there was little to no difference in the rate of deep vein thrombosis, and other unwanted events compared to those who received the lower dose of blood thinners. 
Blood thinners compared with no treatment (3 studies, 11,538 people)  People who received blood thinners had a reduced death rate compared to those who did not receive blood thinners, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are very confident that higher doses of blood thinners do not change the risk of death but do increase the risk of bleeding in people hospitalised with COVID‐19. 
Although our confidence in the evidence is very limited, people who receive blood thinners may have a lower death rate compared to those who did not receive any blood thinners. 
What happens next? 
Our searches found 62 ongoing studies with 35,470 people. We plan to add the results of these studies to our review when they are published. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 14 April 2021.

Chronic rhinosinusitis frequently occurs in people with cystic fibrosis. Several medical interventions are available for treating chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis; for example, different concentrations of nasal saline irrigations, topical or oral corticosteroids, antibiotics ‐ including nebulized antibiotics ‐ dornase alfa and modulators of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (such as lumacaftor, ivacaftor or tezacaftor). However, the efficacy of these interventions is unclear. 
This is an update of a previously published review.
Objectives
The objective of this review is to compare the effects of different medical interventions in people diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and hand searching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search of trials register: 09 September 2021. 
We also searched ongoing trials databases, other medical databases and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest additional searches: 22 November 2021. 
Selection criteria
Randomized and quasi‐randomized trials of different medical interventions compared to each other or to no intervention or to placebo. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials identified for potential inclusion in the review. We planned to conduct data collection and analysis in accordance with Cochrane methods and to independently rate the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE guidelines. 
Main results
We identified no trials that met the pre‐defined inclusion criteria. The most recent searches identified 44 new references, none of which were eligible for inclusion in the current version of this review; 12 studies are listed as excluded and one as ongoing. 
Authors' conclusions
We identified no eligible trials assessing the medical interventions in people with cystic fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis. High‐quality trials are needed which should assess the efficacy of different treatment options detailed above for managing chronic rhinosinusitis, preventing pulmonary exacerbations and improving quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis.

## Plain Title: Looking for Better Ways to Treat Nose Problems in Cystic Fibrosis

### Rationale

Cystic fibrosis is a disease that affects many parts of the body. It makes thick, sticky mucus. This mucus can block airways. It can also cause problems in the nose and sinuses. This is called chronic rhinosinusitis.

Chronic rhinosinusitis means you have a stuffy or runny nose for a long time. It can cause pain and pressure in your face. It makes it hard to breathe through your nose. This problem is very common for people with cystic fibrosis.

There are many ways doctors try to treat these nose problems. Some use salt water rinses. Others use nose sprays or pills. Some people take special drugs for cystic fibrosis. But we do not know which treatments work best. We do not know how well they work.

This study looked at past research. It wanted to find out which treatments help people with cystic fibrosis. It aimed to see what really makes a difference. We need to find good ways to treat these nose problems. Good treatment can help people feel better. It can also stop other problems, like lung infections.

### Trial Design

This study was a ""review."" This means the researchers did not do new tests on people. Instead, they looked at other studies that had already been done. They searched for very specific types of studies.

They looked for studies called ""randomized trials."" In these studies, people get different treatments by chance. This helps make sure the results are fair. They wanted studies that compared one treatment to another. They also looked for studies that compared a treatment to no treatment. Or, they looked for studies that compared a treatment to a ""placebo."" A placebo is like a dummy pill or spray with no medicine in it.

The researchers searched many medical databases. They looked in books and at notes from meetings. They searched for studies up until the end of 2021. They wanted to find out how different nose treatments work. They focused on people who have cystic fibrosis. These people also had long-term nose and sinus problems. The studies could include people of any age or gender.

The researchers looked at the studies one by one. Two different people checked each study. They made sure the study fit the rules. If a study matched their rules, they would gather its information. Then they would compare the results of the different treatments. They planned to rate how good the evidence was from each study.

### Results

The researchers looked at many studies. They searched for hundreds of titles. They found many new articles about cystic fibrosis. But they found *no studies* that met their strict rules.

This means they could not compare treatments. They found no good studies that tested treatments for nose problems. They could not say which treatment worked best. They could not say if any treatment was better than no treatment.

The main result is that we still do not know. We do not have clear answers. We do not know which medical treatments work well for people with cystic fibrosis. We also do not know which treatments help their chronic rhinosinusitis.

This study shows a big need. Doctors need to do new, careful studies. These studies should test different treatments for nose problems in cystic fibrosis. They need to see how well these treatments work. We need to know if treatments help stop lung problems. We also need to know if they make life better for patients.

In short, there is no good proof right now. We need more research. We need to find effective ways to help people with cystic fibrosis breathe better and feel better.","Medical interventions for chronic inflammation of the nose and sinuses in cystic fibrosis
Review question 
What are the effects of medical interventions for chronic rhinosinusitis on people with cystic fibrosis? 
Background 
Chronic rhinosinusitis is long‐term infection and inflammation of the nasal cavity and air‐filled spaces around the eyes and nose. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that makes secretions in the body thick, and hence stagnant. When this occurs in and around the nose, it causes chronic rhinosinusitis. Better care of people with cystic fibrosis has led to them living longer, increasing the chance of developing chronic rhinosinusitis. Early and effective interventions with antibiotics, steroids, drugs that thin the mucus (e.g. dornase alfa) and drugs to improve how the cell membrane channel functions (CFTR modulators) can help to improve quality of life and prevent the development of lower airway disease. Currently, there are no guidelines based on trials to know how best to treat chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 09 September 2021.
Study characteristics 
We found no trials in our search that met our inclusion criteria. We have listed 12 trials as excluded and one trial as ongoing in the current review. 
Key results 
Although chronic rhinosinusitis is common in people with cystic fibrosis, there is not enough evidence available on its management. This review highlights the need for well‐designed trials assessing which treatment is best for managing chronic rhinosinusitis, preventing lower airway disease and improving quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis.

Smoking is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly coronary heart disease (CHD). However, quitting smoking may prevent secondary CVD events in people already diagnosed with CHD.  
Objectives
To examine the impact of smoking cessation on death from CVD and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), in people with incident CHD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the trials registries clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We ran all searches from database inception to 15 April 2021.  
Selection criteria
We included cohort studies, and both cluster‐ and individually randomised controlled trials of at least six months' duration. We treated all included studies as cohort studies and analysed them by smoking status at follow‐up. Eligible studies had to recruit adults (> 18 years) with diagnosed CHD and who smoked tobacco at diagnosis, and assess whether they quit or continued smoking during the study. Studies had to measure at least one of our included outcomes with at least six months' follow‐up. Our primary outcomes were death from CVD and MACE. Secondary outcomes included all‐cause mortality, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, non‐fatal stroke, new‐onset angina and change in quality of life.  
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. 
We assessed the risk of bias for the primary outcomes using the ROBINS‐I tool. We compared the incidence of death from CVD and of MACE (primary outcomes) between participants who quit smoking versus those who continued to smoke for each included study that reported these outcomes. We also assessed differences in all‐cause mortality, incidence of non‐fatal myocardial infarction, incidence of non‐fatal stroke and new onset angina. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For our outcome, change in quality of life, we calculated the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for the difference in change in quality of life from baseline to follow‐up between those who had quit smoking and those who had continued to smoke. For all meta‐analyses we used a generic inverse variance random‐effects model and quantified statistical heterogeneity using the I²statistic. 
We assessed the certainty of evidence for our primary outcomes using the eight GRADE considerations relevant to non‐randomised studies. 
Main results
We included 68 studies, consisting of 80,702 participants.
For both primary outcomes, smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk compared with continuous smoking: CVD death (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.75; I² = 62%; 18 studies, 17,982 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and MACE (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.71; I² = 84%; 15 studies, 20,290 participants; low‐certainty evidence). These findings were robust to our planned sensitivity analyses. Through subgroup analysis, for example comparing adjusted versus non‐adjusted estimates, we found no evidence of differences in the effect size. While there was substantial heterogeneity, this was primarily in magnitude rather than the direction of the effect estimates. Overall, we judged 11 (16%) studies to be at moderate risk of bias and 18 (26%) at serious risk, primarily due to possible confounding. There was also some evidence of funnel plot asymmetry for MACE outcomes. For these reasons, we rated our certainty in the estimates for CVD death as moderate and MACE as low.  
For our secondary outcomes, smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk in all‐cause mortality (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.66; I² = 58%; 48 studies, 59,354 participants), non‐fatal myocardial infarction (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.72; I² = 2%; 24 studies, 23,264 participants) and non‐fatal stroke (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 11,352 participants). As only one study reported new onset of angina, we did not conduct meta‐analysis, but this study reported a lower risk in people who stopped smoking. Quitting smoking was not associated with a worsening of quality of life and suggested improvement in quality of life, with the lower bound of the CI also consistent with no difference (SMD 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.24; I² = 48%; 8 studies, 3182 participants).  
Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence that smoking cessation is associated with a reduction of approximately one‐third in the risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease in people who stop smoking at diagnosis. This association may be causal, based on the link between smoking cessation and restoration of endothelial and platelet function, where dysfunction of both can result in increased likelihood of CVD events.  
Our results provide evidence that there is a decreased risk of secondary CVD events in those who quit smoking compared with those who continue, and that there is a suggested improvement in quality of life as a result of quitting smoking. Additional studies that account for confounding, such as use of secondary CVD prevention medication, would strengthen the evidence in this area.

## Plain Title
Quitting Smoking Helps People with Heart Disease Live Longer and Healthier Lives

## Rationale
Smoking is a major cause of heart problems. It can lead to serious conditions like heart attacks. Many people already have heart disease. For them, smoking makes their condition worse. It can even lead to death.

This study looked at people who had heart disease. We wanted to see if quitting smoking helped them. We thought quitting smoking could lower their risk. It might stop more heart problems from happening.

We know smoking harms blood vessels. It makes the blood sticky. Quitting smoking can fix some of this damage. So, quitting could protect the heart. This study was important to show how much it helps.

## Trial Design
We wanted to know how this study was designed. We looked at many past studies. These studies followed people over time. They watched if people quit smoking. They also watched for new heart problems.

The studies included adults over 18 years old. All of them had heart disease. They also smoked when they were first diagnosed. We checked their health for at least six months.

We mainly looked at two things. We checked if people died from heart disease. We also checked for major heart events. These include heart attacks and strokes. We also looked at general death rates. We checked if people had new chest pain. We also looked at how their life quality changed.

## Results
We looked at 68 studies. These studies included over 80,000 people. We found clear results. Quitting smoking helped people a lot.

People who quit smoking had a lower risk of death. They were less likely to die from heart disease. Their risk was about one-third lower. They also had fewer major heart problems. Their risk of these problems was also about one-third lower.

Quitting smoking also lowered other risks. People who quit were less likely to die from any cause. They had fewer heart attacks. They also had fewer strokes. One study also showed less new chest pain.

Quitting smoking did not make life worse. It actually seemed to make life better. People who quit felt better.

These results tell us a lot. If you have heart disease and smoke, quit. It can help you live longer. It can also help you have fewer heart problems. We need more studies. These new studies can help us learn even more. They can look at other medicines people take. This will make our proof even stronger.","Does stopping smoking make people with heart disease less likely to have another heart attack? 
Key messages 
• People with heart disease who stop smoking are likely to experience a decreased risk in future heart attacks or other events linked to the heart or blood vessels, such as stroke.  
• People with heart disease who stop smoking are unlikely to have worse quality of life. 
Smoking and heart disease 
Smoking increases the chances that a person will have a heart attack, however there is less information on whether stopping smoking can reduce the risk of having a second heart attack.  
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out whether stopping smoking after a heart attack can reduce the chances of having further heart attacks or other types of disease linked to the heart or blood vessels. If stopping smoking does prevent further illness this could motivate more people to quit smoking and encourage doctors and nurses to provide more active support to help people to stop.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that lasted at least 6 months, and that included people diagnosed with heart disease who were smoking when the study started. Studies also had to measure whether people did or did not stop smoking and whether or not they had another event linked to their heart or blood vessels, such as another heart attack or a stroke.  
Search date: we included studies published up to 15 April 2021. 
What we found 
We found 68 studies with 80,702 people. Most studies included adult men and women from the general population, however, 11 studies included only men. We looked at the combined results of 60 studies that measured events linked to heart disease and of 8 studies that measured people’s quality of life over a period of 6 months or more.  
What are the results of our review? 
Compared with people who continued to smoke, people who stopped smoking were a third less likely to die from heart disease or stroke (evidence from 17,982 people in 18 studies) and a third less likely to have another heart attack or stroke (evidence from 20,290 people in 15 studies). Our confidence in these results was moderate (death from heart disease or stroke) and low (death from heart disease or stroke, another heart attack or another stroke) respectively. Our confidence in the strength of our results was reduced because of issues with how some of the studies were designed and carried out. However, when we only examined studies of a higher standard, we continued to find that people who stopped smoking were less likely to die from heart disease or stroke. This suggests that while we may be uncertain about how big the reduction in the chance of dying is, people who stop smoking are likely to reduce their chances of dying from heart disease or stroke to some degree. We found similar results for a decreased likelihood of dying from any cause, having another heart attack that does not lead to death and having a stroke that does not lead to death.  
We also found that people who stopped smoking had a suggested improvement in quality of life compared with those who continued smoking after being diagnosed with heart disease.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with dyspnoea, cough or sputum production (or both) and affects quality of life and functional status. More efficient approaches to alternative management that may include patients themselves managing their condition need further exploration in order to reduce the impact on both patients and healthcare services. Digital interventions may potentially impact on health behaviours and encourage patient engagement. 
Objectives
To assess benefits and harms of digital interventions for managing COPD and apply Behaviour Change Technique (BCT) taxonomy to describe and explore intervention content. 
Search methods
We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register (date of last search 28 April 2020). We found other trials at web‐based clinical trials registers. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing digital technology interventions with or without routine supported self‐management to usual care, or control treatment for self‐management. Multi‐component interventions (of which one component was digital self‐management) compared with usual care, standard care or control treatment were included. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved with a third review author. We assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes were impact on health behaviours, self‐efficacy, exacerbations and quality of life, including the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The minimally important difference (MID) for the SGRQ is 4 points. Two review authors independently applied BCT taxonomy to identify mechanisms in the digital interventions that influence behaviours. 
Main results
Fourteen studies were included in the meta‐analyses (1518 participants) ranging from 13 to 52 weeks duration. Participants had mild to very severe COPD. Risk of bias was high due to lack of blinding. GRADE ratings were low to very low certainty due to lack of blinding and imprecision. Common BCT clusters identified as behaviour change mechanisms in interventions were goals and planning, feedback and monitoring, social support, shaping knowledge and antecedents. 
Digital technology intervention with or without routine supported self‐management 
Interventions included mobile phone (three studies), smartphone applications (one study), and web or Internet‐based (five studies). 
Evidence is very uncertain about effects on impact on health behaviours as measured by six‐minute walk distance (6MWD) at 13 weeks (mean difference (MD) 26.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐21.70 to 74.10; participants = 122; studies = 2) or 23 to 26 weeks (MD 14.31, 95% CI ‐19.41 to 48.03; participants = 164; studies = 3). There may be improvement in 6MWD at 52 weeks (MD 54.33 95% CI ‐35.47 to 144.12; participants = 204; studies = 2) but studies were varied (very low certainty). 
There may be no difference in self‐efficacy on managing Chronic Disease Scale (SEMCD) or pulmonary rehabilitation adapted index of self‐efficacy tool (PRAISE). Evidence is very uncertain. 
Quality of life may be slightly improved on the chronic respiratory disease questionnaire (CRQ) at 13 weeks (MD 0.45, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.90; participants = 123; studies = 2; low certainty), but is not clinically important (MID 0.5). There may be little or no difference at 23 or 52 weeks (low to very low certainty). There may be a clinical improvement on SGRQ total at 52 weeks (MD ‐26.57, 95% CI ‐34.09 to ‐19.05; participants = 120; studies = 1; low certainty). Evidence for COPD assessment test (CAT) and Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) is very uncertain. 
There may be little or no difference in dyspnoea symptoms (CRQ dyspnoea) at 13, 23 weeks or 52 weeks (low to very low certainty evidence) or mean number of exacerbations at 26 weeks (low‐certainty evidence). 
There was no evidence for the number of people experiencing adverse events.
Multi‐component interventions 
Digital components included mobile phone (one study), and web or internet‐based (four studies). 
Evidence is very uncertain about effects on impact on health behaviour (6MWD) at 13 weeks (MD 99.60, 95% CI ‐15.23 to 214.43; participants = 20; studies = 1). 
No evidence was found for self‐efficacy. Four studies reported effects on quality of life (SGRQ and CCQ scales). The evidence is very uncertain. 
There may be no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations or mean days to first exacerbation at 52 weeks with a multi‐component intervention compared to standard care. 
Evidence is very uncertain about effects on the number of people experiencing adverse events at 52 weeks. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a clear benefit or harm of digital technology interventions with or without supported self‐management, or multi‐component interventions compared to usual care in improving the 6MWD or self‐efficacy. We found there may be some short‐term improvement in quality of life with digital interventions, but there is no evidence about whether the effect is sustained long term. Dyspnoea symptoms may improve over a longer duration of digital intervention use. The evidence for multi‐component interventions is very uncertain and as there is little or no evidence for adverse events, we cannot determine the benefit or harm of these interventions. The evidence base is predominantly of very low certainty with concerns around high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. Given that variation of interventions and blinding is likely to be a concern, future, larger studies are needed taking these limitations in consideration. Future studies are needed to determine whether the small improvements observed in this review can be applied to the general COPD population. 
A clear understanding of behaviour change through the BCT classification is important to gauge uptake of digital interventions and health outcomes in people with varying severity of COPD. Currently there is no guidance for interpreting BCT components of a digital intervention for changes to health outcomes. We could not interpret the BCT findings to the health outcomes we were investigating due to limited evidence that was of very low certainty. In future research, standardised approaches need to be considered when designing protocols to investigate effectiveness of digital interventions by including a standardised approach to BCT classification in addition to validated behavioural outcome measures that may reflect changes in behaviour. 
","## Plain Title: Digital Tools for Lung Disease Care

## Rationale:

COPD is a lung disease. It makes it hard to breathe. People with COPD may cough a lot. They may also make a lot of phlegm. This disease makes life hard for many people. It also puts a big strain on doctors and hospitals.

We want to find new ways to help people with COPD. We think that digital tools may help. These tools could help people manage their own health. This study looked at how these tools might help. We wanted to see if they made people feel better. We also looked at any harm they might cause.

## Trial Design:

This study looked at other studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means some people got the new digital tools. Other people got the usual care. We compared these two groups.

The studies we looked at included many people. They all had COPD. Some had mild disease. Others had very bad disease. The people in these studies used digital tools. These tools included phone apps or websites. Some studies also offered help with the digital tools.

The studies lasted for different amounts of time. Some were as short as 13 weeks. Others were as long as 52 weeks. We checked how these tools changed people's health. We looked at how far they could walk. We also looked at their quality of life.

## Results:

We looked at 14 studies in total. There were 1518 people in these studies. The studies lasted for up to one year. People in the studies had different forms of COPD.

Many studies did not keep people from knowing what treatment they got. This makes the results less clear. We also found that the results were not always exact.

Some studies used mobile phones or websites. They looked at how far people could walk. The results were not clear for short times. After a year, people might walk a little further. But this was also not very clear.

Digital tools might make quality of life a little better. This was seen for a short time, about 13 weeks. But this small change may not be very important for patients. One study found a bigger improvement after a year. We need more clear studies to be sure.

Digital tools did not seem to change how often people had flare-ups. Flare-ups are times when COPD gets worse. We also did not find much proof about side effects.

There were other studies that used digital tools plus other care. The results from these studies were not clear. We could not tell if they helped or caused harm.

In the end, we don't know for sure if digital tools help. We need more studies. These new studies need to be better designed. They should hide from people what treatment they get. This will give us clearer answers. We also need to see if small changes can help many people with COPD.","Digital interventions for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Review question 
Do digital interventions help people to improve their self‐management of COPD and their health? Do they help to change their behaviour about managing their symptoms? 
What is COPD? 
COPD is a chronic and progressive condition affecting the airways and lungs. Typically, COPD results from prolonged exposure to harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke, leading to inflammation of the airways, as well as abnormal expansion of the airspaces of the lungs. Owing to the highly varied nature of COPD, there is much variety in how the condition affects individuals’ lives. A persistent cough and breathlessness are characteristic symptoms of COPD, worsening during flare‐ups (exacerbations) and becoming more severe over time. This makes activities of daily living more difficult and greatly impacts quality of life. 
Managing COPD is complex and varies depending on the severity of the condition. Self‐management techniques often play a role in relieving symptoms, such as breathing exercises, as well as a combination of medication and supplementary oxygen. 
'Digital interventions' and 'telehealth' are terms used to encompass the use of technology to communicate and send information between a patient and a healthcare provider ‐ helping to manage the patient’s condition remotely. This may involve (but is not restricted to) the use of a mobile phone or tablet computer application to log symptoms and lung function, allowing a clinician to adjust medications in real‐time. It may also involve remotely training a patient in self‐management techniques. There is scope for those living with COPD to greatly benefit from the use of such interventions, offering convenient and accessible healthcare provision. 
Why did we do this review? 
We wanted to find out if digital interventions were helpful for people with COPD in terms of managing their condition, and if these interventions played a part in changing their behaviour towards self‐management. Additionally, we wanted to understand the behaviour change techniques incorporated in different digital interventions. 
What evidence did we find? 
Mostly, digital interventions or multi component approaches did not improve walking distance or betterment in one's own belief in managing their condition. There was small short‐term improvement in quality of life with Internet‐based interventions but we cannot be certain whether the improvement is seen long term. Breathing difficulties may improve with long‐term use of digital interventions, but they may have little to no effect on flare‐ups. Due to limited data available, we cannot say with confidence that digital interventions can be used to improve health in people with COPD, or that they reduce harm. There is little or no evidence about possible unwanted side‐effects of digital interventions. More research in this field can provide more robust conclusions for their use and insight into people's behaviours towards these novel approaches.

Postoperative pain is common and may be severe. Postoperative administration of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces patient opioid requirements and, in turn, may reduce the incidence and severity of opioid‐induced adverse events (AEs). 
Objectives
To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single‐dose intravenous ketorolac, compared with placebo or an active comparator, for moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases without language restrictions: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS on 20 April 2020. We checked clinical trials registers and reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized double‐blind trials that compared a single postoperative dose of intravenous ketorolac with placebo or another active treatment, for treating acute postoperative pain in adults following any surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was the number of participants in each arm achieving at least 50% pain relief over a four‐ and six‐hour period.Our secondary outcomes were time to and number of participants using rescue medication; withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and for any other cause; and number of participants experiencing any AE, serious AEs (SAEs), and NSAID‐related or opioid‐related AEs.For subgroup analysis, we planned to analyze different doses of parenteral ketorolac separately and to analyze results based on the type of surgery performed.We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 12 studies, involving 1905 participants undergoing various surgeries (pelvic/abdominal, dental, and orthopedic), with 17 to 83 participants receiving intravenous ketorolac in each study. Mean study population ages ranged from 22.5 years to 67.4 years. Most studies administered a dose of ketorolac of 30 mg; one study assessed 15 mg, and another administered 60 mg. 
Most studies had an unclear risk of bias for some domains, particularly allocation concealment and blinding, and a high risk of bias due to small sample size. The overall certainty of evidence for each outcome ranged from very low to moderate. Reasons for downgrading certainty included serious study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision. 
Ketorolac versus placebo 
Very low‐certainty evidence from eight studies (658 participants) suggests that ketorolac results in a large increase in the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over four hours compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 2.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80 to 4.37). The number needed to treat for one additional participant to benefit (NNTB) was 2.4 (95% CI 1.8 to 3.7). Low‐certainty evidence from 10 studies (914 participants) demonstrates that ketorolac may result in a large increase in the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over six hours compared to placebo (RR 3.26, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.51). The NNTB was 2.5 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.7). 
Among secondary outcomes, for time to rescue medication, moderate‐certainty evidence comparing intravenous ketorolac versus placebo demonstrated a mean median of 271 minutes for ketorolac versus 104 minutes for placebo (6 studies, 633 participants). For the number of participants using rescue medication, very low‐certainty evidence from five studies (417 participants) compared ketorolac with placebo. The RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.00), that is, it did not demonstrate a difference between groups. 
Ketorolac probably results in a slight increase in total adverse event rates compared with placebo (74% versus 65%; 8 studies, 810 participants; RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.19; number needed to treat for an additional harmful event (NNTH) 16.7, 95% CI 8.3 to infinite, moderate‐certainty evidence). Serious AEs were rare. Low‐certainty evidence from eight studies (703 participants) did not demonstrate a difference in rates between ketorolac and placebo (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.03). 
Ketorolac versus NSAIDs Ketorolac was compared to parecoxib in four studies and diclofenac in two studies. For our primary outcome, over both four and six hours there was no evidence of a difference between intravenous ketorolac and another NSAID (low‐certainty and moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively). Over four hours, four studies (337 participants) produced an RR of 1.04 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.21) and over six hours, six studies (603 participants) produced an RR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.19). 
For time to rescue medication, low‐certainty evidence from four studies (427 participants) suggested that participants receiving ketorolac waited an extra 35 minutes (mean median 331 minutes versus 296 minutes). For the number of participants using rescue medication, very low‐certainty evidence from three studies (260 participants) compared ketorolac with another NSAID. The RR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.40), that is, there may be little or no difference between groups.   
Ketorolac probably results in a slight increase in total adverse event rates compared with another NSAID (76% versus 68%, 5 studies, 516 participants; RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.23; NNTH 12.5, 95% CI 6.7 to infinite, moderate‐certainty evidence). Serious AEs were rare. Low‐certainty evidence from five studies (530 participants) did not demonstrate a difference in rates between ketorolac and another NSAID (RR 3.18, 95% CI 0.13 to 76.99). Only one of the five studies reported a single serious AE. 
Authors' conclusions
The amount and certainty of evidence for the use of intravenous ketorolac as a treatment for postoperative pain varies across efficacy and safety outcomes and amongst comparators, from very low to moderate. The available evidence indicates that postoperative intravenous ketorolac administration may offer substantial pain relief for most patients, but further research may impact this estimate. Adverse events appear to occur at a slightly higher rate in comparison to placebo and to other NSAIDs. Insufficient information is available to assess whether intravenous ketorolac has a different rate of gastrointestinal or surgical‐site bleeding, renal dysfunction, or cardiovascular events versus other NSAIDs. There was a lack of studies in cardiovascular surgeries and in elderly populations who may be at increased risk for adverse events. 
","## Plain Title
Better Pain Relief After Surgery

## Rationale
After surgery, many people feel a lot of pain. Doctors often give strong pain medicines called opioids. Opioids help with pain, but they can also cause bad side effects. These side effects can include feeling sick or even addiction.

This study looked at a different pain medicine called ketorolac. Ketorolac is a medicine that reduces swelling and pain. It is like ibuprofen but much stronger. We wanted to see if ketorolac could help people feel less pain after surgery. We also wanted to see if it could lower the need for opioids. We hoped ketorolac would be a good choice for pain relief.

## Trial Design
This study looked at many past studies. These studies were set up to compare ketorolac to other things. Some compared it to a dummy medicine, called a placebo. Others compared it to other pain medicines.

The studies included adults who had surgery. These people had pain that was medium to bad. The age of people in the studies was from about 22 to 67 years old. The types of surgeries were different. They included belly surgery, tooth surgery, and bone surgery. Each person in these studies got a single shot of ketorolac after surgery. They also watched how long people felt better. They checked for any bad side effects.

## Results
We looked at 12 studies. These studies included over 1900 people. Most people got a 30 mg shot of ketorolac.

Ketorolac helped a lot with pain. Compared to the dummy medicine, more people felt much better.
* After 4 hours, ketorolac helped almost 3 times more people.
* After 6 hours, ketorolac helped over 3 times more people.
People who got ketorolac waited much longer to ask for more pain medicine. They waited about 271 minutes. People who got the dummy medicine waited only about 104 minutes. This means ketorolac helped for a longer time.

Ketorolac did cause a few more side effects than the dummy medicine. About 74 people out of 100 on ketorolac had a side effect. About 65 people out of 100 on the dummy medicine had a side effect. Most side effects were not serious. Serious side effects were rare with both medicines.

When we compared ketorolac to other pain medicines, it worked just as well. There was no big difference in how much pain relief people got. It also caused a few more side effects than other pain medicines. About 76 people out of 100 on ketorolac had a side effect. About 68 people out of 100 on other pain medicines had a side effect. Serious side effects were rare.

In conclusion, ketorolac can give good pain relief after surgery. It can help most patients. But it may cause a small rise in side effects. We need more studies to learn about certain side effects. We also need to study older people and people with heart problems.","What are the benefits and risks of a single injection of ketorolac (an anti‐inflammation medicine) for relieving short‐term pain after surgery in adults? 
Key messages 
· Ketorolac may reduce short‐term pain after surgery by 50% (half) or more in more people than a placebo (dummy treatment).· There may be little to no difference between ketorolac and other anti‐inflammation medicines in the number of people whose pain is reduced by half or more.· Ketorolac probably causes slightly more unwanted effects than placebo and other anti‐inflammation medicines; more evidence is required to establish if it causes serious unwanted effects. 
Treating short‐term pain after surgery 
It is common for people to feel pain in the short term (within six hours) after surgery. Often, medicines called non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are given to relieve this pain. 
NSAIDS work by stopping the body’s production of chemicals that cause inflammation and pain. A potential advantage of using NSAIDs is that they may limit the need for stronger pain‐relief medicine such as opioids. Opioids can cause unwanted (adverse) events such as nausea and vomiting, constipation, breathing problems and allergic reactions. People may become addicted to opioids if they take a lot of them. 
NSAIDs can also cause unwanted effects. These include bleeding at the site of the surgical wound, and potential injury to the kidneys and gut. It is therefore important to weigh the benefits and risks of NSAIDs when considering using them to reduce pain shortly after surgery. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out about the benefits and risks of using a specific NSAID, ketorolac, for relief of short‐term pain after surgery. Ketorolac can be given as an injection, which may be useful when patients cannot take medicines by mouth. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that involved adults (aged over 18) and compared a single injection of ketorolac against: 
· a placebo (dummy treatment); or· another treatment. 
We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 12 studies that involved 1905 people in total. The studies investigated the treatment of pain after surgery on the abdomen, pelvis, teeth, bones, joints and muscles. Most studies (10) treated people with a dose of 30 milligrams of ketorolac. They compared ketorolac against: 
· a placebo;· another NSAID; or· an opioid. 
Here we present the findings from comparisons between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDs. 
Pain reduction 
The evidence suggests that:
· around three times more people may have their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within six hours of surgery when treated with ketorolac rather than placebo; and· there could be little to no difference between ketorolac and other NSAIDS in the number of people with pain reduced by 50% or more within four or six hours of surgery. 
Need for extra pain medicines (rescue medication) 
Ketorolac could delay the need for rescue medication compared to placebo or other NSAIDs. The evidence is not robust enough to show if fewer people need rescue medicine when treated with ketorolac. 
Adverse effects 
Ketorolac probably causes slightly more adverse effects than placebo and other NSAIDS. Serious adverse effects (such as blood collecting in the muscles around the abdomen, causing severe pain) were rare in the studies we found; the evidence suggested there may be little to no difference in the number of serious adverse events between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDS. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Studies were small, and most may have been conducted in ways that could introduce errors into their results. This limited our confidence in the evidence. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to April 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD015207,"Background
Elevated blood pressure, or hypertension, is the leading cause of preventable deaths globally. Diets high in sodium (predominantly sodium chloride) and low in potassium contribute to elevated blood pressure. The WHO recommends decreasing mean population sodium intake through effective and safe strategies to reduce hypertension and its associated disease burden. Incorporating low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) into population strategies has increasingly been recognised as a possible sodium reduction strategy, particularly in populations where a substantial proportion of overall sodium intake comes from discretionary salt. The LSSS contain lower concentrations of sodium through its displacement with potassium predominantly, or other minerals. Potassium‐containing LSSS can potentially simultaneously decrease sodium intake and increase potassium intake.  Benefits of LSSS include their potential blood pressure‐lowering effect and relatively low cost. However, there are concerns about potential adverse effects of LSSS, such as hyperkalaemia, particularly in people at risk, for example, those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or taking medications that impair potassium excretion. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety of replacing salt with LSSS to reduce sodium intake on cardiovascular health in adults, pregnant women and children. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL, EBSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 18 August 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. No language or publication restrictions were applied. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective analytical cohort studies in participants of any age in the general population, from any setting in any country. This included participants with non‐communicable diseases and those taking medications that impair potassium excretion. Studies had to compare any type and method of implementation of LSSS with the use of regular salt, or no active intervention, at an individual, household or community level, for any duration. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full‐text articles to determine eligibility; and extracted data, assessed risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB tool, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by adults, children (≤ 18 years) and pregnant women. Primary effectiveness outcomes were change in diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP and SBP), hypertension and blood pressure control; cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality were additionally assessed as primary effectiveness outcomes in adults. Primary safety outcomes were change in blood potassium, hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia. 
Main results
We included 26 RCTs, 16 randomising individual participants and 10 randomising clusters (families, households or villages). A total of 34,961 adult participants and 92 children were randomised to either LSSS or regular salt, with the smallest trial including 10 and the largest including 20,995 participants. No studies in pregnant women were identified. Studies included only participants with hypertension (11/26), normal blood pressure (1/26), pre‐hypertension (1/26), or participants with and without hypertension (11/26). This was unknown in the remaining studies. The largest study included only participants with an elevated risk of stroke at baseline. Seven studies included adult participants possibly at risk of hyperkalaemia. All 26 trials specifically excluded participants in whom an increased potassium intake is known to be potentially harmful. The majority of trials were conducted in rural or suburban settings, with more than half (14/26) conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
The proportion of sodium chloride replacement in the LSSS interventions varied from approximately 3% to 77%. The majority of trials (23/26) investigated LSSS where potassium‐containing salts were used to substitute sodium. In most trials, LSSS implementation was discretionary (22/26). Trial duration ranged from two months to nearly five years.  
We assessed the overall risk of bias as high in six trials and unclear in 12 trials.
LSSS compared to regular salt in adults: LSSS compared to regular salt probably reduce DBP on average (mean difference (MD) ‐2.43 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.50 to ‐1.36; 20,830 participants, 19 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) and SBP (MD ‐4.76 mmHg, 95% CI ‐6.01 to ‐3.50; 21,414 participants, 20 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) slightly.  
On average, LSSS probably reduce non‐fatal stroke (absolute effect (AE) 20 fewer/100,000 person‐years, 95% CI ‐40 to 2; 21,250 participants, 3 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence), non‐fatal acute coronary syndrome (AE 150 fewer/100,000 person‐years, 95% CI ‐250 to ‐30; 20,995 participants, 1 RCT, moderate‐certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (AE 180 fewer/100,000 person‐years, 95% CI ‐310 to 0; 23,200 participants, 3 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) slightly, and probably increase blood potassium slightly (MD 0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.18; 784 participants, 6 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence), compared to regular salt.  
LSSS may result in little to no difference, on average, in hypertension (AE 17 fewer/1000, 95% CI ‐58 to 17; 2566 participants, 1 RCT, low‐certainty evidence) and hyperkalaemia (AE 4 more/100,000, 95% CI ‐47 to 121; 22,849 participants, 5 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) compared to regular salt. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on blood pressure control, various cardiovascular events, stroke mortality, hypokalaemia, and other adverse events (very‐low certainty evidence). 
LSSS compared to regular salt in children: The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on DBP and SBP in children. We found no evidence about the effects of LSSS on hypertension, blood pressure control, blood potassium, hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia in children. 
Authors' conclusions
When compared to regular salt, LSSS probably reduce blood pressure, non‐fatal cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality slightly in adults. However, LSSS also probably increase blood potassium slightly in adults. These small effects may be important when LSSS interventions are implemented at the population level. Evidence is limited for adults without elevated blood pressure, and there is a lack of evidence in pregnant women and people in whom an increased potassium intake is known to be potentially harmful, limiting conclusions on the safety of LSSS in the general population. We also cannot draw firm conclusions about effects of non‐discretionary LSSS implementations. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on blood pressure in children. 
","**1. Plain Title: Can special salts help lower blood pressure and improve heart health?**

**2. Rationale**

High blood pressure is a big health problem. It can lead to serious issues. Things like heart attacks and strokes can happen. Eating too much salt can make blood pressure high. Not eating enough potassium also plays a part.

The World Health Organization wants people to eat less salt. One idea is to use salt that has less sodium. These ""low-sodium salt substitutes"" replace some sodium with potassium. This kind of salt might lower blood pressure. It could also boost potassium intake. This is good because potassium helps blood pressure. Plus, these special salts are cheap.

But there are worries. Too much potassium can be bad for some people. This is true for those with kidney problems. It's also true for those taking certain medicines. This study wants to see if these special salts are safe and work well. We need to know if they truly help heart health.

**3. Trial Design**

This study looked at many past studies. It gathered information from ""randomized controlled trials."" These are studies where people are put into groups by chance. One group uses the special salt. The other uses regular salt or no special treatment.

The studies included adults of all ages. Some had high blood pressure. Others had normal blood pressure. A few studies included children. No studies were found for pregnant women.

The studies checked how blood pressure changed. They also looked at heart problems. And they checked potassium levels in the blood. This helped us see if the special salt was safe. The studies lasted from two months to almost five years.

**4. Results**

We looked at 26 studies. These studies involved many adults, almost 35,000. There were also 92 children. No studies included pregnant women.

The special salts did reduce blood pressure a little in adults. They slightly lowered the top number (systolic) and the bottom number (diastolic). This is good for heart health.

These special salts also seemed to lower the risk of some serious heart problems. This includes strokes and heart deaths. This is a positive outcome for many people.

However, the special salts did slightly increase blood potassium levels in adults. For most people, this is not a problem. But for some, too much potassium can be risky. People with kidney disease, for example, need to be careful.

For children, the results were not clear. We do not know if these special salts help children's blood pressure. More research is needed for children. We also could not say much about pregnant women.

In conclusion, special salts with less sodium seem to help adults. They lower blood pressure and reduce heart risks. But they do raise potassium a bit. We need more studies for some groups of people. This includes those with kidney issues, pregnant women, and children.","Does using low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) instead of regular salt reduce blood pressure and heart disease risks, and is it safe? 
Key messages 
• In adults, using LSSS instead of regular salt in food probably lowers blood pressure slightly. Adults using LSSS instead of regular salt probably have a slightly lower risk of non‐fatal heart conditions, such as stroke or a sudden reduced blood flow to the heart, and death from heart disease. 
• Using LSSS instead of regular salt probably also slightly increases the level of blood potassium (a mineral that keeps your heart beating at the right pace) in adults. This could be harmful for people who cannot effectively regulate the potassium in their bodies. Other evidence on safety is very limited. 
• We are not certain about effects of using LSSS instead of regular salt on blood pressure in children, or whether using LSSS is safe in children. 
• This evidence may not directly apply to people known to be at risk of high blood potassium, such as people with kidney problems or on certain medications. 
What are low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS)? 
LSSS are products with less sodium than regular salt. Amounts of sodium in LSSS are lowered by replacing some of the sodium with potassium or other minerals. LSSS may help lower risks of using regular salt, since eating lots of sodium and not enough potassium contributes to high blood pressure. Globally, high blood pressure is the largest cause of preventable deaths, mainly because it causes stroke, acute coronary syndrome (ACS; where less blood flows to the heart), and kidney problems. 
However, LSSS also has potential health risks. Using LSSS may lead to higher than normal blood potassium (hyperkalaemia), which causes problems with the heartbeat speed and rhythm, or can cause the heart to stop. These risks are greater in certain people, for example, those whose kidneys do not work properly to remove potassium. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out what the effects of using LSSS instead of regular salt are on blood pressure as well as on events (stroke and ACS) and heart disease death. We also wanted to know if using LSSS instead of regular salt is safe, both in the general population and in people who are known to be at risk of high blood potassium levels. 
We wanted to find this out for adults, children and pregnant women.
What did we do?We searched five electronic databases and trial registries for studies that compared using LSSS with using regular salt. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the combined evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.  
What did we find? 
We found 26 trials* involving 34,961 adults and 92 children. No studies in pregnant women were found. Most trials were undertaken in rural or suburban areas, with more than half done in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Most trials included some people with high blood pressure (22); the largest included only people with a high risk of stroke. Seven trials were done in people at possible risk of high blood potassium. All trials excluded people where high potassium intake is known to be harmful, such as people with kidney problems or on certain medications. Nearly all trials (23) examined LSSS types where some sodium was replaced with potassium. The amount of sodium replaced in the various LSSS used in the trials ranged from very small (3%) to large (77%). 
*Trials are types of studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure similar groups of participants. 
Main results 
In adults, LSSS probably lowers blood pressure (diastolic and systolic) slightly when compared to regular salt. Using LSSS also probably lowers risk of non‐fatal stroke, non‐fatal ACS and heart disease death slightly when compared to regular salt. 
However, using LSSS instead of regular salt probably also slightly increases the level of potassium in the blood. 
Compared to regular salt, LSSS may result in little to no difference in high blood pressure and hyperkalaemia. 
We could not draw any conclusions about effects of LSSS on blood pressure control, various heart disease events, death caused by stroke, lower than normal blood potassium (hypokalaemia), and other adverse events. 
We could not draw any conclusions about the effects or safety of using LSSS instead of regular salt in children. 
What are the limitations of the evidence?  
We are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence was lowered mainly because of concerns about how some trials were conducted, and whether the results apply to the general population. We are not sure about the effects and safety of LSSS in children, pregnant women, people known to have a risk of high blood potassium, or those who do not have high blood pressure. We are also unsure about the effects of LSSS when used in foods not prepared at home. Further research may change these results. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to August 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013187,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management, reduce morbidity and improve survival. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised to the skin but has potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue, while cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma have a much higher potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death. Exfoliative cytology is a non‐invasive test that uses the Tzanck smear technique to identify disease by examining the structure of cells obtained from scraped samples. This simple procedure is a less invasive diagnostic test than a skin biopsy, and for BCC it has the potential to provide an immediate diagnosis that avoids an additional clinic visit to receive skin biopsy results. This may benefit patients scheduled for either Mohs micrographic surgery or non‐surgical treatments such as radiotherapy. A cytology scrape can never give the same information as a skin biopsy, however, so it is important to better understand in which skin cancer situations it may be helpful. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of exfoliative cytology for detecting basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of standard diagnostic practice (visual inspection with or without dermoscopy). Secondary objectives were: to determine the diagnostic accuracy of exfoliative cytology for detecting cSCC, invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, and any other skin cancer; and for each of these secondary conditions to compare the accuracy of exfoliative cytology with visual inspection with or without dermoscopy in direct test comparisons; and to determine the effect of observer experience. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also studied the reference lists of published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies evaluating exfoliative cytology in adults with lesions suspicious for BCC, cSCC or melanoma, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). Where possible we estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. 
Main results
We synthesised the results of nine studies contributing a total of 1655 lesions to our analysis, including 1120 BCCs (14 datasets), 41 cSCCs (amongst 401 lesions in 2 datasets), and 10 melanomas (amongst 200 lesions in 1 dataset). Three of these datasets (one each for BCC, melanoma and any malignant condition) were derived from one study that also performed a direct comparison with dermoscopy. Studies were of moderate to poor quality, providing inadequate descriptions of participant selection, thresholds used to make cytological and histological diagnoses, and blinding. Reporting of participants' prior referral pathways was particularly poor, as were descriptions of the cytodiagnostic criteria used to make diagnoses. No studies evaluated the use of exfoliative cytology as a primary diagnostic test for detecting BCC or other skin cancers in lesions suspicious for skin cancer. Pooled data from seven studies using standard cytomorphological criteria (but various stain methods) to detect BCC in participants with a high clinical suspicion of BCC estimated the sensitivity and specificity of exfoliative cytology as 97.5% (95% CI 94.5% to 98.9%) and 90.1% (95% CI 81.1% to 95.1%). respectively. When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 clinically suspected BCC lesions with a median observed BCC prevalence of 86%, exfoliative cytology would miss 21 BCCs and would lead to 14 false positive diagnoses of BCC. No false positive cases were histologically confirmed to be melanoma. Insufficient data are available to make summary statements regarding the accuracy of exfoliative cytology to detect melanoma or cSCC, or its accuracy compared to dermoscopy. 
Authors' conclusions
The utility of exfoliative cytology for the primary diagnosis of skin cancer is unknown, as all included studies focused on the use of this technique for confirming strongly suspected clinical diagnoses. For the confirmation of BCC in lesions with a high clinical suspicion, there is evidence of high sensitivity and specificity. Since decisions to treat low‐risk BCCs are unlikely in practice to require diagnostic confirmation given that clinical suspicion is already high, exfoliative cytology might be most useful for cases of BCC where the treatments being contemplated require a tissue diagnosis (e.g. radiotherapy). The small number of included studies, poor reporting and varying methodological quality prevent us from drawing strong conclusions to guide clinical practice. Despite insufficient data on the use of cytology for cSCC or melanoma, it is unlikely that cytology would be useful in these scenarios since preservation of the architecture of the whole lesion that would be available from a biopsy provides crucial diagnostic information. Given the paucity of good quality data, appropriately designed prospective comparative studies may be required to evaluate both the diagnostic value of exfoliative cytology by comparison to dermoscopy, and its confirmatory value in adequately reported populations with a high probability of BCC scheduled for further treatment requiring a tissue diagnosis. 
","## How a Simple Skin Scrape Helps Doctors Spot Skin Cancer

### Rationale

Skin cancer is a serious health problem. Finding it early is key to good treatment and a better chance of getting well. There are a few kinds of skin cancer.

One type is called Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC). It usually stays on the skin. But it can spread and harm nearby tissue. Other types, like Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma, can spread through the body. These can be deadly.

Doctors often use a skin biopsy to check for skin cancer. This means taking a small piece of skin. It can be painful. You also need another visit to get results.

This study looked at a simpler test. It's called exfoliative cytology. This test scrapes a few cells from the skin. Then a doctor looks at them under a microscope. This is like the ""Tzanck smear"" test.

This test is not as painful as a biopsy. It could give results right away. This would save you an extra trip to the doctor. It could help people getting surgery or other treatments. But we need to know more about when this scrape test is helpful. It cannot always give all the information a biopsy can.

The main idea of this study was to see how well this scrape test finds BCC. We also wanted to compare it to how doctors usually check skin. That is by looking at it, sometimes with a special tool. We also looked at how well it found other skin cancers.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past research. We wanted to see how well the scrape test works. We searched many databases for studies. These studies were published up to August 2016.

We included studies that looked at adults. These adults had skin spots that doctors thought might be BCC, cSCC, or melanoma. The scrape test results were compared to a biopsy. A biopsy is the best way to confirm skin cancer.

Two researchers looked at all the information. They used a special form to get the data. We then put the results together. We wanted to find out how often the test was right. And how often it missed a cancer or said there was cancer when there was none.

### Results

We looked at nine studies. These studies included 1655 skin spots in total. Out of these, 1120 spots were BCC. 41 spots were cSCC. And 10 spots were melanoma.

The studies we found were not perfect. They did not always give enough details. For example, they did not always say how they chose people for the study. Or how doctors decided if the cells showed cancer.

No studies looked at the scrape test as the very first test for skin cancer. All the studies looked at it to confirm what doctors already suspected.

For BCC, in people doctors strongly suspected had it, the scrape test was very good. It found BCC 97 times out of 100. It correctly said there was no BCC 90 times out of 100.

Let's say 1000 people had spots that doctors thought were BCC. If 860 of those people really had BCC, the scrape test would miss 21 BCCs. It would also say 14 people had BCC when they did not. No one who tested positive by mistake had melanoma.

We did not have enough information for melanoma or cSCC. We also could not fully compare the scrape test to how doctors usually check skin.

Doctors think this scrape test might be good for confirming BCC. Especially when people need a tissue diagnosis for their treatment. Like for radiation therapy. But we need more and better studies.

The scrape test may not be good for cSCC or melanoma. For these, it is vital to see the whole spot. A biopsy does this better. More research is needed to fully understand when this simple scrape test can help.","How accurate is exfoliative cytology ('skin scrape' cytology) for diagnosing basal cell carcinoma and other skin cancers in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer. The most common is basal cell carcinoma (BCC). BCC is a localised cancer that can grow and destroy the skin around it. They rarely spread into the body like other cancers can. Very small or superficial low‐risk BCCs can generally be treated with treatments such as creams rather than surgery, while it is better to surgically remove BCCs that are more likely to grow and spread. Radiotherapy (a treatment where radiation is used to kill cancer cells) can also be used if BCCs are very large or cannot be removed by surgery. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is also usually a localised skin cancer. In a small proportion of cases it can spread to other parts of the body, so the best treatment is to remove it using surgery. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer as it has a higher potential to spread to other parts of the body, and so it is vital to recognise it and remove it early. If people with BCC do not receive the correct diagnosis (known as a false negative test result), their treatment can be delayed, making the surgical procedure more complicated. Diagnosing BCC when it is actually something else (a false positive result) may result in unnecessary treatment, surgery or other investigations and can cause the patient stress and anxiety. If BCC is incorrectly diagnosed in an individual who actually has an cSCC or melanoma, effective treatment can be delayed and this might lead to a greater chance that the cSCC or melanoma spreads to other organs in the body, which can be very serious. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate a technique called 'exfoliative cytology' is for diagnosing skin cancer. Researchers in Cochrane found nine studies to answer this question. Nine studies were concerned with the diagnosis of BCC, two with the diagnosis of cSCC and one with the diagnosis of melanoma. 
What was studied in the review? 
Exfoliative cytology means scraping the surface of a possible skin cancer with a knife and then spreading a small layer of the scrape onto a glass slide so that the cells in the scrape can be stained and looked at under a microscope. It is less invasive than skin biopsy and quick to perform, with results available immediately. This could save patients an additional clinic visit to receive skin biopsy results. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review examined nine studies with a total of 1655 lesions (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) that were given these final diagnoses*: 1120 BCCs, 41 cSCCs and 10 melanomas. 
For identifying BCC, seven studies show the effect of using exfoliative cytology to confirm BCC in lesions that doctors already suspected were BCCs. In a group of 1000 such lesions, of which 860 (86%) actually do have BCC, then: 
‐ an estimated 853 people will have an exfoliative cytology result confirming that a BCC is present. Of these 14 (1.6%) will not actually have a BCC (false positive result); 
‐ of the 147 people with an exfoliative cytology result indicating that no BCC is present, 21 (14%) will in fact actually have a BCC (false negative result). 
One study compared the accuracy of exfoliative cytology to using a hand‐held microscope (dermoscopy) for making a diagnosis of BCC but used a different method of removing cells and included patients with a higher risk of melanoma than found in the other eight studies. 
There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of exfoliative cytology for diagnosing cSCC or melanoma. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The small number of studies included in this review, poor description of how patients were selected to be included in the study, and limited information on how the test results were used to make diagnoses, reduces the reliability of our results. 
The studies did not explain how patients had been referred to have the exfoliative cytology test. Most important of all, the test was only used in people in whom doctors had already diagnosed a BCC just by looking at the skin lesion. In other words, the test was being used to confirm a doctor's diagnosis. Most studies did not include enough people with skin lesions that are similar in appearance to a BCC to be sure that this test correctly identifies a BCC. This may cause exfoliative cytology to appear more accurate than it would be in actual practice. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in the UK, across Europe and in Australia. Study authors rarely described patient characteristics, such as age and location of the lesion. The percentage of people included in the studies with a final diagnosis of BCC ranged from 18% to 90% (nine studies). For cSCC it was 4% and 18% (two studies), and for melanoma it was 5% (one study). It was not possible to tell from the studies how clinicians had decided that study participants had lesions that could be a skin cancer. 
What are the implications of this review? 
No research has been done using exfoliative cytology to diagnose a skin cancer when a patient is first seen by a doctor. The results of this review suggest that exfoliative cytology can help to confirm BCC in patients with skin lesions that a doctor already suspects of being a BCC. This test could be useful for patients with BCCs that need non‐surgical treatments, such as radiotherapy, where a tissue diagnosis is needed before the treatment can be given. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy was the reference standard (means of establishing the final diagnosis). 
"
10.1002-14651858.CD013365.pub2,"Background
Diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer of the lymphatic system. About 30% to 40% of people with DLBCL experience relapse and 10% are refractory to first‐line treatment usually consisting of R‐CHOP chemotherapy. Of those eligible for second‐line treatment, commonly consisting of salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem‐cell transplantation (ASCT), around 50% experience relapse. With a median overall survival of less than six to 12 months, the prognosis of individuals who relapse or are refractory (r/r) to advanced lines of treatment or of those who are ineligible for ASCT, is very poor. With the introduction of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell therapy, a novel treatment option for these people is available. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell therapy for people with relapsed or refractory (r/r) DLBCL. 
Search methods
An experienced information specialist performed a systematic database search for relevant articles on CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase until September 11th, 2020. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of identified studies up to this date. All search results were screened by two authors independently and a third author was involved in case of discrepancies. 
Selection criteria
We included prospectively planned trials evaluating CAR T‐cell therapy for people with r/r DLBCL. We had planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and we flexibly adapted eligibility criteria to the most reliable study designs available. We excluded studies involving fewer than 10 participants with r/r DLBCL and studies with a proportion of participants with r/r DLBCL below 70%, unless data were reported separately for this subgroup. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data and performed risk of bias ratings independently. A third author was involved in case of disagreements. As our search did not yield any completed RCTs, prospective controlled non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) or prospective observational studies with a control group, we did not meta‐analyse data and reported all results narratively. We adopted the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for prioritised outcomes. 
Main results
We identified 13 eligible uncontrolled studies evaluating a single or multiple arms of CAR T‐cell therapies. We also identified 38 ongoing studies, including three RCTs. Ten studies are awaiting classification due to completion with no retrievable results data or insufficient data to justify inclusion. The mean number of participants enrolled, treated with CAR T‐cell therapy and evaluated in the included studies were 79 (range 12 to 344; data unavailable for two studies), 61 (range 12 to 294; data unavailable for one study) and 52 (range 11 to 256), respectively. 
Most studies included people with r/r DLBCL among people with other haematological B‐cell malignancies. Participants had received at least a median of three prior treatment lines (data unavailable for four studies), 5% to 50% had undergone ASCT (data unavailable for five studies) and, except for two studies, 3% to 18% had undergone allogenic stem‐cell transplantation (data unavailable for eight studies). 
The overall risk of bias was high for all studies, in particular, due to incomplete follow‐up and the absence of blinding. None of the included studies had a control group so that no adequate comparative effect measures could be calculated. The duration of follow‐up varied substantially between studies, in particular, for harms. Our certainty in the evidence is very low for all outcomes. 
Overall survival was reported by eight studies (567 participants). Four studies reported survival rates at 12 months which ranged between 48% and 59%, and one study reported an overall survival rate of 50.5% at 24 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on overall survival. 
Two studies including 294 participants at baseline and 59 participants at the longest follow‐up (12 months or 18 months) described improvements of quality of life measured with the EuroQol 5‐Dimension 5‐Level visual analogue scale (EQ‐5D‐5L VAS) or Function Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Lymphoma (FACT‐Lym). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on quality of life. 
None of the studies reported treatment‐related mortality.
Five studies (550 participants) reported the occurrence of adverse events among participants, ranging between 99% and 100% for any grade adverse events and 68% to 98% for adverse events grade ≥ 3. In three studies (253 participants), 56% to 68% of participants experienced serious adverse events, while in one study (28 participants), no serious adverse events occurred. CAR T‐cell therapy may increase the risk of adverse events and serious adverse events but the evidence is very uncertain about the exact risk. 
The occurrence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was reported in 11 studies (675 participants) under use of various grading criteria. Five studies reported between 42% and 100% of participants experiencing CRS according to criteria described in Lee 2014. CAR T‐cell therapy may increase the risk of CRS but the evidence is very uncertain about the exact risk. 
Nine studies (575 participants) reported results on progression‐free survival, disease‐free survival or relapse‐free survival. Twelve‐month progression‐free survival rates were reported by four studies and ranged between 44% and 75%. In one study, relapse‐free survival remained at a rate of 64% at both 12 and 18 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on progression‐free survival. 
Thirteen studies (620 participants) provided data on complete response rates. At six months, three studies reported complete response rates between 40% and 45%. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on complete response rates. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence on the benefits and harms of CAR T‐cell therapy for people with r/r DLBCL is limited, mainly because of the absence of comparative clinical trials. The results we present should be regarded in light of this limitation and conclusions should be drawn very carefully. Due to the uncertainty in the current evidence, a large number of ongoing investigations and a risk of substantial and potentially life‐threatening complications requiring supplementary treatment, it is critical to continue evaluating the evidence on this new therapy. 
","## Plain Language Summary: CAR T-Cell Therapy for a Type of Lymphoma

### Plain Title

A Look at How CAR T-Cell Therapy Helps People with a Type of Lymphoma That Comes Back or Does Not Respond to Treatment.

### Rationale

**What is the problem?**

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a fast-growing cancer. It starts in the body's lymph system. The lymph system is part of our body's defense against sickness. About 3 or 4 out of every 10 people with DLBCL get sick again. This happens even after their first treatment. Another 1 out of 10 people do not get better with their first treatment. This first treatment is often a strong medicine mix called R-CHOP.

For those who can get more treatment, about half get sick again. This second treatment often uses strong medicine and then a stem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant replaces bad cells with good ones.

When the cancer comes back or does not respond, people do not live long. Most live less than a year. This is a very serious problem for these patients.

**Why is this study important?**

Doctors are looking for new ways to treat this cancer. A new treatment is called CAR T-cell therapy. This therapy uses a person's own immune cells to fight cancer. Immune cells are the body's defense cells.

This study wants to see if CAR T-cell therapy helps these patients. It also looks at any bad effects from the treatment. This study helps us learn if this new treatment works and if it is safe.

### Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This study looked at many past studies. It is a ""review"" of earlier research. Doctors searched big lists of medical papers. They looked for studies about CAR T-cell therapy for DLBCL. They looked until September 2020. They also checked other lists of ongoing studies.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included people with DLBCL. Their cancer had either come back or did not get better. These people had often tried at least three other treatments first. Some had also had a stem cell transplant. The studies included men and women. The age of the patients varied.

**What kind of studies were looked at?**

The goal was to find studies that compared CAR T-cell therapy to other treatments. But there were no such studies that were finished. So, the review looked at studies that did not have a comparison group. These studies just reported on people who got CAR T-cell therapy.

**How many people were in these studies?**

Most studies had more than 10 people. The average number of people treated in these studies was about 60. Some studies had as few as 12 people. Others had as many as 294 people.

**How long were people followed in the studies?**

The time people were watched after treatment was different in each study. Some were watched for a short time. Others were watched for a longer time. This makes it harder to compare the results.

### Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

The study found 13 past studies about CAR T-cell therapy. These studies did not compare the treatment to anything else. They just showed what happened to people who got the therapy. There are also many studies still going on, including some that will compare treatments.

**How did people do after treatment?**

*   **Living longer:** Eight studies looked at how long people lived. In some studies, about half of the people were still alive after one year. One study found half of the people were alive after two years. But the information is not very clear about how much CAR T-cell therapy helps people live longer.
*   **Feeling better:** Two studies looked at how much people's quality of life improved. This means how well they felt and did daily tasks. These studies showed some people felt better. But the information is not very clear about how much CAR T-cell therapy helps with quality of life.
*   **Cancer not coming back:** Nine studies looked at how long people stayed free of cancer. In some studies, about half to three-quarters of people stayed cancer-free after one year. But the information is not very clear about how much CAR T-cell therapy helps keep cancer away.
*   **Full response:** Thirteen studies looked at how many people had their cancer fully go away. In some studies, about 4 or 5 out of 10 people had their cancer fully go away after six months. But the information is not very clear about how much CAR T-cell therapy helps cancer fully go away.

**What were the bad effects of treatment?**

Almost all people in the studies had some bad effects. About 7 to 10 out of every 10 people had serious bad effects. These serious effects sometimes needed more treatment.

*   One common serious effect is called cytokine release syndrome (CRS). This can happen when the immune system gets too active. Between 4 and 10 out of 10 people had CRS in some studies.
*   CAR T-cell therapy might raise the risk of these bad effects. But the information is not very clear about the exact risk.

**What did the doctors conclude?**

The doctors found that there is not enough strong information yet. This is because there were no studies that compared CAR T-cell therapy to other treatments. It is hard to know for sure how much the therapy helps or what the exact risks are.

**Why is this study important for the future?**

This new therapy can have serious problems. Because of this, it is very important to keep studying CAR T-cell therapy. We need more studies that compare it to other treatments. This will help doctors know for sure if it is the best choice for patients with DLBCL.","CAR T‐cell therapy for people with diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma which returns after treatment or no longer responds to treatment 
Background 
Diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a fast‐growing cancer of the lymphatic system, an important part of the immune system. It affects blood cells that produce antibodies to fight infections. 
DLBCL is potentially curable. Most people with DLBCL respond well to initial therapies such as chemotherapy. For some people, the disease becomes refractory, which means it no longer responds to treatment, or it relapses, which means it returns after treatment. As a second‐line treatment, people with DLBCL can receive chemotherapy coupled with stem‐cell transplantation, but not all people are candidates for this therapy. From those who are, around 50% experience relapse after treatment. People who relapse or are refractory to advanced lines of treatment and those who are not candidates for a stem‐cell transplant have a very poor prognosis: Only half of them survive longer than six to 12 months. 
A promising treatment for these people is 'chimeric antigen receptor' (CAR) T‐cell therapy, which utilises the body's own immune cells (T‐cells) to fight DLBCL. T‐cells are removed from the person's blood, equipped with so‐called 'chimeric antigen receptors' (CARs), that help to recognise and destroy the cancer cells, in the laboratory and then delivered back into the person's blood. 
What was our aim? 
We wanted to explore whether CAR T‐cells are an effective treatment for people with DLBCL that returns after treatment (relapses) or no longer responds to treatment (is refractory). We also wanted to explore the frequency of unwanted effects associated with CAR T‐cell therapy. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all available clinical studies on treatment with CAR T‐cells for people with relapsed or refractory DLBCL to summarise the current evidence. We also evaluated the risk of bias in included studies and rated our confidence in the evidence. 
What did we find? 
We found 13 studies with information on 679 participants (who had received several prior lines of therapy) that received CAR T‐cell therapy. None of the studies had a control group. This means CAR T‐cells were not compared with another treatment. We decided not to meta‐analyse the study results and reported all results narratively. We also found 38 ongoing studies. 
What are the key results? 
Eight studies with 567 participants evaluated overall survival. After 12 months, around half of participants were alive in four studies. In one study, around half of participants were alive after 24 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on survival. 
Two studies (294 participants at study start; 59 participants at study end) reported that quality of life improved over time. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on quality of life. 
Deaths related to the therapy were not reported.
Five studies (550 participants) reported on adverse events. Almost all participants (99% to 100%) experienced some kind of adverse event (including mild events). Between 68% and 98% of participants had adverse events that were severe. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of adverse events but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
In three studies (253 participants), 56% to 68% of participants experienced serious adverse events, while in one study (28 participants), participants had no serious adverse events. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of serious adverse events but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
Eleven studies (675 participants) reported on the frequency of 'cytokine release syndrome' (CRS), an overreaction of the immune system that is typically seen in CAR T‐cell therapy. It includes fever and can include symptoms such as chills, muscle pain or dizziness. Several scales were used across the studies to describe CRS. In five studies using the same scale, between 42% and 100% of participants had CRS. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of CRS but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
Nine studies (575 participants) reported when DLBCL relapsed (returned) or progressed (got worse). Four studies reported that, at 12 months, DLBCL did not progress in 44% to 75% of participants. In one study, 64% of participants did not relapse at both 12, and 18 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on DLBCL relapse or progress. 
Thirteen studies (620 participants) reported how many participants had a complete response (all signs of cancer disappeared). In three studies, between 40% and 45% of participants experienced a complete response at six months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on complete response. 
What does this mean? 
The evidence on CAR T‐cells in the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL is very uncertain. This is mainly because, today, there are no direct comparisons of CAR T‐cells with other treatments. People who receive CAR T‐cells can have severe adverse events that require additional treatment. We identified many ongoing studies and some of them compare CAR T‐cells with standard care. We will keep evaluating the evidence on this novel therapy. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to September 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD012584.pub2,"To continue taking or to stop taking antiplatelet drugs for a few days before non‐cardiac surgery in adults 
Review question 
We set out to determine whether continuing to take antiplatelet drugs before non‐cardiac surgery that requires general, spinal or regional anaesthesia increases the risk of experiencing serious bleeding, ischaemic event or death in adults, when compared with stopping antiplatelet drugs for at least five days before non‐cardiac surgery. 
Background 
Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel reduce the risk of people getting blood clots, and are routinely prescribed for people who have had coronary stents inserted. They are also recommended for people with unstable angina or heart disease, or people who have had a heart attack, heart surgery or a stroke. Taking antiplatelet therapy introduces an increased risk of bleeding, which could lead to problems if a person needs non‐cardiac surgery. Stopping usual antiplatelet therapy a few days before surgery might reduce the risk of serious bleeding during surgery. Not taking these antiplatelet drugs could, however, increase the risk of a heart attack, stroke, or death. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence from randomized controlled trials is current to January 2018. We included five trials with 666 adults in the review. Three studies are ongoing. All participants were taking antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) at the start of the study. Two studies stopped antiplatelet drugs for at least five days before surgery, and three studies gave participants a placebo instead of antiplatelet therapy during this time. 
Key results 
We found low‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to the number of people who died up to 30 days or six months after surgery (five studies, 659 participants). We found moderate‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy probably makes little or no difference to incidences of bleeding serious enough to need a blood transfusion during or immediately after surgery (four studies, 368 participants). We found low‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to bleeding serious enough to need further surgery (four studies, 368 participants), and may make little or no difference to the number of ischaemic events such as stroke or heart attack (four studies, 616 participants). 
Quality of the evidence 
Some studies had low risk of bias because they had clearly reported their methods for randomizing people to each group, and three studies used a placebo agent so that people did not know whether or not they were continuing their usual antiplatelet therapy. However, we found few studies with few events, with wide variation in results. To continue or stop taking antiplatelet drugs for a few days before non‐cardiac surgery might make little or no difference to the number of people who died, who had bleeding that needed further surgery or who had ischaemic events, and it probably makes little or no difference to bleeding that needed a blood transfusion. We found three ongoing studies which will increase certainty in the effect in future updates of the review. 
","## Plain Title: Taking or Stopping Blood Thinners Before Surgery

## Rationale

Some people take special drugs called antiplatelet drugs. These drugs help stop blood clots from forming. Blood clots can be very bad. They can cause heart attacks or strokes. Doctors often give these drugs to people who have had heart problems or a stroke. For example, people with special tubes in their heart, called stents, take these drugs.

But these drugs also make it easier to bleed. This can be a problem if someone needs surgery. Surgery can cause a lot of bleeding. Doctors wonder if stopping these drugs before surgery makes it safer. They want to know if it lowers the chance of bad bleeding.

However, stopping these drugs might also be risky. It could raise the chance of a heart attack or stroke. So, doctors need to know the best choice. This study looked at both choices. It wanted to find out what happens when people keep taking these drugs versus stopping them.

## Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. One group kept taking their blood thinners. The other group stopped them.

The study included 5 trials. It looked at 666 adults in total. All these adults were already taking blood thinners. These drugs were aspirin or clopidogrel. Some people stopped their drugs for at least 5 days. Others took a sugar pill instead of their blood thinners. This kept them from knowing what group they were in.

This study looked at adults having non-heart surgery. This is surgery not on the heart itself. The surgery used special sleep medicine. This could be full sleep, back numbing, or only part of the body numbing. The study checked what happened up to 6 months after surgery.

## Results

This study found some key things. It looked at how many people died. It also looked at how many people had serious bleeding. It also checked for heart attacks or strokes.

It seems that keeping or stopping blood thinners does not change much. It may make little or no difference to how many people die. This was seen up to 30 days or 6 months after surgery.

It also seems that the choice makes little or no difference to serious bleeding. This is bleeding that needs a blood transfusion. A transfusion means getting new blood. This was seen during or right after surgery. The choice also made little or no difference to bleeding needing more surgery.

Lastly, the choice may make little or no difference to heart attacks or strokes. These are called ischemic events.

The study looked at the facts. Some studies were well-done. But there were not many studies. They also had few bad events. This makes it harder to be very sure. More studies are now being done. These new studies will help doctors learn more. They will give clearer answers in the future.","To continue taking or to stop taking antiplatelet drugs for a few days before non‐cardiac surgery in adults

10.1002-14651858.CD003147.pub5,"Using positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effect of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Background 
CF affects approximately one in 3000 live births in white populations and causes frequent lung infection, due to mucus blocking the airways. Chest physiotherapy is often used to try to clear the mucus from the lungs. We wanted to discover whether using a PEP device (a form of chest physiotherapy) was better or worse than other other forms of chest physiotherapy for clearing the mucus from the lungs in people with CF. A PEP device provides positive pressure behind the mucus to try to push it out of the lungs. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 20 February 2019.
Study characteristics 
The review includes 28 studies with 788 people (from infants to adults) with CF with mild to severe lung disease. The studies compared PEP to other methods of chest physiotherapy; the length of treatment ranged from a single session to two years of treatment. 
Key results 
Generally, the efficacy of PEP is similar to other methods of chest physiotherapy such as postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, oscillatory PEP devices such as the flutter and acapella, thoracic oscillating devices such as the 'Vest', and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) (typically used for ventilatory support, but by changing the inspiratory and expiratory pressures on the device and combining it with huffing, BiPaP has been used for airway clearance). We found no difference between PEP and other forms of chest physiotherapy in lung function, the amount of mucus cleared from the airways or its related effects on the health of people with CF. However, the rate of flare ups of respiratory symptoms decreased in people using PEP compared to other forms of physiotherapy such as a vibrating PEP device or a vibrating vest. There was some evidence that people with CF may prefer PEP to other chest physiotherapy methods. There was no evidence of PEP causing harm, except in one study where infants performing either PEP or percussion in various positions which use gravity to help drain secretions, experienced some gastro‐oesophageal reflux (regurgitation of food) in head‐down positions; this was more severe in the group using postural drainage with percussion. In all the other trials PEP was performed in a sitting position. 
In 10 of the 28 studies studied single PEP treatment sessions. The results from these studies are very limited as they could not report on the number of respiratory infections and lung function did not change with just one treatment. Two one‐year studies compared PEP to postural drainage and percussion; in the study with children, PEP improved their lung function, while in the adult study, lung function declined slightly with both PEP and postural drainage and percussion. Also, the method of performing PEP was different in the two age groups. 
Although PEP seems to have an advantage in reducing flare ups (based on the combined results of a few studies), different physiotherapy techniques and devices may be more or less effective at varying times and in different individuals during baseline function and chest flare ups. Each person should talk to their clinician to help choose which method of airway clearance is best for them and which they will adhere to, so as to provide the best quality of life and long‐term outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
Some studies were of low quality. These studies highlight the difficulty in comparing studies using PEP compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy. Factors such as age and severity of lung disease in the participants may affect the results as well as the method of performing each treatment. Overall, the evidence provided by this review for whether PEP reduces flare ups compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy was moderate to high quality, but evidence for other outcomes was of very low to moderate quality, as results were limited. 
","## Plain Title: Breathing Easier: How a Simple Device Helps People with Cystic Fibrosis

### Rationale

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a health problem that affects about 1 in 3000 babies born into white families. This illness makes thick mucus in the lungs. This mucus can block air passages. Blocked air passages cause many lung infections.

Doctors often use chest therapy to help clear this mucus. We wanted to see if using a special device, called a PEP device, worked better. A PEP device uses gentle air pressure. This pressure helps push the mucus out of the lungs. This study looked at how well PEP therapy cleared mucus compared to other ways.

### Trial Design

This study asked, ""How does a PEP device compare to other ways to clear lungs?"" We looked at past studies on this topic. We included 28 studies in our review. These studies had a total of 788 people. The people ranged from babies to adults. All of them had CF, from mild to serious lung problems.

The studies compared PEP therapy to other types of chest therapy. Some treatments lasted just one time. Others lasted up to two years. We wanted to see if PEP therapy made people feel better and breathe easier.

### Results

Most of the time, PEP therapy worked as well as other methods. These other methods included things like:
*   Patting the chest to help mucus move.
*   Special breathing exercises.
*   Shaking devices that help clear air passages.

We found no major differences in how well lungs worked. We also saw no difference in how much mucus was cleared. The health of people with CF was similar across all treatments.

But, people using PEP therapy had fewer ""flare-ups."" A flare-up is when breathing problems get worse. This was a good finding. Also, some people liked using PEP therapy more than other methods.

PEP therapy did not seem to cause harm. In one study, babies had some stomach upset when using PEP or another method in head-down positions. This problem was worse with the other method. In most studies, people used PEP while sitting up.

Some studies only looked at one treatment session. These studies could not tell us much about long-term effects. They could not track lung infections. Lung function did not change after just one treatment.

Two studies lasted a year. One study with children showed that PEP therapy made their lungs work better. In an adult study, lungs got a little worse with both PEP and another method. The way PEP was done was also different for children and adults.

Overall, PEP therapy might help reduce flare-ups. This is based on a few studies. Each person should talk to their doctor. They can find the best way to clear their airways. This helps them live a better life.

The quality of some studies was not very high. It is hard to compare different types of therapy. Things like age and how bad the lung disease is can change results. How each treatment is done also matters. We think the evidence for PEP reducing flare-ups is good. But, for other things, the evidence was not as strong.","Using positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis

10.1002-14651858.CD013162.pub2,"Background
Previous Cochrane Reviews have shown that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders. However, questions remain regarding the following: up‐to‐date evidence of the relative efficacy and acceptability of CBT compared to waiting lists/no treatment, treatment as usual, attention controls, and alternative treatments; benefits across a range of outcomes; longer‐term effects; outcomes for different delivery formats; and amongst children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and children with intellectual impairments. 
Objectives
To examine the effect of CBT for childhood anxiety disorders, in comparison with waitlist/no treatment, treatment as usual (TAU), attention control, alternative treatment, and medication. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (all years to 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (each to October 2019), international trial registries, and conducted grey literature searches. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of CBT that involved direct contact with the child, parent, or both, and included non‐CBT comparators (waitlist/no treatment, treatment as usual, attention control, alternative treatment, medication). Participants were younger than age 19, and met diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Primary outcomes were remission of primary anxiety diagnosis post‐treatment, and acceptability (number of participants lost to post‐treatment assessment), and secondary outcomes included remission of all anxiety diagnoses, reduction in anxiety symptoms, reduction in depressive symptoms, improvement in global functioning, adverse effects, and longer‐term effects. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 87 studies and 5964 participants in quantitative analyses.
Compared with waitlist/no treatment, CBT probably increases post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety diagnoses (CBT: 49.4%, waitlist/no treatment: 17.8%; OR 5.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.90 to 7.60; n = 2697, 39 studies, moderate quality); NNTB 3 (95% CI 2.25 to 3.57) and all anxiety diagnoses (OR 4.43, 95% CI 2.89 to 6.78; n = 2075, 28 studies, moderate quality). 
Low‐quality evidence did not show a difference between CBT and TAU in post‐treatment primary anxiety disorder remission (OR 3.19, 95% CI 0.90 to 11.29; n = 487, 8 studies), but did suggest CBT may increase remission from all anxiety disorders compared to TAU (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.46; n = 203, 5 studies). 
Compared with attention control, CBT may increase post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety disorders (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.89; n = 822, 10 studies, low quality) and all anxiety disorders (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.22 to 6.17; n = 378, 5 studies, low quality). 
There was insufficient available data to compare CBT to alternative treatments on post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety disorders, and low‐quality evidence showed there may be little to no difference between these groups on post‐treatment remission of all anxiety disorders (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.23; n = 401, 4 studies) 
Low‐quality evidence did not show a difference for acceptability between CBT and waitlist/no treatment (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.41; n=3158, 45 studies), treatment as usual (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.56; n = 441, 8 studies), attention control (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.49; n = 797, 12 studies) and alternative treatment (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.13; n=515, 7 studies). 
No adverse effects were reported across all studies; however, in the small number of studies where any reference was made to adverse effects, it was not clear that these were systematically monitored. 
Results from the anxiety symptom outcomes, broader outcomes, longer‐term outcomes and subgroup analyses are provided in the text. 
We did not find evidence of consistent differences in outcomes according to delivery formats (e.g. individual versus group; amount of therapist contact time) or amongst samples with and without ASD, and no studies included samples of children with intellectual impairments. 
Authors' conclusions
CBT is probably more effective in the short‐term than waiting lists/no treatment, and may be more effective than attention control. We found little to no evidence across outcomes that CBT is superior to usual care or alternative treatments, but our confidence in these findings are limited due to concerns about the amount and quality of available evidence, and we still know little about how best to efficiently improve outcomes. 
","## How Talking Helps Kids With Worries

### Rationale

Many kids feel worried sometimes. But for some kids, these worries are very strong. They can stop kids from doing fun things. These worries can make it hard to go to school or play with friends. This is called an anxiety disorder. It can be a big problem for kids and their families.

We know that a type of therapy called CBT can help. CBT stands for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. It teaches kids ways to change bad thoughts and actions. This study looked at how well CBT works for kids with strong worries. We wanted to see if it helps more than just waiting or other types of help. We also wanted to know if it helps all kids, even those with other needs.

CBT helps kids learn to face their fears. It helps them change how they think about things that scare them. This can make their worries smaller. It can help them feel better and do more.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. It combined the results from all of them. This helps us get a clearer picture.

We looked for studies that used CBT. The kids in these studies were under 19 years old. They all had a doctor say they had an anxiety disorder. The CBT could be for the child, the parent, or both.

We compared CBT to other ways of helping. These included:
*   **Waiting list:** Kids got no help at first.
*   **No treatment:** Kids got no help at all.
*   **Normal care:** Kids got the usual help from their doctor.
*   **Attention control:** Kids got some attention, but not real therapy.
*   **Other types of therapy:** Kids got a different kind of talk therapy.
*   **Medicine:** Kids took medicine for their worries.

We mainly looked at if the kids' main anxiety went away after therapy. We also looked at if kids stayed in the therapy. We checked for other good changes too. We looked at how many worries kids had. We checked if they felt sad less often. We also looked at how well they could do daily tasks. We checked if there were any bad effects from the therapy.

### Results

We looked at 87 studies. There were almost 6000 kids in these studies.

CBT worked much better than just waiting or getting no help.
*   About 5 out of 10 kids got better with CBT.
*   Only about 2 out of 10 kids got better with no help.
*   This means CBT helped many more kids. For every 3 kids treated with CBT, 1 more got better than those who got no help.

CBT also seemed to work better than just getting some attention.
*   It helped more kids get rid of their main anxiety.

We did not find clear proof that CBT was better than usual care. We also did not see a clear difference between CBT and other types of therapy. But we need more studies to be sure about this. The proof for these comparisons was not as strong.

Kids usually stayed in CBT therapy. They did not drop out more often than other groups. This means they found it helpful and were okay with it. No bad effects were reported in any study. But it was not always clear if studies looked for bad effects closely.

We did not see big differences based on how CBT was given. For example, one-on-one therapy seemed as good as group therapy. The amount of time with a therapist did not change the results much either.

CBT helped kids with anxiety. It helped them feel less worried. It helped them do more things. It seemed helpful for most kids who took part. But we need more studies to learn more about how to make CBT even better. We also need to study kids with other special needs more closely.","Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety in children and young people
Why is this review important? 
Many children and young people experience problems with anxiety. Children and young people with anxiety disorders are more likely than their peers to have difficulty with friendships, family life, and school, and to develop mental health problems later in life. Therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help children and young people to overcome difficulties with anxiety by using new ways of thinking and facing their fears. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Parents, children, and young people; people working in education and mental health services for children and young people; and general practitioners. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review updates and replaces previous Cochrane Reviews from 2005 and 2015, which showed that CBT is an effective treatment for children and young people with anxiety disorders. 
This review aimed to answer the following questions:
• Is CBT more effective than a waiting list or no treatment?
• Is CBT more effective than other treatments and medication?
• Does CBT help to reduce anxiety for children and young people in the longer term?
• Are some types of CBT more effective than others? (e.g. individual versus group therapy) 
• Is CBT effective for specific groups? (e.g. children with autism)
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched the databases to find all studies of CBT for anxiety disorders in children and young people published up to October 2019. In order to be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) and had to include young people under 19 years of age with an anxiety disorder diagnosis. We included 87 studies with a total of 5964 participants in the analysis. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
We rated the overall quality of the evidence as 'moderate’ or 'low'. There is evidence that CBT is more effective than a waiting list or no treatment in reducing anxiety in children and young people, although the findings did vary across studies. There is no clear evidence that CBT is more effective than other treatments. A small number of studies looked at outcomes six months after CBT was given and showed that reductions in anxiety continued. We found no clear evidence that one way of providing CBT is more effective than another (e.g. in a group, longer treatments, with parents) or that CBT is more or less effective for any specific group of children (e.g. children with autism spectrum disorders). 
What should happen next? 
Future research should compare CBT to alternative treatments and medication; identify who does and does not benefit from CBT and what those who do not benefit need; establish how to make CBT more accessible; and give far more consideration to neglected populations, including children and young people from low‐ and middle‐income countries.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease, with an estimated global prevalence ranging from 0.5% to 4.6%. Based on clinical features, psoriasis is generally divided into the following: chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP); psoriasis associated with psoriatic arthritis; and pustular, erythrodermic, or guttate psoriasis. We also considered psoriasis affecting the palms and soles (palmoplantar psoriasis, or PPP). Although psoriasis is rarely life‐threatening, it can affect a person's quality of life significantly. 
Phototherapy is an essential treatment option for people with psoriasis. The most commonly used types of phototherapy are narrow‐band ultraviolet B (NB‐UVB), broad‐band ultraviolet B (BB‐UVB), and psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy (PUVA). PUVA can be further divided into oral, bath, and topical PUVA according to the administrative route of psoralen. NB‐UVB delivers almost exclusively 311 nm radiation, whereas BB‐UVB can be divided into two types: selective BB‐UVB (305 to 325 nm radiation) and conventional BB‐UVB (280 to 320 nm radiation). 
This review included 13 small randomised controlled trials (RCT), with a total of 662 participants. Most of these were of poor methodological quality. 
For treating CPP, the clearance rate between the NB‐UVB and oral PUVA groups were inconsistent in three RCTs. In one, there was no difference between the groups, and in the other two, the clearance rate was in favour of oral PUVA. The evidence from the comparison of NB‐UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left‐right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the two groups, while another RCT favoured bath PUVA. 
Two RCTs found NB‐UVB plus retinoid (re‐NB‐UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re‐PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or guttate psoriasis. One RCT found no significant differences between NB‐UVB and selective BB‐UVB for clearing CPP or in the number of withdrawals due to side‐effects. 
In participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no statistically significant differences between NB‐UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate. 
In summary, NB‐UVB may be preferred to oral or bath PUVA because it is more convenient to use. NB‐UVB seemed to be equal to selective BB‐UVB for clearing CPP. Evidence regarding NB‐UVB and conventional BB‐UVB is limited. The long‐term safety of NB‐UVB needs to be confirmed. The efficacy of NB‐UVB for clearing PPP needs to be confirmed in future studies. 
","## Clear Skin Through Light: A Look at Psoriasis Treatment

### Rationale

Psoriasis is a common skin problem. It makes your skin red, scaly, and itchy. This disease is not life-threating. But it can make life hard for people who have it. It affects how they feel about themselves. It can also make daily tasks tough.

Doctors often use light therapy to treat psoriasis. This therapy helps calm the skin. There are a few types of light therapy. These include narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) and broad-band ultraviolet B (BB-UVB). Another type is psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA).

NB-UVB uses a very specific kind of light. BB-UVB uses a broader range of light. PUVA uses a drug called psoralen with UVA light. Psoralen makes the skin more sensitive to light. This study looked at how well these light therapies work. It also wanted to see which one is best.

### Trial Design

This study asked: ""How do different light therapies compare for psoriasis?"" We looked at past studies. These studies were small and used random groups. This means some people got one treatment. Others got a different one. This helps make the study fair.

The studies included 662 people in total. These people had different types of psoriasis. Most had chronic plaque psoriasis. Some had psoriasis on their palms and soles. The age and gender of the people varied. We do not know the exact number for each.

These studies lasted different amounts of time. The treatment periods varied. People might be in a study for weeks or months. The main goal was to see how much the skin cleared. They also watched for any bad effects.

### Results

We looked at 13 small studies. Most of these studies were not very strong in their design. This means we must be careful with the results.

For common psoriasis, NB-UVB and oral PUVA had mixed results. Some studies showed no real difference. Other studies said oral PUVA worked better. When comparing NB-UVB to bath PUVA, the results were also mixed. Some studies found no difference. Others found bath PUVA worked better.

Adding a drug called retinoid to NB-UVB or PUVA showed similar results. Both treatments worked about the same. They helped people with common psoriasis or guttate psoriasis.

NB-UVB and a type of BB-UVB showed no real difference. They both cleared the skin about the same. Also, people stopped these treatments at the same rate. This means side effects were similar.

For psoriasis on hands and feet, NB-UVB and topical PUVA worked the same. Neither was better at clearing the skin.

In short, NB-UVB might be easier to use than oral or bath PUVA. It seems to work as well as a specific type of BB-UVB. We need more research on NB-UVB and other BB-UVB types. We also need to know if NB-UVB is safe for a long time. Future studies should also check how well NB-UVB clears psoriasis on hands and feet.","Narrow‐band ultraviolet B phototherapy versus broad‐band ultraviolet B or psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy for treating psoriasis

Hepatorenal syndrome is defined as renal failure in people with cirrhosis in the absence of other causes. In addition to supportive treatment such as albumin to restore fluid balance, the other potential treatments include systemic vasoconstrictor drugs (such as vasopressin analogues or noradrenaline), renal vasodilator drugs (such as dopamine), transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and liver support with molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS). There is uncertainty over the best treatment regimen for hepatorenal syndrome. 
Objectives
To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for hepatorenal syndrome in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trial registers until December 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials on hepatorenal syndrome in people with cirrhosis. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in adults with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently identified eligible trials and collected data. The outcomes for this review included mortality, serious adverse events, any adverse events, resolution of hepatorenal syndrome, liver transplantation, and other decompensation events. We performed a network meta‐analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio (OR), rate ratio, hazard ratio (HR), and mean difference (MD) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available‐case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. 
Main results
We included a total of 25 trials (1263 participants; 12 interventions) in the review. Twenty‐three trials (1185 participants) were included in one or more outcomes. All the trials but two were at high risk of bias, and all the evidence was of low or very low certainty. The trials included participants with liver cirrhosis of varied aetiologies as well as a mixture of type I hepatorenal syndrome only, type II hepatorenal syndrome only, or people with both type I and type II hepatorenal syndrome. Participant age ranged from 42 to 60 years, and the proportion of females ranged from 5.8% to 61.5% in the trials that reported this information. The follow‐up in the trials ranged from one week to six months. Overall, 59% of participants died during this period and about 35% of participants recovered from hepatorenal syndrome. The most common interventions compared were albumin plus terlipressin, albumin plus noradrenaline, and albumin alone. 
There was no evidence of a difference in mortality (22 trials; 1153 participants) at maximal follow‐up between the different interventions. None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life. There was no evidence of differences in the proportion of people with serious adverse events (three trials; 428 participants), number of participants with serious adverse events per participant (two trials; 166 participants), proportion of participants with any adverse events (four trials; 402 participants), the proportion of people who underwent liver transplantation at maximal follow‐up (four trials; 342 participants), or other features of decompensation at maximal follow‐up (one trial; 466 participants). Five trials (293 participants) reported number of any adverse events, and five trials (219 participants) reported treatment costs. Albumin plus noradrenaline had fewer numbers of adverse events per participant (rate ratio 0.51, 95% CrI 0.28 to 0.87). Eighteen trials (1047 participants) reported recovery from hepatorenal syndrome (as per definition of hepatorenal syndrome). In terms of recovery from hepatorenal syndrome, in the direct comparisons, albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin plus octreotide had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome than albumin plus terlipressin (HR 0.04; 95% CrI 0.00 to 0.25 and HR 0.26, 95% CrI 0.07 to 0.80 respectively). There was no evidence of differences between the groups in any of the other direct comparisons. In the network meta‐analysis, albumin and albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome compared with albumin plus terlipressin. 
Funding: two trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies; five trials were funded by parties who had no vested interest in the results of the trial; and 18 trials did not report the source of funding. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on very low‐certainty evidence, there is no evidence of benefit or harm of any of the interventions for hepatorenal syndrome with regards to the following outcomes: all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events (proportion), number of serious adverse events per participant, any adverse events (proportion), liver transplantation, or other decompensation events. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that albumin plus noradrenaline had fewer 'any adverse events per participant' than albumin plus terlipressin. Low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence also found that albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome compared with albumin plus terlipressin. 
Future randomised clinical trials should be adequately powered; employ blinding, avoid post‐randomisation dropouts or planned cross‐overs (or perform an intention‐to‐treat analysis); and report clinically important outcomes such as mortality, health‐related quality of life, adverse events, and recovery from hepatorenal syndrome. Albumin plus noradrenaline and albumin plus terlipressin appear to be the interventions that should be compared in future trials. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Helping Kidneys When the Liver is Sick

### Rationale

Your liver helps your body in many ways. It cleans your blood and helps you digest food. When your liver is very sick, it is called cirrhosis. Cirrhosis can make your kidneys stop working well. This is called hepatorenal syndrome.

When your kidneys do not work well, your body can get very sick. This can be very hard on patients. There are different ways to treat this problem. Some treatments use medicine to help blood flow to your kidneys. Other treatments help the liver directly.

Doctors want to know which treatment works best. This study looked at many treatments. We want to find the best way to help people with this serious problem. We want to see if one treatment is safer or works better than others.

### Trial Design

We looked at many past studies. These studies were called ""randomized clinical trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. Each group got a different treatment. This helps us see which treatment works best.

The studies we looked at included adults with cirrhosis. These people also had hepatorenal syndrome. Their ages ranged from 42 to 60 years. Both men and women were in these studies.

We looked at how long people were in these studies. Some people were in a study for one week. Others were in a study for up to six months. We looked at things like if people got better. We also looked at if there were any bad effects from the treatments.

### Results

We looked at 25 studies in total. These studies included 1263 people. They tested 12 different ways to treat hepatorenal syndrome. We found that most studies were not perfect. This made it hard to be sure about some results.

About 6 out of 10 people in the studies died. About 3 out of 10 people got better from hepatorenal syndrome. We looked at many treatments. The most common ones were albumin with terlipressin, albumin with noradrenaline, and albumin alone.

We did not find clear proof that one treatment helped people live longer than another. We also did not find clear proof about bad effects. Most treatments seemed to have similar risks. No study looked at how people felt about their health.

We did find one thing: albumin with noradrenaline seemed to cause fewer bad effects than albumin with terlipressin. Also, albumin alone or albumin with midodrine and octreotide did not help people recover as much as albumin with terlipressin.

More studies are needed to be sure. These new studies should be better designed. They should compare albumin with noradrenaline and albumin with terlipressin. This will help us find the best way to help people with this kidney problem.","Treatment of hepatorenal syndrome
What is the aim of this Cochrane review? 
To find out the best treatment for decreased kidney function (hepatorenal syndrome) in people with liver cirrhosis (a form of advanced liver disease with scarring of the liver) with complications. The authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 25 randomised controlled trials (participants receive the treatment based on method similar to coin toss or lottery; this is to ensure that the people who receive the different treatments are similar in all aspects except the treatment, so that any differences in the results between the treatments can be attributed to the treatment rather than differences in the type of people who received the treatment). During analysis of data, authors used standard Cochrane techniques, which allows comparison of two treatments at a time. Authors also used advanced techniques, that allow comparison of many treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network meta‐analysis' or 'multiple treatment comparisons'). The aim is to gather reliable evidence on the relative benefits and harms of the different treatments. 
Date of literature search December 2018 
Key messages Only two studies were conducted well. The remaining studies had one or more flaws. Therefore, there is high uncertainty in the results of the analysis. The authors could not recommend one treatment over another on the basis of risk of death, serious complications, percentage of people who developed any complication, percentage of participants who underwent liver transplantation (replacement of a diseased liver with a healthy one), or the number of other liver failure events. Health‐related quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. The number of complications of any severity was lower with albumin plus noradrenaline than albumin plus terlipressin. Recovery from hepatorenal syndrome may be lower with albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone than albumin plus terlipressin and albumin plus noradrenaline. 
Funding source was unclear in 18 studies. Industrial organisations funded two studies and the remaining five studies did not receive any funding from industrial organisations. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review studied people of any sex, age, and origin, having advanced liver disease due to various causes, and who had developed hepatorenal syndrome. People were administered different treatments. The review authors excluded studies with liver‐transplanted participants. Participants age, when reported, ranged from 42 to 60 years. The number of females ranged from 6 to 62 out of 100 in the studies that reported this information. The main treatments compared were albumin alone, albumin plus terlipressin, and albumin plus noradrenaline. The authors gathered and analysed data on death, quality of life, serious and non‐serious complications, time to liver transplantation, recovery from hepatorenal syndrome, and disappearance of symptoms. 
What were the main results of the review? 
The 25 studies included a small number of participants (1263 participants). Study data were sparse. Twenty‐three studies with 1185 participants provided data for analyses. The follow‐up in the trials ranged from one week to six months. The review shows that: 
‐ About 60 out of every 100 people died within three months, and 35 out of every 100 people recovered from hepatorenal syndrome. 
‐ The provided treatment may make no difference to the percentage of people who died or developed serious complications, number of serious complications per person, percentage of people who developed complications of any severity, or the percentage of people undergoing liver transplantation. 
‐ None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life.
‐ The number of complications of any severity was lower with albumin plus noradrenaline than albumin plus terlipressin. 
‐ Recovery from hepatorenal syndrome may be lower with albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone than albumin plus terlipressin and albumin plus noradrenaline. 
‐ We have very low confidence in the overall results.
‐ Future trials with proper design and quality are needed to clarify the best treatment for people with advanced liver disease having hepatorenal syndrome.

Uterine leiomyomas, also referred to as myomas or fibroids, are benign tumours arising from the smooth muscle cells of the myometrium. They are the most common pelvic tumour in women. The estimated rate of leiomyosarcoma, found during surgery for presumed benign leiomyomas, is about 0.51 per 1000 procedures, or approximately 1 in 2000. 
Treatment options for symptomatic uterine leiomyomas include medical, surgical, and radiologically‐guided interventions. Laparoscopic myomectomy is the gold standard surgical approach for women who want offspring, or otherwise wish to retain their uterus. A limitation of laparoscopy is the inability to remove large specimens from the abdominal cavity through the laparoscope. To overcome this challenge, the morcellation approach was developed, during which larger specimens are broken into smaller pieces in order to remove them from the abdominal cavity via the port site. However, intracorporeal power morcellation may lead to scattering of benign tissues, with the risk of spreading leiomyoma or endometriosis. In cases of unsuspected malignancy, power morcellation can cause unintentional dissemination of malignant cells, and lead to a poorer prognosis by upstaging the occult cancer. 
A strategy to optimise women's safety is to morcellate the specimens inside a bag. In‐bag morcellation may avoid the dissemination of tissue fragments. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of protected in‐bag extracorporeal manual morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy compared to intra‐abdominal uncontained power morcellation. 
Search methods
On 1 July 2019, we searched; the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialized Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, PubMed, Google Scholar, and two trials registers. 
We reviewed the reference lists of all retrieved full‐text articles, and contacted experts in the field for additional and ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing in‐bag extracorporeal manual morcellation versus intracorporeal uncontained power morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy in premenopausal women. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods.
Two review authors independently reviewed the eligibility of trials, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. Data were checked for accuracy. 
The summary measures were reported as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). 
The outcomes of interest were a composite of intraoperative and postoperative complications, operative times, ease of morcellation, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, conversion to laparotomy, and postoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. Results for the five main outcomes follow. 
Main results
We included two trials, enrolling 176 premenopausal women with fibroids, who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy. 
The experimental group received in‐bag manual morcellation, during which each enucleated myoma was placed into a specimen retrieval bag, and manually morcellated with scalpel or scissors. In the control group, intracorporeal uncontained power morcellation was used to reduce the size of the myomas. 
No intraoperative complications, including accidental morcellation of the liver, conversion to laparotomy, endoscopic bag disruption, bowel injury, bleeding, accidental injury to any viscus or vessel, were reported in either group in either trial. 
We found very low‐quality evidence of inconclusive results for total operative time (MD 9.93 minutes, 95% CI ‐1.35 to 21.20; 2 studies, 176 participants; I² = 35%), and ease of morcellation (MD ‐0.73 points, 95% CI ‐1.64 to 0.18; 1 study, 104 participants). The morcellation operative time was a little longer for the in‐bag manual morcellation group, however the quality of the evidence was very low (MD 2.59 minutes, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.72; 2 studies, 176 participants; I² = 0%). There were no postoperative diagnoses of leiomyosarcoma made in either group in either trial. 
We are very uncertain of any of these results. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to indirectness and imprecision, because of limited sites in high‐income settings and countries, small sample sizes, wide confidence intervals, and few events. 
Authors' conclusions
There are limited data on the effectiveness and safety of in‐bag morcellation at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy compared to uncontained power morcellation. We were unable to determine the effects of in‐bag morcellation on intraoperative complications as no events were reported in either group. We are uncertain if in‐bag morcellation improves total operative time or ease of morcellation compared to control. Regarding morcellation operative time, the quality of the evidence was also very low and we cannot be certain of the effect of in‐bag morcellation compared to uncontained morcellation. No cases of postoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma occurred in either group. We found only two trials comparing in‐bag extracorporeal manual morcellation to intracorporeal uncontained power morcellation at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy. Both trials had morcellation operative time as primary outcome and were not powered for uncommon outcomes such as intraoperative complications, and postoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. 
Large, well‐planned and executed trials are needed.
","## Taking Out Uterine Growths Safely

### Rationale

Many women get growths in their womb. These growths are called fibroids. They are not cancer. But they can cause problems. Some women have pain. Some have heavy bleeding. These problems can make life hard.

Doctors can take out fibroids with surgery. This surgery is called myomectomy. It is often done with small cuts. This is called laparoscopic surgery. It helps women keep their womb. This is good for women who want to have babies.

Sometimes, fibroids are too big to remove through small cuts. Doctors use a tool to break them into smaller pieces. This tool is called a morcellator. This helps them remove the fibroids.

But, using this tool can spread small pieces of the fibroid. This can cause new fibroids to grow. Very rarely, a fibroid that looks harmless can be cancer. If this cancer is broken into pieces, it can spread. This makes the cancer harder to treat.

Doctors want a safer way to break up fibroids. They thought about putting the fibroid in a bag first. Then, they could break it up inside the bag. This might stop pieces from spreading. This study looked at how well this ""in-bag"" method works. It also checked if it was safe.

### Trial Design

This study looked at how different ways of removing fibroids worked. It compared two methods. Both methods used small cuts in the belly. This is a type of surgery.

One method was new. It was called ""in-bag manual morcellation."" The doctor put the fibroid into a bag inside the belly. Then, the doctor used small tools to break up the fibroid. This was all done inside the bag.

The other method was the usual way. It was called ""uncontained power morcellation."" The doctor used a special tool to break up the fibroid. This was done without a bag.

This study looked at other studies. These studies included women who had fibroids. All women were still able to have babies. They all had surgery to take out their fibroids. They were in the study for a short time. This was to see how they did right after surgery.

### Results

We looked at two studies. These studies included 176 women. All these women had fibroids. They had surgery to remove them.

One group of women had the fibroids broken up inside a bag. The other group had the fibroids broken up without a bag.

No women in either group had serious problems during surgery. Things like bleeding or damage to other organs did not happen. No women needed a bigger surgery.

Breaking up the fibroids inside a bag took a little longer. But we are not very sure about this. The study found no difference in how easy it was to break up the fibroids.

No women in either group were found to have cancer after surgery. This is good news.

But, the study could not say for sure if breaking up fibroids in a bag is much better. The studies were small. They did not have many women. More studies are needed to be sure. These new studies need to be bigger and better planned.","In‐bag manual versus uncontained power morcellation for laparoscopic myomectomy
Review question 
Cochrane authors reviewed the effectiveness and safety of in‐bag manual morcellation compared to uncontained power morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy. The primary outcome of the review was a composite of intraoperative (during surgery) complications. 
Background 
Myomectomy is a surgical procedure to remove uterine fibroids — also called leiomyomas. These common, non‐cancerous growths usually develop in the uterus during childbearing years, but they can occur at any age. In laparoscopic myomectomy, which is a minimally invasive procedure, the surgeon accesses and removes the fibroids through several small abdominal incisions. 
Laparoscopic myomectomy is the gold standard for women with uterine leiomyomas, but it is difficult to remove large fibroids through the small incisions and tubes (laparoscopes). To overcome this challenge, surgeons developed a technique to break the large fibroids into smaller pieces (morcellation). 
However, power morcellation (using a drill‐like instrument to cut up the fibroids) inside the abdomen may lead to the scattering of the tissues. These tissues may be benign (such as fibroids or endometriosis), but they may also be tissues from an undiagnosed cancer. A strategy to optimise women's safety is to cut up larger fibroids with a scalpel or scissors, inside a bag. 
Study Characteristics 
We included two randomised controlled trials, which enrolled 176 premenopausal women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy; they were randomised to receive either in‐bag manual morcellation (87 women) or uncontained power morcellation (89 women). The literature was searched to 1 July 2019. 
Key results 
Neither study reported complications during or after surgery, including no diagnoses of leiomyosarcoma, for women in either group. 
We are very uncertain whether in‐bag morcellation reduces the total time of the operation, or improves the ease of morcellation. The evidence suggests that the morcellation operative time was slightly longer when the surgeon used in‐bag morcellation. However, the quality of the evidence is very low and we cannot be certain of any of these results. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low quality. The main limitations were indirectness (both trials took place in high‐income settings and countries, therefore, our findings are limited to this type of setting), and imprecision (both trials had small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals).

Background 
An arterial catheter is a thin tube or line that can be inserted into an artery. Arterial catheters are used to monitor blood pressure during complex surgeries and during stays in intensive care.

Our aim was to find out whether ultrasound offers any advantages over palpation of the artery or Doppler auditory assistance. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to January 2016. We found five eligible studies ‐ four comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. 
Key results 
We included in the review children aged one month to 18 years. We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas. Ultrasound also increased the success rate within two attempts. It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children. It is also likely that ultrasound is more useful if the practitioner is experienced in its use. 
Quality of the evidence 
We noted variation in the risk of bias of included studies. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate mainly because the number of studies was limited. For the same reason, we could not confirm the effect of age and expertise in ultrasound usage. 
Conclusions 
Our evidence suggests that ultrasound is superior to other techniques for arterial catheter insertion, particularly in babies and young children.

### Plain Title: Sound Waves Help Doctors Place Tubes in Kids' Blood Vessels

### Rationale

Children sometimes need a small tube put into an artery. This tube is called an arterial catheter. Doctors use it to check blood pressure. This is very important during big surgeries. It is also important when kids are very sick in the hospital.

Putting this tube in can be hard. The artery is small and can be hard to find. Sometimes, doctors have to try many times. This can hurt the child. It can also cause bruising or damage to the artery.

Doctors usually find the artery by feeling for a pulse. Or they use a sound machine to listen for the artery. We wanted to see if using sound waves to make a picture, called ultrasound, would be better. Ultrasound lets doctors see inside the body. This might help them put the tube in right the first time. It might also cause less harm to the child.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past research. It gathered all the good studies up to January 2016. The goal was to see how ultrasound compares to other ways of placing these tubes.

The studies we found looked at children. These children were from one month old up to 18 years old. We looked at five studies in total. Four studies compared ultrasound to feeling for the pulse. One study compared ultrasound to listening for the artery. We wanted to find out if using ultrasound made it easier and safer for kids.

### Results

Our review looked at many children. These kids were babies and up to 18 years old. We found good news about using ultrasound.

Using ultrasound helped doctors put the tube in on the first try more often. This means fewer pokes for the child. It also caused less bruising. That is a blood spot under the skin. Ultrasound also helped doctors succeed within two tries.

It seems that ultrasound helps babies and very young children the most. It might be less helpful for older kids. Also, doctors who use ultrasound a lot get better at it. This makes it work even better for their patients.

In closing, our findings suggest ultrasound is a better way. It helps doctors put arterial tubes in children. This is especially true for babies and small children.","Ultrasound use for insertion of arterial catheters in children

10.1002-14651858.CD013273,"Background
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is vastly recommended as the first‐line analgesic for osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. However, there has been controversy about this recommendation given recent studies have revealed small effects of paracetamol when compared with placebo. Nonetheless, past studies have not systematically reviewed and appraised the literature to investigate the effects of this drug on specific osteoarthritis sites, that is, hip or knee, or on the dose used. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of paracetamol compared with placebo in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts to 3 October 2017, and ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal on 20 October 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing paracetamol with placebo in adults with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Major outcomes were pain, function, quality of life, adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and abnormal liver function tests. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors used standard Cochrane methods to collect data, and assess risk of bias and quality of the evidence. For pooling purposes, we converted pain and physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function) scores to a common 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability) scale. 
Main results
We identified 10 randomised placebo‐controlled trials involving 3541 participants with hip or knee osteoarthritis. The paracetamol dose varied from 1.95 g/day to 4 g/day, and the majority of trials followed participants for three months only. Most trials did not clearly report randomisation and concealment methods and were at unclear risk of selection bias. Trials were at low risk of performance, detection, and reporting bias. 
At 3 weeks' to 3 months' follow‐up, there was high‐quality evidence that paracetamol provided no clinically important improvements in pain and physical function. Mean reduction in pain was 23 points (0 to 100 scale, lower scores indicated less pain) with placebo and 3.23 points better (5.43 better to 1.02 better) with paracetamol, an absolute reduction of 3% (1% better to 5% better, minimal clinical important difference 9%) and relative reduction of 5% (2% better to 8% better) (seven trials, 2355 participants). Physical function improved by 12 points on a 0 to 100 scale (lower scores indicated better function) with placebo and was 2.9 points better (0.95 better to 4.89 better) with paracetamol, an absolute improvement of 3% (1% better to 5% better, minimal clinical important difference 10%) and relative improvement of 5% (2% better to 9% better) (7 trials, 2354 participants). 
High‐quality evidence from eight trials indicated that the incidence of adverse events was similar between groups: 515/1586 (325 per 1000) in the placebo group versus 537/1666 (328 per 1000, range 299 to 360) in the paracetamol group (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.11). There was less certainty (moderate‐quality evidence) around the risk of serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and the rate of abnormal liver function tests, due to wide CIs or small event rates, indicating imprecision. Seventeen of 1480 (11 per 1000) people treated with placebo and 28/1729 (16 per 1000, range 8 to 29) people treated with paracetamol experienced serious adverse events (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.53; 6 trials). The incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 65/1000 participants in with placebo and 77/1000 (range 59 to 100) participants with paracetamol (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.55; 7 trials). Abnormal liver function occurred in 18/1000 participants treated with placebo and 70/1000 participants treated with paracetamol (RR 3.79, 95% CI 1.94 to 7.39), but the clinical importance of this effect was uncertain. None of the trials reported quality of life. 
Subgroup analyses indicated that the effects of paracetamol on pain and function did not differ according to the dose of paracetamol (3.0 g/day or less versus 3.9 g/day or greater). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on high‐quality evidence this review confirms that paracetamol provides only minimal improvements in pain and function for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis, with no increased risk of adverse events overall. Subgroup analysis indicates that the effects on pain and function do not differ according to the dose of paracetamol. Due to the small number of events, we are less certain if paracetamol use increases the risk of serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and rate of abnormal liver function tests. 
Current clinical guidelines consistently recommend paracetamol as the first‐line analgesic medication for hip or knee osteoarthritis, given its low absolute frequency of substantive harm. However, our results call for reconsideration of these recommendations. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Does Tylenol Really Help Hip or Knee Pain?

**Rationale**

Many people feel pain in their hips or knees. This pain is often due to a problem called osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis can make it hard to move and enjoy daily life. Doctors often suggest a medicine called paracetamol, also known as Tylenol or acetaminophen, for this pain. It is usually the first medicine they tell you to try.

But some people wonder if paracetamol really works well for this kind of pain. Past studies have not looked closely at how well paracetamol helps specific areas like the hip or knee. They also haven't looked at different doses of the medicine. We wanted to see if paracetamol truly helps with hip or knee pain and if it causes any bad side effects.

**Trial Design**

This study looked at many other studies that had already been done. We searched through big databases of medical research. We looked for studies that gave some adults paracetamol and other adults a sugar pill, called a placebo. The adults in these studies all had osteoarthritis in their hip or knee.

We wanted to see how paracetamol compared to the sugar pill. We looked at things like how much pain people felt, how well they could move, and their overall quality of life. We also looked for any bad effects from the medicine. These studies usually followed people for about three months.

**Results**

We found 10 studies that fit our needs. These studies included over 3500 people with hip or knee pain from osteoarthritis. The amount of paracetamol given in these studies was between about 2 grams and 4 grams each day. Most studies watched people for three months.

We found that paracetamol did not help much with pain or how well people could move. People taking the sugar pill also felt some pain relief. Paracetamol only added a very small amount of extra help with pain and movement. It was not enough to make a big difference in how people felt day-to-day.

We also looked at side effects. About the same number of people in both groups had side effects. This means paracetamol did not cause more common side effects than the sugar pill. However, we are less sure about very rare or serious side effects. More people who took paracetamol had problems with their liver tests. We don't know yet if this is a big concern.

Taking more paracetamol did not make it work better. So, taking a higher dose did not help more with pain or movement.

Based on our findings, paracetamol gives only very small help for hip and knee pain from osteoarthritis. It does not cause more common bad side effects. But we need to think about these findings. Doctors may need to rethink if paracetamol should be the first medicine they suggest for this type of pain.","Paracetamol for treating people with hip or knee osteoarthritis
Background 
Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee is a progressive disabling disease affecting many people worldwide. Although paracetamol is widely used as a treatment option for this condition, recent studies have called into question how effective this pain relief medication is. 
Search date 
This review includes all trials published up to 3 October 2017.
Study characteristics 
We included randomised clinical trials (where people are randomly put into one of two treatment groups) looking at the effects of paracetamol for people with hip or knee pain due to osteoarthritis against a placebo (a 'sugar tablet' that contains nothing that could act as a medicine). We found 10 trials with 3541 participants. On average, participants in the study were aged between 55 and 70 years, and most presented with knee osteoarthritis. The treatment dose ranged from 1.95 g/day to 4 g/day of paracetamol and participants were followed up between one and 12 weeks in all but one study, which followed people up for 24 weeks. Six trials were funded by companies that produced paracetamol. 
Key results 
Compared with placebo tablets, paracetamol resulted in little benefit at 12 weeks.
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improved by 3% (1% better to 5% better), or 3.2 points (1 better to 5.4 better) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale. 
• People who took paracetamol reported that their pain improved by 26 points.
• People who took placebo reported that their pain improved by 23 points.
Physical function (lower scores mean better function) 
Improved by 3% (1% better to 5% better), or 2.9 points (1.0 better to 4.9 better) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale. 
• People who took paracetamol reported that their function improved by 15 points.
• People who had placebo reported that their function improved by 12 points.
Side effects (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
No more people had side effects with paracetamol (3% less to 3% more), or 0 more people out of 100. 
• 33 out of 100 people reported a side effect with paracetamol.
• 33 out of 100 people reported a side effect with placebo.
Serious side effects (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
1% more people had serious side effects with paracetamol (0% less to 1% more), or one more person out of 100. 
• Two out of 100 people reported a serious side effect with paracetamol.
• One out of 100 people reported a serious side effect with placebo.
Withdrawals due to adverse events (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
1% more people withdrew from treatment with paracetamol (1% less to 3% more), or one more person out of 100. 
• Eight out of 100 people withdrew from paracetamol treatment.
• Seven out of 100 people withdrew from placebo treatment.
Abnormal liver function tests (up to 12 to 24 weeks): 
5% more people had abnormal liver function tests (meaning there was some inflammation or damage to the liver) with paracetamol (1% more to 10% more), or five more people out of 100. 
• Seven out of 100 people had an abnormal liver function test with paracetamol.
• Two out of 100 people had an abnormal liver function test with placebo.
Quality of the evidence 
High‐quality evidence indicated that paracetamol provided only minimal improvements in pain and function for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis, with no increased risk of adverse events overall. None of the studies measured quality of life. Due to the small number of events, we were less certain if paracetamol use increased the risk of serious side effects, increased withdrawals due to side effects, and changed the rate of abnormal liver function tests. However, although there may be more abnormal liver function tests with paracetamol, the clinical implications are unknown.

10.1002-14651858.CD006487.pub2,"Injectable local anaesthetic agents for preventing pain in participants requiring dental treatment 
Review question 
This review assessed the evidence for providing successful local anaesthesia that prevents pain during a dental procedure. Included studies compared injections of local anaesthetic to help people requiring dental treatment and to prevent painful sensations tested in an experimental way (such as using cold, a sharp probe, or an electric stimulus). 
Background 
An injection of local anaesthetic prevents a person from feeling pain. It is given in one specific area rather than in the whole body. Although pain during dental treatment can be successfully managed, it is a common fear of patients. 
Several different local anaesthetics are available to dentists, as well as a variety of ways to deliver them, to prevent pain. Factors that appear to influence success include increased difficulty in anaesthetizing teeth in the presence of inflammation, variable susceptibility of different teeth to local anaesthesia, different operative procedures performed on the tooth (for example, it appears easier to achieve successful anaesthesia for dental extractions than for root canal treatment), and various techniques and solutions used to give the local anaesthetic. 
We investigated whether injection of one local anaesthetic solution was more effective than another for preventing pain during dental treatment or during an experimental study, and whether this effect occurred quickly or lasted a sufficient length of time, if any unwanted effects occurred, and people’s experience of the dental procedures. Local adverse events might include pain during or after injection, or long‐lasting anaesthesia. Systemic effects due to the local anaesthetic solution can include allergic reactions and changes in heart rate and blood pressure. 
Study characteristics 
Two reviewers searched the literature to identify studies that compared different local anaesthetic solutions injected into people undergoing dental treatment or volunteers who had the same outcomes measured in experimental ways. Within every trial, each person was randomly assigned to receive one of the local anaesthetics under study. The search was up‐to‐date as of 31 January 2018. 
We found 123 trials with 19,223 male and female participants. These trials investigated pain experienced during dental treatment including surgery, extraction, periodontal (gum) treatment, tooth preparation, root canal treatment, anaesthesia of nerves within teeth (pulps) tested using an electric pulp tester or cold stimulant, and anaesthesia of soft tissues measured following pricking of gums or self‐reported by the participant. We pooled data from 68 studies (6615 participants). This resulted in eight outcomes when seven different local anaesthetic solutions were tested during dental treatment, two outcomes assessing pain during and after injection of local anaesthetic, and 47 outcomes tested with a pulp tester or by pricking of gums or self‐reported by participants. 
Key results 
The review suggests that of the 14 types of local anaesthetic tested, evidence to support the use of one over another is limited to the outcome of success (absence of pain), from three comparisons of local anaesthetic. Findings show that 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine in posterior teeth with inflamed pulps requiring root canal treatment. No difference between these solutions was seen when pain on injection was assessed, and although lidocaine resulted in less post‐injection pain, the difference was minimal. Researchers found that 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 3% prilocaine, 0.03 IU felypressin and 4% prilocaine plain for surgical procedures and surgical procedures/periodontal treatment, respectively. Speeds of onset were within clinically acceptable times, and durations were variable, making them suitable for different applications. Both of these latter outcomes were tested in experimental ways that may not reflect clinical findings. Unwanted effects were rare. Patients' experience of the procedures was not assessed owing to lack of data. 
Quality of the evidence 
From comparisons of local anaesthetics in this review, all appeared effective and safe with little difference between them. Available evidence ranged from moderate to very low in quality. Some studies fell short, in terms of quality, owing to small numbers of participants, unclear reporting of study methods, and reporting of data in a format that was not easy to combine with other data. Further research is required to clarify the effectiveness and safety of one local anaesthetic over another. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Pain-Free Dental Visits

### Rationale

Going to the dentist can make people feel scared. Many people worry about pain during dental work. Dentists use shots to numb a part of your mouth. This helps you not feel pain. These shots are called local anaesthetics. They only work in one spot, not your whole body.

There are many types of numbing shots. Dentists also have different ways to give them. Some teeth are harder to numb, like when there is swelling. Also, some dental jobs, like root canals, are harder to numb than pulling a tooth. We need to know which numbing shot works best. We also need to know if it works fast and lasts long enough. We also checked for bad effects from the shots.

### Trial Design

We looked at many studies. These studies compared different numbing shots. The shots were given to people having dental work. Some studies also used healthy people. They checked how well the shots worked in a test. For example, they might use cold or a small poke to see if the area was numb.

Each person in a study was put into a group by chance. Each group got a different numbing shot. This helps make sure the results are fair. We looked at studies up to January 31, 2018.

We found 123 studies. These studies included 19,223 men and women. They had dental work like surgery, tooth pulling, gum treatment, and root canals. Some studies also tested how numb the tooth nerves were. They used a special tool or cold. Other studies checked how numb the gums felt. They used a small poke or asked people. We combined the facts from 68 studies. This included 6615 people.

### Results

We looked at 14 types of numbing shots. We found a few key things.

One numbing shot, 4% articaine with epinephrine, worked better. It was better than 2% lidocaine with epinephrine. This was for back teeth with swelling that needed root canal treatment. Both shots caused about the same amount of pain when given. Lidocaine caused a little less pain after the shot, but the difference was small.

Another finding was that 2% lidocaine with epinephrine worked better. It was better than 3% prilocaine with felypressin. It also worked better than 4% prilocaine alone. This was for dental surgery and gum treatment.

Most shots started working quickly. This means they numbed the area fast enough. How long the shots lasted was different for each one. This makes them good for different dental jobs. Bad effects from the shots were rare. We could not tell how people felt about their dental visits. This was because the studies did not have enough of that kind of information.

All the numbing shots we looked at seemed to work well and were safe. There was not a big difference between them. The facts from the studies were sometimes strong and sometimes weak. Some studies were small. Some did not clearly say how they did their work. Some information was hard to combine. More studies are needed. We need to know for sure which numbing shot is best and safest.","Injectable local anaesthetic agents for preventing pain in participants requiring dental treatment

10.1002-14651858.CD008215.pub3,"Is there an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with drugs for subfertility?
Background Drugs to stimulate ovulation have been used to treat subfertility since the early 1960s. There is uncertainty about the safety of these drugs and their potential risk of causing cancer. Moreover, it has already been shown that infertility itself increases the risk of ovarian cancer. 
The aim of the review We aimed with this updated systematic review to summarise current published research on the risk of ovarian cancer in subfertile women treated with fertility drugs compared to the general population and to subfertile women not treated with fertility drugs. 
What are the main findings? Overall, based on 37 studies, which included a total of 4,684,724 women, we did not find enough strong evidence suggesting a potentially higher risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with fertility drugs. 
A cumulative analysis of 12 case‐control studies from the USA revealed increased risk of ovarian cancer in women using fertility drugs, and this risk was higher in nulliparous women (women who have not given birth) when compared to multiparous women (women who have given birth to more than one child). One of the 37 included studies reported a two‐fold increase in development of serous borderline ovarian tumour in women after more than four cycles of progesterone; however the number of cases included in this group was very small. One cohort study also suggested an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumour in infertile women treated with clomiphene citrate when compared to infertile women who did not undergo treatment to conceive. 
Quality of the evidence Studies showing an increase in the risk of ovarian cancer were of low methodological quality, with short follow‐up periods and with lack of adjustment for important confounding factors; therefore the results are too unreliable. However, compared with older studies, recent studies have tended to report both the dose and the number of cycles of infertility drugs and have included more contemporary drug regimens; this has made the final results more reliable. 
What are the conclusions? Infertility has been found to be an important risk factor for ovarian cancer. However, the association between infertility drugs and ovarian cancer needs to be addressed with consideration of other factors such as age, body mass index, parity, genetic factors (i.e. family history for ovarian cancer), and aetiology of the infertility, along with longer follow‐up times. 
","## Plain Title
Fertility Drugs and Ovarian Cancer: What We Know

## Rationale
Many women want to have children. Some women have trouble getting pregnant. This is called subfertility or infertility. Doctors can give these women special drugs. These drugs help them get pregnant. They have been used since the 1960s.

Some people worry these drugs might cause cancer. Specifically, they worry about ovarian cancer. The ovaries are where eggs are made. Infertility itself can make ovarian cancer more likely. So, it is hard to tell what causes the risk.

This study looked at past research. We wanted to see if fertility drugs raise the risk of ovarian cancer. We compared women who used the drugs to those who did not. We also compared them to women who get pregnant easily.

## Trial Design
This study did not test new drugs. It looked at many old studies. We pulled together facts from these past studies. This type of study is called a ""systematic review.""

We looked at 37 different studies. These studies included many women. In total, over 4.6 million women were part of this review. The women were of different ages. They all had trouble getting pregnant. Some used fertility drugs and some did not.

The studies varied in how long they followed women. Some studies only watched women for a short time. Other studies watched them for many years. We looked at how reliable each study was.

## Results
We looked at all the facts. We did not find strong proof. We could not say that fertility drugs cause more ovarian cancer. The big picture did not show a clear risk.

But, a few studies showed something different. Twelve studies from the USA found a link. These studies said women using fertility drugs had a higher risk. This risk was higher for women who had never given birth.

One study looked at a certain type of growth. This growth is called a serous borderline ovarian tumor. It is not full-blown cancer. This study showed a two-fold rise in risk. This was for women who used a drug for more than four cycles. But very few women were in this group.

Another study found a higher risk for borderline tumors. This was for infertile women using clomiphene citrate. This drug helps release eggs. They had a higher risk than infertile women not using this drug.

The studies that showed a higher risk were not always strong. They often did not follow women long enough. They also did not look at other things that could cause cancer. This made their results less sure.

Newer studies are getting better. They write down how much drug was used. They also record how many cycles were taken. This makes their facts more trustworthy.

We learned that just being infertile can raise the risk of ovarian cancer. Doctors need to think about many things. Age, weight, if a woman has had children, and family history all matter. The cause of infertility also plays a role. We need studies that watch women for a long time.","Is there an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with drugs for subfertility?
Background Drugs to stimulate ovulation have been used to treat subfertility since the early 1960s. There is uncertainty about the safety of these drugs and their potential risk of causing cancer. Moreover, it has already been shown that infertility itself increases the risk of ovarian cancer. 
The aim of the review We aimed with this updated systematic review to summarise current published research on the risk of ovarian cancer in subfertile women treated with fertility drugs compared to the general population and to subfertile women not treated with fertility drugs. 
What are the main findings? Overall, based on 37 studies, which included a total of 4,684,724 women, we did not find enough strong evidence suggesting a potentially higher risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with fertility drugs. 
A cumulative analysis of 12 case‐control studies from the USA revealed increased risk of ovarian cancer in women using fertility drugs, and this risk was higher in nulliparous women (women who have not given birth) when compared to multiparous women (women who have given birth to more than one child). One of the 37 included studies reported a two‐fold increase in development of serous borderline ovarian tumour in women after more than four cycles of progesterone; however the number of cases included in this group was very small. One cohort study also suggested an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumour in infertile women treated with clomiphene citrate when compared to infertile women who did not undergo treatment to conceive. 
Quality of the evidence Studies showing an increase in the risk of ovarian cancer were of low methodological quality, with short follow‐up periods and with lack of adjustment for important confounding factors; therefore the results are too unreliable. However, compared with older studies, recent studies have tended to report both the dose and the number of cycles of infertility drugs and have included more contemporary drug regimens; this has made the final results more reliable. 
What are the conclusions? Infertility has been found to be an important risk factor for ovarian cancer. However, the association between infertility drugs and ovarian cancer needs to be addressed with consideration of other factors such as age, body mass index, parity, genetic factors (i.e. family history for ovarian cancer), and aetiology of the infertility, along with longer follow‐up times.

10.1002-14651858.CD013846.pub2,"Background
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors (COX‐I) may prevent PDA‐related complications. Controversy exists on which COX‐I drug is the most effective and has the best safety profile in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic COX‐I drugs and 'no COXI prophylaxis' in preterm infants using a Bayesian network meta‐analysis (NMA). 
Search methods
Searches of Cochrane CENTRAL via Wiley, OVID MEDLINE and Embase via Elsevier were conducted on 9 December 2021. We conducted independent searches of clinical trial registries and conference abstracts; and scanned the reference lists of included trials and related systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled preterm or low birth weight infants within the first 72 hours of birth without a prior clinical or echocardiographic diagnosis of PDA and compared prophylactic administration of indomethacin or ibuprofen or acetaminophen versus each other, placebo or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. We used the GRADE NMA approach to assess the certainty of evidence derived from the NMA for the following outcomes: severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), mortality, surgical or interventional PDA closure, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), gastrointestinal perforation, chronic lung disease (CLD) and cerebral palsy (CP). 
Main results
We included 28 RCTs (3999 preterm infants). Nineteen RCTs (n = 2877) compared prophylactic indomethacin versus placebo/no treatment, 7 RCTs (n = 914) compared prophylactic ibuprofen versus placebo/no treatment and 2 RCTs (n = 208) compared prophylactic acetaminophen versus placebo/no treatment. Nine RCTs were judged to have high risk of bias in one or more domains.We identified two ongoing trials on prophylactic acetaminophen. 
Bayesian random‐effects NMA demonstrated that prophylactic indomethacin probably led to a small reduction in severe IVH (network RR 0.66, 95% Credible Intervals [CrI] 0.49 to 0.87; absolute risk difference [ARD] 43 fewer [95% CrI, 65 fewer to 16 fewer] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; moderate‐certainty), a moderate reduction in mortality (network RR 0.85, 95% CrI 0.64 to 1.1; ARD 24 fewer [95% CrI, 58 fewer to 16 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐4; moderate‐certainty) and surgical PDA closure (network RR 0.40, 95% CrI 0.14 to 0.66; ARD 52 fewer [95% CrI, 75 fewer to 30 fewer] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐2; moderate‐certainty) compared to placebo. Prophylactic indomethacin resulted in trivial difference in NEC (network RR 0.76, 95% CrI 0.35 to 1.2; ARD 16 fewer [95% CrI, 42 fewer to 13 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; high‐certainty), gastrointestinal perforation (network RR 0.92, 95% CrI 0.11 to 3.9; ARD 4 fewer [95% CrI, 42 fewer to 137 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐3; moderate‐certainty) or CP (network RR 0.97, 95% CrI 0.44 to 2.1; ARD 3 fewer [95% CrI, 62 fewer to 121 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; low‐certainty) and may result in a small increase in CLD (network RR 1.10, 95% CrI 0.93 to 1.3; ARD 36 more [95% CrI, 25 fewer to 108 more] per 1000; median rank 3, 95% CrI 1‐3; low‐certainty). 
Prophylactic ibuprofen probably led to a small reduction in severe IVH (network RR 0.69, 95% CrI 0.41 to 1.14; ARD 39 fewer [95% CrI, 75 fewer to 18 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐4; moderate‐certainty) and moderate reduction in surgical PDA closure (network RR 0.24, 95% CrI 0.06 to 0.64; ARD 66 fewer [95% CrI, from 82 fewer to 31 fewer] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐2; moderate‐certainty) compared to placebo. Prophylactic ibuprofen may result in moderate reduction in mortality (network RR 0.83, 95% CrI 0.57 to 1.2; ARD 27 fewer [95% CrI, from 69 fewer to 32 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐4; low‐certainty) and leads to trivial difference in NEC (network RR 0.73, 95% CrI 0.31 to 1.4; ARD 18 fewer [95% CrI, from 45 fewer to 26 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐3; high‐certainty), or CLD (network RR 1.00, 95% CrI 0.83 to 1.3; ARD 0 fewer [95% CrI, from 61 fewer to 108 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; low‐certainty). The evidence is very uncertain on effect of ibuprofen on gastrointestinal perforation (network RR 2.6, 95% CrI 0.42 to 20.0; ARD 76 more [95% CrI, from 27 fewer to 897 more] per 1000; median rank 3, 95% CrI 1‐3; very low‐certainty). 
The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of prophylactic acetaminophen on severe IVH (network RR 1.17, 95% CrI 0.04 to 55.2; ARD 22 more [95% CrI, from 122 fewer to 1000 more] per 1000; median rank 4, 95% CrI 1‐4; very low‐certainty), mortality (network RR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.16 to 1.4; ARD 82 fewer [95% CrI, from 135 fewer to 64 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐4; very low‐certainty), or CP (network RR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.01 to 6.3; ARD 70 fewer [95% CrI, from 109 fewer to 583 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐3; very low‐certainty). 
In summary, based on ranking statistics, both indomethacin and ibuprofen were equally effective (median ranks 2 respectively) in reducing severe IVH and mortality. Ibuprofen (median rank 1) was more effective than indomethacin in reducing surgical PDA ligation (median rank 2). However, no statistically‐significant differences were observed between the COX‐I drugs for any of the relevant outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Prophylactic indomethacin probably results in a small reduction in severe IVH and moderate reduction in mortality and surgical PDA closure (moderate‐certainty), may result in a small increase in CLD (low‐certainty) and results in trivial differences in NEC (high‐certainty), gastrointestinal perforation (moderate‐certainty) and cerebral palsy (low‐certainty). Prophylactic ibuprofen probably results in a small reduction in severe IVH and moderate reduction in surgical PDA closure (moderate‐certainty), may result in a moderate reduction in mortality (low‐certainty) and trivial differences in CLD (low‐certainty) and NEC (high‐certainty). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acetaminophen on any of the clinically‐relevant outcomes. 
","## Plain Title
Medicines to help very small babies with a heart problem.

## Rationale
Some babies are born too early. We call them preterm infants. These babies can have a heart problem. This problem is called patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA.

PDA means a small blood vessel near the heart stays open. This vessel should close soon after birth. If it stays open, it can cause serious problems for the baby. It can even lead to death.

Doctors use medicines to help close this vessel. These medicines are called COX-I drugs. They stop the vessel from staying open. But doctors are not sure which medicine works best. They also want to know which one is safest.

This study looked at different COX-I drugs. We wanted to see if they help prevent problems. We also wanted to see how safe they are for these tiny babies.

## Trial Design
This study looked at many past studies. We gathered information from 28 studies. These studies included almost 4000 preterm babies.

All babies in these studies were born early. They weighed very little. They got medicine within 3 days of birth. They did not have a PDA diagnosis yet.

Some babies got indomethacin. Some got ibuprofen. Some got acetaminophen. Other babies got a sugar pill or no treatment. We compared these groups.

We checked for serious problems. These included brain bleeds, death, and needing surgery. We also looked at gut problems and lung problems. This study combined all the data to find the best medicine.

## Results
We found that indomethacin can help. It may lower the risk of severe brain bleeds. This means about 43 fewer babies out of 1000 would have this problem. It also helped reduce the chance of death. About 24 fewer babies out of 1000 might die. And it lowered the need for PDA surgery. About 52 fewer babies out of 1000 needed surgery.

Indomethacin did not make gut problems worse. It also had little effect on other issues. But it might cause a small rise in long-term lung problems.

Ibuprofen also showed good results. It may reduce severe brain bleeds. This means about 39 fewer babies out of 1000. It also greatly lowered the need for PDA surgery. About 66 fewer babies out of 1000 needed surgery. Ibuprofen might also reduce death. About 27 fewer babies out of 1000 might die.

Ibuprofen did not seem to cause more gut or lung problems. But we need more research on gut tears.

We are not sure about acetaminophen. The results for this medicine were not clear. We need more studies to know if it helps.

In short, both indomethacin and ibuprofen are good choices. They both help prevent serious problems. Ibuprofen seemed better at stopping the need for surgery. But overall, both drugs worked well.","Prophylactic cyclo‐oxygenase inhibitor drugs to prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants 
 
Review question 
Among the available cyclo‐oxygenase inhibitor (COX‐I) drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen), which one is the safest and most effective in preventing death and poor outcomes in preterm infants when given prophylactically without the prior knowledge of the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) within the first 72 hours after birth? 
Background 
A PDA is a common complication in preterm or low‐birth weight infants. PDA is an open vascular channel between the lungs and the heart which usually closes shortly after birth. In preterm infants, the PDA frequently remains open and may contribute to life‐threatening complications. COX‐I drugs such as indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen may prevent a PDA and related poor outcomes. Controversy exists on which of the three COX‐I drugs, if any, improves clinical outcomes in preterm infants. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in preterm babies (born at less than 37 weeks into pregnancy) or low‐birthweight (weighing less than 2500 grams) infants where COX‐I drugs were given without the prior knowledge of the presence of a PDA, within the first 72 hours after birth. The included studies compared administration of indomethacin or ibuprofen or acetaminophen versus each other, placebo or no treatment.  
Key results 
This review of 28 clinical trials (3999 preterm infants) found that prophylactic indomethacin probably results in a small reduction in severe brain bleeding, a moderate reduction in death and need for PDA surgery, and may result in a small increase in chronic lung disease. Prophylactic indomethacin likely results in trivial differences in necrotizing enterocolitis, gastrointestinal perforation and cerebral palsy. Prophylactic ibuprofen probably results in a small reduction in severe brain bleeding and a moderate reduction in need for PDA surgery. Prophylactic ibuprofen may result in a moderate reduction in death and trivial differences in chronic lung disease and necrotizing enterocolitis. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acetaminophen on any of the clinically relevant outcomes.There are currently two ongoing trials on prophylactic use of acetaminophen. 
Certainty of the evidence 
According to GRADE (a method to score the certainty of the trials supporting each outcome), the certainty of the evidence varied from very low to high but was moderate for the most important outcomes of severe brain bleeding and death. 
How up to date is the search evidence 
The search is up to date as of 9 December 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013697.pub2,"Background
Posterior blepharitis is common and causes ocular surface and lid damage as well as discomfort. It affects 37% to 47% of all ophthalmology patients; its incidence increasing with age. It is a multifactorial disease associated with multiple other pathologies, such as rosacea, meibomianitis, and infections. Treatment usually focuses on reliefing the symptoms by using artificial tears, lid scrubs, and warm compresses. The condition may be notoriously difficult to manage adequately once it becomes chronic. One such management approach for chronic blepharitis is the use of oral antibiotics for both their antibacterial as well as anti‐inflammatory properties. There are currently no guidelines regarding the use of oral antibiotics, including antibiotic type, dosage, and treatment duration, for the treatment of chronic blepharitis. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of oral antibiotic use for people with chronic blepharitis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 29 August 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral antibiotics with placebo in adult participants with chronic blepharitis (including staphylococcal, seborrhoeic, or Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD)). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology and graded the certainty of the body of evidence for six outcomes using the GRADE classification. 
Main results
We included two studies with 220 participants (numbers of eyes unclear). One parallel‐group RCT comparing oral doxycycline (40 mg once a day) with placebo enrolled 70 participants with blepharitis and facial rosacea in the USA. Follow‐up duration was three months. One three‐arm RCT conducted in South Korea investigated the effect of high‐dose (200 mg twice a day) and low‐dose (20 mg twice a day) doxycycline versus placebo after one month of study medication. It enrolled 50 participants with chronic MGD in each study arm (i.e. 150 participants enrolled in total). 
The two studies did not evaluate the same outcome measurements, which precluded any meta‐analysis. The evidence for the effect of oral antibiotics on subjective improvement in symptoms was very uncertain. One study suggested that there was little to no effect of oral doxycycline on subjective symptoms based on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores ranging from 0 to 100 (higher score indicates worse condition) (mean difference (MD) 3.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) −4.61 to 11.71; n = 70) and bulbar conjunctival hyperemia ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) (MD −0.01, 95% CI −0.38 to 0.36; n = 70) at 12 weeks. The three‐arm RCT showed that oral doxycycline may slightly improve number of symptoms (MD −0.56, 95% CI −0.95 to −0.17; n = 93 (high‐dose doxycycline versus placebo); MD −0.48, 95% CI −0.86 to −0.10; n = 93 (low‐dose doxycycline versus placebo)) and proportion of participants with symptom improvement (risk ratio (RR) 6.13, 95% CI 2.61 to 14.42; n = 93 (high‐dose doxycycline versus placebo); RR 6.54, 95% CI 2.79 to 15.30; n = 93 (low‐dose doxycycline versus placebo)) at one month, but the evidence is very uncertain. We judged the certainty of evidence for subjective symptoms as very low. 
One study evaluated aqueous tear production by Schirmer's test (mm/5 min) (higher score indicates better condition) and tear film stability by measuring tear film break‐up time (TBUT) in seconds (higher score indicates better condition) at one month. We found very low certainty evidence that oral doxycycline may improve these clinical signs. The estimated MD in Schirmer's test score after one month of treatment was 4.09 mm (95% CI 2.38 to 5.80; n = 93) in the high‐dose doxycycline group versus the placebo group and 3.76 mm (95% CI 1.85 to 5.67; n = 93) in the low‐dose doxycycline group versus the placebo group. The estimated MD in TBUT after one month was 1.58 seconds (95% CI 0.57 to 2.59; n = 93) when comparing the high‐dose doxycycline group with the placebo group, and 1.70 seconds (95% CI 0.96 to 2.44; n = 93) when comparing the low‐dose doxycycline group with the placebo group. Although there was a noted improvement in these scores, their clinical importance remains uncertain. 
One study suggested that oral doxycycline may increase the incidence of serious side effects: 18 (39%) participants in the high‐dose doxycycline group, 8 (17%) in the low‐dose doxycycline group, and 3 (6%) out of 47 participants in the placebo group experienced serious side effects (RR 6.13, 95% CI 1.94 to 19.41; n = 93 (high‐dose doxycycline versus placebo); RR 2.72, 95% CI 0.77 to 9.64; n = 93 (low‐dose doxycycline versus placebo)). Additionally, one study reported that one case of migraine headache and five cases of headache were observed in the oral doxycycline group, and one case of non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma was observed in the placebo group. We judged the certainty of evidence for adverse events as very low. 
Authors' conclusions
There was insufficient evidence to draw any meaningful conclusions on the use of oral antibiotics for chronic blepharitis. Very low certainty evidence suggests that oral antibiotics may improve clinical signs, but may cause more adverse events. The evidence for the effect of oral antibiotics on subjective symptoms is very uncertain. Further trials are needed to provide high quality evidence on the use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of chronic blepharitis. 
","## Clear Look at Eye Lid Swelling

### Rationale

Your eyelids can get swollen and red. This is called posterior blepharitis. It is a common eye problem. It can make your eyes hurt or feel dry. It can make your vision blurry.

This problem affects many people. It often gets worse as people get older. Other health problems can make it worse. These include rosacea and dry eyes.

Doctors often give eye drops or ask people to clean their eyelids. But this problem can be hard to fix for good. It can become a long-term problem.

Some doctors give pills called antibiotics. These pills fight germs. They also help calm swelling. But doctors do not know the best way to use these pills. They do not know which pills to use or for how long.

This study looked at how these pills work. It wanted to see if they help people with swollen eyelids. It also checked for any bad effects.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. These studies tested antibiotics for swollen eyelids. These studies used a fair way to test the pills. Some people got the antibiotic pills. Other people got fake pills, called a placebo. This helps doctors see if the real pill works.

The studies included adults. These adults had long-term swollen eyelids. This means their eyelids were swollen for a long time. The studies did not say how long people were in the study.

Two studies were included. They had a total of 220 people. One study was in the USA. It gave people a pill called doxycycline. It gave this pill for three months. The other study was in South Korea. It gave people doxycycline for one month. Some people got a high dose. Some got a low dose.

### Results

The studies did not measure the same things. So, we could not combine all the results.

One study looked at how people felt. It asked if their symptoms got better. The study found that doxycycline may not help much. People's symptoms did not change a lot. Their eyes did not get much less red.

The other study also looked at symptoms. It found that doxycycline might help a little. People said they had fewer symptoms. More people felt better. This was true for both high and low doses. But we are not very sure about these results.

One study looked at how much tears people made. It also checked how long tears stayed on the eye. These are signs of eye health. Doxycycline might have made these signs better. People made more tears. Tears stayed on the eye longer. But we are not sure if this change is big enough to matter.

The study also looked for bad effects. More people who took doxycycline had serious side effects. This was especially true for the high dose. Many people had bad effects with the high dose. Fewer people had bad effects with the low dose. A few people who took the fake pill had bad effects too.

Some people had headaches with doxycycline. One person in the fake pill group got a serious illness. We are not very sure about these bad effects either.

Overall, we do not have enough clear proof. We cannot say for sure if antibiotics help swollen eyelids. They might help some signs of the problem. But they might also cause more bad effects. More studies are needed to find clear answers.","Treating long‐lasting blepharitis (swollen and itchy eyelids): how well do antibiotics (medicines that kill bacteria) work when taken by mouth (orally)? 
Key messages· We did not find enough evidence to show how well antibiotics taken by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
· One antibiotic tested may improve some clinical aspects (symptoms and course of the disease), but we are uncertain about its benefit in this respect, and it may also cause a higher number of unwanted effects. 
· More studies are needed to find out how well antibiotics taken by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What is blepharitis?Blepharitis is a common condition affecting the eyes. It causes swelling and redness on the edges of the eyelids, making them feel sore, and an itching or a gritty feeling in the eyes. The most common causes of blepharitis are infection by a type of bacteria that lives on the surface of the eye, or skin conditions such as dermatitis. 
How is blepharitis treated?Blepharitis is usually treated by regularly cleaning the eyelids, or using a cream or eye drops containing an antibiotic (a type of medicine that kills bacteria). If these do not work, then taking antibiotics by mouth (orally) is often tried. However, there are no guidelines about which type of antibiotic to give, what dose to use, or how long treatment should last. 
What did we want to find out?We wanted to find out how well antibiotics given by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that tested antibiotics given by mouth to treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What did we find?We found 2 studies in 220 adults with long‐lasting blepharitis. One study took place in the USA and lasted for three months; it tested the antibiotic doxycycline compared to placebo treatment (a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain any medicine but looks identical to the medicine being tested). The other study took place in South Korea and tested the effects of high or low doses of doxycycline compared to placebo treatment. 
One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company; the other study did not report a source of funding. The studies measured results of treatment in different ways, so it was not possible to combine the studies' results to analyse them together. 
What are the main results of our review?We are uncertain about the effects of doxycycline on symptoms such as itching, burning, and watery eyes, as evaluated by people taking part in the studies. 
One study measured changes in how much an affected eye watered (produced tears) before and after one month of treatment. High‐ and low‐dose doxycycline may improve the eye's ability to produce tears (evidence from 1 study with 93 people in each dose group). 
One study evaluated dryness of the eye by measuring the time it took for a dry spot to appear on the surface of the eye after blinking (the 'tear film break‐up time'). Taking doxycycline (high‐ and low‐dose) for one month may improve problems with dryness (evidence from 1 study with 93 people in each dose group). 
Taking doxycycline for one month may cause more unwanted effects than taking a placebo (evidence from 1 study in 139 people). The number of unwanted effects reported was higher in the high‐dose doxycycline group. 
No studies measured:
· how many bacteria were present in the eye before or after treatment;
· people's well‐being (quality of life); or
· the costs and benefits of the treatments tested.
What are the limitations of the evidence?We have very low confidence in the evidence because of limitations in the ways the studies were conducted, and because the results of the studies varied widely and were inconsistent. One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company, which could have affected the way the study was designed, conducted, and reported. Further research is likely to change and increase our confidence in the results. 
How up‐to‐date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 29 August 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013438,"Background
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of beta‐blockers to influence perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus routine prescription of these drugs in an unselected population remains a controversial issue. A previous version of this review assessing the effectiveness of perioperative beta‐blockers in cardiac and non‐cardiac surgery was last published in 2018. The previous review has now been split into two reviews according to type of surgery. This is an update, and assesses the evidence in non‐cardiac surgery only. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of perioperatively administered beta‐blockers for the prevention of surgery‐related mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing non‐cardiac surgery. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis Previews and Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science on 28 June 2019. We searched clinical trials registers and grey literature, and conducted backward‐ and forward‐citation searching of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs and quasi‐randomized studies comparing beta‐blockers with a control (placebo or standard care) administered during the perioperative period to adults undergoing non‐cardiac surgery. If studies included surgery with different types of anaesthesia, we included them if 70% participants, or at least 100 participants, received general anaesthesia. We excluded studies in which all participants in the standard care control group were given a pharmacological agent that was not given to participants in the intervention group, studies in which all participants in the control group were given a beta‐blocker, and studies in which beta‐blockers were given with an additional agent (e.g. magnesium). We excluded studies that did not measure or report review outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. 
Main results
We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 participants; we found no quasi‐randomized studies. All participants were undergoing non‐cardiac surgery, and types of surgery ranged from low to high risk. Types of beta‐blockers were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. In nine studies, beta‐blockers were titrated according to heart rate or blood pressure. Duration of administration varied between studies, as did the time at which drugs were administered; in most studies, it was intraoperatively, but in 18 studies it was before surgery, in six postoperatively, one multi‐arm study included groups of different timings, and one study did not report timing of drug administration. Overall, we found that more than half of the studies did not sufficiently report methods used for randomization. All studies in which the control was standard care were at high risk of performance bias because of the open‐label study design. Only two studies were prospectively registered with clinical trials registers, which limited the assessment of reporting bias. In six studies, participants in the control group were given beta‐blockers as rescue therapy during the study period. 
The evidence for all‐cause mortality at 30 days was uncertain; based on the risk of death in the control group of 25 per 1000, the effect with beta‐blockers was between two fewer and 13 more per 1000 (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.54; 16 studies, 11,446 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Beta‐blockers may reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction by 13 fewer incidences per 1000 (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.87; 12 studies, 10,520 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found no evidence of a difference in cerebrovascular events (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.81; 6 studies, 9460 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or in ventricular arrhythmias (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.47; 5 studies, 476 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation or flutter by 26 fewer incidences per 1000 (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; 9 studies, 9080 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, beta‐blockers may increase bradycardia by 55 more incidences per 1000 (RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.74 to 3.56; 49 studies, 12,239 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and hypotension by 44 more per 1000 (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.51; 49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
We downgraded the certainty of the evidence owing to study limitations; some studies had high risks of bias, and the effects were sometimes altered when we excluded studies with a standard care control group (including only placebo‐controlled trials showed an increase in early mortality and cerebrovascular events with beta‐blockers). We also downgraded for inconsistency; one large, well‐conducted, international study found a reduction in myocardial infarction, and an increase in cerebrovascular events and all‐cause mortality, when beta‐blockers were used, but other studies showed no evidence of a difference. We could not explain the reason for the inconsistency in the evidence for ventricular arrhythmias, and we also downgraded this outcome for imprecision because we found few studies with few participants. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence for early all‐cause mortality with perioperative beta‐blockers was uncertain. We found no evidence of a difference in cerebrovascular events or ventricular arrhythmias, and the certainty of the evidence for these outcomes was low and very low. We found low‐certainty evidence that beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarctions. However, beta‐blockers may increase bradycardia (low‐certainty evidence) and probably increase hypotension (moderate‐certainty evidence). Further evidence from large placebo‐controlled trials is likely to increase the certainty of these findings, and we recommend the assessment of impact on quality of life. We found 18 studies awaiting classification; inclusion of these studies in future updates may also increase the certainty of the evidence. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Do Beta-Blockers Help Patients Having Surgery?

### Rationale

When you have surgery, your heart can sometimes have problems. These problems can be serious. They can even cause death. Doctors have used a type of medicine called beta-blockers. They thought these medicines might help protect the heart during and after surgery.

But studies have shown different results. Some studies said beta-blockers helped. Other studies said they did not. This made it hard for doctors to know if they should give these drugs to all patients.

This study looked at past research. It wanted to see if beta-blockers truly help. It focused on people having surgery *not* on their heart. We wanted to see if these drugs lower the risk of heart problems or death.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. One group got the beta-blocker. The other group got a dummy pill (placebo) or usual care.

We looked for studies that included adults having surgery not on their heart. We wanted to see if beta-blockers kept them safer. We included studies where patients received a general anesthetic.

We looked at how long people took the medicine. We also looked at when they took it. Some took it before surgery. Some took it during surgery. Some took it after surgery. We gathered all this information to get a clear picture.

### Results

We looked at 83 studies. These studies included almost 15,000 people. All these people had surgery that was not on their heart.

We found that beta-blockers **might reduce** the risk of two heart problems:
*   **Heart attacks:** About 13 fewer heart attacks for every 1000 people.
*   **Irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation):** About 26 fewer cases for every 1000 people.

However, beta-blockers also **might increase** the risk of some side effects:
*   **Slow heart rate (bradycardia):** About 55 more cases for every 1000 people.
*   **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** About 44 more cases for every 1000 people.

We were not sure if beta-blockers changed the risk of dying within 30 days. We also did not find clear proof that they changed the risk of stroke or other heart rhythm problems.

The findings from these studies were sometimes unclear. Some studies had problems in how they were done. This makes us less certain about the results. More research is needed to be more sure. Doctors need to weigh the possible good and bad effects of these drugs. They should think about each patient's needs.","Beta‐blockers to prevent death or serious events after surgery not involving the heart
This review assessed evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on whether beta‐blockers reduce deaths or other serious events when given to people undergoing surgery other than heart surgery. The findings for heart surgery are covered in another review. 
Background 
Surgery increases stress in the body, which responds by releasing the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. Stress from surgery can lead to death or other serious events such as heart attacks, stroke, or an irregular heartbeat. For surgery that does not involve the heart, an estimated 8% of people may have injury to their heart around the time of surgery. Beta‐blockers are drugs that block the action of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart. Beta‐blockers can slow down the heart, and reduce blood pressure, and this may reduce the risk of serious events. However, beta‐blockers may lead to a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure which could increase the risk of death or a stroke. Prevention of early complications after surgery is important, but using beta‐blockers to prevent these complications is controversial. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 28 June 2019. We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 adults who were undergoing different types of surgery other than heart surgery. Eighteen studies are awaiting classification (because we did not have enough details to assess them), and three studies are ongoing. The types of beta‐blockers used in the studies were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. Studies compared these beta‐blockers with either a placebo (disguised to look like a beta‐blocker but containing no medicine) or with standard care. 
Key results 
Beta‐blockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days of surgery (16 studies, 11,446 participants; low‐certainty evidence), have a stroke (6 studies, 9460 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or experience ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat rhythms, starting in the main chambers of the heart, that are potentially life‐threatening and may need immediate medical treatment; 5 studies, 476 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We found that beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat, starting in the atrial chambers of the heart, that increases the risk of stroke if untreated; 9 studies, 9080 participants; low certainty‐evidence), and the number of people who have a heart attack (12 studies, 10,520 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, taking beta‐blockers may increase the number of people who experience a very low heart rate (49 studies, 12,239 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or very low blood pressure (49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), around the time of surgery. 
In a few studies, we also found little or no difference in the number of people who died after 30 days, who died because of a heart problem, or had heart failure. We found no evidence of whether beta‐blockers alter the length of time in hospital. 
No studies assessed whether people who were given beta‐blockers had a better quality of life after heart surgery. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence in this review was limited by including some studies that were at high risk of bias, and we noticed that some of our findings were different if we only included placebo‐controlled studies or studies that reported how participants were randomized. We also found one large, well‐conducted, international study that had different findings to the smaller studies. It showed a reduction in heart attacks and an increase in stroke and all‐cause mortality when beta‐blockers were used, whilst the other studies did not show a clear effect. We were also less certain of the findings for outcomes with few studies, such as for ventricular arrhythmias. 
Conclusion 
Although beta‐blockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days, have a stroke, or have ventricular arrhythmias, they may reduce atrial fibrillation and heart attacks. Taking beta‐blockers may increase the number of people with a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure around the time of surgery. Further evidence from large, placebo‐controlled trials is likely to increase the certainty of these findings, and we recommend the assessment of impact on quality of life.

10.1002-14651858.CD013320.pub2,"Background
High intake of added sugar have been suggested to impact the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Knowledge on the subject can contribute to preventing CVD. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of a high versus low‐added sugar consumption for primary prevention of CVD in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S) on 2 July 2021. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal for ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was performed together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no restriction on language of publication or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials, that compared different levels of added sugar intake. Exclusion criteria were: participants aged below 18 years; diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2); and previous CVD. Primary outcomes were incident cardiovascular events (coronary, carotid, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease) and all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL‐cholesterol, HDL‐cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and adverse events (gastrointestinal symptoms and impaired dental health). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 21 RCTs (1110 participants completing the interventions) examining the effects of different levels of added sugar intake with a mean duration of 14 weeks. The study participants were generally described as healthy and the mean age ranged from 22 to 57 years. 
No studies reported on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality. There was minimal effect of low intake of added sugar on total cholesterol levels (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21; I² = 0%; 16 studies; 763 participants; low certainty of evidence) and triglycerides (MD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17; I² = 3%; 14 studies; 725 participants) but no evidence of effect on LDL‐cholesterol and HDL‐cholesterol. There was minimal effect on diastolic blood pressure (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.37; I² = 0%; 13 studies; 873 participants) and on systolic blood pressure (MD 1.44, 95% 0.08 to 2.80; I² = 27%, 14 studies; 873 participants; low certainty of evidence), but no evidence of effect on fasting plasma glucose. 
Only one study reported on dental health, with no events. No other trials reported adverse events (impaired dental health or gastrointestinal symptoms). 
All results were judged as low‐quality evidence according to GRADE. The risk of bias was generally unclear, five studies were classified at an overall low risk of bias (low risk in at least four domains, not including other bias). 
Authors' conclusions
No trials investigating the effect of added sugar on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality were identified in our searches. Evidence is uncertain whether low intake of added sugar has an effect on risk factors for CVD; the effect was small and the clinical relevance is, therefore, uncertain. Practical ways to achieve reductions in dietary added sugar includes following current dietary recommendations. 
Future trials should have longer follow‐up time and report on all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular events in order to clarify the effect of added sugar on these outcomes. Future trials should also aim for more direct interventions and preferably be more independent of industry funding.

How Does Eating Less Sugar Affect Your Heart Health?

### Rationale
Heart disease is a major problem. It can cause serious health issues. Things like heart attacks or strokes can happen. Eating a lot of added sugar might make heart disease more likely. We wanted to know more about this.

This study looked at how much sugar people eat. It compared eating a lot of sugar to eating less sugar. We wanted to see if eating less sugar could stop heart problems. This study is important. It helps us learn how food affects our hearts.

### Trial Design
This study looked at other studies. These studies were called randomized controlled trials. These are good studies. They randomly put people into groups. One group ate a lot of sugar. The other group ate less sugar.

People in these studies were generally healthy. They were between 22 and 57 years old. They did not have diabetes. They also did not have heart disease already. Each study lasted about 14 weeks.

We looked at many things. We checked blood pressure. We also checked cholesterol and other fats in the blood. We looked for any bad effects too.

### Results
We found 21 studies. These studies had 1,110 people in them. No study reported on heart attacks or death. This means we do not know if sugar affects these directly.

Eating less sugar had a small effect. It slightly lowered total cholesterol. It also slightly lowered some blood fats called triglycerides. But the effect was very small. We are not sure if this small change helps your health a lot. Eating less sugar also slightly lowered blood pressure. But again, the effect was small. It did not change blood sugar levels.

Only one study looked at teeth health. It did not find any problems. Other studies did not report bad effects.

The findings from these studies are not very strong. We need more research. Future studies should follow people for longer. They should also look at heart attacks and death. For now, it is a good idea to follow advice about eating less sugar. This can help keep your heart healthy.","Low levels of sugar to prevent cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels and the number one cause of death worldwide. It is important to detect modifiable risk factors and find strategies to prevent CVD. There are several established modifiable risk factors for developing CVD, one of them being eating an unhealthy diet rich in sugar. Sugar can be divided in two categories; sugars naturally occurring in food and sugars that are added to food. A high level of added sugar intake is suggested to cause weight gain and affect blood lipids, increasing the risk of CVD. This review assessed different levels of added sugars in the diet and the effect on cardiovascular events (e.g. heart attack or stroke), death, and CVD risk factors in healthy adults. 
Study characteristics 
Databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials in which participants are randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control treatment) were searched. The trials that were included compared different levels of added sugar intake and its effect on risk factors for CVD in healthy adults. People with previous CVD or diabetes were not included in the review. 
Key results 
Twenty‐one trials were found with 1110 participants. None of the trials looked at cardiovascular events or death. The trials reported on blood pressure, blood lipid levels and blood sugar levels. The review found that low levels of added sugar intake led to a small reduction in blood pressure and blood lipid levels, but no effect was seen on blood sugar. The evidence is current to July 2021. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies included in the review provide low‐quality evidence that low levels of added sugar in the diet indirectly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. More long‐term studies of high quality assessing effects of different levels of sugar on CVD risk factors, cardiovascular events and death are needed.

Review question 
Are protocols useful for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit?  Background 
Mechanical ventilation is used to help newborns to breath when they are too sick or born too premature to breath on their own. However, mechanical ventilation is not without risk, and can cause (permanent) damage to the lungs. For example, the pressure needed to fill the lungs with air may destroy the very fragile air sacs, and result in scaring of the lungs. For this reason, it is important to recognize when a newborn is mature and strong enough to start breathing for himself/herself, and to reduce (wean) the ventilator support. There is, unfortunately, no current agreement on the best way to wean newborns off the ventilator. Researchers have studied the usefulness of standardized protocols to guide the process of weaning off the ventilator in adults and children. In adults, 17 studies of weaning protocols have shown benefit in helping the doctors and nurses wean adults off the ventilator in a safe and timely manner. In children, three studies of weaning protocols have shown they are beneficial in reducing time on the ventilator, but the studies were too few to show harms. As yet, we do not know if weaning protocols in neonates provide benefits or harms. However, these standardized protocols have supplied us with firm evidence for their usefulness in weaning from mechanical ventilation in the care of children.  Study characteristics

## Plain Title
Helping Tiny Babies Breathe Better: A Look at How We Take Them Off Breathing Machines

## Rationale
Sometimes, tiny babies are born too early or are too sick to breathe on their own. When this happens, doctors use a machine called a ""ventilator"" to help them breathe. This machine pushes air into their lungs.

But using this breathing machine can be risky. It can hurt a baby's tiny lungs. The air pressure can damage the small air sacs in the lungs. This can cause scars.

So, it's very important to know when a baby is strong enough to breathe by themselves. Then, doctors can slowly take the baby off the breathing machine. This process is called ""weaning.""

Right now, doctors don't agree on the best way to wean newborn babies off these machines.

Researchers have looked at set plans, called ""protocols,"" for weaning older children and adults off breathing machines. For adults, these plans helped doctors and nurses take them off the machines safely and faster. For children, these plans also helped reduce the time they spent on the machines.

These plans seem helpful for older patients. But we don't know yet if they help or harm newborn babies. We need to find out if these plans can help tiny babies too.

## Trial Design
This study was a review. This means we looked at many past studies. We wanted to find studies about using set plans, or protocols, to take newborn babies off breathing machines.

We looked for studies that focused on babies. These babies were very young. They were in the hospital's special care unit for newborns. This unit is called the neonatal intensive care unit.

We wanted to see if these plans helped babies breathe on their own sooner. We also wanted to see if these plans caused any problems for the babies.

## Results
We looked for studies about using these special plans for newborn babies. We found a problem. We did not find any studies that looked only at babies under 28 days old.

We found two studies that included some newborn babies. But we could not get the specific information for just the newborn babies from these studies. The studies mixed the newborn data with data from older children.

So, at this time, we have no clear proof. We don't know if using these special plans helps newborn babies more than not using them. We need more studies to find out if these plans are good for tiny babies.","The usefulness of protocols for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit

10.1002-14651858.CD013247.pub2,"Background
Ocrelizumab is a humanised anti‐CD20 monoclonal antibody developed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017 for using in adults with relapsing‐remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Ocrelizumab is the only disease‐modifying therapy (DMT) approved for PPMS. In November 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) also approved ocrelizumab as the first drug for people with early PPMS. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the benefits, harms, and tolerability of ocrelizumab in people with MS. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits, harms, and tolerability of ocrelizumab in people with RRMS and PPMS. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and two trials registers on 8 October 2021. We screened reference lists, contacted experts, and contacted the main authors of studies. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults diagnosed with RRMS or PPMS according to the McDonald criteria, comparing ocrelizumab alone or associated with other medications, at the approved dose of 600 mg every 24 weeks for any duration, versus placebo or any other active drug therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
Four RCTs met our selection criteria. The overall population included 2551 participants; 1370 treated with ocrelizumab 600 mg and 1181 controls. Among the controls, 298 participants received placebo and 883 received interferon beta‐1a. The treatment duration was 24 weeks in one study, 96 weeks in two studies, and at least 120 weeks in one study. One study was at high risk of allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel; all four studies were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. 
For RRMS, compared with interferon beta‐1a, ocrelizumab was associated with: 1. lower relapse rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.73; 2 studies, 1656 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); 2. a lower number of participants with disability progression (hazard ratio (HR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.84; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 3. little to no difference in the number of participants with any adverse event (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; 2 studies, 1651 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); 4. little to no difference in the number of participants with any serious adverse event (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.11; 2 studies, 1651 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 5. a lower number of participants experiencing treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.91; 2 studies, 1651 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 6. a lower number of participants with gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.35; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 7. a lower number of participants with new or enlarging T2‐hyperintense lesions on MRI (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.69; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low‐certainty evidence) at 96 weeks. 
For PPMS, compared with placebo, ocrelizumab was associated with: 1. a lower number of participants with disability progression (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98; 1 study, 731 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 2. a higher number of participants with any adverse events (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.11; 1 study, 725 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); 3. little to no difference in the number of participants with any serious adverse event (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.23; 1 study, 725 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 4. little to no difference in the number of participants experiencing treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.75; 1 study, 725 participants; low‐certainty evidence) for at least 120 weeks. There were no data for number of participants with gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions on MRI and number of participants with new or enlarging T2‐hyperintense lesions on MRI. 
Authors' conclusions
For people with RRMS, ocrelizumab probably results in a large reduction in relapse rate and little to no difference in adverse events when compared with interferon beta‐1a at 96 weeks (moderate‐certainty evidence). Ocrelizumab may result in a large reduction in disability progression, treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events, number of participants with gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions on MRI, and number of participants with new or enlarging T2‐hyperintense lesions on MRI, and may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events (low‐certainty evidence). 
For people with PPMS, ocrelizumab probably results in a higher rate of adverse events when compared with placebo for at least 120 weeks (moderate‐certainty evidence). Ocrelizumab may result in a reduction in disability progression and little to no difference in serious adverse events and treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (low‐certainty evidence). 
Ocrelizumab was well tolerated clinically; the most common adverse events were infusion‐related reactions and nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract and upper respiratory tract infections.

## Plain Title
Study of a New Drug for Multiple Sclerosis: Benefits and Risks

## Rationale
Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a disease that affects your brain and spinal cord. It can make it hard to move, see, and think clearly. MS can get worse over time. This makes daily life hard for many patients.

Ocrelizumab is a new drug. It may help people with MS. It works by targeting certain cells in the body. These cells play a part in MS. This drug is approved in the US and Europe. It is the only drug for a type of MS called primary progressive MS.

This study looked at how well ocrelizumab works. We also looked at its side effects. This helps doctors and patients make good choices about treatment.

## Trial Design
How is this study designed?

We looked at past studies. These studies were called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, people get either the new drug or another treatment. The choice is made by chance. This helps us see if the new drug really works.

The studies included adults with MS. Some had relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Others had primary progressive MS (PPMS). All patients got ocrelizumab. They received 600 mg every 24 weeks. This is the normal dose.

Some patients got a sugar pill (placebo). Other patients got a different MS drug. We looked at how they did. The studies lasted from 24 weeks to over 120 weeks. This helped us see long-term effects.

We looked at 4 studies in total. There were 2551 patients. 1370 patients got ocrelizumab. 1181 patients got other treatments. We checked how many times their MS got worse. We also checked for side effects.

## Results
What were the main results of the study?

For people with relapsing-remitting MS:
Ocrelizumab lowered how often MS attacks happened. This was compared to another drug. Patients had fewer attacks.
It also slowed down MS getting worse. Patients had less new damage to their brain. This was seen on MRI scans.
Side effects were about the same. People taking ocrelizumab did not have more serious side effects. Fewer people stopped treatment due to side effects.

For people with primary progressive MS:
Ocrelizumab slowed down MS getting worse. This was compared to a sugar pill.
People taking ocrelizumab had more minor side effects. But serious side effects were about the same. Very few people stopped treatment due to side effects.

Overall, ocrelizumab seems to help. It can lower MS attacks and slow down the disease. The drug was generally safe. Common side effects included reactions during the infusion. Also, common colds and bladder infections.

This study shows that ocrelizumab is a good option. It offers a new choice for people with MS.","What are the benefits and risks of ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis?
Key messages 
– Ocrelizumab is a recently approved medicine to treat people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In relapsing‐remitting MS (where people experience flare‐ups of symptoms), ocrelizumab probably substantially reduces flare‐ups, may substantially reduce worsening of symptoms, and probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects compared with interferon beta‐1a (a standard treatment for MS), 96 weeks after treatment starts. 
– Compared to placebo (a dummy medicine) after 120 weeks of treatment for primary progressive MS (where people's symptoms worsen gradually), ocrelizumab may reduce worsening of symptoms. Ocrelizumab probably increases unwanted effects but makes little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects. 
– We need more, better‐designed studies to test the effectiveness of ocrelizumab and measure unwanted effects.  
What is multiple sclerosis? 
MS is a condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the nerves in the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system). This damage prevents messages travelling from the central nervous system to other parts of the body. It causes a range of potential symptoms from pins and needles to difficulties with balance and walking.  
There are several types of MS. In relapsing‐remitting MS, people have 'flare‐ups' of disease followed by periods of recovery. In primary progressive MS, people's symptoms gradually worsen over time.  
What is ocrelizumab? 
Ocrelizumab is a medicine that has been recently approved to treat relapsing‐remitting MS and primary progressive MS. It is a disease‐modifying therapy, which is a type of medicine that treats the underlying symptoms of MS. Ocrelizumab targets white blood cells in the body's immune system. It sticks to a type of these cells called B cells, and stops them attacking the central nervous system. This prevents inflammation and nerve damage, reducing the number and severity of relapses and slowing the worsening of symptoms. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if ocrelizumab is more effective than any other medicine or placebo in people with relapsing‐remitting MS and primary progressive MS. 
We were interested in how many people:
– had symptom flare‐ups;
– had worsening symptoms;
– experienced unwanted effects; and
– stopped treatment due to unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared ocrelizumab against any other medicine or placebo for people with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing‐remitting MS or primary progressive MS. People in the studies could be any age or sex, could have mild or severe symptoms, and could have had MS for any length of time. 
We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found four studies with 2551 people with MS. The largest study included 732 people and the smallest included 163 people. The studies were in countries around the world, but mostly in the USA. One study lasted for 24 weeks; two studies for 96 weeks; and one study for at least 120 weeks. Pharmaceutical companies funded the four studies. 
Three studies compared ocrelizumab with interferon beta‐1a in people with relapsing‐remitting MS. Interferon beta‐1a is an older type of disease‐modifying therapy. One study compared ocrelizumab with placebo for people with primary progressive MS. 
Main results 
Ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta‐1a for people with relapsing‐remitting MS, after 96 weeks of treatment: 
– probably substantially reduces the number of people who had flare‐ups;
– may substantially reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse;
– probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects; and 
– may substantially reduce the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects.  
Ocrelizumab compared with placebo for people with primary progressive MS, after 120 weeks of treatment: 
– may reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse; 
– probably increases unwanted effects;  and
– may make little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects and the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the results is moderate to low for several reasons. First, people dropped out of the studies unevenly, which meant more people had one treatment than the other. Second, there was not enough information about some of our points of interest to allow us to draw conclusions for outcomes, there was not enough information available for us to be confident in the results. Finally, changes in symptoms shown by scans could have been due to causes other than disease progression. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 8 October 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013497.pub2,"Background
GM‐CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor) is a growth factor that is used to supplement culture media in an effort to improve clinical outcomes for those undergoing assisted reproduction. It is worth noting that the use of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media often adds a further cost to the price of an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycle. The purpose of this review was to assess the available evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness and safety of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of GM‐CSF‐supplemented human embryo culture media versus culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF, in women or couples undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Search methods
We used standard methodology recommended by Cochrane. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, DARE, OpenGrey, PubMed, Google Scholar, and two trials registers on 15 October 2019, checked references of relevant papers and communicated with experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing GM‐CSF (including G‐CSF (granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor))‐supplemented embryo culture media versus any other non‐GM‐CSF‐supplemented embryo culture media (control) in women undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were live birth and miscarriage rate. The secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, multiple gestation, preterm birth, birth defects, aneuploidy, and stillbirth rates. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methodology. We undertook one comparison, GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media versus culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF, for those undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Main results
We included five studies, the data for three of which (1532 participants) were meta‐analysed. We are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media makes any difference to the live‐birth rate when compared to using conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF (odds ratio (OR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.52, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 69%, low‐quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of live birth associated with conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF was 22%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media would be between 21% and 30%. 
We are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media makes any difference to the miscarriage rate when compared to using conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.36, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 0%, low‐quality evidence). This evidence suggests that if the miscarriage rate associated with conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF was 4%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media would be between 2% and 5%. 
Furthermore, we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media makes any difference to the following outcomes: clinical pregnancy (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.45, 3 RCTs, N = 1532 women, I2 = 67%, low‐quality evidence); multiple gestation (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.10, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 35%, very low‐quality evidence); preterm birth (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.04, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 76%, very low‐quality evidence); birth defects (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.01, I2 = 0%, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, low‐quality evidence); and aneuploidy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.26, I2 = 0%, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, low‐quality evidence). We were unable to undertake analysis of stillbirth, as there were no events in either arm of the two studies that assessed this outcome. 
Authors' conclusions
Due to the very low to low quality of the evidence, we cannot be certain whether GM‐CSF is any more or less effective than culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF for clinical outcomes that reflect effectiveness and safety. It is important that independent information on the available evidence is made accessible to those considering using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media. The claims from marketing information that GM‐CSF has a positive effect on pregnancy rates are not supported by the available evidence presented here; further well‐designed, properly powered RCTs are needed to lend certainty to the evidence. 
","## A Closer Look at IVF Culture Media

### Rationale

Many couples want to have a baby. Sometimes, they need help to get pregnant. This help is called assisted reproduction. One common method is IVF, or in vitro fertilization. In IVF, doctors combine a sperm and an egg outside the body. They grow the early baby, called an embryo, in a dish. This dish has a special liquid called culture media.

Some companies add a special helper to this liquid. This helper is a growth factor called GM-CSF. They claim it makes IVF work better. It helps the embryo grow. It also might help the baby be born healthy. However, adding GM-CSF makes IVF cost more.

This study wanted to see if GM-CSF really helps. Does it lead to more live births? Is it safe for the baby? We need to know if the extra cost is worth it. This study looked at past research. It aimed to find clear answers.

### Trial Design

This study is a review of other studies. It gathers and checks facts from many trials. These trials are called randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In an RCT, some women get the special liquid with GM-CSF. Others get the usual liquid without it. This helps us see if GM-CSF makes a difference.

The study looked at women or couples having IVF. They wanted to get pregnant. The review looked at how many babies were born alive. It also checked for miscarriages. A miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends too soon.

The researchers searched many databases. They looked for studies that met their rules. They wanted to compare GM-CSF liquid to regular liquid. They looked at studies up to October 2019. The study itself does not involve patients. It collects info from past studies.

### Results

The study looked at five past trials. It combined info from three of them. These three studies included 1532 women.

The study found no clear proof that GM-CSF helps. It is not certain if GM-CSF leads to more live births. In the studies, the live birth rate was about 22% with regular liquid. With GM-CSF, it ranged from 21% to 30%. This small change is not enough to say it truly helps.

The study also looked at miscarriages. It found no clear proof that GM-CSF lowers miscarriages. If the miscarriage rate was 4% with regular liquid, it was 2% to 5% with GM-CSF. This difference is too small to be sure.

The study also checked other things. These included getting pregnant, having twins, early births, and birth defects. For all these things, the study found no clear proof. It is not certain if GM-CSF makes any difference.

The quality of the evidence was low. This means we cannot be very sure about the results. The study could not look at stillbirths. No stillbirths happened in the studies that checked for them.

In conclusion, the facts do not support claims that GM-CSF helps. We need more and better studies. These new studies will give us clearer answers. For now, it is not clear if paying extra for GM-CSF is worth it. People need honest info when making choices about IVF.","Growth factor‐supplemented culture media for women undergoing assisted reproduction
Review question 
Does culture media containing the growth factor GM‐CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor) improve the chances of a pregnancy and live‐born baby, and reduce the risk of miscarriage, twin or triplet pregnancy, premature birth, birth defects, genetic problems in the baby, and stillbirth? 
Background 
Assisted reproduction includes processes whereby a woman's eggs and a man's sperm are combined to achieve fertilisation outside of the body. Embryos are placed in a solution called culture medium to support the growing embryo until it can be replaced into the woman's uterus. Culture medium supplemented with GM‐CSF is widely available in clinics and is often offered as an 'add‐on' to an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycle in an effort to improve the success rates of treatment. Using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture medium can make IVF more expensive. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to October 2019. We obtained data from three randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of 1532 infertile women undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a specialised form of IVF whereby the sperm is injected into the egg. We compared GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media versus culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF for those undergoing assisted reproduction. 
What the review found 
Low‐quality evidence reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to the live‐birth rate when compared to using culture media not containing GM‐CSF. This suggests that if the rate of live birth associated with culture media not containing GM‐CSF is 22%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐containing culture media would be between 21% and 30%. Low‐quality evidence also reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to miscarriage when compared to using culture media not containing GM‐CSF. This suggests that if the miscarriage rate associated with culture media not containing GM‐CSF is 4%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐containing culture media would be between 2% and 5%. Low‐quality evidence for pregnancy, birth defects, and genetic problems with the baby, and very low‐quality evidence for twin or triplet pregnancies, and premature birth, reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to these outcomes when compared to culture media not containing GM‐CSF. Two studies looked at stillbirth, but as no stillbirths occurred in either study, we were unable to analyse this outcome. 
Overall conclusions 
Due to the very low to low quality of the evidence, we cannot be certain whether GM‐CSF is any more or less effective or harmful than culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF. It is important that independent information on the available evidence is made accessible to those considering using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media. In the meantime, more large studies are needed to increase the certainty of our conclusions.

10.1002-14651858.CD013515.pub2,"Background
Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a group of musculoskeletal disorders affecting the jaw. They are frequently associated with pain that can be difficult to manage and may become persistent (chronic). Psychological therapies aim to support people with TMDs to manage their pain, leading to reduced pain, disability and distress. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychological therapies in people (aged 12 years and over) with painful TMD lasting 3 months or longer. 
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched six bibliographic databases up to 21 October 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any psychological therapy (e.g. cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), behaviour therapy (BT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), mindfulness) for the management of painful TMD. We compared these against control or alternative treatment (e.g. oral appliance, medication, physiotherapy). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We reported outcome data immediately after treatment and at the longest available follow‐up. 
We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies. Two review authors independently assessed each included study for any risk of bias in sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting of outcomes, and other issues. We judged the certainty of the evidence for each key comparison and outcome as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE criteria. 
Main results
We identified 22 RCTs (2001 participants), carried out between 1967 and 2021. We were able to include 12 of these studies in meta‐analyses. The risk of bias was high across studies, and we judged the certainty of the evidence to be low to very low overall; further research may change the findings. Our key outcomes of interest were: pain intensity, disability caused by pain, adverse events and psychological distress. Treatments varied in length, with the shortest being 4 weeks. The follow‐up time ranged from 3 months to 12 months. Most studies evaluated CBT.   
At treatment completion, there was no evidence of a benefit of CBT on pain intensity when measured against alternative treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.03, confidence interval (CI) ‐0.21 to 0.28; P = 0.79; 5 studies, 509 participants) or control (SMD ‐0.09, CI ‐0.30 to 0.12; P = 0.41; 6 studies, 577 participants). At follow‐up, there was evidence of a small benefit of CBT for reducing pain intensity compared to alternative treatment (SMD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.50 to ‐0.08; 5 studies, 475 participants) and control (SMD ‐0.30, CI ‐0.51 to ‐0.09; 6 studies, 639 participants). 
At treatment completion, there was no evidence of a difference in disability outcomes (interference in activities caused by pain) between CBT and alternative treatment (SMD 0.15, CI ‐0.40 to 0.10; P = 0.25; 3 studies, 245 participants), or between CBT and control/usual care (SMD 0.02, CI ‐0.21 to 0.24; P = 0.88; 3 studies, 315 participants). Nor was there evidence of a difference at follow‐up (CBT versus alternative treatment: SMD ‐0.15, CI ‐0.42 to 0.12; 3 studies, 245 participants; CBT versus control: SMD 0.01 CI ‐ 0.61 to 0.64; 2 studies, 240 participants). 
There were very few data on adverse events. From the data available, adverse effects associated with psychological treatment tended to be minor and to occur less often than in alternative treatment groups. There were, however, insufficient data available to draw firm conclusions. 
CBT showed a small benefit in terms of reducing psychological distress at treatment completion compared to alternative treatment (SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.50 to ‐0.15; 6 studies, 553 participants), which was maintained at follow‐up (SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.51 to ‐0.13; 6 studies, 516 participants). For CBT versus control, only one study reported results for distress and did not find evidence of a difference between groups at treatment completion (mean difference (MD) 2.36, 95% CI ‐1.17 to 5.89; 101 participants) or follow‐up (MD ‐1.02, 95% CI ‐4.02 to 1.98; 101 participants). 
We assessed the certainty of the evidence to be low or very low for all comparisons and outcomes. 
The data were insufficient to draw any reliable conclusions about psychological therapies other than CBT. 
Authors' conclusions
We found mixed evidence for the effects of psychological therapies on painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). There is low‐certainty evidence that CBT may reduce pain intensity more than alternative treatments or control when measured at longest follow‐up,  but not at treatment completion. There is low‐certainty evidence that CBT may be better than alternative treatments, but not control, for reducing psychological distress at treatment completion and follow‐up. There is low‐certainty evidence that CBT may not be better than other treatments or control for pain disability outcomes.  
There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about alternative psychological therapeutic approaches, and there are insufficient data to be clear about adverse effects that may be associated with psychological therapies for painful TMD.  
Overall, we found insufficient evidence on which to base a reliable judgement about the efficacy of psychological therapies for painful TMD. Further research is needed to determine whether or not psychological therapies are effective, the most effective type of therapy and delivery method, and how it can best be targeted. In particular, high‐quality RCTs conducted in primary care and community settings are required, which evaluate a range of psychological approaches against alternative treatments or usual care, involve both adults and adolescents, and collect measures of pain intensity, pain disability and psychological distress until at least 12 months post‐treatment.  
","**Plain Title: Mind-Body Help for Jaw Pain**

**Rationale**

Many people have pain in their jaw. This is called Temporomandibular Disorder, or TMD. TMD can cause a lot of pain. It can make it hard to eat or talk. This pain can last a long time. It can be a real burden.

Doctors want to help people manage this pain. They think that helping people with their thoughts and feelings might help their pain. This is called psychological therapy. It might make the pain less. It might also help people live better.

This study wanted to see if these mind-body therapies work for TMD. It looked at if they could ease pain. It also looked at if they could help with stress.

**Trial Design**

This study looked at many other studies. These studies were called randomized controlled trials. That means people were put into groups by chance. One group got mind-body therapy. The other group got a different treatment or no special treatment.

The studies included people aged 12 and older. They all had jaw pain for 3 months or more. The mind-body therapies looked at were things like talk therapy. Other treatments included jaw guards or medicine.

The studies checked how people felt right after treatment. They also checked how they felt months later. The longest check was 12 months after treatment.

**Results**

The study looked at 22 past studies. These studies included over 2000 people. Most of them looked at one type of talk therapy called CBT.

Right after treatment, CBT did not seem to lower pain more than other treatments. It also did not lower pain more than no treatment.

But, a few months later, CBT seemed to help a little. People who had CBT felt a bit less pain. This was compared to other treatments or no treatment.

CBT did not seem to help people do daily tasks better. This means it did not help much with how pain stopped them from living their lives.

Very few problems were reported with mind-body therapy. When they did happen, they were often small.

CBT did help lower stress right after treatment. This good effect lasted for months. This was true when compared to other treatments. We don't know much about how CBT compared to no treatment for stress.

The study found that we need more research. The results were not always clear. More studies are needed to know if mind-body therapies really help jaw pain. They also need to find the best way to use them.","What are the benefits and risks of psychological therapies for adults and young people over 12 years old with painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? 
Key messages 
The overall results are mixed, but indicate that psychological therapies may be a useful approach for painful TMD as there is some limited evidence that they can reduce the pain. Our review suggests that they may do this at least as well as other available treatments. Any negative effects of psychological therapies are unclear, and more research is needed before we can know whether they provide a noticeable benefit while causing no or few problems. 
What is the condition? 
Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are conditions that affect the jaw joint and the muscles that move it. They are often associated with pain that lasts more than 3 months (known as chronic pain). Other symptoms include limited mouth opening, and jaw clicking and locking. All symptoms can interfere with quality of life and mood. 
What did we want to know? 
We wanted to find out how effective psychological therapies are for adults and young people over the age of 12 years who have painful TMD that has lasted at least 3 months. 
What did we do? 
We searched databases of medical and dental journals and research studies. We only selected studies known as 'randomised controlled trials (RCTs)'. In this type of study, participants are allocated to groups randomly. One group receives the intervention and the other receives a different treatment or no treatment at all. RCTs aim to reduce the risk of introducing bias in clinical studies. 
We looked for reports of RCTs of psychological therapies compared to different treatments or no treatment in people over 12 years of age. Most of the reports we found compared psychological therapy to medication or the use of a special mouthguard.  
We chose to focus on three measures of success. These were reduction in pain intensity, interference with activities caused by pain ('pain disability'), and psychological distress. We looked for details of these measures immediately after treatment and a few months later. We also looked for information on any 'adverse effects' (negative side effects of the treatments).  
We used standard Cochrane methods to decide which studies to include, collect the key information from the studies, judge whether or not the studies were biased in any way, and judge how certain we can be about the results. 
What did we find? 
Overall we found 22 relevant studies. Most of the studies reported on one particular form of psychological therapy called cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). We did not have enough information to draw any conclusions about any other psychological therapies. 
The results told us that CBT was no different to other treatments (e.g. oral splints, medicine) or usual care/no treatment in reducing the intensity of the TMD pain by the end of treatment. There was some evidence that people who had CBT might have slightly less pain a few months after treatment.  
There was some evidence that CBT might be better than other treatments for reducing psychological distress both at the end of treatment and a few months later. This was not seen in the one study that compared CBT against usual care. 
In terms of how much pain interfered with activities, there was no evidence that there was any difference between CBT and other treatments.  
There was too little information to be sure about whether psychological treatments cause adverse effects (problems caused by treatment such as feeling unwell or worse pain or unexpected effects). Only six of the 22 studies measured what adverse effects participants experienced. In these six studies, adverse effects associated with psychological treatment seemed to be minor in general and to occur less often than in alternative treatment groups.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies had design limitations. There was also variation in the length of treatment and in how it was delivered. This means that we need to be cautious in interpreting the results that we found and they may not be reliable. 
How up to date is the evidence? 
We searched for studies up to 21 October 2021.
"
10.1002-14651858.CD013384.pub2,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by shortness of breath, cough and recurrent exacerbations. People with COPD often live with one or more co‐existing long‐term health conditions (comorbidities). People with more severe COPD often have a higher number of comorbidities, putting them at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of any single intervention for COPD adapted or tailored to their comorbidity(s) compared to any other intervention for people with COPD and one or more common comorbidities (quantitative data, RCTs) in terms of the following outcomes: Quality of life, exacerbations, functional status, all‐cause and respiratory‐related hospital admissions, mortality, pain, and depression and anxiety. 
To assess the effectiveness of an adapted or tailored single COPD intervention (simple or complex) that is aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and one or more common comorbidities (quantitative data, RCTs) compared to usual care in terms of the following outcomes: Quality of life, exacerbations, functional status, all‐cause and respiratory‐related hospital admissions, mortality, pain, and depression and anxiety. 
To identify emerging themes that describe the views and experiences of patients, carers and healthcare professionals when receiving or providing care to manage multimorbidities (qualitative data). 
Search methods
We searched multiple databases including the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL, to identify relevant randomised and qualitative studies. We also searched trial registries and conducted citation searches. The latest search was conducted in January 2021. 
Selection criteria
Eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) compared a) any single intervention for COPD adapted or tailored to their comorbidity(s) compared to any other intervention, or b) any adapted or tailored single COPD intervention (simple or complex) that is aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and one or more comorbidities, compared to usual care. We included qualitative studies or mixed‐methods studies to identify themes. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods for analysis of the RCTs. We used Cochrane's risk of bias tool for the RCTs and the CASP checklist for the qualitative studies. We planned to use the Mixed Methods Appraisal tool (MMAT) to assess the risk of bias in mixed‐methods studies, but we found none. We used GRADE and CERQual to assess the quality of the quantitative and qualitative evidence respectively. The primary outcome measures for this review were quality of life and exacerbations. 
Main results
Quantitative studies 
We included seven studies (1197 participants) in the quantitative analyses, with interventions including telemonitoring, pulmonary rehabilitation, treatment optimisation, water‐based exercise training and case management. Interventions were either compared with usual care or with an active comparator (such as land‐based exercise training). Duration of trials ranged from 4 to 52 weeks. Mean age of participants ranged from 64 to 72 years and COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. Trials included either people with COPD and a specific comorbidity (including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, lung cancer, head or neck cancer, and musculoskeletal conditions), or with one or more comorbidities of any type. 
Overall, we judged the evidence presented to be of moderate to very low certainty (GRADE), mainly due to the methodological quality of included trials and imprecision of effect estimates. 
Intervention versus usual care 
Quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score may improve with tailored pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care at 52 weeks (mean difference (MD) −10.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) −12.66 to −9.04; 1 study, 70 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Tailored pulmonary rehabilitation is likely to improve COPD assessment test (CAT) scores compared with usual care at 52 weeks (MD −8.02, 95% CI −9.44 to −6.60; 1 study, 70 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and with a multicomponent telehealth intervention at 52 weeks (MD −6.90, 95% CI −9.56 to −4.24; moderate‐certainty evidence). Evidence is uncertain about effects of pharmacotherapy optimisation or telemonitoring interventions on CAT improvement compared with usual care. 
There may be little to no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations, or mean exacerbations with case management compared with usual care (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.57; 1 study, 470 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
For secondary outcomes, six‐minute walk distance (6MWD) may improve with pulmonary rehabilitation, water‐based exercise or multicomponent interventions at 38 to 52 weeks (low‐certainty evidence). A multicomponent intervention may result in fewer people being admitted to hospital at 17 weeks, although there may be little to no difference in a telemonitoring intervention. There may be little to no difference between intervention and usual care for mortality. 
Intervention versus active comparator 
We included one study comparing water‐based and land‐based exercise (30 participants). We found no evidence for quality of life or exacerbations. 
There may be little to no difference between water‐ and land‐based exercise for 6MWD (MD 5 metres, 95% CI −22 to 32; 38 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Qualitative studies 
One nested qualitative study (21 participants) explored perceptions and experiences of people with COPD and long‐term conditions, and of researchers and health professionals who were involved in an RCT of telemonitoring equipment. 
Several themes were identified, including health status, beliefs and concerns, reliability of equipment, self‐efficacy, perceived ease of use, factors affecting usefulness and perceived usefulness, attitudes and intention, self‐management and changes in healthcare use. We judged the qualitative evidence presented as of very low certainty overall. 
Authors' conclusions
Owing to a paucity of eligible trials, as well as diversity in the intervention type, comorbidities and the outcome measures reported, we were unable to provide a robust synthesis of data. Pulmonary rehabilitation or multicomponent interventions may improve quality of life and functional status (6MWD), but the evidence is too limited to draw a robust conclusion. The key take‐home message from this review is the lack of data from RCTs on treatments for people living with COPD and comorbidities. 
Given the variation in number and type of comorbidity(s) an individual may have, and severity of COPD, larger studies reporting individual patient data are required to determine these effects. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Improving Care for People with COPD and Other Health Problems

### Rationale

Many people have a breathing problem called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or COPD. COPD makes it hard to breathe. It can cause a cough and sudden flare-ups. These flare-ups can be very serious.

People with COPD often have other health problems too. These can be heart issues or muscle pain. More health problems can make COPD worse. They can also lead to more time in the hospital. This can be a big burden for patients.

Doctors want to find the best ways to help people with COPD. They also want to help with their other health problems. This study looked at different ways to help. We wanted to see if new ways of care could make people feel better. We hoped new treatments would improve their lives.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies that were already done. We looked for studies that tested new ways to help people with COPD. These studies focused on people who also had other health problems. We wanted to see how new treatments worked. We compared them to usual care. We also compared them to other common treatments.

The people in these studies were mostly older adults. Their age ranged from about 64 to 72 years old. They had COPD of different levels, from mild to very bad. They also had at least one other health problem. This could be heart disease or cancer.

The studies we looked at lasted for different amounts of time. Some were as short as 4 weeks. Others lasted up to a year, or 52 weeks. We looked at how these treatments affected people’s daily lives. We wanted to see if they improved breathing and reduced hospital stays. We also looked at things like pain and feeling sad.

### Results

We found seven studies that fit our needs. They included 1,197 people. The treatments in these studies were different. Some used special exercise programs. Some used phone calls to check on patients. Others looked at how medicines were used.

It was hard to make strong conclusions. This is because the studies were very different. The quality of the studies also varied. But we did find some helpful information.

One type of special exercise called pulmonary rehabilitation may help. It may make people with COPD feel better. This means they had a better quality of life. This was seen after a year. This type of exercise may also make it easier to do daily tasks.

Some other treatments might also help. Water exercise or special programs may improve how far people can walk. Some programs might also lead to fewer hospital visits. But we need more research to be sure.

We also looked at what patients and doctors thought. They talked about their experiences. They shared what worked well and what did not. They also talked about how they managed their health.

In summary, we found that there is not enough strong research. We need more studies on how to best treat people with COPD. Especially for those who also have other health problems. More research will help us find the best care for these patients. This will help them live better lives.","Approaches to help people with COPD who have one or more long‐term conditions
What is COPD and comorbidity? 
COPD is a common condition caused mainly by smoking and can lead to long‐term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, and cough with sputum production due to airways and lung damage. People with COPD may have one or more other long‐term conditions (comorbidities) such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, asthma and lung cancer which can lead to poor health. People living with two or more comorbidities can also be known as living with multimorbidity. 
Why did we do this review?  
Because many people with COPD live with multimorbidity, naturally people in clinical trials will have multimorbidities. However, the results of those trials are usually not reported broken down by multimorbidity. People with comorbidities may need to adapt interventions to take account of their comorbidity — for example taking exercise in water instead of on land so that their bodies are better supported. Historically, Cochrane Airways Reviews have not taken into account people's comorbidities, and this review is a first step to addressing this. We decided to complete a review that centres on people with COPD and comorbidities following a meeting with our COPD patient group, who highlighted concerns over comorbidities. After some deliberation, we decided to include the following two sorts of trials. 
1. Any single intervention for COPD delivered to people with COPD adapted to or targeting their comorbidity compared to routine care or any other intervention. 
2. Any intervention aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and comorbidities, which could be simple (e.g. scheduling COPD and heart clinics on the same day) or more complex (e.g. developing a new care package for management of people with COPD across a local health service), compared to routine care. 
We wanted to know which treatments improve quality of life and reduce exacerbations for people living with COPD and one or more comorbidities. 
We also wanted to find out about how people with COPD, carers and health professionals felt about those treatments. 
What information did we find? 
We carried out a search for studies in January 2021. We found seven  eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 1197 people, and one qualitative study which was part of one of the randomised trials and provided information about people's opinions and experiences of using telehealth equipment. People included in the trials were aged between 64 and 72 years, and their COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. The trials either included people with COPD and a specific comorbidity such as cardiovascular disease or lung cancer, or they included people with COPD and one or more other conditions of any sort. 
Results and conclusions 
There is not enough evidence on people with COPD and other comorbidities to draw firm conclusions about interventions aimed at COPD that are adapted for the comorbidity. The available evidence indicated the following:  
‐ Quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score may improve with tailored pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care (note that there is a strong evidence base for pulmonary rehabilitation in people with COPD). 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation is likely to improve quality of life as measured by the COPD assessment test (CAT) scores compared with usual care at 52 weeks and with a multicomponent telehealth intervention.  
‐ Evidence is uncertain about the effects of pharmacotherapy optimisation or telemonitoring interventions on CAT improvement compared with usual care. 
‐ There may be little to no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations, or mean exacerbations with case management compared with usual care.  
‐ For secondary outcomes, the distance walked by participants in six minutes may improve with pulmonary rehabilitation, water‐based exercise or multicomponent interventions. A multicomponent intervention may result in fewer people being admitted to hospital, although there may be little to no difference in a telemonitoring intervention.  
‐ There may be little to no difference between intervention and usual care for deaths across several studies. 
‐ One study compared water‐based exercise with land‐based exercise. We found no evidence for quality of life or exacerbations. There may be little to no difference between water‐ and land‐based exercise on the distance walked by participants in six minutes. 
‐ One qualitative study explored perceptions and experiences of people with COPD and long‐term conditions, and of researchers and health professionals who were involved in an RCT of telemonitoring equipment. Several themes were identified, including health status, beliefs and concerns, reliability of equipment, self‐efficacy, perceived ease of use, factors affecting usefulness and perceived usefulness, attitudes and intention, self‐management and changes in healthcare use.  
Larger studies with more people with COPD and comorbidities could help to find out if targeted approaches can improve health. 
Certainty of the information 
Overall there were very few studies and most studies were small. This means the results are based on a small amount of information. Trials with different interventions and different or more people may give a different result.

Diagnosis of endometrial (womb) cancer is normally made at an early stage, as most women with the disease experience abnormal vaginal bleeding, which prompts them to seek medical advice. However, delays in presentation and referral can result in delay in diagnosis and management, which can lead to unfavourable treatment outcomes. This is particularly a problem for pre‐ and peri‐menopausal women. Providing educational information to women and healthcare providers regarding symptoms relating to endometrial cancer may raise awareness of the disease and reduce delayed treatment. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of health education interventions targeting healthcare providers, or individuals, or both, to promote early presentation and referral for women with endometrial cancer symptoms. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of review articles. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both individually randomised and cluster‐RCTs. In the absence of RCTs we planned to include well‐designed non‐randomised studies (NRS) with a parallel comparison assessing the benefits of any type of health education interventions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently evaluated whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria for the review, but none were found. 
Main results
A comprehensive search of the literature yielded the following results: CENTRAL (1022 references), MEDLINE (2874 references), and Embase (2820 references). After de‐duplication, we screened titles and abstracts of 4880 references and excluded 4864 that did not meet the review inclusion criteria. Of the 16 references that potentially met the review inclusion, we excluded all 16 reports after reviewing the full texts. We did not identify any ongoing trials. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently an absence of evidence to indicate the effectiveness of health education interventions involving healthcare providers or individuals or both to promote early presentation and referral for women with endometrial cancer symptoms. High‐quality RCTs are needed to assess whether health education interventions enhance early presentation and referral. If health education interventions can be shown to reduce treatment delays in endometrial cancer, further studies would be required to determine which interventions are most effective.

## Plain Title: Learning About Womb Cancer Symptoms

### Rationale

Womb cancer often starts in the lining of the womb. This is called endometrial cancer. Most women with womb cancer have unusual bleeding. This bleeding often makes them see a doctor early. Getting help early is key.

But some women may wait to see a doctor. Doctors may also be slow to send them for tests. This can lead to delays in finding the cancer. It can also delay getting treatment. This is very bad for women. It is a bigger problem for women who are not past menopause.

This study wanted to see if teaching people helps. It looked at teaching women or their doctors. The idea was to help women get care faster. Quick care can lead to better health results. The study wanted to know if teaching helps women with womb cancer signs. It also wanted to see if it helps doctors send them for care sooner.

### Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This study was a look at other studies. It did not test new drugs. It did not test people. The study team searched for past research. They looked for studies about teaching people. These studies would have focused on womb cancer signs. They would have aimed to help women get seen by a doctor fast. They also looked for studies about doctors sending women for care fast.

The team looked for the best kind of studies. These are called ""randomized controlled trials."" These studies compare one group to another. Sometimes they looked for studies that were not randomized. But those studies needed to be well-planned. They needed to show clear benefits from teaching.

The team looked at studies that focused on women. These women would have symptoms of womb cancer. The studies might also include their doctors. The study did not specify age or other health conditions for the women. It also did not say how long people would be in such studies. This is because they were looking for existing studies, not running a new one with people.

### Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

The study team looked very hard for studies. They checked many sources. They looked at a large number of reports. They found over 1000 reports in one source. They found almost 3000 reports in another. And over 2800 in a third source.

After removing duplicates, they had over 4800 reports to check. They read the titles and short summaries. Most of these reports did not fit what they were looking for. They removed 4864 of them.

They then had 16 reports left. They read these full reports. But none of these 16 reports met their rules. They also looked for studies that were still happening. They did not find any of those either.

**What does this mean for patients?**

This study found no clear answers. There is no proof yet that teaching helps. We do not know if health talks help women get care faster. We also do not know if they help doctors send women for care sooner.

More good studies are needed. We need studies to see if teaching works. If teaching does help, then we need to know what kinds of teaching work best. This could help women with womb cancer get treatment sooner. That could lead to better health for them.","Do health education interventions lead to early treatment for women with symptoms of endometrial (womb) cancer 
Background Endometrial (womb) cancer arises from the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the lining of the womb. Diagnosis when the disease is still at an early stage (cancer is still within the womb, without spread into nearby tissues) is common, as most women with the disease experience abnormal vaginal bleeding and go to their doctors. However, delayed management of endometrial cancer still occurs. This is particularly a problem for women who are about to go through or are in the menopause. Providing educational information to women and healthcare providers regarding symptoms relating to endometrial cancer may raise awareness of the disease and reduce delayed treatment. We undertook this review to assess whether endometrial cancer education led to women with endometrial cancer symptoms visiting their doctors and being referred for treatment earlier than when there was no education. 
The aim of the review We undertook this review to assess whether endometrial cancer education led to women with endometrial cancer symptoms visiting their doctors and being referred for treatment earlier than when there was no educational information available. 
Main findings We planned to include randomised controlled trials (studies in which people or groups of people are allocated by chance to two or more groups, treating them differently). In the absence of randomised controlled trials, we planned to include studies where participants were not randomised but that included an assessment of the benefits of health education compared to no health education. We searched scientific databases and checked the titles and abstracts of 4880 possibly relevant articles and assessed the full text of 16 of these references. However, we found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Conclusions There is currently an absence of evidence to indicate whether providing health education to healthcare providers, or individuals or both, promotes early presentation and referral for women with symptoms of endometrial cancer.

Delayed recovery of urinary continence is a major adverse effect of robotic‐assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in men undergoing prostate cancer treatment. To address this issue, a number of surgical techniques have been designed to reconstruct the posterior aspect of the rhabdosphincter, which is responsible for urinary continence after removal of the prostate; however, it is unclear how well they work.  
Objectives
To assess the effects of posterior musculofascial reconstruction RALP compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, trials registries, other sources of the grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to 12 March 2021. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which participants were randomized to undergo variations of posterior musculofascial reconstruction RALP versus no posterior reconstruction during RALP for clinically localized prostate cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. Primary outcomes were: urinary continence recovery within one week after catheter removal, at three months after surgery, and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: urinary continence recovery at six and twelve months after surgery, potency recovery twelve months after surgery, positive surgical margins (PSM), and biochemical recurrence‐free survival (BCRFS). We performed statistical analyses using a random‐effects model. We rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Our search identified 13 records of eight unique RCTs, of which six were published studies and two were abstract proceedings. We included 1085 randomized participants, of whom 963 completed the trials (88.8%). All participants had either cT1c or cT2 or cT3a disease, with a mean prostate‐specific antigen level of 8.15 ng/mL. 
Primary outcomes 
Posterior reconstruction RALP (PR‐RALP) may improve urinary continence one week after catheter removal compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.73; I2 = 42%; studies = 5, participants = 498; low CoE) although the CI also includes the possibility of no effect. Assuming 335 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 84 more men per 1000 (33 fewer to 244 more) reporting urinary continence recovery.  
Posterior reconstruction may have little to no effect on urinary continence three months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.14; I2 = 67%; studies = 6, participants = 842; low CoE). Assuming 701 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 14 fewer men per 1000 (112 fewer to 98 more) reporting urinary continence after three months. 
PR‐RALP probably results in little to no difference in serious adverse events compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.92; I2 = 0%; studies = 6, participants = 835; moderate CoE). Assuming 25 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP experience a serious adverse event at this time point, this corresponds to six fewer men per 1000 (17 fewer to 23 more) reporting serious adverse events.  
Secondary outcomes 
PR‐RALP may result in little to no difference in recovery of continence 12 months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.07; I2 = 25%; studies = 3, participants = 602; low CoE). Assuming 918 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 18 more men per 1000 (18 fewer to 64 more) reporting urinary continence recovery.  
We are very uncertain about the effects of PR‐RALP on recovery of potency 12 months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26; I2 = 3%; studies = 2, participants = 308; very low CoE). Assuming 433 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are potent at this time point, this corresponds to nine more men per 1000 (78 fewer to 113 more) reporting potency recovery.  
PR‐RALP may result in little to no difference in positive surgical margins compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.33; I2 = 50%; studies = 3, participants = 517; low CoE). Assuming 130 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP have a positive surgical margin, this corresponds to 31 more men per 1000 (46 fewer to 173 more) reporting positive surgical margins.  
PR‐RALP may result in little to no difference in biochemical recurrence compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.52; I2 = 0%; studies = 2, participants = 468; low CoE). Assuming 70 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP have experienced biochemical recurrence at this time point, this corresponds to 25 more men per 1000 (18 fewer to 107 more) reporting biochemical recurrence.  
Authors' conclusions
This review found evidence that PR‐RALP may improve early continence one week after catheter removal but not thereafter. Meanwhile, adverse event rates are probably not impacted and surgical margins rates are likely similar. This review was unable to determine if or how these findings may be impacted by the person's age, nerve‐sparing status, or clinical stage. Study limitations, imprecision, and inconsistency lowered the certainty of evidence for the outcomes assessed.

### **Plain Title: How a Surgery Change Can Help Men Control Their Urine After Prostate Cancer Surgery**

### **Rationale**
Men who have prostate cancer often need surgery. One common surgery is called robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, or RALP. After this surgery, many men find it hard to control their urine. This is called urinary incontinence. It can be a big problem for men. It makes daily life hard.

Doctors have tried new ways to do the RALP surgery. These new ways try to fix a muscle that helps with urine control. This muscle is at the back of where the prostate used to be. But we do not know if these new surgery methods truly help.

This study looked at these new methods. It wanted to see if changing the RALP surgery helps men control their urine better. We also wanted to see if it causes more problems.

### **Trial Design**
This study looked at other studies. We searched many places for studies that compared two groups of men. All men in these studies had prostate cancer. All had the RALP surgery.

One group of men had the new surgery method. This method rebuilt the muscle at the back. The other group had the standard RALP surgery. They did not have the muscle rebuilt.

We looked for studies where men were put into groups by chance. This makes the study fair. We gathered facts from these studies. We looked at how soon men could control their urine. We also looked at any bad things that happened.

### **Results**
We found 13 reports from 8 main studies. These studies included over 1,000 men. Most men finished the studies. All men had early-stage prostate cancer.

**What we found for early urine control:**
The new surgery method might help men control their urine sooner. This was one week after their catheter was out. Out of 1,000 men, about 335 could control their urine with the standard surgery. With the new surgery, about 84 more men could control their urine. This is a small gain.

**What we found for later urine control:**
The new surgery did not seem to help with urine control after three months. It also did not help after twelve months. The number of men who could control their urine was about the same in both groups.

**What we found for bad events:**
The new surgery did not cause more serious bad events. Out of 1,000 men, about 25 had a serious bad event with standard surgery. With the new surgery, about 6 fewer men had a serious bad event. This means it is safe.

**Other findings:**
We are not sure if the new surgery affects men's ability to have sex. We also do not know if it changes the chance of cancer coming back. It also did not seem to change how clear the edges of the surgery were.

**Our main message:**
The new surgery might help men control their urine a bit sooner. This is in the first week after surgery. But it does not seem to help later on. It also does not cause more bad problems. We need more studies to be very sure about these results. We cannot say if age or other factors change these findings.","Should we perform posterior reconstruction RALP or standard RALP for clinically localized prostate cancer? 
Review question 
In men with prostate cancer who are having their prostate removed using surgery assisted by a robotic device (called robotic‐assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, or RALP), how does connecting the tissue behind the urethra (so‐called posterior reconstruction) compare to surgery where these connections are not made (standard RALP)? 
Background 
Urologists often use a robot to remove the prostate in men with prostate cancer. After surgery, most men leak urine for some time. This problem is called incontinence and usually improves six to 12 months after surgery in most men. However, it can be very bothersome during this time. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies in which chance determined whether men had posterior reconstruction RALP or standard RALP. These studies included 1085 men with an average age ranging from 60 to 67 years. The average prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) level in the men was 8.15 ng/mL. Higher levels of PSA may indicate worse prostate cancer. 
Key results 
We found that posterior reconstruction RALP may result in better continence one week after the catheter comes out compared to standard RALP (although it is also possible that it is no better), but it may make little to no difference at either three or 12 months after surgery. Posterior reconstruction RALP probably results in little to no difference in serious unwanted effects compared with the standard way of doing the surgery. There may also be little to no difference in positive surgical margins, meaning the risk of there being cancer cells right at the cut edge of the prostate when viewed under the microscope. There may also be no difference between the two techniques in terms of the risk of a PSA level that goes up within 12 months of surgery, which often signals that there is cancer left behind. We are very uncertain how posterior reconstruction RALP effects the ability to achieve an erection, compared to standard RALP. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low depending on the outcome, meaning that we have moderate to very little confidence in the results.

10.1002-14651858.CD013399.pub2,"Background
The risk of venous thromboembolism is increased in adults and enhanced by asparaginase‐based chemotherapy, and venous thromboembolism introduces a secondary risk of treatment delay and premature discontinuation of key anti‐leukaemic agents, potentially compromising survival. Yet, the trade‐off between benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated according to asparaginase‐based regimens is uncertain.  
Objectives
The primary objectives were to assess the benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis for first‐time symptomatic venous thromboembolism in adults with ALL receiving asparaginase‐based therapy compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis. 
The secondary objectives were to compare the benefits and harms of different groups of primary systemic thromboprophylaxis by stratifying the main results per type of drug (heparins, vitamin K antagonists, synthetic pentasaccharides, parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors, direct oral anticoagulants, and blood‐derived products for antithrombin substitution). 
Search methods
We conducted a comprehensive literature search on 02 June 2020, with no language restrictions, including (1) electronic searches of Pubmed/MEDLINE; Embase/Ovid; Scopus/Elsevier; Web of Science Core Collection/Clarivate Analytics; and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and (2) handsearches of (i) reference lists of identified studies and related reviews; (ii) clinical trials registries (ClinicalTrials.gov registry; the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry; the World Health Organisation's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP); and pharmaceutical manufacturers of asparaginase including Servier, Takeda, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Ohara Pharmaceuticals, and Kyowa Pharmaceuticals), and (iii) conference proceedings (from the annual meetings of the American Society of Hematology (ASH); the European Haematology Association (EHA); the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO); and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)). We conducted all searches from 1970 (the time of introduction of asparaginase in ALL treatment). We contacted the authors of relevant studies to identify any unpublished material, missing data, or information regarding ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs); including quasi‐randomised, controlled clinical, cross‐over, and cluster‐randomised trial designs) comparing any parenteral/oral preemptive anticoagulant or mechanical intervention with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, or comparing two different pre‐emptive anticoagulant interventions in adults aged at least 18 years with ALL treated according to asparaginase‐based chemotherapy regimens. For the description of harms, non‐randomised observational studies with a control group were eligible for inclusion.  
Data collection and analysis
Using a standardised data collection form, two review authors independently screened and selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias for each outcome using standardised tools (RoB 2.0 tool for RCTs and ROBINS‐I tool for non‐randomised studies) and the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes included first‐time symptomatic venous thromboembolism, all‐cause mortality, and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included asymptomatic venous thromboembolism, venous thromboembolism‐related mortality, adverse events (i.e. clinically relevant non‐major bleeding and heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia for trials using heparins), and quality of life. Analyses were performed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For non‐randomised studies, we evaluated all studies (including studies judged to be at critical risk of bias in at least one of the ROBINS‐I domains) in a sensitivity analysis exploring confounding.  
Main results
We identified 23 non‐randomised studies that met the inclusion criteria of this review, of which 10 studies provided no outcome data for adults with ALL. We included the remaining 13 studies in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, in which we identified invalid control group definition in two studies and judged outcomes of nine studies to be at critical risk of bias in at least one of the ROBINS‐I domains and outcomes of two studies at serious risk of bias. 
We did not assess the benefits of thromboprophylaxis, as no RCTs were included. In the main descriptive analysis of harms, we included two retrospective non‐randomised studies with outcomes judged to be at serious risk of bias. One study evaluated antithrombin concentrates compared to no antithrombin concentrates. We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on all‐cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.19 (intention‐to‐treat analysis); one study, 40 participants; very low certainty of evidence). We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on venous thromboembolism‐related mortality (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.94 (intention‐to‐treat analysis); one study, 40 participants; very low certainty of evidence). We do not know whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on major bleeding, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, and quality of life in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy, as data were insufficient. The remaining study (224 participants) evaluated prophylaxis with low‐molecular‐weight heparin versus no prophylaxis. However, this study reported insufficient data regarding harms including all‐cause mortality, major bleeding, venous thromboembolism‐related mortality, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia, and quality of life. 
In the sensitivity analysis of harms, exploring the effect of confounding, we also included nine non‐randomised studies with outcomes judged to be at critical risk of bias primarily due to uncontrolled confounding. Three studies (179 participants) evaluated the effect of antithrombin concentrates and six studies (1224 participants) evaluated the effect of prophylaxis with different types of heparins. When analysing all‐cause mortality; venous thromboembolism‐related mortality; and major bleeding (studies of heparin only) including all studies with extractable outcomes for each comparison (antithrombin and low‐molecular‐weight heparin), we observed small study sizes; few events; wide CIs crossing the line of no effect; and substantial heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots. Although the observed heterogeneity could arise through the inclusion of a small number of studies with differences in participants; interventions; and outcome assessments, the likelihood that bias due to uncontrolled confounding was the cause of heterogeneity is inevitable. Subgroup analyses were not possible due to insufficient data.  
Authors' conclusions
We do not know from the currently available evidence, if thromboprophylaxis used for adults with ALL treated according to asparaginase‐based regimens is associated with clinically appreciable benefits and acceptable harms. The existing research on this question is solely of non‐randomised design, seriously to critically confounded, and underpowered with substantial imprecision. Any estimates of effect based on the existing insufficient evidence is very uncertain and is likely to change with future research.

## Plain Title
Protecting Adult Blood Cancer Patients from Blood Clots During Treatment

## Rationale
Some adults get a type of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Doctors treat this cancer with strong medicines, including one called asparaginase. This medicine can help fight the cancer.

But asparaginase can also make blood clots more likely to form. These blood clots are called venous thromboembolism (VTE). Blood clots are dangerous. They can make people very sick. They can also cause delays in cancer treatment. Sometimes, treatment even stops early. This can make it harder for patients to get well.

Doctors want to know if giving medicine to prevent blood clots will help these patients. They want to know if the benefits of preventing clots are greater than any possible harms from the medicine. This study looked at past research to find answers.

## Trial Design
This study was a look back at other studies. It was not a new study with patients. The goal was to find out how well medicines work to stop blood clots. It also aimed to see if these medicines caused bad side effects.

The researchers looked for studies about adults. These adults were at least 18 years old. They all had ALL and were taking asparaginase medicine. Some studies looked at medicines that prevent clots. Others looked at no medicine, or different types of clot-prevention medicines.

The researchers searched many places. They looked at medical journals and trial lists. They also checked meeting notes from 1970 to June 2020. This was when asparaginase began to be used. They did not limit their search by language.

They looked for studies that randomly put patients into groups. This helps make results fair. But they also looked at other types of studies. They wanted to see if medicines given by shot or by mouth helped. They also checked if special machines helped prevent clots.

They focused on how many people got blood clots. They also looked at if people died, and if they had serious bleeding. They also checked for other problems, like mild bleeding or if a medicine made blood cells drop. They also looked at how patients felt.

## Results
The researchers found 23 past studies. But only 13 of these studies had useful facts about adults with ALL. None of these studies randomly assigned patients to groups. This means the studies were not the best kind to show clear benefits.

Because there were no strong studies, the researchers could not say if clot-prevention medicine helped. They could not say if it stopped blood clots for these patients.

They also looked at how much harm these medicines might cause. Two studies looked at a medicine called antithrombin concentrates. This medicine aims to prevent clots. One study had 40 patients. It looked at if this medicine changed how many people died. It also looked at if it changed deaths from blood clots. The results were not clear. We cannot be sure if this medicine helped or harmed.

This study also looked at other problems. These included major bleeding, other bleeding, and how patients felt. But there was not enough information in the past studies to know for sure. Another study looked at a medicine called low-molecular-weight heparin. This medicine also aims to prevent clots. But that study also did not have enough facts to know about harms.

The researchers found that the past studies were not very good. They had few patients. The results were not clear. It was hard to tell if the medicines helped or caused problems.

Right now, we do not know if clot-prevention medicines are helpful or safe for adults with ALL taking asparaginase. The studies we have are not strong enough to give clear answers. More research is needed to find out.","Prevention of blood clots in adults diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether currently available medications for prevention of blood clots have an appreciable balance between benefits and harms in adults with a subtype of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated with asparaginase‐containing chemotherapy.  
Key messages 
We are uncertain whether blood‐derived products such as antithrombin concentrates for the prevention of blood clots in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy are associated with unacceptable harms such as death. Our confidence in the identified studies is limited because of their non‐randomised design with few participants and no control for underlying factors that could influence the outcome. 
Harms regarding other types of blood clot prevention such as low‐molecular‐weight heparin could not be evaluated, because death and bleeding were not reported.  We did not look at benefits such as reduction in risk of blot clots, given the low quality of identified evidence (no randomised studies). We need high‐quality randomised studies, as the conduct of such studies minimises the risk of underlying factors influencing the outcomes.  
What was studied in this review?  
ALL is a subtype of blood cancer arising from malignant transformation of immature white blood cells of lymphoid origin. Over the last 20 years, the historically poor survival in adults with this disease has markedly improved, primarily due to the introduction of more intensive anti‐leukaemic treatment inspired by that used in children with ALL. One of the hallmarks of this treatment is the intensive use of the anti‐leukaemic agent called asparaginase. However, nothing comes without a price. Both older age and asparaginase treatment increase the risk of blood clots, which can either block the blood vessels (predominantly in those called veins) and change the normal blood flow or shower fractions of the clot into other veins located in important organs, resulting in serious health problems. Additionally, doctors are prone to stop asparaginase treatment, if blood clots occur—potentially compromising survival in these people.  
We do not know if the existing types of blood clot prevention protect against the clots and do not cause bleeding and death in adults with this disease. The medications include heparins, vitamin K antagonists, synthetic pentasaccharides, direct thrombin inhibitors, direct oral anticoagulants, or blood‐derived products for antithrombin substitution (decreased production in the body of this anti‐blood clotting protein during asparaginase), and mechanical prevention such as graduated elastic stockings.  
Therefore, we looked at all currently available research in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐containing chemotherapy who received blood clot prevention compared to placebo or no prevention. We looked at the following outcomes: first‐time symptomatic venous blood clot, all‐cause death, major bleeding, blood clot‐related death, asymptomatic venous blood clot, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, heparin‐induced lowering of blood platelet counts, and quality of life. 
What are the results of this review? 
We found 23 studies, of which we included two studies in our main analyses to help answer the question and nine studies in an additional analysis to help describe the limitations of the evidence. The remaining 12 studies could not be included due to missing outcomes or critical risk of bias, as people in the control group were not 'real' controls.  
The two studies from our main analysis were conducted in UK/Canada and compared antithrombin with no antithrombin concentrates and low‐molecular‐weight heparin with no low‐molecular‐weight heparin, respectively, for people with ALL. We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy improve/reduce all‐cause/blood clot‐related death, because our confidence in the evidence was very low (one study, 40 adults). Harms in relation to the use of low‐molecular‐weight heparin could not be evaluated, because all‐cause/blood clot‐related death, major/clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, or heparin‐induced lowering of platelets were not reported. None of the studies looked at quality of life.  
No studies were found that evaluated any of the other prevention types. We did not look at benefits such as reduction in risk of blood clots, given the low certainty of evidence.

10.1002-14651858.CD013667.pub2,"Background
Self‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury regardless of degree of suicidal intent or other types of motivation) is a growing problem in most countries, often repeated, and associated with suicide. Evidence assessing the effectiveness of interventions in the treatment of SH in children and adolescents is lacking, especially when compared with the evidence for psychosocial interventions in adults. This review therefore updates a previous Cochrane Review (last published in 2015) on the role of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychosocial interventions or pharmacological agents or natural products for SH compared to comparison types of care (e.g. treatment‐as‐usual, routine psychiatric care, enhanced usual care, active comparator, placebo, alternative pharmacological treatment, or a combination of these) for children and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) who engage in SH. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialized Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL] and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [CDSR]), together with MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PsycINFO (to 4 July 2020). 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing specific psychosocial interventions or pharmacological agents or natural products with treatment‐as‐usual (TAU), routine psychiatric care, enhanced usual care (EUC), active comparator, placebo, alternative pharmacological treatment, or a combination of these, in children and adolescents with a recent (within six months of trial entry) episode of SH resulting in presentation to hospital or clinical services. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a repeated episode of SH over a maximum follow‐up period of two years. Secondary outcomes included treatment adherence, depression, hopelessness, general functioning, social functioning, suicidal ideation, and suicide. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised trial quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence internals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CIs. The overall quality of evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. repetition of SH at post‐intervention) was appraised for each intervention using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included data from 17 trials with a total of 2280 participants. Participants in these trials were predominately female (87.6%) with a mean age of 14.7 years (standard deviation (SD) 1.5 years). The trials included in this review investigated the effectiveness of various forms of psychosocial interventions. None of the included trials evaluated the effectiveness of pharmacological agents in this clinical population. There was a lower rate of SH repetition for DBT‐A (30%) as compared to TAU, EUC, or alternative psychotherapy (43%) on repetition of SH at post‐intervention in four trials (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.82; N = 270; k = 4; high‐certainty evidence). There may be no evidence of a difference for individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy and TAU for repetition of SH at post‐intervention (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.12 to 7.24; N = 51; k = 2; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether mentalisation based therapy for adolescents (MBT‐A) reduces repetition of SH at post‐intervention as compared to TAU (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.06 to 8.46; N = 85; k = 2; very low‐certainty evidence). Heterogeneity for this outcome was substantial ( I² = 68%). There is probably no evidence of a difference between family therapy and either TAU or EUC on repetition of SH at post‐intervention (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.07; N = 191; k = 2; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, there was no evidence of a difference for compliance enhancement approaches on repetition of SH by the six‐month follow‐up assessment, for group‐based psychotherapy at the six‐ or 12‐month follow‐up assessments, for a remote contact intervention (emergency cards) at the 12‐month assessment, or for therapeutic assessment at the 12‐ or 24‐month follow‐up assessments. 
Authors' conclusions
Given the moderate or very low quality of the available evidence, and the small number of trials identified, there is only uncertain evidence regarding a number of psychosocial interventions in children and adolescents who engage in SH. Further evaluation of DBT‐A is warranted. Given the evidence for its benefit in adults who engage in SH, individual CBT‐based psychotherapy should also be further developed and evaluated in children and adolescents. 
","## A Look at Treatments for Self-Harm in Young People

### Rationale

Many young people hurt themselves on purpose. This is called self-harm. It can be things like taking too much medicine or cutting their skin. Self-harm is a big problem in many places. It often happens again and again. It can also lead to suicide.

Doctors need to know what treatments work best for young people who self-harm. But there is not much research about this. Most of what we know is about adults. We need to find good ways to help children and teens.

This study looks at different ways to help young people. It checks if certain talks or medicines can stop them from self-harming again. The goal is to find safe and helpful ways to treat them.

### Trial Design

This study looked at how other studies were set up. It gathered information from many different research papers. We call these ""randomized controlled trials."" In these trials, some young people get a certain treatment. Other young people get standard care. This helps us see if the new treatment works better.

This study focused on children and teens up to 18 years old. All of them had self-harmed in the past six months. They had gone to a hospital or clinic because of it. The study looked at if they self-harmed again over two years. It also checked other things. These included how well they followed treatment. It looked at if they felt sad, hopeless, or thought about suicide.

### Results

We looked at 17 studies. These studies included 2280 young people. Most of them were girls (about 9 out of 10). Their average age was about 15 years old.

The studies looked at different types of talking therapies. No studies looked at medicines for self-harm in young people.

One type of therapy worked well. It is called DBT-A. Young people who got DBT-A were less likely to self-harm again. About 3 out of 10 young people who got DBT-A self-harmed again. But about 4 out of 10 who got standard care self-harmed again. This was a clear benefit.

Other types of therapy did not show a clear benefit. It was not clear if CBT-based therapy made a difference. It was also unclear if MBT-A therapy helped. Family therapy did not seem to stop self-harm from happening again.

In some cases, there was not enough clear proof to say if a treatment worked. This means we need more studies to be sure.

### Conclusions

We need more good research on treatments for self-harm in young people. The studies we looked at had some limits. We have some hopeful signs for DBT-A therapy. Doctors should study DBT-A more.

CBT-based therapy helps adults who self-harm. So, doctors should also test this therapy more for children and teens. This will help us find the best ways to keep young people safe and healthy.","Interventions for children and adolescents who self‐harm
We have reviewed the international literature regarding psychosocial interventions, pharmacological (drug), and natural product (dietary supplementation) treatment trials in the field. A total of 17 trials meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. There is little evidence of beneficial effects for individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy, mentalisation‐based therapy for adolescents (MBT‐A), group‐based psychotherapy, enhanced assessment approaches, compliance enhancement approaches, family interventions, or remote contact interventions. There is some evidence of effectiveness for dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT‐A) for adolescents. However, few trials have been conducted and those that have are generally small, meaning that possible beneficial effects of some of these therapies cannot be ruled out. 
Why is this review important? 
Self‐harm (SH), which includes intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is strongly linked with suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed. There has been an increase in the use of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. It is therefore important to assess the evidence for their effectiveness. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Hospital administrators (e.g. service providers), health policy officers and third party payers (e.g. health insurers), clinicians working with patients who engage in SH, patients themselves, and their relatives. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review is an update of a previous Cochrane Review from 2015 which found little evidence of beneficial effects of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. This updated review aims to further evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of interventions for children and adolescents with SH with a broader range of outcomes. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of either psychosocial or drug treatments for children and adolescents up to 18 years of age who had recently engaged in SH. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There have been surprisingly few investigations of treatments for SH in children and adolescents, despite the size of this problem in many countries. We found positive effects of DBT‐A on repetition of SH. There is currently no clear evidence for the effectiveness of individual CBT‐based psychotherapy, MBT‐A, group‐based psychotherapy, enhanced assessment approaches, compliance enhancement approaches, family interventions, or remote contact interventions in preventing repetition of SH. 
What should happen next? 
We recommend further trials of DBT‐A. Given the evidence for its benefit for adults who engage in SH, individual CBT‐based psychotherapy should also be further developed and evaluated in children and adolescents. Given the extent of SH in children and adolescents, greater attention should be paid to the development and evaluation of specific therapies for this population.

10.1002-14651858.CD013225.pub3,"Background
This is an updated version of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2019.
Catamenial epilepsy describes worsening seizures in relation to the menstrual cycle and may affect around 40% of women with epilepsy. Vulnerable days of the menstrual cycle for seizures are perimenstrually (C1 pattern), at ovulation (C2 pattern), and during the luteal phase (C3 pattern). A reduction in progesterone levels premenstrually and reduced secretion during the luteal phase is implicated in catamenial C1 and C3 patterns. A reduction in progesterone has been demonstrated to reduce sensitivity to the inhibitory neurotransmitter in preclinical studies, hence increasing risk of seizures. A pre‐ovulatory surge in oestrogen has been implicated in the C2 pattern of seizure exacerbation, although the exact mechanism by which this surge increases risk is uncertain. Current treatment practices include the use of pulsed hormonal (e.g. progesterone) and non‐hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) in women with regular menses, and complete cessation of menstruation using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone (Depo‐Provera) or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (triptorelin and goserelin)) in women with irregular menses. 
Catamenial epilepsy and seizure exacerbation is common in women with epilepsy. Women may not receive appropriate treatment for their seizures because of uncertainty regarding which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatment should be taken, as well as the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health. This review aims to address these issues to inform clinical practice and future research. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments for seizures exacerbated by the menstrual cycle in women with regular or irregular menses. We synthesised the evidence from randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments in women with catamenial epilepsy of any pattern. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases on 20 July 2021 for the latest update: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 19 July 2021). CRS Web includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the specialised registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Cochrane Epilepsy. We used no language restrictions. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional reports of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs and quasi‐RCTs of blinded or open‐label design that randomised participants individually (i.e. cluster‐randomised trials were excluded). We included cross‐over trials if each treatment period was at least 12 weeks in length and the trial had a suitable wash‐out period. We included the following types of interventions: women with any pattern of catamenial epilepsy who received a hormonal or non‐hormonal drug intervention in addition to an existing antiepileptic drug regimen for a minimum treatment duration of 12 weeks. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on study design factors and participant demographics for the included studies. The primary outcomes of interest were: proportion seizure‐free, proportion of responders (at least 50% decrease in seizure frequency from baseline), and change in seizure frequency. Secondary outcomes included: number of withdrawals, number of women experiencing adverse events of interest (seizure exacerbation, cardiac events, thromboembolic events, osteoporosis and bone health, mood disorders, sedation, menstrual cycle disorders, and fertility issues), and quality of life outcomes. 
Main results
Following title, abstract, and full‐text screening, we included eight full‐text articles reporting on four double‐blind, placebo‐controlled RCTs. We included two cross‐over RCTs of pulsed norethisterone, and two parallel RCTs of pulsed progesterone recruiting a total of 192 women aged between 13 and 45 years with catamenial epilepsy. We found no RCTs for non‐hormonal treatments of catamenial epilepsy or for women with irregular menses. 
Meta‐analysis was not possible for the primary outcomes, therefore we undertook a narrative synthesis. For the two RCTs evaluating norethisterone versus placebo (24 participants), there were no reported treatment differences for change in seizure frequency. Outcomes for the proportion seizure‐free and 50% responders were not reported. For the two RCTs evaluating progesterone versus placebo (168 participants), the studies reported conflicting results for the primary outcomes. One progesterone RCT reported no significant difference between progesterone 600 mg/day taken on day 14 to 28 and placebo with respect to 50% responders, seizure freedom rates, and change in seizure frequency for any seizure type. The other progesterone RCT reported a decrease in seizure frequency from baseline in the progesterone group that was significantly higher than the decrease in seizure frequency from baseline in the placebo group. 
The results of secondary efficacy outcomes showed no significant difference between groups in the pooled progesterone RCTs in terms of treatment withdrawal for any reason (pooled risk ratio (RR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 3.00, P = 0.18, I2 = 0%) or treatment withdrawals due to adverse events (pooled RR 2.91, 95% CI 0.53 to 16.17, P = 0.22, I2 = 0%). No treatment withdrawals were reported from the norethisterone RCTs. The RCTs reported limited information on adverse events, although one progesterone RCT reported no significant difference in the number of women experiencing adverse events (diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, headache, and depression). No studies reported on quality of life. 
We judged the evidence for outcomes related to the included progesterone RCTs to be of low to moderate certainty due to risk of bias, and for outcomes related to the included norethisterone RCTs to be of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and risk of bias. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides very low‐certainty evidence of no treatment difference between norethisterone and placebo, and moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence of no treatment difference between progesterone and placebo for catamenial epilepsy. However, as all the included studies were underpowered, important clinical effects cannot be ruled out. 
Our review highlights an overall deficiency in the literature base on the effectiveness of a wide range of other hormonal and non‐hormonal interventions currently being used in practice, particularly for those women who do not have regular menses. Further clinical trials are needed in this area. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Helping Women with Seizures Linked to Their Period

### Rationale

Many women who have seizures find that their seizures get worse around the time of their period. This is called catamenial epilepsy. About 4 out of 10 women with epilepsy have this problem.

Seizures can worsen at different times during the menstrual cycle. This can be before the period starts, during ovulation (when an egg is released), or in the time after ovulation.

We think changes in a hormone called progesterone might play a role. When progesterone levels drop, it can make seizures more likely. Another hormone, estrogen, may also affect seizures during ovulation.

Women with catamenial epilepsy might not get the right treatment. This is because we don't know which treatments work best. We also worry about how treatments might affect a woman's ability to have children, her periods, bone health, and heart health.

This study wants to find out which treatments are best. This will help doctors and guide future research.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past research on catamenial epilepsy. We wanted to see how different treatments worked.

We searched many health databases for studies. We looked for studies that randomly assigned women to different treatments. This means some women got a treatment, and others got a placebo (a fake treatment).

We included studies that focused on women with catamenial epilepsy. These women were already taking seizure medicine. The studies needed to last at least 12 weeks.

We looked at a few key things. We checked how many women became seizure-free. We also looked at how many women had at least half their seizures stop. We checked if the number of seizures changed.

We also watched for side effects. We looked at how many women stopped their treatment. We checked for serious problems like heart issues or bone problems. We also looked for mood changes, sleepiness, or problems with periods or getting pregnant.

### Results

We found 8 studies that reported on 4 main trials. These studies included 192 women. They were between 13 and 45 years old. All these women had catamenial epilepsy.

Two studies looked at a hormone called norethisterone. Two other studies looked at a hormone called progesterone. All these studies compared the hormone to a fake pill (placebo).

We did not find any studies on non-hormone treatments for catamenial epilepsy. We also found no studies for women with irregular periods.

For the norethisterone studies, we saw no difference in how often seizures happened. The studies did not report if women became seizure-free or if their seizures were cut in half.

For the progesterone studies, the results were mixed. One study found no real difference between progesterone and placebo. This was true for women who had fewer seizures, became seizure-free, or had changes in seizure number. The other study showed that women taking progesterone had fewer seizures than those taking placebo.

When we looked at side effects, there was no major difference between the groups. Not many women stopped treatment because of side effects. The studies did not give much detail on specific side effects. They also did not report on how treatments affected a woman's quality of life.

The evidence for these treatments was not very strong. This means we cannot be fully sure about the results. The studies were too small to show clear effects.

In short, we found no clear proof that norethisterone or progesterone help catamenial epilepsy. But, because the studies were small, we cannot say for sure that they don't help.

This study shows we need more research. We need to look at more treatments, both hormone and non-hormone. This is especially true for women whose periods are not regular.","Treatments for seizures in catamenial (menstrual‐related) epilepsy
Background 
Catamenial (menstrual) epilepsy describes a worsening of seizures in relation to the menstrual cycle and may affect around 40% of women with epilepsy. There are specific times within the menstrual cycle when women are most at risk: in the days leading up to a menstrual period and during a menstrual period (perimenstrual or catamenial type 1 pattern); at the time of ovulation (catamenial type 2 pattern); and in the second half of their cycle (luteal phase, or catamenial type 3 pattern). The reason for this increased risk may relate to changes in the levels of progesterone (a hormone released by the ovaries) around the time of a menstrual period and oestrogen (a female sex hormone) surge around ovulation. Studies in animals have demonstrated that lower progesterone may affect how the brain reacts to the brain chemical gamma‐Aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is important in preventing seizures. The link between high levels of oestrogen and risk of seizures remains unclear. 
Current treatment of catamenial epilepsy depends on whether a woman has regular or irregular menstrual periods. If a woman has regular periods, hormonal (e.g. progesterone supplements) and non‐hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) taken prior to and during a period may be used. In women who do not have regular periods, and who therefore cannot predict their period days, stopping periods using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone (Depo‐Provera) or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (triptorelin and goserelin)) are treatment options. 
Catamenial epilepsy is common in women with epilepsy, and may have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Women may not receive appropriate treatment for their catamenial seizures. There is uncertainty regarding which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatments should be taken. There are also concerns about the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health. This review aimed to address these issues in order to inform clinical practice and future research. 
Objectives 
The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments in stopping seizures in women with catamenial epilepsy. 
Methods 
We searched electronic databases to find relevant studies in which treatment was continued for at least 12 weeks. Our outcomes of interest were: average change in seizures, percentage of women achieving a reduction in seizures by at least 50%, and percentage of women who became seizure‐free. We also examined the reasons why women dropped out of the studies and any reported side effects. 
Results 
We included four randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of hormonal treatments in the review, two trials evaluating progesterone and two evaluating norethisterone. In all of these studies, the treatment was compared to a placebo (a harmless sugar pill). We did not find any studies testing non‐hormonal treatments or any studies in women with irregular periods. The four included studies involved a total of 192 women aged between 13 and 45 years experiencing catamenial epilepsy. The included studies did not demonstrate any significant differences between groups when comparing progesterone or norethisterone to placebo for seizure outcomes. The included studies reported limited information on side effects, but women taking progesterone were no more likely to withdraw from the study due to side effects than those receiving placebo. 
The evidence is current to July 2021.
Certainty of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low to moderate, as the included studies provided unclear information on methods of blinding, recruited small numbers of participants, and were inconsistent in reporting treatment outcomes. 
Conclusions 
We found very limited, mostly low‐certainty evidence, of no difference in seizure outcomes for norethisterone and progesterone versus placebo in women with catamenial epilepsy. Our review highlights an overall lack of information on the effectiveness of a wide range of other hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments currently being used. Further studies in women with catamenial epilepsy are needed in this area.

10.1002-14651858.CD003737.pub4,"What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia (an eye co‐ordination problem that starts in childhood)? 
Key messages 
· Covering one eye with a patch improves the eye co‐ordination of children with intermittent exotropia more effectively than regular monitoring by an eye specialist. 
· Few studies have compared other treatments for intermittent exotropia, and those that have do not provide clear answers about their benefits and risks. 
· Well‐conducted studies are needed in this area to improve the management of intermittent exotropia. 
What is intermittent exotropia? 
Intermittent exotropia is an eye condition that develops in the first year of life. It causes one or both eyes to turn out toward the ear, typically when a child looks into the distance, daydreams, is tired, or is in bright sunlight. Only one eye turns out at a time, while the other eye points straight forwards. This can happen infrequently, or regularly throughout the day. 
What treatments are available for intermittent exotropia? 
Regular monitoring (observation) by an eye specialist may be all that is needed when a child’s eyes point in the same direction most of the time, or when intermittent exotropia does not affect vision. 
For children with more severe intermittent exotropia, several treatments are available, including: 
· eye exercises, to improve a child’s control over their eye movements;
· glasses, to encourage the eyes to work together;
· eye muscle surgery, to adjust the position of the eyes; and
· covering one eye with a patch, to strengthen the other eye.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out:
· which treatment works best for intermittent exotropia; and
· whether treatments cause any unwanted (adverse) effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared different treatments for intermittent exotropia against each other. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 6 studies that involved a total of 890 people who were mostly children aged 12 months to 10 years. The studies followed people for between six months and three years, and took place in the USA (four studies), India (one study), and Turkey (one study). The studies compared: 
· patching against observation (two studies); and
· different treatments involving surgery (four studies).
Patching compared to observation 
The evidence:
· shows that patching is better than observation for improving eye co‐ordination; and 
· suggests that patching and observation may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision. 
Different surgical procedures 
The evidence suggests that:
· surgery on the muscles that control the outward movement of both eyes is probably better for improving eye co‐ordination than surgery on the muscles that control both inward and outward movement in one eye; 
· these two procedures may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision and quality of life, and may lead to similar numbers of adverse effects (such as small lumps under the skin); and 
· there may be little to no difference in effect on eye co‐ordination when looking at distant objects between surgical procedures on the inside of the eye (‘plication’ and ‘resection’) when combined with surgery on the outside of the eye. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The evidence is based on a small number of studies, and several studies may have used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. In general, the studies provided limited information about the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia. For example, they often did not investigate adverse effects or effects on sharpness of vision at a distance and quality of life. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is current to January 2021.

## Plain Title
Learning About Eye Patching for Children's Eyes

## Rationale
Sometimes, a child’s eyes do not work well together. This problem is called intermittent exotropia. It means one or both eyes turn out. The eye turns out toward the ear. This can happen when a child is tired. It can also happen when looking far away. Or it happens in bright sunlight. This condition starts when a child is very young. It can make it hard for eyes to work together.

Doctors want to find the best ways to help these children. They want to know what treatments work. They also want to know if treatments cause problems. This study looks at different ways to treat this eye problem. We need to find treatments that help eyes work together better. Patching one eye might help make the other eye stronger.

## Trial Design
How did we do this study? We looked at many past studies. We searched for studies about treating intermittent exotropia. We wanted to find studies that compared treatments. We checked how good these studies were. We looked at how they did their research. We also checked how many people were in each study.

The studies we found included 890 people. Most of them were children. They were 1 year old to 10 years old. These studies watched people for 6 months to 3 years. They took place in the USA, India, and Turkey. Some studies compared patching an eye to just watching. Other studies looked at different eye surgeries.

## Results
What did we find out? We learned some key things.

**Patching an eye:** Covering one eye with a patch helps. It helps children's eyes work together better. This is better than just watching the eyes. Patching might not change how well a child sees up close.

**Eye Surgery:** There are different types of eye surgery. Surgery on both eyes' outer muscles works well. It helps eyes work together more. This might be better than surgery on one eye's inner and outer muscles. Both types of surgery seem to have similar side effects. These could be small bumps under the skin. They also seem to affect close-up vision the same way. The quality of life for the child also seemed similar.

We also looked at some other surgeries. These were on the inside and outside of the eye. They seemed to work about the same for far vision.

**What this means:** Patching can help children with this eye problem. More studies are needed to learn more. We need to know more about the pros and cons of all treatments. Doctors want to find the very best ways to help children. They want to make sure treatments are safe. They also want to make sure treatments help eyes work well.

This study used information up to January 2021.","What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia (an eye co‐ordination problem that starts in childhood)? 
Key messages 
· Covering one eye with a patch improves the eye co‐ordination of children with intermittent exotropia more effectively than regular monitoring by an eye specialist. 
· Few studies have compared other treatments for intermittent exotropia, and those that have do not provide clear answers about their benefits and risks. 
· Well‐conducted studies are needed in this area to improve the management of intermittent exotropia. 
What is intermittent exotropia? 
Intermittent exotropia is an eye condition that develops in the first year of life. It causes one or both eyes to turn out toward the ear, typically when a child looks into the distance, daydreams, is tired, or is in bright sunlight. Only one eye turns out at a time, while the other eye points straight forwards. This can happen infrequently, or regularly throughout the day. 
What treatments are available for intermittent exotropia? 
Regular monitoring (observation) by an eye specialist may be all that is needed when a child’s eyes point in the same direction most of the time, or when intermittent exotropia does not affect vision. 
For children with more severe intermittent exotropia, several treatments are available, including: 
· eye exercises, to improve a child’s control over their eye movements;
· glasses, to encourage the eyes to work together;
· eye muscle surgery, to adjust the position of the eyes; and
· covering one eye with a patch, to strengthen the other eye.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out:
· which treatment works best for intermittent exotropia; and
· whether treatments cause any unwanted (adverse) effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared different treatments for intermittent exotropia against each other. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 6 studies that involved a total of 890 people who were mostly children aged 12 months to 10 years. The studies followed people for between six months and three years, and took place in the USA (four studies), India (one study), and Turkey (one study). The studies compared: 
· patching against observation (two studies); and
· different treatments involving surgery (four studies).
Patching compared to observation 
The evidence:
· shows that patching is better than observation for improving eye co‐ordination; and 
· suggests that patching and observation may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision. 
Different surgical procedures 
The evidence suggests that:
· surgery on the muscles that control the outward movement of both eyes is probably better for improving eye co‐ordination than surgery on the muscles that control both inward and outward movement in one eye; 
· these two procedures may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision and quality of life, and may lead to similar numbers of adverse effects (such as small lumps under the skin); and 
· there may be little to no difference in effect on eye co‐ordination when looking at distant objects between surgical procedures on the inside of the eye (‘plication’ and ‘resection’) when combined with surgery on the outside of the eye. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The evidence is based on a small number of studies, and several studies may have used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. In general, the studies provided limited information about the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia. For example, they often did not investigate adverse effects or effects on sharpness of vision at a distance and quality of life. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is current to January 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD012470.pub2,"Interventions for treating wrist fractures (broken wrists) in children
Background and aim 
Wrist fractures are the most common bone injury in children. Most are buckle (or torus) fractures, where the bone surface bulges out. These minor fractures heal well. They are often treated with a wrist splint or a below‐elbow plaster cast.  More serious fractures are where the bone breaks, generally resulting in displacement of the bone parts. Usually the bone is manipulated back into place ('reduction'), followed by cast immobilisation, often with an above‐elbow cast including the elbow. When considered, surgery generally involves placing wires through the skin and into the bone (percutaneous wiring). 
We aimed to assess the best‐quality evidence for different treatments of wrist fractures in children. 
Results of the search 
We searched medical databases up to May 2018 and included 30 studies with 2930 children. Studies included more male children and reported mean ages between eight and 10 years. We summarise the results from five key comparisons. 
Key results 
Six studies compared a removable splint with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. One study found there may be little or no difference between the two devices in physical function at four weeks. Few children needed a change or reapplication of either splint or cast (4 studies). There were no refractures. We are uncertain whether there is any difference in pain during device use. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate time to return to former activities (recovery time), minor complications, and child or parent satisfaction. Two studies found lower healthcare costs for splints. 
Four studies compared a soft or elasticated bandage with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. We are uncertain if there is less disability at four weeks after bandaging. Few children changed device or needed extended immobilisation (3 studies). There were no serious adverse events. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate recovery time, wrist pain, minor complications, and satisfaction. Children found the bandage more convenient (1 study). 
Two studies (mainly buckle fractures) compared cast removal at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (a cast saw was not required for home removal). All had recovered function at four weeks (1 study). There were few treatment changes and no serious adverse effects. Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There may be no difference in pain at four weeks (1 study). There may be greater parental satisfaction for cast removal at home (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. 
Four studies compared below‐elbow versus above‐elbow casts in usually displaced fractures. We are uncertain if children are less dependent on help when using below‐elbow casts. We are uncertain if there is a difference between the two casts in physical function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain about the finding that all children with above‐elbow casts needed another fracture reduction. There were no serious adverse events. Recovery time and minor complications were not reported. There may be little difference in needing physiotherapy for stiffness. Pain at one week may be less for below‐elbow casts (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for below‐elbow casts. 
Five studies compared percutaneous wiring and above‐elbow cast immobilisation versus above‐elbow cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures. Short‐term physical function was not reported. There may be no between‐group difference in function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain whether surgery reduces the risk of treatment failure, defined as early or difficult removal of wires, and remanipulation for loss in position. We are uncertain whether there are fewer serious adverse events with surgery. Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There may be less need for physiotherapy after surgery. One USA study found treatment costs were similar. 
Quality of the evidence 
All 30 studies had weaknesses that could affect the reliability of their results. We considered the evidence for all outcomes to be low or very low quality. 
Conclusion 
There is not enough evidence to determine the best ways of treating different types of wrist fractures in children. However, the review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for buckle fractures. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Helping Kids With Broken Wrists

### Rationale

Broken wrists are a common problem for kids. Most of these breaks are not severe. The bone may bulge out a bit, but it heals well. Doctors often treat these minor breaks with a wrist brace or a cast that goes below the elbow.

More serious breaks mean the bone is fully broken. The parts of the bone may not line up. Doctors usually move the bone back into place. This is called ""reduction."" Then, they put on a cast. This cast might go above the elbow. For very serious breaks, doctors might put wires through the skin into the bone. This is called ""percutaneous wiring.""

We want to find the best ways to treat wrist breaks in children. We looked at past studies to see what works best. Our goal is to find the best care for children with broken wrists.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many past studies about broken wrists in kids. We searched medical records up to May 2018. We found 30 studies. These studies included 2,930 children. Most of the children were boys. Their ages were usually between 8 and 10 years old.

We focused on five main ways doctors treat these breaks. We compared different types of braces, casts, and if surgery was better. We looked at how well kids could move their wrists. We also looked at pain, other problems, and how happy kids and parents were. This study did not involve new patients. It reviewed what was already known.

### Results

We found some key things from the studies:

**Brace vs. Below-Elbow Cast for Minor Breaks:**
* Six studies compared a soft brace to a cast below the elbow.
* There was little to no change in how kids used their hand after four weeks.
* Few children needed a new brace or cast.
* No children broke their wrist again.
* We are not sure if one was better for pain.
* We do not know how fast kids got back to normal.
* Two studies found braces cost less than casts.

**Soft Bandage vs. Below-Elbow Cast for Minor Breaks:**
* Four studies looked at a soft bandage against a below-elbow cast.
* We are not sure if bandages helped kids more at four weeks.
* Few children needed a different device or more time with the device.
* No serious problems happened.
* Kids found bandages easier to use.

**Taking Cast Off at Home vs. Hospital:**
* Two studies looked at taking casts off at home. Parents did this.
* All kids could use their hand well after four weeks.
* Few changes were needed. No serious problems happened.
* It may have cost less to take casts off at home.
* Parents may have been happier taking casts off at home.

**Below-Elbow Cast vs. Above-Elbow Cast for Serious Breaks:**
* Four studies compared casts above and below the elbow. These were for more serious breaks.
* We are not sure if kids needed less help with below-elbow casts.
* We are not sure if one cast was better for hand use after six months.
* Pain at one week might be less with below-elbow casts.
* One study found below-elbow casts cost less.

**Surgery (Wires) Plus Cast vs. Cast Alone for Serious Breaks:**
* Five studies looked at surgery plus a cast, or just a cast. This was for serious breaks.
* We are not sure if surgery helped avoid problems. This includes wires coming out or the bone moving again.
* We are not sure if surgery caused fewer serious problems.
* Kids may need less physical therapy after surgery.
* One study found that costs for surgery and a cast were about the same as just a cast.

**Overall, we found that many studies had problems.** This means their results might not be fully true. So, we do not have enough strong proof to say what the best treatment is.

However, the results do show a trend. For minor breaks, doctors are moving away from casts. They are using braces or bandages more. This is good news for kids with these types of broken wrists.","Interventions for treating wrist fractures (broken wrists) in children

","## Plain Language Summary: Making Work Safer for Builders

### Plain Title

Making work safer for builders.

### Rationale

Building sites can be very risky places. Many people who work in construction get hurt on the job. In fact, more builders get hurt than workers in other big jobs.

Many groups have ideas to stop these injuries. But we are not sure if these ideas truly help. We need to know what works best.

This study looked at ways to make building sites safer. We wanted to find out which plans actually cut down on injuries. We hoped to find good ways to keep builders safe.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. It was like collecting all the puzzle pieces to see the full picture. We searched for all studies about keeping construction workers safe. We wanted to know what kinds of plans people tried.

We looked at things like new rules, safety ads, training, checks, and health help. We also looked at money given to companies. We wanted to see if these things stopped injuries. We focused on studies published up to April 1, 2017.

We checked how good each study was. This helped us know how much to trust the results. We included 17 studies in total.

### Results

We found some interesting things. Just making new rules by themselves might not stop injuries. This includes injuries that are not deadly and those that are.

Ideas that focus on a whole region, like big safety ads or checks, might not work well. These might not stop injuries that are not deadly.

But, plans with many different parts seemed to help. For example, a safety plan with many steps could reduce injuries. A plan to keep the workplace drug-free also helped. Giving money to companies to get safer tools, like new scaffolds, seemed to cut down on injuries that are not deadly.

The studies we found were not very strong. This means we need more good studies. We need more proof for many safety ideas. Many safety guides and experts suggest these ideas.

We also need to find ways to make sure builders and bosses follow safety rules. This study helps us learn more about keeping builders safe. It shows that some plans work better than others. It also tells us where we need more research.","Interventions to reduce injuries in construction workers

10.1002-14651858.CD013230,"Background
Oral poisoning is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide, with estimates of over 100,000 deaths due to unintentional poisoning each year and an overrepresentation of children below five years of age. Any effective intervention that laypeople can apply to limit or delay uptake or to evacuate, dilute or neutralize the poison before professional help arrives may limit toxicity and save lives. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of pre‐hospital interventions (alone or in combination) for treating acute oral poisoning, available to and feasible for laypeople before the arrival of professional help. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and three clinical trials registries to 4 December 2018, and we also carried out reference checking and citation searching. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials comparing interventions (alone or in combination) that are feasible in a pre‐hospital setting for treating acute oral poisoning patients, including but potentially not limited to activated charcoal (AC), emetics, cathartics, diluents, neutralizing agents and body positioning. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, data collection and assessment. Primary outcomes of this review were incidence of mortality and adverse events, plus incidence and severity of symptoms of poisoning. Secondary outcomes were duration of symptoms of poisoning, drug absorption, and incidence of hospitalization and ICU admission. 
Main results
We included 24 trials involving 7099 participants. Using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, we assessed no study as being at low risk of bias for all domains. Many studies were poorly reported, so the risk of selection and detection biases were often unclear. Most studies reported important outcomes incompletely, and we judged them to be at high risk of reporting bias. 
All but one study enrolled oral poisoning patients in an emergency department; the remaining study was conducted in a pre‐hospital setting. Fourteen studies included multiple toxic syndromes or did not specify, while the other studies specifically investigated paracetamol (2 studies), carbamazepine (2 studies), tricyclic antidepressant (2 studies), yellow oleander (2 studies), benzodiazepine (1 study), or toxic berry intoxication (1 study). Twenty‐one trials investigated the effects of activated charcoal (AC), administered as a single dose (SDAC) or in multiple doses (MDAC), alone or in combination with other first aid interventions (a cathartic) and/or hospital treatments. Six studies investigated syrup of ipecac plus other first aid interventions (SDAC + cathartic) versus ipecac alone. The collected evidence was mostly of low to very low certainty, often downgraded for indirectness, risk of bias or imprecision due to low numbers of events. 
First aid interventions that limit or delay the absorption of the poison in the body 
We are uncertain about the effect of SDAC compared to no intervention on the incidence of adverse events in general (zero events in both treatment groups; 1 study, 451 participants) or vomiting specifically (Peto odds ratio (OR) 4.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 57.26, 1 study, 25 participants), ICU admission (Peto OR 7.77, 95% CI 0.15 to 391.93, 1 study, 451 participants) and clinical deterioration (zero events in both treatment groups; 1 study, 451 participants) in participants with mixed types or paracetamol poisoning, as all evidence for these outcomes was of very low certainty. No studies assessed SDAC for mortality, duration of symptoms, drug absorption or hospitalization. 
Only one study compared SDAC to syrup of ipecac in participants with mixed types of poisoning, providing very low‐certainty evidence. Therefore we are uncertain about the effects on Glasgow Coma Scale scores (mean difference (MD) −0.15, 95% CI −0.43 to 0.13, 1 study, 34 participants) or incidence of adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% CI 0.26 to 5.83, 1 study, 34 participants). No information was available concerning mortality, duration of symptoms, drug absorption, hospitalization or ICU admission. 
This review also considered the added value of SDAC or MDAC to hospital interventions, which mostly included gastric lavage. No included studies investigated the use of body positioning in oral poisoning patients. 
First aid interventions that evacuate the poison from the gastrointestinal tract 
We found one study comparing ipecac versus no intervention in toxic berry ingestion in a pre‐hospital setting. Low‐certainty evidence suggests there may be an increase in the incidence of adverse events, but the study did not report incidence of mortality, incidence or duration of symptoms of poisoning, drug absorption, hospitalization or ICU admission (103 participants). 
In addition, we also considered the added value of syrup of ipecac to SDAC plus a cathartic and the added value of a cathartic to SDAC. 
No studies used cathartics as an individual intervention.
First aid interventions that neutralize or dilute the poison 
No included studies investigated the neutralization or dilution of the poison in oral poisoning patients. 
Authors' conclusions
The studies included in this review provided mostly low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence about the use of first aid interventions for acute oral poisoning. A key limitation was the fact that only one included study actually took place in a pre‐hospital setting, which undermines our confidence in the applicability of these results to this setting. Thus, the amount of evidence collected was insufficient to draw any conclusions. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title
First Aid for Poisoning: What Works Before Help Arrives?

### Rationale
Swallowing poison is a big problem around the world. It can cause serious harm and even death. Many young kids are hurt by poisoning each year.

When someone swallows poison, time is key. Quick actions can stop the poison from hurting the body. It can also save lives. This is before doctors can help.

We looked at simple first aid steps. These are steps anyone can take right away. They can help get the poison out. They can also stop it from being absorbed. This study aimed to see if these steps really work. We wanted to know if they make a difference for people who swallow poison.

### Trial Design
This study looked at other research. It collected facts from many past studies. We wanted to find studies about first aid for swallowed poison. These studies had to be about steps people can take at home. This is before medics or doctors arrive.

We looked for studies where people got different kinds of help. Some got ""activated charcoal."" This is a special powder that soaks up poison. Others got medicine to make them throw up. Some studies looked at other simple methods.

The people in these studies had swallowed poison. They were of all ages. Many studies looked at people in the emergency room. Only one study looked at people before they got to the hospital. We wanted to see how these first aid steps affected them. We checked if they lived or got worse. We also looked at other side effects.

### Results
We found 24 studies to review. These studies had over 7000 people in them. Most of the studies did not give clear results. It was hard to be sure about what worked. Many studies did not share all their information.

Most studies looked at activated charcoal. This charcoal can soak up poison. We found it hard to say if it helped or not. The results were not clear enough. For example, one study with 451 people saw no bad effects with charcoal. But the proof was weak. No studies showed if charcoal stopped deaths.

One study looked at medicine to make people throw up. This was for kids who ate toxic berries. It seemed to cause more bad effects. But the proof for this was also weak.

Our main finding is that we do not have enough good facts. We cannot say for sure which first aid steps work best. Most studies did not happen in real-life home settings. This means we cannot say if these steps will help before doctors arrive. We need more clear studies to find out.","First aid treatments for oral poisoning
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of first aid treatments for poisoning that could be feasibly given by people who are not health professionals. 
Background 
Many first aid treatments are recommended for treating people who have ingested poisonous substances. Some treatments, such as activated charcoal (AC), bind to the poison, limiting the body's absorption of it. Others may induce vomiting (such as syrup of ipecac) or dilute or neutralize the poison (such as drinking water, milk or juices). Adjusting the person's body position may also have an effect. 
Study characteristics 
In December 2018 we searched for high‐quality studies (randomly dividing participants into different treatment groups) investigating treatments for poisoning that laypeople can perform. We found 24 studies with 7099 participants. All but one study took place in hospitals; the remaining one was in a home setting. 
Fourteen studies either did not specify the type of poison or studied different kinds. The others investigated overdoses of specific medicines (paracetamol, carbamazepine, antidepressant, benzodiazepine) or poisonous plants (yellow oleander or poisonous berries). 
Twenty‐one trials studied different treatments with activated charcoal: as a single dose or multiple doses, with or without other first aid treatments (a substance to speed up bowel transit), and with or without hospital treatments. Six studies compared syrup of ipecac, with or without other first aid treatments (single‐dose activated charcoal plus bowel transit enhancing substance) versus no treatment. We found no studies that investigated the neutralization or dilution of the poison or the use of certain body positions. 
Key results 
Two studies compared a single dose of activated charcoal to no treatment following poisoning with paracetamol or different kinds of poisoning. We are uncertain about the treatment's side effects, admission to intensive care or worsening of the patient, and there was no information about effects on death, symptom duration, poison uptake or hospitalization. 
One study compared a single dose of activated charcoal to ipecac in mixed types of poisoning. We are uncertain about the effect of activated charcoal compared to ipecac, on the patient's level of coma or the number of unwanted effects. There was no information about effects on death, symptom duration, poison uptake, hospitalization or intensive care admission. 
One study compared ipecac to no treatment in children who ate poisonous berries at home. There may be an increase in the number of unwanted effects for ipecac. There was no information about effects on death, poisoning symptoms, symptoms duration, poison uptake, hospitalization or intensive care admission. 
We also investigated the use of single‐dose or multi‐dose activated charcoal, with or without hospital treatment, compared to each other or no treatment. Furthermore, we investigated the added value of ipecac to single‐dose activated charcoal and the added value of adding bowel transit enhancing substances to AC. 
Certainty of the evidence 
All but one study took place in a hospital setting, which means that the results cannot be directly applied to the lay setting. Because studies did not always report the methods they used, we are uncertain about the quality of the research conduct for many. Outcomes important to patients and pre‐specified by us as important outcomes for this review were often absent or incompletely reported. Our certainty about the results of this review is mostly low to very low. Therefore future research is highly likely to change the findings. 
Conclusion 
Based on the identified evidence, we cannot draw any conclusions about the effects of any of the investigated first aid treatments in a lay setting.

Viral load (VL) testing in people living with HIV (PLHIV) helps to monitor antiretroviral therapy (ART). VL is still largely tested using central laboratory‐based platforms, which have long test turnaround times and involve sophisticated equipment. VL tests with point‐of‐care (POC) platforms capable of being used near the patient are potentially easy to use, give quick results, are cost‐effective, and could replace central or reference VL testing platforms. 
Objectives
To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of POC tests to detect high viral load levels in PLHIV attending healthcare facilities. 
Search methods
We searched eight electronic databases using standard, extensive Cochrane search methods, and did not use any language, document type, or publication status limitations. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and consulted an expert in the field from the World Health Organization (WHO) HIV Department for potentially relevant studies. The latest search was 23 November 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included any primary study that compared the results of a VL test with a POC platform to that of a central laboratory‐based reference test to detect high viral load in PLHIV on HIV/AIDS care or follow‐up. We included all forms of POC tests for VL as defined by study authors, regardless of the healthcare facility in which the test was conducted. We excluded diagnostic case‐control studies with healthy controls and studies that did not provide sufficient data to create the 2 × 2 tables to calculate sensitivity and specificity. We did not limit our study inclusion to age, gender, or geographical setting. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the search results to identify eligible articles. They also independently extracted data using a standardized data extraction form and conducted risk of bias assessment using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool. Using participants as the unit of analysis, we fitted simplified univariable models for sensitivity and specificity separately, employing a random‐effects model to estimate the summary sensitivity and specificity at the current and commonly reported World Health Organization (WHO) threshold (≥ 1000 copies/mL). The bivariate models did not converge to give a model estimate. 
Main results
We identified 18 studies (24 evaluations, 10,034 participants) defining high viral loads at main thresholds ≥ 1000 copies/mL (n = 20), ≥ 5000 copies/mL (n = 1), and ≥ 40 copies/mL (n = 3). All evaluations were done on samples from PLHIV retrieved from routine HIV/AIDS care centres or health facilities. For clinical applicability, we included 14 studies (20 evaluations, 8659 participants) assessing high viral load at the clinical threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL in the meta‐analyses. Of these, sub‐Saharan Africa, Europe, and Asia contributed 16, three, and one evaluation respectively. All included participants were on ART in only nine evaluations; in the other 11 evaluations the proportion of participants on ART was either partial or not clearly stated. Thirteen evaluations included adults only (n = 13), five mixed populations of adults and children, whilst in the remaining two the age of included populations was not clearly stated. The majority of evaluations included commercially available tests (n = 18). Ten evaluations were POC VL tests conducted near the patient in a peripheral or onsite laboratory, whilst the other 10 were evaluations of POC VL tests in a central or reference laboratory setting. The test types evaluated as POC VL tests included Xpert HIV‐1 Viral Load test (n = 8), SAMBA HIV‐1 Semi‐Q Test (n = 9), Alere Q NAT prototype assay for HIV‐1 (n = 2) and m‐PIMA HIV‐1/2 Viral Load test (n = 1). The majority of evaluations (n = 17) used plasma samples, whilst the rest (n = 3) utilized whole blood samples. 
Pooled sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI)) of POC VL at a threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL was 96.6% (94.8 to 97.8) (20 evaluations, 2522 participants), and pooled specificity (95% CI) was 95.7% (90.8 to 98.0) (20 evaluations, 6137 participants). Median prevalence for high viral load (≥ 1000 copies/mL) (n = 20) was 33.4% (range 6.9% to 88.5%). 
Limitations 
The risk of bias was mostly assessed as unclear across the four domains due to incomplete reporting. 
Authors' conclusions
We found POC VL to have high sensitivity and high specificity for the diagnosis of high HIV viral load in PLHIV attending healthcare facilities at a clinical threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Simple Title: Quick HIV Test Is Good

### Rationale

**What is HIV and why is testing important?**

HIV is a virus that can make people sick. Doctors use medicine to treat HIV. This medicine is called ART. It helps control the virus in a person's body.

To know if ART is working, doctors check how much virus is in the blood. This is called a viral load test. If the viral load is high, it means the medicine might not be working as well.

**What is the problem with current tests?**

Right now, many viral load tests are done in big labs. Sending samples to these labs takes a long time. It also needs special machines. This means people wait longer for results. They also have to go back to the clinic. This can be hard for patients.

**Why do we need a new way to test?**

We need a faster and easier way to test viral load. A new type of test is called a ""point-of-care"" (POC) test. This test can be done right where the patient is. It gives quick results. It is also often cheaper. This could make it easier for people with HIV to get tested and stay healthy.

**What did this study want to find out?**

This study wanted to see how well these quick POC tests work. We wanted to know if they can find high levels of the HIV virus as well as the usual lab tests. We believed that these quick tests would be just as good.

### Trial Design

**How was this study designed?**

This study looked at many other studies. It gathered information from them. We looked for studies that compared the new quick POC tests to the standard lab tests. We wanted to see if both tests gave similar results.

**Who was in these studies?**

The studies included people living with HIV. These people were getting care at clinics. They were of all ages, both adults and children. We did not limit the studies by where they were done.

**What did the studies compare?**

Each study looked at a new quick POC test. Then, they compared its results to a standard lab test. They wanted to see if the POC test could correctly find if someone had a ""high viral load."" A high viral load means there are many virus particles in the blood.

**How long did people stay in these studies?**

This was not a study where people joined for a set time. Instead, we looked at past studies. These past studies each collected data from patients over their own timeframes. We just looked at the results they already had.

### Results

**What did the study find out?**

We looked at 18 studies. These studies included more than 10,000 people. They tested the quick POC tests. These tests looked for high levels of HIV virus.

**Did the quick tests work well?**

Yes, the quick POC tests worked very well. They were very good at finding people with high viral loads.

*   When a person had a high viral load, the quick test found it 96 times out of 100. This is called sensitivity.
*   When a person did not have a high viral load, the quick test correctly said they did not 95 times out of 100. This is called specificity.

These numbers mean the quick tests are almost as good as the regular lab tests.

**What types of quick tests were used?**

Many different quick tests were studied. Some common ones were Xpert HIV-1, SAMBA HIV-1, and Alere Q. Most studies used blood plasma. Some used whole blood.

**What does this mean for patients?**

This study shows that quick POC tests can help people with HIV.

*   They can get test results faster.
*   They might not have to wait as long for doctors to know if their medicine is working.
*   This could lead to quicker changes in medicine if needed.

**What is the main message from this study?**

Doctors concluded that these quick tests are good. They can correctly find high levels of HIV. This means they can be used to help manage HIV care. They can make testing easier and faster for people living with HIV.","Point‐of‐care tests for detecting high viral load in people living with HIV attending healthcare facilities 
Why is improving the diagnosis of high HIV viral load infection important? 
It helps to monitor the HIV virus levels in people living with HIV (PLHIV) who are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). High virus levels indicate that the medications are failing to suppress the virus, a condition known as ART treatment failure, which has a risk of severe illness and death. Rapid diagnostic tests that detect high HIV virus levels quickly near the patient (point‐of‐care) can increase access to early changes in ART. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of point‐of‐care (POC) tests for diagnosing high HIV virus levels in PLHIV attending healthcare facilities. 
What was studied in this review? 
Point‐of‐care tests for viral load detection with results measured against central laboratory tests (reference test). We included all forms of tests with POC platforms for VL regardless of the healthcare facility in which the test was conducted. 
What are the main results in this review? 
Fourteen studies that completed 20 evaluations involving 8659 participants compared molecular POC tests for diagnosing high virus levels at the clinically recommended positivity threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL. 
What are the strengths and limitations of this review? 
The review included sufficient studies done on samples from PLHIV retrieved from routine HIV/AIDS care centres or health facilities, but it was unclear if all included participants were on ART. Also, none of the included tests was a true POC test conducted at the patient's side: half of the included studies (n = 10) evaluated POC tests in onsite laboratories near the patient, and the other half were tests with POC platforms evaluated in a central or reference laboratory (n = 10). 
To whom do the results of this review apply? 
PLHIV with suspected high viral loads attending healthcare facilities.
What are the implications of this review? 
In theory, for a population of 1000 PLHIV where 100 have high virus levels, 136 people would receive a positive result with the molecular POC test; of these, 39 will not have high viral levels (false‐positive result) and would be incorrectly identified as not responding to ART treatment, possibly leading to unnecessary testing or further treatment; and 864 would receive a negative test result with the molecular POC test; of these, three will actually have high virus levels (false‐negative result) and would be missed whilst failing ART treatment. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 23 November 2020.
"
10.1002-14651858.CD013196.pub2,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, including bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic condition causing shortness of breath, cough, and exacerbations leading to poor health outcomes. Face‐to‐face visits with health professionals can be hindered by severity of COPD or frailty, and by people living at a distance from their healthcare provider and having limited access to services. Telehealth technologies aimed at providing health care remotely through monitoring and consultations could help to improve health outcomes of people with COPD. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of telehealth interventions that allow remote monitoring and consultation and multi‐component interventions for reducing exacerbations and improving quality of life, while reducing dyspnoea symptoms, hospital service utilisation, and death among people with COPD. 
Search methods
We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register. Additional sources searched included the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the IEEEX Xplore Digital Library. The latest search was conducted in April 2020. We used the GRADE approach to judge the certainty of evidence for outcomes. 
Selection criteria
Eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included adults with diagnosed COPD. Asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and other respiratory conditions were excluded. Interventions included remote monitoring or consultation plus usual care, remote monitoring or consultation alone, and mult‐component interventions from all care settings. Quality of life scales included St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). The dyspnoea symptom scale used was the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire Self‐Administered Standardized Scale (CRQ‐SAS). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We assessed confidence in the evidence for each primary outcome using the GRADE method. Primary outcomes were exacerbations, quality of life, dyspnoea symptoms, hospital service utilisation, and mortality; a secondary outcome consisted of adverse events. 
Main results
We included 29 studies in the review (5654 participants; male proportion 36% to 96%; female proportion 4% to 61%). Most remote monitoring interventions required participants to transfer measurements using a remote device and later health professional review (asynchronous). Only five interventions transferred data and allowed review by health professionals in real time (synchronous). Studies were at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. We found no evidence on comparison of remote consultations with or without usual care. 
Remote monitoring plus usual care (8 studies, 1033 participants)  
Very uncertain evidence suggests that remote monitoring plus usual care may have little to no effect on the number of people experiencing exacerbations at 26 weeks or 52 weeks. There may be little to no difference in effect on quality of life (SGRQ) at 26 weeks (very low to low certainty) or on hospitalisation (all‐cause or COPD‐related; very low certainty). COPD‐related hospital re‐admissions are probably reduced at 26 weeks (hazard ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.93; 106 participants; moderate certainty). There may be little to no difference in deaths between intervention and usual care (very low certainty). We found no evidence for dyspnoea symptoms or adverse events. 
Remote monitoring alone (10 studies, 2456 participants)  
Very uncertain evidence suggests that remote monitoring may result in little to no effect on the number of people experiencing exacerbations at 41 weeks (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.55). There may be little to no effect on quality of life (SGRQ total at 17 weeks, or CAT at 38 and 52 weeks; very low certainty). There may be little to no effect on dyspnoea symptoms on the CRQ‐SAS at 26 weeks (low certainty). There may be no difference in effects on the number of people admitted to hospital (very low certainty) or on deaths (very low certainty). We found no evidence for adverse events. 
Multi‐component interventions with remote monitoring or consultation component (11 studies, 2165 participants)  
Very uncertain evidence suggests that multi‐component interventions may have little to no effect on the number of people experiencing exacerbations at 52 weeks. Quality of life at 13 weeks may improve as seen in SGRQ total score (mean difference ‐9.70, 95% CI ‐18.32 to ‐1.08; 38 participants; low certainty) but not at 26 or 52 weeks (very low certainty). COPD assessment test (CAT) scores may improve at a mean of 38 weeks, but evidence is very uncertain and interventions are varied. 
There may be little to no effect on the number of people admitted to hospital at 33 weeks (low certainty). Multi‐component interventions are likely to result in fewer people re‐admitted to hospital at a mean of 39 weeks (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.81; 344 participants, 3 studies; moderate certainty). There may be little to no difference in death at a mean of 40 weeks (very low certainty). There may be little to no effect on people experiencing adverse events (very low certainty). We found no evidence for dyspnoea symptoms. 
Authors' conclusions
Remote monitoring plus usual care provided asynchronously may not be beneficial overall compared to usual care alone. Some benefit is seen in reduction of COPD‐related hospital re‐admissions, but moderate‐certainty evidence is based on one study. We have not found any evidence for dyspnoea symptoms nor harms, and there is no difference in fatalities when remote monitoring is provided in addition to usual care. 
Remote monitoring interventions alone are no better than usual care overall for health outcomes. 
Multi‐component interventions with asynchronous remote monitoring are no better than usual care but may provide short‐term benefit for quality of life and may result in fewer re‐admissions to hospital for any cause. We are uncertain whether remote monitoring is responsible for the positive impact on re‐admissions, and we are unable to discern the long‐term benefits of receiving remote monitoring as part of patient care. 
Owing to paucity of evidence, it is unclear which COPD severity subgroups would benefit from telehealth interventions. Given there is no evidence of harm, telehealth interventions may be beneficial as an additional health resource depending on individual needs based on professional assessment. Larger studies can determine long‐term effects of these interventions.

## Plain Title: Using Remote Care for Lung Disease

### Rationale

COPD is a serious lung disease. It makes it hard to breathe. People with COPD often cough a lot. They also get very sick sometimes. These sicknesses can make their health worse.

It can be hard for these patients to see doctors in person. Some are too sick to travel. Others live far from health clinics. Remote care uses technology to help. It lets doctors check on patients from far away. They can also talk to patients over the phone or video.

We wanted to see if remote care helps people with COPD. We thought it might make them feel better. It might also keep them out of the hospital.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. We gathered information from many past research projects. These studies included adults with COPD. They did not include people with other lung problems.

The studies looked at different types of remote care. Some used devices to track patient health at home. Doctors could then check these records. Other studies had doctors talk to patients remotely. Some studies combined these methods. They also gave patients their usual care.

We looked at how long people were in the studies. Some studies lasted a few weeks. Others lasted over a year. We wanted to see if remote care helped with:
* Getting sick less often.
* Feeling better and having a better life.
* Having less trouble breathing.
* Staying out of the hospital.
* Living longer.

### Results

We looked at 29 studies. These studies included over 5000 people. Most of the people were men.

Many remote care systems let patients send health numbers. Doctors looked at these later. Only a few systems let doctors see numbers right away.

We found that remote care with usual care might not help much. It might not stop people from getting sick. It might not make them feel much better. But it might lower how many times people go back to the hospital for COPD. This is based on only one study. We do not know if it helps with breathing. We also do not know about bad side effects. We saw no change in how long people lived.

Remote care by itself also did not seem to help much. It did not stop people from getting sick. It did not make them feel better. It did not help with breathing. It did not keep them out of the hospital. It also did not change how long people lived.

Some studies used many types of remote care. These might help people feel better for a short time. They might also lower how many times people go back to the hospital. But we do not know if remote care caused this. We also do not know if these benefits last a long time.

We do not know which patients might get the most help. But remote care does not seem to cause harm. So, it might be a good choice for some patients. It could be an extra way to get care. Doctors can decide if it's right for each person. More studies are needed to see long-term effects.","Telehealth technologies for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Review question 
Do telehealth technologies help improve the health of people who have COPD?
Background 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes a group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnoea), coughing, and increased mucus. COPD causes limited airflow in the lungs when breathing out; this can be measured by spirometry (a measure to assess how well the lungs function). The spirometer takes two measurements: volume of air when breathing out forcefully in one second, and total amount of air breathed out. When COPD gets worse over time, this leads to greater symptom severity and can reduce quality of life. Disease progression and sudden flare‐ups (exacerbations) of symptoms can increase someone's risks of hospitalisation and death. Telehealth technologies could improve delivery of health care for people with COPD, which could reduce exacerbations, improve quality of life, and lower rates of hospitalisation. However, it is unclear whether providing telehealth care improves health‐related outcomes for people with COPD. We wanted to explore whether telehealth technologies were helpful for people with COPD. 
What are telehealth technologies? 
Study investigators used a range of telehealth technologies. Some included remote monitoring technology, which requires daily use of a laptop or a tablet with monitoring equipment, with results received by the healthcare professional. Typical monitoring equipment included a stethoscope (to measure blood pressure and heart rate), a pulse oximeter (to measure oxygen levels in the blood), a spirometer (to measure lung function), a thermometer, and other devices. Interventions involved regular phone calls with healthcare professionals for patients to talk about their symptoms and completion of health questionnaires. 
Identifying and selecting studies 
We searched online databases up until April 2020. We searched for studies published worldwide, in any language, at any time. Two review authors looked at lists of studies separately, then agreed on which studies should be included. 
To find the best answer to our question, we looked for studies that recruited people with COPD of any severity. To make the comparison fair, we looked for studies in which investigators compared remote monitoring, remote monitoring plus usual care, and multi‐component treatments. People included in these studies had to have the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive one of these teleheath technologies or usual care. 
Key results 
We found 29 studies (5654 people with moderate to very severe COPD) that were suitable for inclusion in our review. Duration of these studies ranged from 3 to 12 months. 
We did not find any important benefits or harms for patients who were monitored with any of the telehealth technologies when we looked at number of exacerbations, improvement in quality of life, and reduction in breathing distress symptoms, hospitalisations, or death. However, people who were monitored through telehealth technology plus usual care had some reduction in risk of hospital re‐admission. Thus, telehealth technologies that were part of a care package reduced COPD‐related hospital re‐admissions. 
We could not be certain of any harms of stand‐alone remote monitoring. We are also uncertain of any benefits or harms of stand‐alone remote monitoring of patient experiences or reports of breathing distress. 
Quality of evidence 
Currently, no good quality evidence is available. We are very uncertain about evidence for exacerbations, quality of life, dyspnoea symptoms, hospitalisations, deaths, and side effects. However, we are moderately certain about our findings for hospital re‐admissions. 
Conclusion 
We are not clear whether telehealth technologies for monitoring or consultation provide benefit, but we have not found any information on harms. Telehealth could play a role in the care and management of people with COPD. Telehealth as part of multi‐component care packages may provide short‐term benefit for quality of life and hospital re‐admissions. Telehealth in the form of remote monitoring in addition to usual care may reduce the risk of hospital re‐admission. There is little impact on exacerbations, quality of life, and death. Owing to limited information, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. More studies are needed to determine whether telehealth provides any long‐term benefits for people with COPD of varying severity.

Decision coaching is non‐directive support delivered by a healthcare provider to help patients prepare to actively participate in making a health decision. ‘Healthcare providers’ are considered to be all people who are engaged in actions whose primary intent is to protect and improve health (e.g. nurses, doctors, pharmacists, social workers, health support workers such as peer health workers). 
Little is known about the effectiveness of decision coaching.
Objectives
To determine the effects of decision coaching (I) for people facing healthcare decisions for themselves or a family member (P) compared to (C) usual care or evidence‐based intervention only, on outcomes (O) related to preparation for decision making, decisional needs and potential adverse effects. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (Wiley), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (Ebsco), Nursing and Allied Health Source (ProQuest), and Web of Science from database inception to June 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where the intervention was provided to adults or children preparing to make a treatment or screening healthcare decision for themselves or a family member. Decision coaching was defined as: a) delivered individually by a healthcare provider who is trained or using a protocol; and b) providing non‐directive support and preparing an adult or child to participate in a healthcare decision. Comparisons included usual care or an alternate intervention. There were no language restrictions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened citations, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data on characteristics of the intervention(s) and outcomes. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion to reach consensus. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measures of treatment effect and, where possible, synthesised results using a random‐effects model. If more than one study measured the same outcome using different tools, we used a random‐effects model to calculate the standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI. We presented outcomes in summary of findings tables and applied GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
Out of 12,984 citations screened, we included 28 studies of decision coaching interventions alone or in combination with evidence‐based information, involving 5509 adult participants (aged 18 to 85 years; 64% female, 52% white, 33% African‐American/Black; 68% post‐secondary education). The studies evaluated decision coaching used for a range of healthcare decisions (e.g. treatment decisions for cancer, menopause, mental illness, advancing kidney disease; screening decisions for cancer, genetic testing). Four of the 28 studies included three comparator arms.  
For decision coaching compared with usual care (n = 4 studies), we are uncertain if decision coaching compared with usual care improves any outcomes (i.e. preparation for decision making, decision self‐confidence, knowledge, decision regret, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low.  
For decision coaching compared with evidence‐based information only (n = 4 studies), there is low certainty‐evidence that participants exposed to decision coaching may have little or no change in knowledge (SMD ‐0.23, 95% CI: ‐0.50 to 0.04; 3 studies, 406 participants). There is low certainty‐evidence that participants exposed to decision coaching may have little or no change in anxiety, compared with evidence‐based information. We are uncertain if decision coaching compared with evidence‐based information improves other outcomes (i.e. decision self‐confidence, feeling uninformed) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
For decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with usual care (n = 17 studies), there is low certainty‐evidence that participants may have improved knowledge (SMD 9.3, 95% CI: 6.6 to 12.1; 5 studies, 1073 participants). We are uncertain if decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with usual care improves other outcomes (i.e. preparation for decision making, decision self‐confidence, feeling uninformed, unclear values, feeling unsupported, decision regret, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
For decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with evidence‐based information only (n = 7 studies), we are uncertain if decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with evidence‐based information only improves any outcomes (i.e. feeling uninformed, unclear values, feeling unsupported, knowledge, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Decision coaching may improve participants’ knowledge when used with evidence‐based information. Our findings do not indicate any significant adverse effects (e.g. decision regret, anxiety) with the use of decision coaching. It is not possible to establish strong conclusions for other outcomes. It is unclear if decision coaching always needs to be paired with evidence‐informed information. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of decision coaching for a broader range of outcomes.

### Plain Title
Helping Patients Make Health Choices: What We Learned About Decision Coaching

### Rationale
Sometimes, people need to make big choices about their health. These choices can be about treatment or tests. It can be hard to know what to do. Many patients feel unsure or worried.

""Decision coaching"" is when a healthcare worker helps you. They do not tell you what to do. They help you think through your choices. This helps you get ready to make a health choice. Healthcare workers can be nurses, doctors, or other helpers.

We did not know if decision coaching truly helps patients. We wanted to find out if it made a difference. We thought coaching might help people feel more ready. It might also help them feel surer about their choices. This study looked at how coaching works. It also looked at if it had any bad effects.

### Trial Design
This study was like a big review. We looked at many other studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people in those studies were put into groups by chance. One group got coaching. The other group did not. Or they got other help.

We looked for studies where adults or children needed to make a health choice. This choice could be for themselves or a family member. The coaching had to be one-on-one. A trained healthcare worker gave the coaching. They helped people prepare to make a health choice. They gave support, but did not tell people what to do.

We looked at studies with people aged 18 to 85 years old. Most people in the studies were women. They were from different backgrounds. We looked at studies about many health choices. These included choices for cancer, kidney disease, or mental health. We wanted to see how coaching affected things like:
* How ready people felt to make a choice.
* How sure people felt about their choice.
* How much they knew about their choice.
* If they felt bad about their choice later.
* If they felt worried.

We searched many health databases for these studies. We looked at studies in any language. Two people reviewed all the studies. They made sure the information was correct.

### Results
We looked at almost 13,000 research papers. We picked 28 studies that fit our rules. These studies included 5509 adults. These people were making different health choices.

Here is what we found:
*   **Decision coaching alone vs. usual care:** We could not say for sure if coaching alone helped. The evidence was not strong enough. This means we are not sure if it improved how ready people felt. We also do not know if it helped with feeling sure, knowing more, or feeling less worried.

*   **Decision coaching alone vs. just health facts:** We found some weak proof here. Coaching alone may not change how much people know. It also may not change how worried they feel. We were not sure about other things.

*   **Decision coaching *plus* health facts vs. usual care:** This showed a small improvement. People who got coaching *and* health facts learned more. They knew more about their health choices. We still need more proof for other benefits. This includes how ready people felt or how sure they were.

*   **Decision coaching *plus* health facts vs. just health facts:** We could not say for sure if adding coaching to health facts made a difference. The evidence was not strong enough.

We also looked for any bad effects from coaching. We did not find any big problems. People did not feel more regret or worry after coaching.

In the end, we learned that decision coaching, when given with health facts, may help people know more. It helps them learn about their choices. But we need more research. We need to know more about how coaching helps in other ways. We also need to know if coaching always needs to be with health facts. We can't make strong claims for most things yet.","Decision coaching for people making healthcare decisions
Background 
There is a need to better involve people who are making healthcare decisions about treatments (e.g. surgery) or screening (e.g. tests to tell if there is a health problem). Quality decisions are made when people know the best available evidence on options and can share what matters with their healthcare provider(s). 
Decision coaching supports people to prepare for making a health decision. It is provided by healthcare providers who are trained or use a protocol for decision coaching (e.g. nurses, doctors, pharmacists, social workers, health support workers such as peer health workers).  
We wanted to find out if decision coaching helps people to prepare for making healthcare decisions. 
 
What did we do? 
We are a team of patient partners, healthcare providers, teachers and researchers from seven countries. 
We looked for studies that tested decision coaching with people (adults and children) to prepare them for making a healthcare decision about treatment or screening for themselves or a family member. 
We included studies if people who received decision coaching were randomly put into study groups (e.g. using a computer to decide who goes in which group). Studies where people are randomly put into groups are the best way to compare findings between groups and give results we can rely on when we look at the effects of an intervention like decision coaching.  
 
Search strategy  
To find studies, we searched eight online data banks. We asked experts and authors of studies about decision coaching. We included studies published up to June 2021.  
 
What we found  
We found 28 studies about decision coaching used alone or with high‐quality patient information based on research (called ‘evidence‐based information’). There was a total of 5509 adults in the 28 studies. None of the studies included children, and only one study included people (parents) making decisions for someone else. The studies tested decision coaching with a range of healthcare decisions such as treatment decisions related to cancer, menopause, or mental illness; cancer screening decisions, and genetic testing.  
Some of the studies looked at decision coaching with, or compared to, disease‐specific information or evidence‐based information such as patient decision aids (booklets, videos, online tools that: make the decision clear, provide options and the pros and cons, and help people be clear on what matters to them). 
 
What does the evidence show? 
People who received decision coaching compared with evidence‐based information only: 
‐ may have little or no change in knowledge (406 patients, 3 studies);
‐ may have little of no change in anxiety (242 patients, 1 study).
 
People who received decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with usual care:  
‐may have improved knowledge (1073 patients, 5 studies)
 
Our confidence in the results 
We have low confidence that decision coaching plus evidence‐based information improves people’s knowledge compared to usual care. We have low confidence that decision coaching may have little or no effect on knowledge and anxiety compared to evidence‐based information. We are less confident about our other findings, as the certainty of the evidence is very low and there were important outcomes that were not reported by the included studies. Many studies had a small number of people taking part and this means that the results of this review might change with more studies.   
 
What this means 
Decision coaching may improve peoples’ knowledge to help them prepare to make healthcare decisions when used with evidence‐based information. The review did not detect any adverse effects with the use of decision coaching.

Acute diarrhoea is a leading cause of death for children under five years of age. Most deaths are caused by excessive fluid and electrolyte losses. Racecadotril is an anti‐secretory drug that has been used for acute diarrhoea in children as an adjunct to oral rehydration therapy. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of racecadotril for treating acute diarrhoea in children under five years of age. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, published in the Cochrane Library Issue 3, March 2019); MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), up to 4 March 2019, for clinical trials regardless of publication language or status. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared racecadotril to placebo or no intervention in addition to standard care (oral rehydration therapy) in children under five with acute diarrhoea. The primary outcomes were failure of oral rehydration, duration of diarrhoea, and number of stools. The secondary outcomes were stool output, length of the hospital stay, and adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. We presented dichotomous data with risk ratios (RR) and continuous data with mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD). Where appropriate, we combined trials with meta‐analysis and used a random‐effects model if there was significant heterogeneity (I² ≥ 50%). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Seven RCTs with a total of 1140 participants met the inclusion criteria. The trials were carried out on children aged three months to five years, in outpatient and inpatient facilities from France, Spain, Peru, India, Kenya, and Ecuador. The efficacy and safety of racecadotril were compared to placebo or no treatment. Racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.23; 2 RCTs, 192 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Data on duration of diarrhoea, number of stools in the first 48 hours are insufficient to reach a conclusion; stool output in the first 48 hours appears to be lower in the two trials measuring this, although the data is not combinable. Length of hospital stay was similar in two studies measuring this, and overall there was no evidence that racecadotril increased overall rate of adverse events (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.22; 5 RCTs, 688 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Most adverse events in the racecadotril group were mild or moderate. 
Authors' conclusions
Racecadotril seems to be a safe drug but has little benefit in improving acute diarrhoea in children under five years of age. Current evidence does not support routine use of racecadotril in management of acute diarrhoea in children under five outside of the context of placebo controlled RCTs.

## Plain Title
Study on a Drug for Children's Diarrhea

## Rationale
Diarrhea is a big problem for young children. It is a main cause of death for kids under five. When children have diarrhea, they lose a lot of water and body salts. This can make them very sick and even die.

There is a drug called racecadotril. Doctors use it for children with severe diarrhea. It works by stopping too much water loss from the body. This study wants to know if racecadotril really helps these sick children. We also want to see if it is safe for them.

The study aims to find out if racecadotril can make children feel better faster. We want to see if it lowers the risk of them getting very sick. This drug could help save young lives.

## Trial Design
This study looks at other studies that have already happened. These studies are called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means some children got racecadotril. Other children got a fake medicine or no extra medicine. Both groups also got standard care, like special fluids to drink.

The studies included children from three months to five years old. They all had sudden, bad diarrhea. The studies were done in many places. These include France, Spain, Peru, India, Kenya, and Ecuador. The main things we looked for were how long diarrhea lasted. We also checked how many times kids had bowel movements. We wanted to see if they needed more fluids than just drinking. We also looked at how long kids stayed in the hospital. We checked for any bad reactions to the medicine.

## Results
We looked at seven studies. These studies included 1,140 children. The children were from three months to five years old. The studies checked how well racecadotril worked. They also checked if it was safe.

Racecadotril might help lower the chance of needing more fluids. But we do not have enough strong proof. We do not know if it makes diarrhea shorter. We also do not know if it lessens the number of bowel movements. Some studies showed less stool in the first two days. But we could not combine these results.

The time children stayed in the hospital was about the same for both groups. The drug racecadotril did not seem to cause more bad reactions. Most bad reactions were not serious. They were mild or medium.

In short, racecadotril seems safe. But it does not seem to help much with children's diarrhea. Doctors should not use it all the time for young children. More studies are needed to be sure.","Racecadotril to treat children under five years of age with acute diarrhoea
What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether racecadotril works for children under five years of age with diarrhoea. Cochrane Review authors collected and analysed all relevant trials to answer this question and included seven trials in this review. 
Key messages 
Racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure. We are uncertain whether or not it influences number of bowel movements or duration of diarrhoea. 
What was studied in the review? 
Diarrhoea is a leading cause of death in children under five years old, especially in low‐income countries. Children who have diarrhoea often suffer from frequent and watery bowel movements, which might cause excessive loss of fluid and electrolytes (dehydration). Fluid replacement is recommended to prevent and treat dehydration caused by diarrhoea. Racecadotril has been used in addition to fluid replacement for treating diarrhoea in children, as it reduces release of water and electrolytes into the digestive tract. The drug is supposed to improve the symptoms of diarrhoea (shorten duration of diarrhoea or reduce the stool frequency) as well as reduce the risk of rehydration failure. However, it is not clear if racecadotril really works for children with diarrhoea. 
What are the main results? 
The review authors searched for available trials and included seven trials. The trials were conducted in a total of 1140 children aged from 3 months to 5 years. Children who were given racecadotril were compared to a control group (children who, instead of racecadotril, received a placebo (a dummy drug that contains no racecadotril) or no drug). The review shows that when children with diarrhoea were given racecadotril, compared to placebo or no drug: 
• racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure (low‐certainty evidence); • we are uncertain whether or not racecadotril shortens duration of diarrhoea (very low‐certainty evidence); • we are uncertain whether racecadotril influences the number of stools (very low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may reduce weight of stool output (low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may make little or no difference to length of hospital stay for inpatients (low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may make little or no difference to rates of side‐effect events (low‐certainty evidence) 
How up to date is this review? 
The review authors searched for trials published up to 4 March 2019.

10.1002-14651858.CD013699,"Background
Reducing the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is a global priority. Contact tracing identifies people who were recently in contact with an infected individual, in order to isolate them and reduce further transmission. Digital technology could be implemented to augment and accelerate manual contact tracing. Digital tools for contact tracing may be grouped into three areas: 1) outbreak response; 2) proximity tracing; and 3) symptom tracking. We conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of digital solutions to contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits, harms, and acceptability of personal digital contact tracing solutions for identifying contacts of an identified positive case of an infectious disease. 
Search methods
An information specialist searched the literature from 1 January 2000 to 5 May 2020 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. Additionally, we screened the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, quasi‐RCTs, cohort studies, cross‐sectional studies and modelling studies, in general populations. We preferentially included studies of contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks (including COVID‐19, Ebola, tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome) as direct evidence, but considered comparative studies of contact tracing outside an outbreak as indirect evidence. 
The digital solutions varied but typically included software (or firmware) for users to install on their devices or to be uploaded to devices provided by governments or third parties. Control measures included traditional or manual contact tracing, self‐reported diaries and surveys, interviews, other standard methods for determining close contacts, and other technologies compared to digital solutions (e.g. electronic medical records). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened records and all potentially relevant full‐text publications. One review author extracted data for 50% of the included studies, another extracted data for the remaining 50%; the second review author checked all the extracted data. One review author assessed quality of included studies and a second checked the assessments. Our outcomes were identification of secondary cases and close contacts, time to complete contact tracing, acceptability and accessibility issues, privacy and safety concerns, and any other ethical issue identified. Though modelling studies will predict estimates of the effects of different contact tracing solutions on outcomes of interest, cohort studies provide empirically measured estimates of the effects of different contact tracing solutions on outcomes of interest. We used GRADE‐CERQual to describe certainty of evidence from qualitative data and GRADE for modelling and cohort studies. 
Main results
We identified six cohort studies reporting quantitative data and six modelling studies reporting simulations of digital solutions for contact tracing. Two cohort studies also provided qualitative data. Three cohort studies looked at contact tracing during an outbreak, whilst three emulated an outbreak in non‐outbreak settings (schools). Of the six modelling studies, four evaluated digital solutions for contact tracing in simulated COVID‐19 scenarios, while two simulated close contacts in non‐specific outbreak settings. 
Modelling studies 
Two modelling studies provided low‐certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases using digital contact tracing (measured as average number of secondary cases per index case ‐ effective reproductive number (Reff)). One study estimated an 18% reduction in Reff with digital contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone, and a 35% reduction with manual contact‐tracing. Another found a reduction in Reff for digital contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone (26% reduction) and a reduction in Reff for manual contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone (53% reduction). However, the certainty of evidence was reduced by unclear specifications of their models, and assumptions about the effectiveness of manual contact tracing (assumed 95% to 100% of contacts traced), and the proportion of the population who would have the app (53%). 
Cohort studies 
Two cohort studies provided very low‐certainty evidence of a benefit of digital over manual contact tracing. During an Ebola outbreak, contact tracers using an app found twice as many close contacts per case on average than those using paper forms. Similarly, after a pertussis outbreak in a US hospital, researchers found that radio‐frequency identification identified 45 close contacts but searches of electronic medical records found 13. The certainty of evidence was reduced by concerns about imprecision, and serious risk of bias due to the inability of contact tracing study designs to identify the true number of close contacts. 
One cohort study provided very low‐certainty evidence that an app could reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts. The certainty of evidence for this outcome was affected by imprecision and serious risk of bias. Contact tracing teams reported that digital data entry and management systems were faster to use than paper systems and possibly less prone to data loss. 
Two studies from lower‐ or middle‐income countries, reported that contact tracing teams found digital systems simpler to use and generally preferred them over paper systems; they saved personnel time, reportedly improved accuracy with large data sets, and were easier to transport compared with paper forms. However, personnel faced increased costs and internet access problems with digital compared to paper systems. 
Devices in the cohort studies appeared to have privacy from contacts regarding the exposed or diagnosed users. However, there were risks of privacy breaches from snoopers if linkage attacks occurred, particularly for wearable devices. 
Authors' conclusions
The effectiveness of digital solutions is largely unproven as there are very few published data in real‐world outbreak settings. Modelling studies provide low‐certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases if digital contact tracing is used together with other public health measures such as self‐isolation. Cohort studies provide very low‐certainty evidence that digital contact tracing may produce more reliable counts of contacts and reduce time to complete contact tracing. Digital solutions may have equity implications for at‐risk populations with poor internet access and poor access to digital technology. 
Stronger primary research on the effectiveness of contact tracing technologies is needed, including research into use of digital solutions in conjunction with manual systems, as digital solutions are unlikely to be used alone in real‐world settings. Future studies should consider access to and acceptability of digital solutions, and the resultant impact on equity. Studies should also make acceptability and uptake a primary research question, as privacy concerns can prevent uptake and effectiveness of these technologies. 
","## A New Way to Find People Who May Have Been Sick

### Rationale

When a new sickness spreads, like COVID-19, it is important to stop it fast. One way is to find people who were near a sick person. This is called ""contact tracing."" When we find these people, they can stay home. This helps stop the sickness from spreading more.

Doctors use old ways to find contacts, like calling people. But this takes a lot of time. We need faster ways to find these people.

This study looks at using computers and phones to help. These ""digital tools"" might find contacts quicker. This could help keep more people safe.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. It searched for papers from the year 2000 to 2020. The studies looked at how well digital tools worked to find contacts.

The studies included all kinds of people. They looked at sicknesses like COVID-19 and Ebola.

The digital tools were often apps on phones. People could put these apps on their own phones. Or they might get a special device. The old way of finding contacts was used to compare. This included talking to people and using paper forms.

The study looked at a few things:
* How many sick people were found.
* How fast contacts were found.
* If people liked using the tools.
* If the tools kept private info safe.

### Results

The study found a few things. Six studies were ""cohort"" studies. These looked at real events. Six other studies were ""modeling"" studies. These used computer ideas to see what might happen.

**Ideas from Computer Models:**
* Two studies showed that digital tools might find fewer sick people. They said using an app might lower new sick cases by about 18%.
* Another study said apps might lower new sick cases by 26%.
* But these numbers were not very strong. The computer ideas used some guesses. For example, they guessed how many people would use the app.

**Ideas from Real Life Studies:**
* Two studies said digital tools might be better than old ways.
* During an Ebola outbreak, apps found two times more contacts than paper forms.
* After a whooping cough problem, a special tag found 45 contacts. Old records only found 13 contacts.
* But these results were also not very strong. It is hard to know the exact number of contacts in real life.

* One study showed apps could find contacts faster. Teams said digital tools were quicker than paper. They also said digital tools might lose less data.

* Two studies said that digital tools were easier to use. People liked them more than paper forms. They saved time. They were better for many names. They were easier to carry.
* But, these tools cost more money. And sometimes, there was no internet to use them.

* Digital tools seemed to keep private info safe for the sick person. But there was a risk of others seeing private info if the tools were not strong enough.

**What Does This All Mean?**
* We do not have much proof that digital tools work in real sickness outbreaks.
* Computer ideas hint that digital tools might help. But they need to be used with other ways to stop sickness.
* Real life studies hint that digital tools might find more contacts. They might also save time.
* Digital tools might not work for everyone. Some people may not have phones or internet.

We need more studies. We need to see how well these digital tools work in the real world. We also need to make sure people will use them. And that they keep private info safe.","Are digital contact tracing technologies effective during infectious disease outbreaks?
Why is this question important? 
The global COVID‐19 pandemic highlights the importance of accurate and timely contact tracing. Contact tracing tells people that they may have been near someone with ‐ or showing symptoms of ‐ an infectious disease, allowing them to self‐isolate and helping to stop the spread of infection. Traditionally, contact tracing begins with notification that someone has an infectious disease. They are asked to recall their contacts, going back two to three days before symptom onset. This is time‐consuming and may not always give a complete picture, so digital aids could help contact tracers. 
Digital contact tracing uses technology to track and trace contacts. Individuals download an app onto their smartphones and record location and symptom information, or their devices might use location‐finding technology, like Bluetooth or GPS (global positioning system). If the user is infected, the technology identifies close contacts and/or secondary infections (people to whom they passed the disease), and informs people whom they have been near. The technology identifies where the infection was passed on and its duration (the context). 
However, problems may occur where access to technology is limited, in low‐income settings or for elderly people, for example. Also, some people see it as an invasion of privacy and are suspicious of how their data will be used. 
We wanted to know whether digital contact tracing, compared to manual contact tracing, is effective in reducing the spread of infection, as measured by secondary infections, identifying close contacts, tracing a complete set of contacts, and identifying the context of infection. 
What did we do? 
We searched medical databases for studies that assessed digital contact tracing. We preferred studies set during infectious disease outbreaks, which assessed real people in real time, but we included studies in any setting and of any design. 
To answer our question quickly, we shortened some steps of the Cochrane review process, however, we are confident in our conclusions. 
What we found 
We found 12 relevant studies. Six assessed the effectiveness of digital contact tracing on specific groups (cohorts) of people: three during an outbreak (Ebola in Sierra Leone; tuberculosis in Botswana; and whooping cough (pertussis) in USA); and three replicated an outbreak in schools to assess systems for identifying close contacts of participants. The remaining six were modelling studies, which simulated digital contact tracing. 
Main results 
Digital contact tracing with self‐isolation probably reduces the number of secondary infections, but not as much as manual contact tracing with self‐isolation (2 modelling studies). 
Digital contact tracing found more close contacts in two outbreaks than manual (2 studies in USA and Sierra Leone). Devices in non‐outbreak settings can identify more close contacts than self‐reported diaries or surveys. 
An app may reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts (1 study). Digital systems were faster to use than paper systems for recording new contacts and monitoring known contacts, and possibly less prone to data loss. 
Problems with system access (2 studies) included patchy network coverage, lack of data, technical problems and higher staff training needs. Contact tracers' personal expenses increased (1 study) due to travel and recharging phone batteries. Devices all appeared to protect diagnosed users from contacts, snoopers and authorities but one app's users were members of public health agencies. Studies recorded stolen hardware (second‐hand mobile phones); reported that paper forms were ""often lost"", and that digital data were password protected (2 studies) and encrypted (1 study). 
We found no evidence on contextual information and acceptability.
What this means 
It is unlikely that digital technologies would be the sole method of contact tracing during an outbreak; they would probably be used alongside manual methods. Unfortunately, the technology is largely unproven in real‐world outbreak settings and none of our included studies assessed digital plus manual contact tracing with digital contact tracing alone. Our included studies assessed different technologies and used different methods from each other, so we are uncertain about their evidence. 
Governments that implement digital contact tracing should ensure that at‐risk populations are not disadvantaged and take privacy concerns into account.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the leading cause of death in developed countries, and current treatment modalities have failed to regenerate the dead myocardium resulting from the ischemic damage. Stem cells have the potential to regenerate the damaged myocardium. These cells can be mobilized from the bone marrow by factors such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of stem cell mobilization following granulocyte colony stimulating factor therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to November week 3, 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010 week 48), BIOSIS Previews (1969 to 30 November 2010), ISI Science Citation Index Expanded (1970 to 4 December 2010) and ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (1990 to 4 December 2010). We also checked reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials including participants with a clinical diagnosis of AMI who were randomly allocated to the subcutaneous administration of G‐CSF through a daily dose of 2.5, 5 or 10 microgram/kg for four to six days or placebo. No age or other restrictions were applied for the selection of patients. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected trials, assessed trials for eligibility and methodological quality, and extracted data regarding the clinical efficacy and adverse outcomes. Disagreements were resolved by the third author. 
Main results
We included seven trials reported in 30 references in the review (354 participants). In all trials, G‐CSF was compared with placebo preparations. Dosage of G‐CSF varied among studies, ranging from 2.5 to 10 microgram/kg/day. Regarding overall risk of bias, data regarding the generation of randomization sequence and incomplete outcome data were at a low risk of bias; however, data regarding binding of personnel were not conclusive. The rate of mortality was not different between the two groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.80, P = 0.55). Regarding safety, the limited amount of evidence is inadequate to reach any conclusions regarding the safety of G‐CSF therapy. Moreover, the results did not show any beneficial effects of G‐CSF in patients with AMI regarding left ventricular function parameters, including left ventricular ejection fraction (RR 3.41, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 7.44, P = 0.1), end systolic volume (RR ‐1.35, 95% CI ‐4.68 to 1.99, P = 0.43) and end diastolic volume (RR ‐4.08, 95% CI ‐8.28 to 0.12, P = 0.06). It should also be noted that the study was limited since the trials included lacked long enough follow up durations. 
Authors' conclusions
Limited evidence from small trials suggested a lack of benefit of G‐CSF therapy in patients with AMI. Since data of the risk of bias regarding blinding of personnel were not conclusive, larger RCTs with appropriate power calculations and longer follow up durations are required in order to address current uncertainties regarding the clinical efficacy and therapy‐related adverse events of G‐CSF treatment. 
","## Helping Hearts Heal: A Look at Stem Cell Therapy After Heart Attacks

### Rationale

A heart attack, also called an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), is a very serious health problem. It is the main reason many people die in rich countries. When you have a heart attack, part of your heart muscle dies. This damage is often permanent.

Current treatments do not fully fix this dead heart tissue. This means many patients face long-term health issues. We need new ways to help the heart heal itself.

Stem cells are special cells in your body. They have the power to grow into different types of cells. We think they could help repair the damaged heart muscle. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor, or G-CSF, is a medicine. It can make your body release more of its own stem cells from your bone marrow.

Our study wanted to see if G-CSF could help patients after a heart attack. We hoped it would bring more stem cells to the heart. This might help the heart tissue regrow and work better.

### Trial Design

This study looked at how other studies were set up. It was a review of past research. We wanted to find out: ""How did these studies test G-CSF for heart attack patients?""

We looked for studies that were ""randomized controlled trials."" This means some patients got G-CSF, and some got a dummy medicine (placebo). This helps us see if the G-CSF made a real difference.

The studies included people who had a heart attack. They got G-CSF shots under the skin for four to six days. The dose of G-CSF was small: 2.5, 5, or 10 micrograms for each kilogram of their body weight. Other studies got a placebo shot that did nothing. There were no age limits for the people in these studies. We included all adults who had a heart attack.

Each person in these studies was watched for a certain amount of time. The goal was to see if G-CSF helped their heart or caused any bad effects. However, the studies we looked at often did not follow patients for a very long time.

### Results

We looked at seven different studies. These studies included 354 patients in total. In all these studies, G-CSF was compared to a dummy medicine. The amount of G-CSF given was different in each study, from 2.5 to 10 micrograms per kilogram each day.

We found that G-CSF did not change the number of deaths. The death rate was about the same in both groups. This means G-CSF did not help people live longer.

We also looked at how well the heart was working. G-CSF did not show any real benefits for the heart. It did not improve how much blood the heart pumped out. This is called ""left ventricular ejection fraction."" It also did not change the size of the heart chambers.

It was hard to be sure about how safe G-CSF was. There was not enough information in these studies. We also noted that the studies did not watch patients for long enough. This made it hard to see long-term effects.

In short, the small studies we reviewed did not show that G-CSF helps heart attack patients. We need more and bigger studies. These new studies should watch patients for a longer time. This will help us learn more about G-CSF for heart attacks.","Granulocyte colony stimulating factor treatment following a heart attack
People who suffer a heart attack (due to a blockage in the artery supplying blood to the heart) are usually affected by the damage to a portion of their heart muscle. Current treatment options are unable to restore the damaged section of the heart. Recently, stem cells have been shown to be able to restore and replace the damaged tissue in patients with heart attack. These cells could be mobilized to the heart with agents such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF). 
In this review, analysis of seven included studies with low risk of bias using G‐CSF to improve the function of damaged heart of patient with heart attack failed to show any beneficial effects of this treatment. The rate of mortality was not different between the two groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.80, P = 0.55). Also, left ventricular parameters including left ventricular ejection fraction (RR 3.41, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 7.44, P = 0.1), end systolic volume (RR ‐1.35, 95% CI ‐4.68 to 1.99, P = 0.43) and end diastolic volume (RR ‐4.08, 95% CI ‐8.28 to 0.12, P = 0.06) did not show significant changes between the treatment and the control groups. There was no evidence that the study was associated with serious adverse effects, however it should be noted that the study was limited since the trials included lacked long enough follow up durations. Additionally four studies had either high or unclear risk of bias for blinding. Therefore, based on the results of the current study, G‐CSF treatment should not be administered for patients with heart attack.

Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are high‐risk skin cancers, which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised, with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a microscopic imaging technique, which magnifies the surface of a skin lesion using near‐infrared light. Used in conjunction with clinical or dermoscopic examination of suspected skin cancer, or both, OCT may offer additional diagnostic information compared to other technologies. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of OCT for the detection of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in adults. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
We included studies of any design evaluating OCT in adults with lesions suspicious for invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, BCC or cSCC, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). Our unit of analysis was lesions. Where possible, we estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. 
Main results
We included five studies with 529 cutaneous lesions (282 malignant lesions) providing nine datasets for OCT, two for visual inspection alone, and two for visual inspection plus dermoscopy. Studies were of moderate to unclear quality, using data‐driven thresholds for test positivity and giving poor accounts of reference standard interpretation and blinding. Studies may not have been representative of populations eligible for OCT in practice, for example due to high disease prevalence in study populations, and may not have reflected how OCT is used in practice, for example by using previously acquired OCT images. 
It was not possible to make summary statements regarding accuracy of detection of melanoma or of cSCC because of the paucity of studies, small sample sizes, and for melanoma differences in the OCT technologies used (high‐definition versus conventional resolution OCT), and differences in the degree of testing performed prior to OCT (i.e. visual inspection alone or visual inspection plus dermoscopy). 
Pooled data from two studies using conventional swept‐source OCT alongside visual inspection and dermoscopy for the detection of BCC estimated the sensitivity of OCT as 95% (95% confidence interval (CI) 91% to 97%) and specificity of 77% (95% CI 69% to 83%). 
When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the mean observed BCC prevalence of 60%, OCT would miss 31 BCCs (91 fewer than would be missed by visual inspection alone and 53 fewer than would be missed by visual inspection plus dermoscopy), and OCT would lead to 93 false‐positive results for BCC (a reduction in unnecessary excisions of 159 compared to using visual inspection alone and of 87 compared to visual inspection plus dermoscopy). 
Authors' conclusions
Insufficient data are available on the use of OCT for the detection of melanoma or cSCC. Initial data suggest conventional OCT may have a role for the diagnosis of BCC in clinically challenging lesions, with our meta‐analysis showing a higher sensitivity and higher specificity when compared to visual inspection plus dermoscopy. However, the small number of studies and varying methodological quality means implications to guide practice cannot currently be drawn. 
Appropriately designed prospective comparative studies are required, given the paucity of data comparing OCT with dermoscopy and other similar diagnostic aids such as reflectance confocal microscopy.

## Plain Title
Better Ways to Spot Skin Cancer Early

## Rationale
Skin cancer can be very serious. Some types, like melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma, can spread and be deadly. Other types, like basal cell carcinoma, usually stay in one place but can still harm nearby tissue. Finding these cancers early is key to treating them well and helping people live longer, healthier lives.

It's also important not to worry people with false alarms or do needless surgeries on harmless spots. Doctors use different tools to look at skin spots. One new tool is called Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). It uses light to get a close-up look at the skin. We wanted to see if OCT could help doctors find skin cancers more accurately. This study aimed to find out if OCT helps doctors find melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma in adults.

## Trial Design
This study looked at many past research papers. We searched big health databases up to August 2016. We looked for studies that used OCT on adults with skin spots that doctors thought might be cancer. Then, we compared the OCT results to what was found later, either through a lab test of the skin (histology) or by watching the spot over time.

Two researchers checked the data from these studies. They made sure the information was collected in a fair way. We focused on how well OCT found cancer in each skin spot.

## Results
We found five studies with 529 skin spots. Of these, 282 were cancer. Some studies looked at OCT. Others looked at doctors just looking at the spot. A few studies looked at doctors using a special magnifying tool called a dermoscope. The quality of these studies was fair to unclear. They often did not clearly explain how they decided if a test was positive. They also did not always hide the results from the doctors who were checking the skin. The people in these studies might not be like the people who would use OCT in real life. For example, some studies had a very high number of cancer cases.

We could not say for sure how well OCT finds melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. There were not enough studies, and the studies used different types of OCT. They also did different tests before using OCT.

But for basal cell carcinoma (BCC), we found some clear results. Two studies looked at a common type of OCT along with doctors looking at the skin and using a dermoscope. This showed that OCT found BCC 95% of the time. This means it missed very few BCCs. OCT was also correct 77% of the time when it said a spot was not BCC. This means it did not give too many false alarms.

Let's imagine 1,000 skin spots where 600 are BCC. OCT would miss about 31 BCCs. This is much better than doctors just looking at the skin, which would miss 91 more. It's also better than doctors using a dermoscope, which would miss 53 more. OCT would also have about 93 false alarms for BCC. This means it would reduce unneeded surgeries by 159 compared to just looking at the skin. It would reduce them by 87 compared to using a dermoscope.

In short, we need more studies on OCT for melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. But for basal cell carcinoma, OCT looks promising, especially for spots that are hard to diagnose. It seems to find BCC better and cause fewer false alarms than current methods. However, because there were only a few studies and they varied in quality, we can't fully change medical practice based on these findings yet. We need more good studies to compare OCT to other tools like dermoscopy.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging test, for the detection of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are several different types of skin cancer. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms, and it is important that it is recognised early so that it can be removed. If it is not recognised (also known as a false‐negative test result), treatment can be delayed, and this risks the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body, which may lead to eventual death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are usually localised (i.e. limited to a certain part of the body) skin cancers, although cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations and can cause stress and anxiety to the patient. Making the correct diagnosis is important, and mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate optical coherence tomography (OCT) is for diagnosing skin cancer. Researchers in Cochrane included five studies to answer this question. Two studies were concerned with the diagnosis of melanoma and three with the diagnosis of BCC. 
What was studied in the review? 
A number of tools are available to skin cancer specialists which allow a more detailed examination of the skin compared to examination by the naked eye alone. Currently, a dermoscope is used by most skin cancer specialists, which magnifies the skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) using a bright light source. OCT magnifies the surface of a skin lesion to the level of that seen using a microscope using near‐infrared light. It is quick to perform but is more expensive compared to dermoscopy and requires specialist training. Review authors examined how useful OCT is to help diagnose skin cancers when used after visual inspection or visual inspection plus dermoscopy. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included five studies: two studies with 97 participants with 133 skin lesions suspected of being melanoma, and three studies with 305 participants with 396 lesions suspected of being BCC of which one (50 lesions) also analysed cSCCs (nine lesions). 
The studies investigating the accuracy of OCT for diagnosing melanoma were small and too different from each other to allow a reliable estimate of the accuracy of OCT for melanoma to be made. Similarly, only one small, low‐quality study investigated the accuracy of OCT for diagnosing cSCC. 
For identifying BCC, two studies showed the effects of skin specialists using OCT after visual inspection alone, or visual inspection with dermoscopic examination. These two studies indicated that in theory, if OCT were to be used in a group of 1000 people with skin lesions that were particularly difficult to diagnose, of whom 600 (60%) actually had BCC, then: 
‐ an estimated 662 people would have an OCT result confirming that a BCC was present and of these 93 (14%) would not actually have had a BCC (false‐positive result); 
‐ of the 338 people with an OCT result indicating that no BCC was present, 31 (9%) would actually have a BCC (false‐negative result). 
Compared to making a diagnosis of BCC using visual inspection plus dermoscopy, the addition of OCT in this group would reduce the number of false‐positive results by 87 (thus reducing unnecessary surgical procedures) and would miss 53 fewer BCCs. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
In all included studies, the diagnosis of skin cancer was made by lesion biopsy (OCT/dermoscopy positive) (a biopsy involves taking a sample of body cells and examining them under a microscope), and the absence of skin cancer was confirmed by biopsy (OCT/dermoscopy negative)*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer. However, the small number of studies included in this review, and variability between them, reduced the reliability of findings. Included studies also had important limitations, in particular study participants were from more restricted groups than would be eligible for an OCT scan in practice (e.g. all studies included people with skin lesions that had already been selected for surgical removal), while the way in which OCT was used may not reflect real‐life situations. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in Europe and the US only. Average age (reported in only two studies) was 46 years for melanoma and 63 years for BCC. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma was 23% and 27% (in two studies), ranged from 58% to 61% for BCC (three studies), and was 18% for cSCC (one study). For the diagnosis of BCC, the results apply to people with 'pink' and non‐pigmented skin lesions that the clinician considers particularly difficult to diagnose by the naked eye alone. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Not enough research has been done on using OCT in detecting skin cancers. The results of this review suggest that OCT might help to diagnose BCC when it is difficult to distinguish it from benign skin lesions, but it is not yet clear whether it can adequately distinguish between BCC, cSCC, and melanoma skin cancers. More studies are needed comparing OCT to dermoscopy and to other microscopic techniques (such as reflectance confocal microscopy) in well‐described groups of people with suspicious skin lesions. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the standard comparisons.

Background 
Patients with incurable cancer often experience tiredness (fatigue) during cancer treatment. Psychological therapies may help to reduce this symptom. Tiredness in cancer patients receiving cancer treatment may be treated with psychological therapies aimed at influencing or changing thoughts, emotions, behaviours, social interactions, or a combination of these (e.g. cognitive‐behavioural therapies, supportive‐expressive group therapies). This review looked at how effective psychological therapies are in reducing tiredness in patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment. 
Study characteristics 
In November 2016, we searched for clinical trials looking at psychological therapies in patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment. We found 14 small studies of very low quality reporting data on tiredness outcomes, 12 of which provided data for analyses. A limited number (three studies) reported results about side effects; these studies investigated a psychological therapy combined with medication. 
Key findings 
Review authors found no support for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in reducing tiredness when assessed directly following the intervention. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that psychological therapies may improve physical functioning directly after the intervention and may improve tiredness at first follow‐up. Evidence shows no support for the effectiveness of psychosocial therapies in improving other domains of functioning. Limited evaluation of potential harm suggests no differences in side effects between patients receiving psychological therapy and those given usual care. Limited good quality evidence allows no conclusions on the use of psychological therapies in people with incurable cancer. Larger, high‐quality trials are needed to find out whether psychological therapies help reduce tiredness for people with incurable cancer during cancer treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of study evidence using four levels: very low, low, moderate, and high. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Included studies had design problems and included a very small number of participants. Therefore, the quality of the evidence in this review is very low, and results of this review should be interpreted with caution.

Study looks at talking therapies to help tired cancer patients

## Rationale
Many people with cancer feel very tired. This tiredness can happen when they get treatment for their cancer. It can make life hard for them.

Doctors want to find ways to help with this tiredness. Talking therapies might help. These therapies teach people new ways to think or act. They can help with feelings or how people interact with others. This could make them feel less tired.

This study looked at how well these talking therapies work. It wanted to see if they can make people with incurable cancer feel less tired. This is important because good ways to help are needed.

## Trial Design
How was this study done?
This study looked at past research. It searched for studies up to November 2016. These studies looked at talking therapies. They involved patients with cancer that cannot be cured. These patients were also getting cancer treatment.

The review found 14 small studies. Twelve of these studies gave enough data to be used. The studies did not have a lot of good facts. They had problems in how they were set up. They also had only a few people in them.

Some studies looked at bad effects. These few studies used talking therapy and medicine together. The study aimed to see what the results showed.

## Results
What did the study find?
This study did not find strong proof. It did not show that talking therapies directly helped with tiredness. This was when tiredness was checked right after the therapy.

But some very weak proof did suggest things. It suggested that these therapies might help people move better. This was also right after the therapy. It also suggested they might help with tiredness later on.

The study did not find proof for other good changes. It did not show that talking therapies helped in other ways. When bad effects were checked, there was no real difference. People getting talking therapy had similar bad effects. This was compared to those getting usual care.

The facts from this study are not strong. We cannot say for sure if talking therapies help. This is for people with incurable cancer. The facts were of very low quality. This means we are not sure about the results. We need bigger, better studies. These studies would help us know if talking therapies truly help. They would tell us if they make tired cancer patients feel better.","Psychological therapies to reduce tiredness in patients with incurable cancer

10.1002-14651858.CD013495.pub2,"Background
Depression and anxiety are the most frequent indication for which antidepressants are prescribed. Long‐term antidepressant use is driving much of the internationally observed rise in antidepressant consumption. Surveys of antidepressant users suggest that 30% to 50% of long‐term antidepressant prescriptions had no evidence‐based indication. Unnecessary use of antidepressants puts people at risk of adverse events. However, high‐certainty evidence is lacking regarding the effectiveness and safety of approaches to discontinuing long‐term antidepressants. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of approaches for discontinuation versus continuation of long‐term antidepressant use for depressive and anxiety disorders in adults. 
Search methods
We searched all databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) until January 2020.
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing approaches to discontinuation with continuation of antidepressants (or usual care) for people with depression or anxiety who are prescribed antidepressants for at least six months. Interventions included discontinuation alone (abrupt or taper), discontinuation with psychological therapy support, and discontinuation with minimal intervention. Primary outcomes were successful discontinuation rate,relapse (as defined by authors of the original study), withdrawal symptoms, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, social and occupational functioning, and severity of illness. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. 
Main results
We included 33 studies involving 4995 participants. Nearly all studies were conducted in a specialist mental healthcare service and included participants with recurrent depression (i.e. two or more episodes of depression prior to discontinuation). All included trials were at high risk of bias. The main limitation of the review is bias due to confounding withdrawal symptoms with symptoms of relapse of depression. Withdrawal symptoms (such as low mood, dizziness) may have an effect on almost every outcome including adverse events, quality of life, social functioning, and severity of illness. 
Abrupt discontinuation  
Thirteen studies reported abrupt discontinuation of antidepressant.
Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that abrupt discontinuation without psychological support may increase risk of relapse (hazard ratio (HR) 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59 to 2.74; 1373 participants, 10 studies) and there is insufficient evidence of its effect on adverse events (odds ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.99; 1012 participants, 7 studies; I² = 37%) compared to continuation of antidepressants, without specific assessment of withdrawal symptoms. Evidence about the effects of abrupt discontinuation on withdrawal symptoms (1 study) is very uncertain. 
None of these studies included successful discontinuation rate as a primary endpoint. 
Discontinuation by ""taper""  
Eighteen studies examined discontinuation by ""tapering"" (one week or longer). Most tapering regimens lasted four weeks or less. 
Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that ""tapered"" discontinuation may lead to higher risk of relapse (HR 2.97, 95% CI 2.24 to 3.93; 1546 participants, 13 studies) with no or little difference in adverse events (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.38; 1479 participants, 7 studies; I² = 0%) compared to continuation of antidepressants, without specific assessment of withdrawal symptoms. Evidence about the effects of discontinuation on withdrawal symptoms (1 study) is very uncertain. 
Discontinuation with psychological support  
Four studies reported discontinuation with psychological support. Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that initiation of preventive cognitive therapy (PCT), or MBCT, combined with ""tapering"" may result in successful discontinuation rates of 40% to 75% in the discontinuation group (690 participants, 3 studies). Data from control groups in these studies were requested but are not yet available. 
Low‐certainty evidence suggests that discontinuation combined with psychological intervention may result in no or little effect on relapse (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.19; 690 participants, 3 studies) compared to continuation of antidepressants. Withdrawal symptoms were not measured. Pooling data on adverse events was not possible due to insufficient information (3 studies). 
Discontinuation with minimal intervention  
Low‐certainty evidence from one study suggests that a letter to the general practitioner (GP) to review antidepressant treatment may result in no or little effect on successful discontinuation rate compared to usual care (6% versus 8%; 146 participants, 1 study) or on relapse (relapse rate 26% vs 13%; 146 participants, 1 study). No data on withdrawal symptoms nor adverse events were provided. 
None of the studies used low‐intensity psychological interventions such as online support or a changed pharmaceutical formulation that allows tapering with low doses over several months. Insufficient data were available for the majority of people taking antidepressants in the community (i.e. those with only one or no prior episode of depression), for people aged 65 years and older, and for people taking antidepressants for anxiety. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently, relatively few studies have focused on approaches to discontinuation of long‐term antidepressants. We cannot make any firm conclusions about effects and safety of the approaches studied to date. The true effect and safety are likely to be substantially different from the data presented due to assessment of relapse of depression that is confounded by withdrawal symptoms. All other outcomes are confounded with withdrawal symptoms. Most tapering regimens were limited to four weeks or less. In the studies with rapid tapering schemes the risk of withdrawal symptoms may be similar to studies using abrupt discontinuation which may influence the effectiveness of the interventions. Nearly all data come from people with recurrent depression.   
There is an urgent need for trials that adequately address withdrawal confounding bias, and carefully distinguish relapse from withdrawal symptoms. Future studies should report key outcomes such as successful discontinuation rate and should include populations with one or no prior depression episodes in primary care, older people, and people taking antidepressants for anxiety and use tapering schemes longer than 4 weeks.

Stopping Antidepressants: How to Do It Safely

### Rationale

Many people take medicine for sadness and worry. These medicines are called antidepressants. Some people take them for a long time. This can cause problems. It can lead to bad side effects. But we don't know much about how to stop these medicines safely.

This study looked at different ways to stop antidepressants. We wanted to see what works best. We also wanted to know what is safe. We need to find good ways to help people stop these medicines. This can help them avoid problems.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. One group tried to stop the medicine. Another group kept taking the medicine.

We looked at studies with adults. They had sadness or worry. They had taken antidepressants for at least six months. We looked at different ways to stop the medicine. This included stopping all at once. It also included slowly cutting back. Some studies also had support from a talk therapist.

We wanted to see if people could stop the medicine. We looked at if their sadness came back. We also checked for side effects. And we checked for symptoms when stopping the medicine.

### Results

We looked at 33 studies. These studies had almost 5,000 people. Most people in these studies had sadness come back more than once.

Many studies did not clearly tell us the good or bad effects. It was hard to tell if problems were due to stopping the medicine or if the sadness came back.

**Stopping all at once:**
Some studies looked at stopping the medicine all at once. This might make sadness come back more often. We do not know much about side effects with this method.

**Slowly cutting back:**
Other studies looked at slowly cutting back the medicine. This is called ""tapering."" Most people cut back for four weeks or less. This might also make sadness come back more often. We did not see many differences in side effects.

**Stopping with talk therapy:**
A few studies looked at stopping medicine with talk therapy. This means getting support while slowly cutting back. In these studies, about 4 to 8 out of 10 people successfully stopped the medicine. This method might not make sadness come back more often. We need more information on side effects.

**Minimal help:**
One study looked at a letter to the doctor. This letter asked the doctor to review the medicine. This did not seem to help people stop the medicine more often. It also did not change if sadness came back.

**What we learned:**
We do not have enough strong information yet. We cannot say for sure which way to stop antidepressants is best or safest. More studies are needed. We need studies that look at:
* People who have had sadness only once or not at all.
* Older people.
* People who take medicine for worry.
* Slowly cutting back the medicine for longer than four weeks.

It is very important for future studies to be clear. They need to tell the difference between feeling bad from stopping the medicine and sadness coming back.","Stopping long‐term antidepressants in people with depression or anxiety
Review question 
We aimed to find out if it is effective and safe to stop antidepressants for people with depression or anxiety who have been taking them for six months or longer. 
We compared different approaches for stopping long‐term antidepressants versus continuation. We looked at benefits (e.g. successful discontinuation rate) and harms, such as return of the depressive or anxiety episode (relapse), side effects, and withdrawal symptoms (i.e. symptoms people experience when stopping an antidepressant). 
Background 
Antidepressants are widely used for depression and anxiety. Guidelines recommend that an antidepressant should be continued for at least six months after people start to feel better, and for at least two years if they have had two or more periods of depression. Many people take antidepressants for much longer, and as they can cause unpleasant side effects, long‐term use puts people at risk of harm that may outweigh the benefits. 
Study characteristics 
Our search up until January 2020 found 33 studies, which included 4995 adult participants. Most people in these studies had recurrent depression (two or more episodes of depression before stopping antidepressants), and most were recruited from specialist mental healthcare services. In 13 studies, the antidepressant was stopped abruptly; in 18 studies, the antidepressant was stopped gradually over several weeks (""tapering""); in four studies, psychological therapy support was also offered; and in one study, stopping was prompted by a letter to the GP with guidance on tapering. Most tapering schemes lasted four weeks or less. 
Key results 
We found very low‐certainty evidence suggesting that abrupt stopping may lead to higher risk of relapse and there was insufficient evidence of its effect on occurrence of side effects compared to continuation of the antidepressant. 
We found very low‐certainty evidence suggesting that ""tapering"" over a few weeks may lead to higher risk of a return and again may have little or no effect on side effects compared to continuation. 
We found evidence of very low to low certainty to suggest that stopping the antidepressant in combination with providing preventive cognitive therapy (PCT), or MBCT, was possible for 40% to 75% of participants in the group tapering the antidepressant and may show no difference in effects on relapse. 
We found low‐certainty evidence suggesting that a prompt letter and guidance on tapering sent to the GP may have no effect on the number of people who stop their antidepressant. 
We were unable to draw conclusions about withdrawal symptoms after abrupt or gradual stopping of an antidepressant, as this generally was not assessed. 
None of the studies used very slow tapering schemes beyond a few weeks, tapered liquid forms of antidepressants, or used tapering strips (to allow tapering with very low doses). 
None of the identified studies investigated stopping combined with providing supportive therapy such as online support or self‐help therapy. 
Certainty of evidence 
Overall, the certainty of evidence was low to very low. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and new research is likely to change our conclusions. The main reasons for this assessment of evidence certainty were that trials did not distinguish between symptoms of relapse of depression and symptoms of withdrawal. Also, most studies used no tapering or very ""rapid"" tapering schedules (four weeks or less), and nearly all studies included people with recurrent depression (more than two episodes). 
Conclusions 
We found few studies that examined stopping long‐term antidepressants. We are uncertain if the approaches for stopping long‐term antidepressants studied to date are effective and safe in people with recurrent depression. People should discuss with their doctor when they want to stop their antidepressant. 
Future studies should include people in primary care with only one or no earlier episodes of depression, older people, and people taking antidepressants for anxiety. Studies should taper antidepressants slowly while taking care to distinguish withdrawal symptoms from relapse.

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID‐19 because they counter hyper‐inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. So far, systemic corticosteroids are one of the few treatment options for COVID‐19. Nonetheless, size of effect, certainty of the evidence, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated. 
Objectives
To assess whether systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID‐19, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 16 April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID‐19, irrespective of disease severity, participant age, gender or ethnicity.  
We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids. We included the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (plus/minus placebo), dose comparisons, timing comparisons (early versus late), different types of corticosteroids and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances.  
We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome), corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long‐COVID treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all‐cause mortality, ventilator‐free days, new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, quality of life, serious adverse events, adverse events, and hospital‐acquired infections. 
Main results
We included 11 RCTs in 8075 participants, of whom 7041 (87%) originated from high‐income countries. A total of 3072 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 2322). We also identified 42 ongoing studies and 16 studies reported as being completed or terminated in a study registry, but without results yet.  
Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID‐19 
Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo  
We included 10 RCTs (7989 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre‐specified outcomes and thus our analysis included outcome data from nine studies.  
All‐cause mortality (at longest follow‐up available): systemic corticosteroids plus standard care probably reduce all‐cause mortality slightly in people with COVID‐19 compared to standard care alone (median 28 days: risk difference of 30 in 1000 participants fewer than the control group rate of 275 in 1000 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.00; 9 RCTs, 7930 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Ventilator‐free days: corticosteroids may increase ventilator‐free days (MD 2.6 days more than control group rate of 4 days, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.53; 1 RCT, 299 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Ventilator‐free days have inherent limitations as a composite endpoint and should be interpreted with caution.  
New need for invasive ventilation: the evidence is of very low certainty. Because of high risk of bias arising from deaths that occurred before ventilation we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics.  
Quality of life/neurological outcome: no data were available. 
Serious adverse events: we included data on two RCTs (678 participants) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids compared to standard care (plus/minus placebo); for adverse events and hospital‐acquired infections, we included data on five RCTs (660 participants). Because of high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics (very low‐certainty evidence).    
Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids   
We identified one study that compared methylprednisolone with dexamethasone. The evidence for mortality and new need for invasive mechanical ventilation is very low certainty due to the small number of participants (n = 86). No data were available for the other outcomes. 
We did not identify comparisons of different dosages or timing.
Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease 
Currently, there are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease. 
Authors' conclusions
Moderate‐certainty evidence shows that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all‐cause mortality in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID‐19. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that there may also be a reduction in ventilator‐free days. Since we are unable to  adjust for the impact of early death on subsequent endpoints, the findings for ventilation outcomes and harms have limited applicability to inform treatment decisions. Currently, there is no evidence for asymptomatic or mild disease (non‐hospitalised participants).  
There is an urgent need for good‐quality evidence for specific subgroups of disease severity, for which we propose level of respiratory support at randomisation. This applies to the comparison or subgroups of different types and doses of corticosteroids, too. Outcomes apart from mortality should be measured and analysed appropriately taking into account confounding through death if applicable.  
We identified 42 ongoing and 16 completed but not published RCTs in trials registries suggesting possible changes of effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future. Most ongoing studies target people who need respiratory support at baseline. With the living approach of this review, we will continue to update our search and include eligible trials and published data. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title
Steroid Medicine for Hospitalized People with COVID-19

### Rationale
COVID-19 is a sickness caused by a virus. It can make people very sick. The body can have too much swelling, called hyper-inflammation. This can cause more problems. Steroid medicines can help calm down this swelling. They are one of the few ways to treat severe COVID-19.

Doctors know these steroids might help. But they need to learn more. They want to know how much they help. They also want to know the best dose. And which people will get the most good from them. This study looked at all the information we have. It checked if steroid medicines are safe and work for COVID-19.

### Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This is a good way to test medicines. People in these studies were picked by chance. Some got the steroid medicine. Others got the usual care. Sometimes, they also got a fake medicine, called a placebo.

The people in these studies had COVID-19. They were in the hospital because they were sick. Their age, sex, or race did not matter. They could get any type or amount of steroid medicine. This study looked at different ways to give the medicine. It compared giving steroids plus usual care to just usual care. It also looked at different doses or timing of the medicine.

The study did not include people with other virus sicknesses. It also did not look at steroids used with other active drugs. Or steroids breathed in or put on the skin. It also did not look at people with ""long COVID."" This study kept looking for new information as it came out.

### Results
This study looked at 11 main studies. These studies included over 8,000 people. Most of these people were from rich countries. More than 3,000 people got a steroid medicine. Most of them got a steroid called dexamethasone. The study also found 42 other studies still going on. And 16 studies that were finished but did not have results yet.

**For people in the hospital with COVID-19:**

*   **Dying from any cause:** Steroid medicine plus usual care likely made fewer people die. For every 1,000 people, about 30 fewer died with steroids. This is compared to people who only got usual care. This suggests a small but important benefit.
*   **Days without a breathing machine:** Steroids might give people more days without needing a breathing machine. People on steroids had about 2 and a half more days. But this result is less certain.
*   **New need for a breathing machine:** We are not sure if steroids helped with needing a breathing machine. Some people died before they could get one. This made it hard to tell.
*   **Quality of life:** There was no information about how steroids affected people's quality of life.
*   **Bad side effects:** We are not sure about bad side effects. The studies had different ways of looking at them. And some studies did not report them well.

**Comparing different types or amounts of steroids:**

*   Only one study compared two types of steroids. It looked at methylprednisolone and dexamethasone. This study was too small to be sure about any differences.
*   No studies looked at different amounts of steroids. No studies looked at different times to give steroids.

**For people who were not in the hospital:**

*   There were no studies about steroids for people with mild COVID-19. These were people who did not need to be in the hospital.

**What the study means:**

Steroid medicines likely help people in the hospital with COVID-19. They seem to lower the chance of dying a little bit. They might also help people avoid breathing machines. But we need more studies. We need to learn about different types and doses of steroids. We also need to know more about side effects. And we need to study people with mild COVID-19. This study will keep looking for new facts as they come out.","Are corticosteroids (anti‐inflammatory medicines) given orally or by injection an effective treatment for people with COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
• Corticosteroids (anti‐inflammatory medicines) given orally or by injection (systemic) are probably effective treatments for people hospitalised with COVID‐19. We don’t know whether they cause unwanted effects.  
• We don’t know which systemic corticosteroid is the most effective. We found no evidence about people without symptoms or with mild COVID‐19 who were not hospitalised.  
• We found 42 ongoing studies and 16 completed studies that have not published their results. We will update this review when we find new evidence.     
What are corticosteroids? 
Corticosteroids are anti‐inflammatory medicines that reduce redness and swelling. They also reduce the activity of the immune system, which defends the body against disease and infection. Corticosteroids are used to treat a variety of conditions, such as asthma, eczema, joint strains and rheumatoid arthritis.  
Systemic corticosteroids can be swallowed or given by injection to treat the whole body. High doses of corticosteroids taken over a long time may cause unwanted effects, such as increased appetite, difficulty sleeping and mood changes.  
Why are corticosteroids possible treatments for COVID‐19?  
COVID‐19 affects the lungs and airways. As the immune system fights the virus, the lungs and airways become inflamed, causing breathing difficulties. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation, so may reduce the need for breathing support with a ventilator (a machine that breathes for a patient). Some patients’ immune systems overreact to the virus causing further inflammation and tissue damage; corticosteroids may help to control this response. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether systemic corticosteroids are an effective treatment for people with COVID‐19 and whether they cause unwanted effects. 
We were interested in:
• deaths from any cause up to 14 days after treatment, or longer if reported;• whether people got better or worse after treatment, based on their need for breathing support;• quality of life;• unwanted effects and infections caught in hospital. 
What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated systemic corticosteroids for people with mild, moderate or severe COVID‐19. People could be any age, sex or ethnicity. 
Studies could compare:
• corticosteroids plus usual care versus usual care with or without placebo (sham medicine);• one corticosteroid versus another;• corticosteroids versus a different medicine;• different doses of a corticosteroid; or• early versus late treatment. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 11 studies with 8075 people. About 3000 people received corticosteroids, mostly dexamethasone (2322 people). Most studies took place in high‐income countries.  
We also found 42 ongoing studies, and 16 completed studies that have not yet published their results.  
Main results 
Ten studies compared corticosteroids plus usual care versus usual care with or without placebo. Only one study compared two corticosteroids. The studies included only hospitalised people with confirmed or suspected COVID‐19. No studies looked at non‐hospitalised people, different doses or timing, or provided information about quality of life. 
Corticosteroids plus usual care compared to usual care with or without placebo (10 studies) 
• Corticosteroids probably reduce the number of deaths from any cause slightly, up to 60 days after treatment (9 studies, 7930 people).• One study (299 people) reported that people on a ventilator at the start of the study were ventilation‐free for more days with corticosteroids than with usual care, so corticosteroids may improve people’s symptoms.• Four studies (427 people) reported whether people not on a ventilator at the start of treatment later needed to be put on a ventilator, but we could not pool the studies’ results, so we are unsure if people’s symptoms get worse with corticosteroids or usual care.• We don’t know if corticosteroids increase or reduce serious unwanted effects (2 studies, 678 people), any unwanted effects (5 studies, 660 people), or infections caught in hospital (5 studies, 660 people). 
Methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone (1 study, 86 people) 
• We don’t know whether the corticosteroid methylprednisolone reduces the number of deaths from any cause compared to dexamethasone in the 28 days after treatment.• We don’t know if methylprednisolone worsens people’s symptoms compared to dexamethasone, based on whether they needed ventilation in the 28 days after treatment.• The study did not provide information about anything else we were interested in. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are moderately confident in the evidence about corticosteroids’ effect on deaths from any cause. However, our confidence in the other evidence is low to very low, because studies did not use the most robust methods, and the way results were recorded and reported differed across studies. We did not find any evidence on quality of life and there was no evidence from low‐income countries or on people with mild COVID‐19 or no symptoms, who were not hospitalised.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
Our evidence is up to date to 16 April 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD012488.pub2,"Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions 
Why is this review important? 
More than one in ten children and adolescents have long‐term physical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems like anxiety or depression. Treating these problems early can prevent difficulties with family life, school, and future mental health problems. It is currently unclear whether psychological therapies (talking therapies) designed for children and adolescents without medical issues are appropriate for use with this population. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
This review will be of interest to mental and medical healthcare providers, service users, and service commissioners. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review aims to answer the following questions: 1) Are psychological therapies better than a range of other therapies in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions? and 2) Are psychological therapies acceptable to this audience? 
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched a number of databases to find all high‐quality trials of psychological therapies for anxiety or depression in children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with long‐term physical conditions and symptoms of anxiety or depression, published from 1970 to September 2018. We included twenty‐nine studies with a total of 1349 people in the review and rated the overall quality of the studies as 'low to moderate'. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
A handful of psychological therapies have been researched in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. Most of these were developed for use with children and adolescents who do not have long‐term physical conditions. Some of these, particularly those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and therapies specifically designed to treat depression or anxiety, are effective at reducing mild symptoms of these conditions in the short term. There is limited evidence that such therapies are acceptable to young people and that they can improve quality of life and symptoms of long‐term physical conditions. There is currently a lack of therapies for addressing health‐related anxiety in this population. 
What should happen next? 
Further research should be undertaken to develop more effective psychological therapies to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. 
","## Helping Young People with Health Problems Feel Better

### Rationale

Many kids and teens have health problems that last a long time. These include issues like asthma, diabetes, or cancer. When children live with these conditions, they often feel worried or sad. They may have anxiety or depression.

These feelings can make it hard to be with family. They can also make school tough. Plus, these feelings can lead to more mental health problems later on. We want to help young people feel better early.

We know that talking to someone can help people feel less anxious or sad. These are called psychological therapies. But we are not sure if the same talking therapies that help healthy kids also work for kids with long-term health issues. This study looked at that question. We wanted to see if these therapies could truly help young people with ongoing health problems.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. We searched for all good studies about talking therapies. These studies had to include children and teens up to 18 years old. All of these young people had long-term health problems. They also had signs of worry or sadness.

We looked at studies published between 1970 and September 2018. We found 29 studies in total. These studies included 1,349 young people. We looked at how well these studies were done. We rated their quality as ""low to moderate."" This means some studies were better than others.

The study wanted to answer two main things. First, do talking therapies work better than other ways to reduce worry and sadness in these young people? Second, do young people like these talking therapies? Are they willing to try them?

### Results

We found that a few types of talking therapies have been studied. Most of these therapies were made for kids without long-term health problems. But some of them did help.

These therapies were mostly based on something called Cognitive Behavior Therapy, or CBT. CBT teaches people new ways to think and act. Other therapies were made just for sadness or worry. These therapies helped reduce mild sadness and worry. They worked for a short time.

We also looked at if young people liked these therapies. We found some proof that they do. These therapies might also make life better for these young people. They could even help with their long-term health issues. But we need more proof.

One thing we did not find was therapies for health-related worries. Kids with ongoing health problems often worry about their health. We need more ways to help them with this specific worry.

In short, talking therapies can help some young people with long-term health problems. They can reduce mild worry and sadness. But we need more research. We need to make even better talking therapies. These new therapies should be made especially for kids with long-term health problems. They should also help with health-related worries. This will help more young people feel better.","Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions

10.1002-14651858.CD013287.pub2,"Background
Psychosis is an illness characterised by the presence of hallucinations and delusions that can cause distress or a marked change in an individual's behaviour (e.g. social withdrawal, flat or blunted affect). A first episode of psychosis (FEP) is the first time someone experiences these symptoms that can occur at any age, but the condition is most common in late adolescence and early adulthood. This review is concerned with FEP and the early stages of a psychosis, referred to throughout this review as 'recent‐onset psychosis.' 
Specialised early intervention (SEI) teams are community mental health teams that specifically treat people who are experiencing, or have experienced, a recent‐onset psychosis. SEI teams provide a range of treatments including medication, psychotherapy, psychoeducation, educational and employment support, augmented by assertive contact with the service user and small caseloads. Treatment is time limited, usually offered for two to three years, after which service users are either discharged to primary care or transferred to a standard adult community mental health team. Evidence suggests that once SEI treatment ends, improvements may not be sustained, bringing uncertainty about the optimal duration of SEI to ensure the best long‐term outcomes. Extending SEI has been proposed as a way of providing continued intensive treatment and continuity of care, of usually up to five years, in order to a) sustain the positive initial outcomes of SEI; and b) improve the long‐term trajectory of the illness. 
Objectives
To compare extended SEI teams with treatment as usual (TAU) for people with recent‐onset psychosis.To compare extended SEI teams with standard SEI teams followed by TAU (standard SEI + TAU) for people with recent‐onset psychosis. 
Search methods
On 3 October 2018 and 22 October 2019, we searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's study‐based register of trials, including registries of clinical trials. 
Selection criteria
We selected all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing extended SEI with TAU for people with recent‐onset psychosis and all RCTs comparing extended SEI with standard SEI + TAU for people with recent‐onset psychosis. We entered trials meeting these criteria and reporting usable data as included studies. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes we calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and their 95% CIs, or if assessment measures differed for the same construct, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included three RCTs, with a total 780 participants, aged 16 to 35 years. All participants met the criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorders or affective psychoses. No trials compared extended SEI with TAU. All three trials randomly allocated people approximately two years into standard SEI to either extended SEI or standard SEI + TAU. 
The certainty of evidence for outcomes varied from low to very low. Our primary outcomes were recovery and disengagement from mental health services. No trials reported on recovery, and we used remission as a proxy. 
Three trials reported on remission, with the point estimate suggesting a 13% increase in remission in favour of extended SEI, but this included wide confidence intervals (CIs) and a very uncertain estimate of no benefit (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.31; 3 trials, 780 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Two trials provided data on disengagement from services with evidence that extended SEI care may result in fewer disengagements from mental health treatment (15%) in comparison to standard SEI + TAU (34%) (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75; 2 trials, 380 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
There may be no evidence of a difference in rates of psychiatric hospital admission (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.52; 1 trial, 160 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or the number of days spent in a psychiatric hospital (MD ‐2.70, 95% CI ‐8.30 to 2.90; 1 trial, 400 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
One trial found uncertain evidence regarding lower global psychotic symptoms in extended SEI in comparison to standard SEI + TAU (MD ‐1.90, 95% CI ‐3.28 to ‐0.52; 1 trial, 156 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
It was uncertain whether the use of extended SEI over standard SEI + TAU resulted in fewer deaths due to all‐cause mortality, as so few deaths were recorded in trials (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.64; 3 trials, 780 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Very uncertain evidence suggests that using extended SEI instead of standard SEI + TAU may not improve global functioning (SMD 0.23, 95% CI ‐0.29 to 0.76; 2 trials, 560 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
There was low risk of bias in all three trials for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and other biases. All three trials had high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel due to the nature of the intervention. For the risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessments and incomplete outcome data there was at least one trial with high or unclear risk of bias. 
Authors' conclusions
There may be preliminary evidence of benefit from extending SEI team care for treating people experiencing psychosis, with fewer people disengaging from mental health services. Evidence regarding other outcomes was uncertain. The certainty of evidence for the measured outcomes was low or very low. 
Further, suitably powered studies that use a consistent approach to outcome selection are needed, but with only one further ongoing trial, there is unlikely to be any definitive conclusion for the effectiveness of extended SEI for at least the next few years. 
","## Plain Title
Longer Care for People with Recent Psychosis: Does It Help?

## Rationale
Psychosis is a serious health issue. It causes people to see or hear things that are not real. It also causes them to have strong beliefs that are not true. These problems can make people very upset. They can also change how people act. They might pull away from others. They might not show feelings.

Psychosis can happen at any age. But it often starts when people are young adults. This study looked at new or recent psychosis. We call this ""recent-onset psychosis.""

Special teams help people with recent psychosis. These teams offer many types of care. They give medicine. They offer talk therapy. They teach about the illness. They help with school or jobs. They also keep in close touch with patients. These teams usually help for two to three years. After that, people go to their regular doctor. Or they go to a normal mental health team.

But when this special care ends, people might not stay well. It is not clear how long this special care should last. We want to find the best way to help people long-term.

We think longer special care could help. It might last up to five years. This could keep people feeling better. It could also make their illness easier to manage over time. This study looked to see if this longer care truly helps.

## Trial Design
How is this study designed?
We looked at past studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. This makes sure the groups are fair.

We wanted to compare two types of care. One was longer special care. The other was ""usual care."" Usual care means what people normally get. This is standard special care followed by regular care.

We looked for studies that fit these rules. The people in these studies had recent psychosis. They were between 16 and 35 years old. The studies looked at how the different types of care worked.

We checked all the studies very carefully. We made sure they were good studies. We gathered all the facts from them. We looked at things like how many people got better. We also looked at how many people stopped their treatment.

## Results
What were the main results of the study?
We found three studies to include. These studies had 780 people in total. All these people had recent psychosis. They were 16 to 35 years old.

No studies compared longer special care with just regular care. All three studies compared longer special care with standard special care followed by regular care. People in these studies had already been in standard special care for about two years.

We found that the facts we gathered were not very strong. It was hard to be sure about some results.

One main goal was to see if people got well. Another was to see if people stopped their treatment. No studies used the word ""recovery."" So, we looked at ""remission"" instead. Remission means symptoms get much better.

Three studies looked at remission. Longer special care might lead to 13% more people having remission. But this number was not very certain. It could be that there was no real help.

Two studies showed that fewer people stopped their mental health care. In the longer special care group, 15% stopped care. In the standard care group, 34% stopped care. This means longer care might help people stay in treatment.

We did not find clear proof about hospital stays. It was not clear if longer care changed how many people went to the hospital. It also did not change how long people stayed there.

One study looked at symptoms. It was not clear if longer care made symptoms much lower.

It was also not clear if longer care helped people live longer. Very few people died in the studies. So, we could not say for sure.

Longer care might not make a big difference in how well people function each day. The facts for this were also not very strong.

The people who did this study think longer special care might help. It might help fewer people stop their mental health treatment. But for other things, we are not sure yet. The facts we have are not very strong.

We need more good studies. These studies need to look at the same things. This will help us know for sure. But new answers might not come for a few years.","Is extending the treatment time by specialist mental health teams better for people with recent‐onset psychosis? 
What is psychosis? 
Psychosis describes conditions affecting the mind, in which people have trouble distinguishing what is real from what is not real. This might involve seeing or hearing things that other people cannot see or hear (hallucinations), or believing things that are not true (delusions). The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can cause severe distress and a change in behaviour. A first episode psychosis is the first time a person experiences an episode of psychosis. Recent‐onset psychosis is the first few years of the illness after someone experiences it for the first time. 
Psychosis is treatable 
Many people recover from a first episode and never experience another psychotic episode.
Early intervention teams specialise in treating recent‐onset psychosis, and aim to treat psychosis as quickly and intensively as possible. Intensive, early treatment of psychosis may help more people to continue with their treatment and to recover. 
Early intervention treatment usually lasts for two or three years. After early intervention treatment, a person will be cared for by their doctor or by standard community mental health professionals. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out if longer treatment (for up to 5 years) by specialist early intervention teams was more successful at treating recent‐onset psychosis than the usual two or three years of treatment followed by treatment by non‐specialist teams. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the use of longer treatment of recent‐onset psychosis by specialist early intervention teams. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random. This type of study usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
We wanted to find out, at the end of the treatment:
‐ how many people recovered;
‐ how many people stopped their treatment too soon;
‐ how many people were admitted to a psychiatric hospital, and for how long;
‐ people's psychotic symptoms and functioning (how well they cope with daily life); and 
‐ how many people died.
Search date: we included evidence published up to 22 October 2019. 
What we found 
We found three studies conducted in Denmark, Canada and Hong Kong in 780 people (55% men; average age 20 to 25 years). 
The studies compared longer treatment (up to 5 years) with standard treatment (up to 3 years) by an early intervention team followed by treatment as usual (by their doctor or community mental health professionals). 
What are the results of our review? 
We found no difference between standard treatment and longer treatment by an early intervention team in the numbers of people who recovered (assessed by remission of symptoms; 3 studies; 780 people). 
Fewer people may stop their treatment too soon during longer treatment than standard treatment (2 studies; 380 people). 
There may be no difference between standard treatment and longer treatment for how many people are admitted to a psychiatric hospital (1 study; 160 people), or for how long they stay in hospital (1 study; 400 people). 
Longer treatment may reduce psychotic symptoms more than standard treatment (1 study; 156 people); but may not improve people's functioning (2 studies; 560 people). 
We are uncertain about whether longer treatment reduces the number of people who died, compared with standard treatment, because so few deaths were reported in the studies (3 studies; 780 people). 
How reliable are these results? 
Our results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. We are not confident that longer treatment affects how many people stop treatment too soon, how many are admitted to hospital and how long they stay in hospital. 
We are uncertain about the effect of longer treatment on how many people recover, people's psychotic symptoms and functioning, and on the number of people who die. These results will change when more evidence becomes available. 
Key messages 
Longer treatment of recent‐onset psychosis by specialist mental health teams may lead to fewer people stopping their treatment early. However, we need more evidence before we can be certain about whether longer treatment is better overall than the usual two‐ or three‐year treatment.

10.1002-14651858.CD007492.pub2,"Healthcare services for adults with an intellectual disability
Background 
Adults with an intellectual disability often have difficulty in receiving the healthcare they need. Compared to other adults who do not have an intellectual disability, they have poorer health and have more difficulty finding, getting to, and paying for healthcare. This happens for both physical and mental healthcare needs. 
Review question 
We conducted a review of the literature to assess the effects of different ways to organise services. This is the first update of a previously published review. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all relevant studies until 4 September 2015. We found seven studies, six of which we identified previously and one retrieved for this update. All of the studies assessed the impact of the intervention on the mental health of persons with an intellectual disability; none considered the physical health. Those studies used different interventions, including giving persons with an intellectual disability more health services, psychological support, and treating them at home, instead of at the hospital. Studies mainly looked at how the interventions helped the behavioural problems of those with an intellectual disability, how much burden they caused the care givers, and how much they cost. No study assessed adverse events. 
Key results 
Community‐based behaviour therapy might decrease behavioural problems. We are uncertain whether other interventions make any difference in reducing behavioural problems. There was limited evidence about how those interventions helped care givers to deal with the burden of caring for their relatives with an intellectual disability, or how much they might cost compared with the usual care already provided. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is little information on different ways to organise services for people with intellectual disabilities. Most studies focused on people who had intellectual disabilities and mental health problems. There were no studies on people who had intellectual disabilities and physical problems.

**Rationale**

Adults with learning difficulties often struggle to get good healthcare. They face many challenges. These include finding doctors, getting to appointments, and paying for care. This affects both their body and mind. This means they often have worse health than other adults.

We want to find better ways to organize healthcare for them. We want to see what helps them get the care they need. We looked at different ways services are set up. This study is important. It helps us understand how to improve their health and well-being. Finding better ways to deliver care can make a big difference. It can ease the burden on families too.

**Trial Design**

This study is a review. We looked at past research. We searched for all helpful studies up to September 4, 2015. We found seven studies in total. Six of these studies we found before. We found one new study for this update.

All studies looked at mental health. They did not look at physical health. The studies tried different things. Some gave more health services. Others gave support for the mind. Some treated people at home. This was instead of going to a hospital. The studies checked a few things. They looked at behavior problems. They also checked how much stress caregivers felt. They also looked at the cost of care. No study checked for bad side effects.

**Results**

We found some interesting things. One type of help is ""community-based behavior therapy."" This might make behavior problems better. For other types of help, we are not sure. We do not know if they made a difference for behavior problems.

There was not much information about caregivers. We do not know if these services helped them. We also do not know how much these services cost. We compared them to the usual care.

Here is what we learned. We do not have much information. We need to know more about how to set up services. This is for people with learning difficulties. Most studies looked at mental health. No studies looked at physical health. We need more research in this area. We need to find the best ways to help. This will improve their lives. It will also help their families.","Healthcare services for adults with an intellectual disability
Background 
Adults with an intellectual disability often have difficulty in receiving the healthcare they need. Compared to other adults who do not have an intellectual disability, they have poorer health and have more difficulty finding, getting to, and paying for healthcare. This happens for both physical and mental healthcare needs. 
Review question 
We conducted a review of the literature to assess the effects of different ways to organise services. This is the first update of a previously published review. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all relevant studies until 4 September 2015. We found seven studies, six of which we identified previously and one retrieved for this update. All of the studies assessed the impact of the intervention on the mental health of persons with an intellectual disability; none considered the physical health. Those studies used different interventions, including giving persons with an intellectual disability more health services, psychological support, and treating them at home, instead of at the hospital. Studies mainly looked at how the interventions helped the behavioural problems of those with an intellectual disability, how much burden they caused the care givers, and how much they cost. No study assessed adverse events. 
Key results 
Community‐based behaviour therapy might decrease behavioural problems. We are uncertain whether other interventions make any difference in reducing behavioural problems. There was limited evidence about how those interventions helped care givers to deal with the burden of caring for their relatives with an intellectual disability, or how much they might cost compared with the usual care already provided. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is little information on different ways to organise services for people with intellectual disabilities. Most studies focused on people who had intellectual disabilities and mental health problems. There were no studies on people who had intellectual disabilities and physical problems.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication amongst people who are critically ill, and it is associated with an increased risk of death. For people with severe AKI, continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT), which is delivered over 24 hours, is needed when they become haemodynamically unstable. When CKRT is interrupted due to clotting of the extracorporeal circuit, the delivered dose is decreased and thus leading to undertreatment. 
Objectives
This review assessed the efficacy of non‐pharmacological measures to maintain circuit patency in CKRT. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 January 2021 which includes records identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (parallel‐group and cross‐over studies), cluster RCTs and quasi‐RCTs that examined non‐pharmacological interventions to prevent clotting of extracorporeal circuits during CKRT.  
Data collection and analysis
Three pairs of review authors independently extracted information including participants, interventions/comparators, outcomes, study methods, and risk of bias. The primary outcomes were circuit lifespan and death due to any cause at day 28. We used a random‐effects model to perform quantitative synthesis (meta‐analysis). We assessed the risk of bias in included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing the risk of bias. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
Main results
A total of 20 studies involving 1143 randomised participants were included in the review. The methodological quality of the included studies was low, mainly due to the unclear randomisation process and blinding of the intervention. We found evidence on the following 11 comparisons: (i) continuous venovenous haemodialysis (CVVHD) versus continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) or continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF); (ii) CVVHDF versus CVVH; (iii) higher blood flow (≥ 250 mL/minute) versus standard blood flow (< 250 mL/minute); (iv) AN69 membrane (AN69ST) versus other membranes; (v) pre‐dilution versus post‐dilution; (vi) a longer catheter (> 20 cm) placing the tip targeting the right atrium versus a shorter catheter (≤ 20 cm) placing the tip in the superior vena cava; (vii) surface‐modified double‐lumen catheter versus standard double‐lumen catheter with identical geometry and flow design; (viii) single‐site infusion anticoagulation versus double‐site infusion anticoagulation; (ix) flat plate filter versus hollow fibre filter of the same membrane type; (x) a filter with a larger membrane surface area versus a smaller one; and (xi) a filter with more and shorter hollow fibre versus a standard filter of the same membrane type. 
Circuit lifespan was reported in 9 comparisons. Low certainty evidence indicated that CVVHDF (versus CVVH: MD 10.15 hours, 95% CI 5.15 to 15.15; 1 study, 62 circuits), pre‐dilution haemofiltration (versus post‐dilution haemofiltration: MD 9.34 hours, 95% CI ‐2.60 to 21.29; 2 studies, 47 circuits; I² = 13%), placing the tip of a longer catheter targeting the right atrium (versus placing a shorter catheter targeting the tip in the superior vena cava: MD 6.50 hours, 95% CI 1.48 to 11.52; 1 study, 420 circuits), and surface‐modified double‐lumen catheter (versus standard double‐lumen catheter: MD 16.00 hours, 95% CI 13.49 to 18.51; 1 study, 262 circuits) may prolong circuit lifespan. However, higher blood flow may not increase circuit lifespan (versus standard blood flow: MD 0.64, 95% CI ‐3.37 to 4.64; 2 studies, 499 circuits; I² = 70%). More and shorter hollow fibre filters (versus standard filters: MD ‐5.87 hours, 95% CI ‐10.18 to ‐1.56; 1 study, 6 circuits) may reduce circuit lifespan. 
Death from any cause was reported in four comparisons We are uncertain whether CVVHDF versus CVVH, CVVHD versus CVVH or CVVHDF, longer versus a shorter catheter, or surface‐modified double‐lumen catheters versus standard double‐lumen catheters reduced death due to any cause, in very low certainty evidence. 
Recovery of kidney function was reported in three comparisons. We are uncertain whether CVVHD versus CVVH or CVVHDF, CVVHDF versus CVVH, or surface‐modified double‐lumen catheters versus standard double‐lumen catheters increased recovery of kidney function. 
Vascular access complications were reported in two comparisons. Low certainty evidence indicated using a longer catheter (versus a shorter catheter: RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.74) may reduce vascular access complications, however, the use of surface‐modified double lumen catheters versus standard double‐lumen catheters may make little or no difference to vascular access complications. 
Authors' conclusions
The use of CVVHDF as compared with CVVH, pre‐dilution haemofiltration, a longer catheter, and surface‐modified double‐lumen catheter may prolong the circuit lifespan, while higher blood flow and more and shorter hollow fibre filter may reduce circuit life. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed to be low to very low due to the small sample size of the included studies. 
Data from future rigorous and transparent research are much needed in order to fully understand the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions in preventing circuit coagulation amongst people with AKI receiving CKRT. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title
Ways to Keep Life Support Machines Working for People with Sick Kidneys

### Rationale
Sometimes, people get very sick and their kidneys stop working well. This is called acute kidney injury (AKI). When this happens, a person might need a special machine to clean their blood. This machine is called continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT). It works for 24 hours a day.

But sometimes, the tubes and parts of the machine can get blocked by blood clots. When this happens, the machine stops working. This means the person does not get all the cleaning they need for their blood. This can be very bad for their health.

Doctors want to find ways to stop these clots from forming. This study looked at different ways to keep the machine working longer. It explored things that do not involve medicines. If we can keep the machine running, it can help people with sick kidneys get better.

### Trial Design
This study looked at other studies that tested ways to keep the CKRT machine working. These were studies where people were put into different groups by chance. This is like flipping a coin to decide. This helps make sure the groups are alike.

The studies included people of different ages who were very sick with AKI. They all needed the CKRT machine. The studies looked at things like how the machine was set up or what type of tubes were used.

The main goal was to see how long the machine kept working without clotting. They also looked at how many people died and if their kidneys got better. This review brought together information from many studies to get a clearer picture.

### Results
We looked at 20 studies with over 1100 people. The quality of these studies was not very high. It was hard to tell if the ways people were chosen for groups were truly by chance. It was also hard to tell if everyone knew what treatment they were getting.

We found some clues that certain things might help the machine last longer:
*   Using a specific type of blood cleaning called CVVHDF.
*   Cleaning the blood in a certain way called ""pre-dilution.""
*   Using a longer tube that reaches a specific spot in the heart.
*   Using a special type of tube called a ""surface-modified double-lumen catheter.""

For example, using CVVHDF might make the machine work about 10 hours longer. A longer tube might add about 6 hours. The special tube might add 16 hours.

However, using a faster blood flow might not make the machine last longer. And some filters with ""more and shorter hollow fibers"" might even make the machine stop working sooner.

We are not sure if any of these changes helped people live longer. We are also not sure if they helped kidneys get better.

Using a longer tube might cause fewer problems with where the tube goes into the body. But the special tube did not seem to change these problems.

Overall, the information from these studies is not very strong. We need more good studies to be sure about what works best. This will help doctors make better choices for people with AKI.","Non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing clotting of extracorporeal circuits during continuous kidney replacement therapy 
What is the issue? 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major problem in people with severe illness. In cases of severe AKI, kidney replacement therapy/dialysis (KRT) using circuits is necessary. Continuous kidney replacement therapy is performed continuously over 24 hours. Clotting of the CKRT circuit can interfere with this treatment. To prevent this, a variety of non‐pharmacological (not using medication) interventions have been studied. We aimed to summarise current evidence regarding the efficacy of non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing clotting of extracorporeal circuits during CKRT. 
What did we do? 
We searched for available evidence from the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 25 January 2021. Our review summarised the results of 20 randomised studies involving a total of 1143 people. 
What did we find? 
We found that the quality of the 20 included studies was low, and the number randomised was small. The majority of the included studies did not report death as an outcome. We found that continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), as compared with continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH), may prolong circuit lifespan. In addition, pre‐dilution haemofiltration, as compared with post‐dilution haemofiltration, a longer catheter placing the tip at the right atrium, as compared with a shorter catheter placing the tip in the superior vena cava, and surface‐modified double lumen catheter, as compared with standard double lumen catheter, may extend the circuit lifespan. However, higher blood flow compared to standard blood flow rate might not affect circuit lifespan. Overall, the data was limited and of very low certainty. 
Conclusions 
We found that the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions in people with AKI receiving CKRT remain unclear. There is a need for studies assessing CKRT circuit lifespan as well as other clinically important outcomes.

10.1002-14651858.CD013398.pub3,"Background
Despite being preventable, malaria remains an important public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that overall progress in malaria control has plateaued for the first time since the turn of the century. Researchers and policymakers are therefore exploring alternative and supplementary malaria vector control tools. Research in 1900 indicated that modification of houses may be effective in reducing malaria: this is now being revisited, with new research now examining blocking house mosquito entry points or modifying house construction materials to reduce exposure of inhabitants to infectious bites. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of house modifications on malaria disease and transmission.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CAB) Abstracts (Web of Science); and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS), up to 1 November 2019. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/) to identify ongoing trials up to the same date. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials, including cluster‐randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), cross‐over studies, and stepped‐wedge designs were eligible, as were quasi‐experimental trials, including controlled before‐and‐after studies, controlled interrupted time series, and non‐randomized cross‐over studies. We only considered studies reporting epidemiological outcomes (malaria case incidence, malaria infection incidence or parasite prevalence). We also summarised qualitative studies conducted alongside included studies. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used risk ratios (RR) to compare the effect of the intervention with the control for dichotomous data. For continuous data, we presented the mean difference; and for count and rate data, we used rate ratios. We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Six cRCTs met our inclusion criteria, all conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa; three randomized by household, two by village, and one at the community level. All trials assessed screening of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings or any combination of these; this was either alone, or in combination with eave closure, roof modification or eave tube installation (a ""lure and kill"" device that reduces mosquito entry whilst maintaining some airflow). In two trials, the interventions were insecticide‐based. In five trials, the researchers implemented the interventions. The community implemented the interventions in the sixth trial. 
At the time of writing the review, two of the six trials had published results, both of which compared screened houses (without insecticide) to unscreened houses. One trial in Ethiopia assessed screening of windows and doors. Another trial in the Gambia assessed full screening (screening of eaves, doors and windows), as well as screening of ceilings only. 
Screening may reduce clinical malaria incidence caused by Plasmodium falciparum (rate ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.82; 1 trial, 184 participants, 219.3 person‐years; low‐certainty evidence; Ethiopian study). For malaria parasite prevalence, the point estimate, derived from The Gambia study, was smaller (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.17; 713 participants, 1 trial; low‐certainty evidence), and showed an effect on anaemia (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42, 0.89; 705 participants; 1 trial, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Screening may reduce the entomological inoculation rate (EIR): both trials showed lower estimates in the intervention arm. In the Gambian trial, there was a mean difference in EIR between the control houses and treatment houses ranging from 0.45 to 1.50 (CIs ranged from ‐0.46 to 2.41; low‐certainty evidence), depending on the study year and treatment arm. The Ethiopian trial reported a mean difference in EIR of 4.57, favouring screening (95% CI 3.81 to 5.33; low‐certainty evidence). 
Pooled analysis of the trials showed that individuals living in fully screened houses were slightly less likely to sleep under a bed net (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.09; 2 trials, 203 participants). In one trial, bed net usage was also lower in individuals living in houses with screened ceilings (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95; 1 trial, 135 participants). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the two trials published to date, there is some evidence that screening may reduce malaria transmission and malaria infection in people living in the house. The four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base, and we will add these to this review when they become available.

### Plain Title
Can Fixing Houses Stop Malaria?

### Rationale
Malaria is a bad sickness. It is spread by mosquito bites. Many people still get sick from it. In fact, numbers of people getting malaria stopped going down. This is a big problem. Doctors and scientists want to find new ways to stop malaria.

Long ago, people thought changing houses could help. They thought fixing homes could keep mosquitoes out. Now, we are looking at this idea again. We want to see if blocking gaps in houses works. We also want to see if changing building stuff helps. This might keep people from getting bitten by sick mosquitoes.

This study asks a big question. Can we change houses to stop malaria? We want to know if it can stop people from getting sick. We also want to know if it can stop the sickness from spreading.

### Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies. It searched for studies that tested house changes. These changes aimed to stop malaria. We looked for studies that compared changed houses to normal houses.

We looked for studies that gave people malaria. Or studies that checked for the malaria bug. We also looked for studies about how people felt about the changes.

We found six main studies. All these studies were in Africa. They looked at things like screens on windows and doors. Some also looked at closing off open spaces in roofs. One idea was a ""lure and kill"" device. This lets air in but traps bugs. Some studies also used bug spray in the house changes.

The studies looked at groups of houses or whole villages. In most studies, researchers made the changes. In one study, people in the village made the changes. We looked at what happened in these studies. This helped us see if the house changes worked.

### Results
Two of the six studies have shared their results so far. Both looked at houses with screens. These screens did not have bug spray. They compared them to houses without screens.

One study was in Ethiopia. It looked at screens on windows and doors. This study showed that screens might cut down on malaria sickness. People in screened houses got sick less often. They had almost three times less malaria. This is good news.

Another study was in The Gambia. It looked at full screens on eaves, doors, and windows. It also looked at only screening ceilings. This study showed a small cut in the malaria bug in people. It also showed less blood loss in people. This means screens might help people feel better.

Both studies showed fewer mosquitoes that carry malaria bugs. This means fewer bites. It means fewer sick mosquitoes in screened homes.

But, people in screened houses used bed nets less. Bed nets are another way to stop mosquito bites. This was true for fully screened houses. It was also true for houses with only screened ceilings.

From these two studies, we think screens might lower malaria. They might also lower malaria in people. We are waiting for the other four studies to share their results. Those studies will give us more answers.","House modifications for preventing malaria
What is the aim of this review? 
House modifications, such as screening (covering potential house entry points for mosquitoes with netting or mesh), or the use of alternative construction materials, may contribute to reducing the burden of malaria. They work by blocking mosquitoes from entering houses, and reducing the number of bites householders receive indoors. Some of the house modifications under consideration additionally aim to kill any mosquitoes that attempt to enter houses by incorporating insecticide into the modification. 
Key messages 
Screening windows, doors, eaves and ceilings to prevent mosquitoes entering the house may reduce malaria transmission and illness in people living in the house, based on evidence from two studies conducted in Africa. Four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review summarized studies investigating the effects of house modifications on human malaria outcomes. If studies additionally reported the effect of the house modifications on mosquitoes (those with potential to carry malaria), or householders' views, we also summarized this data. After searching for relevant studies, we identified six studies conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa, two of which have published data, and four of which are not yet in the public domain. All trials assessed screening (of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings, or any combination of these), either alone or in combination with eave closure, roof modification, or eave tube installation (a ""lure and kill"" device positioned in eave gaps). 
What are the main results of the review? 
The two trials with published data assessed the effect of screening alone on malaria infection. Both trials showed a reduction in malaria in screened houses, to varying degrees of effect. One trial in Ethiopia showed that people living in screened houses were around 62% less likely to experience an episode of clinical malaria (caused by P falciparum). However, the certainty of this evidence was low due to issues with the study design, and the trial did not study enough people for us to be confident about the results. Another trial in The Gambia showed that people living in screened houses were around 16% less likely to have P falciparum malaria parasites in their blood, and were less likely to experience anaemia. Our confidence in this result was low because the trial did not study enough people. 
How up to date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies available up to 1 November 2019.

10.1002-14651858.CD013229.pub2,"Background
Smoking is a leading cause of disease and death worldwide. In people who smoke, quitting smoking can reverse much of the damage. Many people use behavioural interventions to help them quit smoking; these interventions can vary substantially in their content and effectiveness. 
Objectives
To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effect of behavioural interventions designed to support smoking cessation attempts and to conduct a network meta‐analysis to determine how modes of delivery; person delivering the intervention; and the nature, focus, and intensity of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation influence the likelihood of achieving abstinence six months after attempting to stop smoking; and whether the effects of behavioural interventions depend upon other characteristics, including population, setting, and the provision of pharmacotherapy. 
To summarise the availability and principal findings of economic evaluations of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation, in terms of comparative costs and cost‐effectiveness, in the form of a brief economic commentary. 
Methods
This work comprises two main elements. 1. We conducted a Cochrane Overview of reviews following standard Cochrane methods. We identified Cochrane Reviews of behavioural interventions (including all non‐pharmacological interventions, e.g. counselling, exercise, hypnotherapy, self‐help materials) for smoking cessation by searching the Cochrane Library in July 2020. We evaluated the methodological quality of reviews using AMSTAR 2 and synthesised data from the reviews narratively. 2. We used the included reviews to identify randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation compared with other behavioural interventions or no intervention for smoking cessation. To be included, studies had to include adult smokers and measure smoking abstinence at six months or longer. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. We synthesised data using Bayesian component network meta‐analysis (CNMA), examining the effects of 38 different components compared to minimal intervention. Components included behavioural and motivational elements, intervention providers, delivery modes, nature, focus, and intensity of the behavioural intervention. We used component network meta‐regression (CNMR) to evaluate the influence of population characteristics, provision of pharmacotherapy, and intervention intensity on the component effects. We evaluated certainty of the evidence using GRADE domains. We assumed an additive effect for individual components. 
Main results
We included 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which 312 randomised controlled trials, representing 250,563 participants and 845 distinct study arms, met the criteria for inclusion in our component network meta‐analysis. This represented 437 different combinations of components. Of the 33 reviews, confidence in review findings was high in four reviews and moderate in nine reviews, as measured by the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool. The remaining 20 reviews were low or critically low due to one or more critical weaknesses, most commonly inadequate investigation or discussion (or both) of the impact of publication bias. Of note, the critical weaknesses identified did not affect the searching, screening, or data extraction elements of the review process, which have direct bearing on our CNMA. Of the included studies, 125/312 were at low risk of bias overall, 50 were at high risk of bias, and the remainder were at unclear risk. Analyses from the contributing reviews and from our CNMA showed behavioural interventions for smoking cessation can increase quit rates, but effectiveness varies on characteristics of the support provided. There was high‐certainty evidence of benefit for the provision of counselling (odds ratio (OR) 1.44, 95% credibility interval (CrI) 1.22 to 1.70, 194 studies, n = 72,273) and guaranteed financial incentives (OR 1.46, 95% CrI 1.15 to 1.85, 19 studies, n = 8877). Evidence of benefit remained when removing studies at high risk of bias. These findings were consistent with pair‐wise meta‐analyses from contributing reviews. There was moderate‐certainty evidence of benefit for interventions delivered via text message (downgraded due to unexplained statistical heterogeneity in pair‐wise comparison), and for the following components where point estimates suggested benefit but CrIs incorporated no clinically significant difference: individual tailoring; intervention content including motivational components; intervention content focused on how to quit. The remaining intervention components had low‐to very low‐certainty evidence, with the main issues being imprecision and risk of bias. There was no evidence to suggest an increase in harms in groups receiving behavioural support for smoking cessation. Intervention effects were not changed by adjusting for population characteristics, but data were limited. Increasing intensity of behavioural support, as measured through the number of contacts, duration of each contact, and programme length, had point estimates associated with modestly increased chances of quitting, but CrIs included no difference. The effect of behavioural support for smoking cessation appeared slightly less pronounced when people were already receiving smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. 
Authors' conclusions
Behavioural support for smoking cessation can increase quit rates at six months or longer, with no evidence that support increases harms. This is the case whether or not smoking cessation pharmacotherapy is also provided, but the effect is slightly more pronounced in the absence of pharmacotherapy. Evidence of benefit is strongest for the provision of any form of counselling, and guaranteed financial incentives. Evidence suggested possible benefit but the need of further studies to evaluate: individual tailoring; delivery via text message, email, and audio recording; delivery by lay health advisor; and intervention content with motivational components and a focus on how to quit. We identified 23 economic evaluations; evidence did not consistently suggest one type of behavioural intervention for smoking cessation was more cost‐effective than another. Future reviews should fully consider publication bias. Tools to investigate publication bias and to evaluate certainty in CNMA are needed. 
","## Plain Title: Help to Quit Smoking: What Works Best?

### Rationale

Smoking is a very big problem. It makes many people sick. It also causes many deaths each year. If people stop smoking, their bodies can heal a lot.

Many people try to stop smoking. They often use different types of help. This help teaches them how to change their habits. But we need to know which kinds of help work best. We also need to know why they work.

This study wants to find the best ways to help people stop smoking. We want to know if some types of help are better than others. We think certain kinds of support will help more people quit. This study will help us find out.

### Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. We called these other studies ""reviews."" We found reviews about help for quitting smoking. This help did not use medicine. It used things like talking to a counselor or using helpful tools.

We searched for these reviews in July 2020. We looked at how well these reviews were done. Then, we used these reviews to find even more studies. These studies were called ""randomized controlled trials.""

These trials looked at adults who smoked. They compared different types of quitting help. Or, they compared help to no help. They checked if people stopped smoking after six months or longer. We looked at 38 different parts of these quitting programs. This included things like who gave the help. It also looked at how the help was given. We also checked how strong the help was.

### Results

We looked at 33 main reviews. These reviews had 312 other studies inside them. These 312 studies included 250,563 people. They had 845 different ways of giving help.

Our study found that help to quit smoking can make more people stop. But, how well it works depends on what kind of help people get.

**Good news!** We found strong proof that two things work very well:

*   **Talking to a counselor:** People who got counseling were about 1.5 times more likely to quit.
*   **Getting money rewards:** People who were promised money if they quit were about 1.5 times more likely to quit.

We also found some proof that other things might help. But, we need more studies to be sure. These things include:

*   **Text messages:** Getting help through text messages.
*   **Help made just for you:** Support that fits your needs.
*   **Help with ideas to make you want to quit:** Support that helps you feel strong to quit.
*   **Help showing you how to quit:** Support that gives you steps to follow.

We did not find any proof that this help caused harm. People were not hurt by getting support.

This help works even if people are using medicine to quit. But, it seems to work a little better if they are not using medicine.

More help, like more talks or longer programs, did not clearly make more people quit.

In short, counseling and money rewards are very good ways to help people stop smoking. Other types of help show promise and need more study.","Does behavioural support help people to stop smoking?
Key messages 
Behavioural support can help more people to stop smoking for six months or longer, without causing unwanted effects. 
Some types of support appear to work better than others. More studies are needed to identify the best ways to support people who are trying to stop smoking, and to identify the best people to support them. 
Stopping smoking 
The best thing people who smoke can do for their health is to stop smoking.
Most people who smoke want to stop, but many find it difficult. People who smoke may use medicines to help them stop. Behavioural support provides an alternative – or additional – way to help people stop smoking. Sometimes behavioural support can be combined with nicotine replacement or other medicines to help people stop smoking. 
Types of behavioural support can include: advice and counselling on ways to make it easier to stop smoking; information about why or how to stop; or a combination. Behavioural support can be given in group sessions or one‐to‐one. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out:
– which types of behavioural support work best to help people stop smoking;
– the best ways to give behavioural support (including the best people to give it); and 
– what aspects of behavioural support help someone to stop smoking.
We also wanted to know if behavioural support can cause any unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for Cochrane Reviews of behavioural support to stop smoking, to identify relevant studies of adults who smoked. We then compared the studies with each other, to find out how well the different types of behavioural support helped people to stop smoking. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to July 2020. 
What we found 
We found 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which we identified 312 relevant studies in 250,503 adults (aged 18 to 63 years) who smoked cigarettes. The studies investigated 437 different combinations of ways to stop smoking. 
Most studies were conducted in the USA or Western Europe; 115 studies took place in healthcare settings and 195 took place in the community. On average, people taking part in the studies were followed up for 10.5 months. 
The studies compared the effects of behavioural support with:
– no behavioural support;
– usual or standard care;
– less‐intense forms of the behavioural support; or other approaches.
We compared all treatments with each other using a mathematical method called network meta‐analysis. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Compared with no behavioural support it was clear that some types of behavioural support increased people's chances of quitting for six months or longer, including: counselling and giving them money for successfully stopping smoking. More people stopped smoking with these types of support whether or not they were also taking medicines to help them stop smoking. 
Behavioural support by text messages probably helped more people to stop smoking than no support. 
Compared with no support, tailoring behavioural support to the person, or group of people, trying to stop smoking probably slightly increased how many of them stopped smoking, as did support that focused on how to stop smoking. 
Increasing the intensity of the support given, such as contacting people more often or having longer sessions, modestly increased how many people stopped smoking. 
We are uncertain about:
– the effects of other types of behavioural support, including hypnotherapy, exercise‐based support, and entering competitions; and 
– the effect of who gives the behavioural support.
Only some studies reported results for unwanted effects; in these, behavioural support did not increase the numbers of any unwanted effects. 
How confident are we in our results? 
We are confident that counselling and rewards of money help people to stop smoking; we do not expect that more evidence will change these results. 
We are less confident in our results for other types of behavioural support, and about who gives the support and how. We found limitations with some of the studies, including how they were designed, conducted, and reported. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. More studies are needed.

10.1002-14651858.CD013270.pub2,"Background
Age‐related cataract affects both eyes in most cases. Most people undergo cataract surgery in both eyes on separate days, referred to as delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). An alternative procedure involves operating on both eyes on the same day, but as two separate procedures, known as immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). Potential advantages of ISBCS include fewer hospital visits for the patient, faster visual recovery, and lower healthcare costs. Nevertheless, concerns exist about possible bilateral, postoperative, sight‐threatening adverse effects with ISBCS. Therefore, there is a clear need for evaluating evidence regarding the safety, effectiveness, and cost‐effectiveness of ISBCS versus DSBCS. 
Objectives
To assess the safety of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age‐related cataracts and to summarise current evidence for the incremental resource use, utilities, costs, and cost‐effectiveness associated with the use of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age‐related cataracts (primary objectives). The secondary objective was to assess visual and patient‐reported outcomes of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age‐related cataracts. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; the WHO ICTRP; and DARE and NHS EED on the CRD Database on 11 May 2021. There were no language restrictions. We limited the searches to a date range of 2007 onwards. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess complications, refractive outcomes, best‐corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) and patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs) with ISBCS compared to DSBCS. We included non‐randomised (NRSs), prospective, and retrospective cohort studies comparing ISBCS and DSBCS for safety assessment, because of the rare incidence of important adverse events. To assess cost‐effectiveness of ISBCS compared to DSBCS, we included both full and partial economic evaluations, and both trial‐based and model‐based economic evaluations. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures and assessed risk of bias for NRSs using the ROBINS‐I tool. For cost‐evaluations, we used the CHEC‐list, the CHEERS‐checklist, and the NICE‐checklist to investigate risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with the GRADE tool. We reported results for economic evaluations narratively. 
Main results
We included 14 studies in the review; two RCTs, seven NRSs, and six economic evaluations (one study was both an NRS and economic evaluation). The studies reported on 276,260 participants (7384 for ISBCS and 268,876 for DSBCS) and were conducted in Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, (South) Korea, Spain (Canary Islands), Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Overall, we considered the included RCTs to be at 'high to some concerns' risk of bias for complications, 'some concerns' risk of bias for refractive outcomes and visual acuity, and 'high' risk of bias for PROMs. The overall risk of bias for NRSs was graded 'serious' regarding complications and 'serious to critical' regarding refractive outcomes.  
With regard to endophthalmitis, we found that relative effects were estimated imprecisely and with low certainty, so that relative estimates were not reliable. Nonetheless, we found a very low risk of endophthalmitis in both ISBCS (1/14,076 participants) and DSBCS (55/556,246 participants) groups. Based on descriptive evidence and partially weak statistical evidence we found no evidence of an increased risk of endophthalmitis with ISBCS. Regarding refractive outcomes, we found moderate‐certainty (RCTs) and low‐certainty (NRSs) evidence there was no difference in the percentage of eyes that did not achieve refraction within 1.0 dioptre of target one to three months after surgery (RCTs: risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.26; NRSs: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.75). Similarly, postoperative complications did not differ between groups (RCTs: RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.40; NRSs: 1.04, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.29), although the certainty of this evidence was very low for both RCTs and NRSs. Furthermore, we found low‐certainty (RCTs) to very low‐certainty (NRSs) evidence that total costs per participant were lower for ISBCS compared to DSBCS, although results of individual studies could not be pooled. Only one study reported on cost‐effectiveness. This study found that ISBCS is cost‐effective compared to DSBCS, but did not measure quality‐adjusted life years using preferred methods and calculated costs erroneously. Finally, regarding secondary outcomes, we found limited evidence on BCDVA (data of two RCTs could not be pooled, although both studies individually found no difference between groups (very low‐certainty evidence)). Regarding PROMs, we found moderate‐certainty evidence (RCTs only) that there was no difference between groups one to three months after surgery (standardised mean difference −0.08, 95% CI −0.19 to 0.03). 
Authors' conclusions
Current evidence supports there are probably no clinically important differences in outcomes between ISBCS and DSBCS, but with lower costs for ISBCS. However, the amount of evidence is limited, and the certainty of the evidence was graded moderate to very low. In addition, there is a need for well‐designed cost‐effectiveness studies. 
","## Helping Eyes See Clearly: Same-Day vs. Different-Day Cataract Surgery

### Rationale

Cataracts are a common eye problem. They make the lens of your eye cloudy. This can make it hard to see. It can make daily tasks difficult. Most people get cataracts in both eyes.

People often have surgery for each eye on different days. This is called delayed surgery. But some doctors do surgery on both eyes on the same day. This is called immediate surgery.

Immediate surgery may have good points. It could mean fewer trips to the hospital. You might see better faster. It could also cost less money.

However, some people worry about risks. There are concerns about possible problems in both eyes. These problems could harm your sight. So, we need to know more about this. We need to see if immediate surgery is safe. We need to know if it works well. We also need to know if it saves money.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. We wanted to see how immediate surgery compares to delayed surgery. We focused on people with cataracts in both eyes.

We looked at studies that randomly assigned people to groups. This helps make sure the results are fair. We checked for problems after surgery. We also looked at how well people could see. We checked how patients felt about their vision.

We also looked at studies that were not random. We did this to check for rare safety issues. This includes serious eye infections.

Finally, we looked at studies about costs. We wanted to see if one type of surgery saved more money. We looked at how much money was spent. We also checked if it was a good value for patients. We included studies from 2007 onwards. We read studies in any language.

### Results

We looked at 14 studies in total. These studies included many people. About 276,000 people were in these studies. They had cataract surgery. The studies came from many countries. This includes Canada, Sweden, and the USA.

We found that there were no major differences. Both types of surgery were very safe. The risk of serious eye infection was very low. It was about 1 in 14,000 for immediate surgery. It was about 55 in 556,000 for delayed surgery. These numbers are very close. We did not find more risk with immediate surgery.

How well people could see after surgery was similar. Their vision did not differ much. Most people saw well. There were no big differences in other problems after surgery. Patients also felt the same about their vision after either type of surgery.

We also looked at costs. Immediate surgery often cost less money. It saved money for patients and hospitals. One study even said immediate surgery was a better value.

Overall, both types of surgery are good options. They both help people see better. Immediate surgery may save money. More studies are needed. We need more studies about costs and how well they work.","Surgery on both eyes on the same day or on different days: which works better to treat cataract in both eyes? 
Key messages 
‐ Current evidence supports there may be no important difference between surgery on both eyes on the same day (ISBCS) and surgery on different days (DSBCS) for the following clinical outcomes: eye (ocular) infection (endophthalmitis, a severe, sight‐threatening but rare complication), spectacle correction after surgery (refraction), complications, vision with spectacle correction (if needed), and patient‐reported outcomes (PROMs; questionnaires on vision). 
‐ Current evidence supports the costs for ISBCS are lower compared to DSBCS, but evidence on the balance between the costs and how well it works (cost‐effectiveness) was lacking. 
‐ Overall, the amount and quality of the evidence was limited.
What is cataract and how is it treated? 
Age‐related cataract is a natural ageing process of the lens of the eye, in which the lens becomes cloudy and vision decreases. The only way to treat cataract is by surgery. During surgery, the clouded lens is removed and replaced by an artificial lens, implanted in the eye. Currently, most people undergo cataract surgery on both eyes on different days, with a period of days, weeks, or even months between surgeries, called delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). However, it is also possible to have cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day, called immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). 
Potential advantages to ISBCS include fewer visits to the hospital, faster visual recovery, and lower healthcare costs. However, there are also potential disadvantages, such as developing complications in both eyes. Also, in ISBCS, outcomes of the first eye cannot be used when performing second‐eye surgery, which may result in worse refractive outcomes (increased spectacle dependence). 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day is as safe, effective, and cost‐effective as having surgery on both eyes on different days. 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that looked at outcomes of ISBCS compared to DSBCS. We also searched for studies that looked at the balance between costs and outcomes for ISBCS compared to DSBCS (cost‐effectiveness). We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 14 studies that involved 276,260 people (7384 who had ISBCS and 268,876 who had DSBCS). The studies were conducted in Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, (South) Korea, Spain (Canary Islands), Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Most studies lasted for around three months. 
Main results  
‐ Endophthalmitis: the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may make little to no difference in the occurrence of endophthalmitis in one eye (up to six weeks after surgery). None of the studies reported endophthalmitis in both eyes, but this event is most likely too rare to be detected by these studies. 
‐ Refractive outcomes: there is probably little to no difference in refractive outcomes at one to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS. 
‐ Other complications: there may be little to no difference in other complications up to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ Costs: the economic studies in this review reported lower costs for ISBCS compared to DSBCS. One study reported that ISBCS is cost‐effective compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ Best‐corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA; vision with spectacle correction if needed): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may have little to no effect on BCDVA at one to three months after surgery, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ PROMs (measured in questionnaires): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) probably makes little to no difference in PROMs at one to three months after surgery. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Overall, we had moderate to very little confidence in the evidence (endophthalmitis: little confidence, refractive outcomes: little to moderate confidence, complications: not confident, costs: little to no confidence, BCDVA: not confident, and PROMs: moderate confidence).  
Our confidence is limited because:
‐ the evidence on endophthalmitis was based on few cases of endophthalmitis;
‐ the studies assessed complications in different ways;
‐ there were not enough studies to be certain about refractive outcomes and complications;
‐ studies on costs reported costs for only one hospital and included different funding sources; 
‐ the studies assessed BCDVA in different ways and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results; 
‐ there were concerns regarding the possibility that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were getting, and not all studies provided data about everything that we were interested in (most outcomes).  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 11 May 2021.

### Plain Title

Fixing Injured Finger Joints Without Surgery

### Rationale

Your fingers have many small joints. The middle joint of your finger is called the proximal interphalangeal joint. Sometimes, this joint can get hurt. This happens if your finger is bent too far backward. This is called a hyperextension injury.

These injuries are very common. They often happen during sports. For example, a football can hit your outstretched hand. This type of injury usually affects adults who are working. It can make it hard to use your hand.

Doctors usually treat these injuries without surgery. They use things like splints or tape. They also tell people to do exercises. People are often told to use their hand. But they must not push it too much.

This study looked at many research papers. We wanted to find the best way to treat these finger injuries. We wanted to know what helps people get better fast. We checked how well people could use their hand. We also looked at how much pain they had. We checked how much they could bend their finger.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. We searched for studies about finger injuries. These studies needed to be ""randomized controlled trials."" This means some people got one treatment. Other people got a different treatment. A computer chose who got what. This helps make the study fair.

We wanted to know how these studies were set up. We looked for studies about the middle finger joint. We focused on hyperextension injuries. We looked for studies that tested different treatments. We wanted to see what worked best.

We checked for studies that looked at people's function. This means how well they could use their hand. We also looked at their pain. And how much they could move their joint.

We found three small studies. These studies had a total of 366 patients. All these studies were more than 15 years old. The people in the studies were adults. They had hyperextension injuries. The studies lasted for at least six months.

### Results

We looked at three studies in total. One study compared two ways of treating injuries. Some people could move their finger freely. Others had their finger kept still. Another study compared special exercises with a removable support. It also compared this to keeping the finger still. The last study compared keeping the finger still for one week. It also compared this to keeping it still for three weeks.

None of these studies found big differences. No treatment was clearly better than another. People had similar pain levels. They had similar movement in their fingers. They also had similar problems at six months.

The studies were small. They were also quite old. It was hard to be sure about the results. We found there is not enough strong proof. We need more research. We need to know if keeping the finger still helps. We also need to know how long to keep it still. This will help doctors choose the best care.","Splints and other non‐surgical methods for treating common injuries of the middle joints of the fingers

10.1002-14651858.CD013757.pub2,"Background
Respiratory viruses are the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and hospitalisation in infants and young children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main infectious agent in this population. Palivizumab is administered intramuscularly every month during five months in the first RSV season to prevent serious RSV LRTI in children. Given its high cost, it is essential to know if palivizumab continues to be effective in preventing severe RSV disease in children. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of palivizumab for preventing severe RSV infection in children.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, three other databases and two trials registers to 14 October 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We searched Embase to October 2020, as we did not have access to this database for 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐RCTs, comparing palivizumab given at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a month (maximum five doses) with placebo, no intervention or standard care in children 0 to 24 months of age from both genders, regardless of RSV infection history.  
Data collection and analysis
We used Cochrane’s Screen4Me workflow to help assess the search results. Two review authors screened studies for selection, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. The primary outcomes were hospitalisation due to RSV infection, all‐cause mortality and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were hospitalisation due to respiratory‐related illness, length of hospital stay, RSV infection, number of wheezing days, days of supplemental oxygen, intensive care unit length of stay and mechanical ventilation days. 
Main results
We included five studies with  a total of 3343 participants. All studies were parallel RCTs, assessing the effects of 15 mg/kg of palivizumab every month up to five months compared to placebo or no intervention in an outpatient setting, although one study also included hospitalised infants. Most of the included studies were conducted in children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities like bronchopulmonary dysplasia and congenital heart disease. The risk of bias of outcomes across all studies was similar and predominately low.  
Palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection at two years' follow‐up (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.64; 5 studies, 3343 participants; high certainty evidence). Based on 98 hospitalisations per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 (29 to 62) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in mortality at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.15; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 (10 to 27) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in adverse events at 150 days' follow‐up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.39; 3 studies, 2831 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Based on 84 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 91 (71 to 117) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory‐related illness at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.97; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Palivizumab may result in a large reduction in RSV infection at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55; 3 studies, 554 participants; low certainty evidence). Based on 195 cases of RSV infection per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 64 (39 to 107) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days at one year's follow‐up (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.44; 1 study, 429 participants; high certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence suggests that prophylaxis with palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection and results in little to no difference in mortality or adverse events. Moreover, palivizumab results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory‐related illness and may result in a large reduction in RSV infections. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days. These results may be applicable to children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities. 
Further research is needed to establish the effect of palivizumab on children with other comorbidities known as risk factors for severe RSV disease (e.g. immune deficiencies) and other social determinants of the disease, including children living in low‐ and middle‐income countries, tropical regions, children lacking breastfeeding, living in poverty, or members of families in overcrowded situations.  
","## Plain Title: A Medicine to Help Babies and Young Kids Avoid Serious Lung Sickness

### Rationale

Tiny bugs called viruses often make babies and young children very sick. These bugs can cause bad lung infections. One common bug is called RSV. It can make kids need to stay in the hospital.

A medicine called palivizumab can help prevent this. Doctors give it as a shot each month. It helps keep serious RSV infections away. This medicine costs a lot of money. So, we need to know if it really works well.

This study looked at how well palivizumab helps kids. We wanted to see if it stops severe RSV sickness. It could help keep many kids out of the hospital.

### Trial Design

We looked at many past studies. These studies tested palivizumab. They compared it to a fake medicine or no treatment. We included studies with children from birth to two years old. Both boys and girls were in these studies.

These studies gave kids palivizumab shots. They got 15 mg for each kg of their weight. They received one shot each month. They got up to five shots in total. We looked at how these kids did. We tracked them for a long time.

We looked for studies that were well-designed. This means they were ""randomized controlled trials."" These types of studies give the best answers. We wanted to see if palivizumab helped.

### Results

We found five good studies. These studies included 3343 kids in total. Most of these kids were at high risk. They had other health problems. These problems made RSV very dangerous for them.

The studies showed clear results. Palivizumab cut the number of kids in the hospital. These were kids sick with RSV. For every 1000 kids, 98 would need to go to the hospital without the medicine. With palivizumab, only 43 did. This is a big drop.

The medicine did not change how many kids died. It also did not cause more side effects. Side effects are bad things that happen from a medicine. Palivizumab also helped lower other lung sicknesses. It helped reduce how many days kids coughed or wheezed.

In short, palivizumab helps prevent bad RSV sickness. It stops many kids from needing hospital care. It does not cause many problems. It can really help kids at high risk.","Palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus infection prevention in children
Review question 
What are the effects (benefits and harms) of palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children? 
Background 
RSV is the main cause of acute respiratory infections in children, mainly during the first year of life, accounting for 33.1 million infections a year with an estimated 90.6% of these episodes occurring in low‐ and middle‐income countries. These infections may present with a runny nose, fever, cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, or difficulty feeding. They may result in hospitalisation, admission to an intensive care unit, and even death, in particular amongst infants aged less than two months, with an estimated hospitalisation rate of 1970 per 100,000 population and 59,600 deaths annually worldwide in children younger than five years old. They may also lead to long‐term complications such as recurrent wheezing and chronic lung problems.  
Palivizumab, sold under the brand name Synagis, is a drug administered with an intramuscular injection every month up to five doses to prevent serious infections in children at high risk for severe disease. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 14 October 2021.
Study characteristics 
We included five studies with 3343 participants. All studies included a small number of participants, including children with a high risk of adverse outcomes if infected with RSV due to underlying health issues, such as premature birth or heart or pulmonary problems.    
Study funding sources 
Most studies did not specify their funding sources. One study was funded by Abbott Laboratories and by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development.  
Key results 
Palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection by 56%; based on 98 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in mortality, and little to no difference in adverse events; based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants and 84 adverse events per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 deaths per 1000 participants and 81  adverse events per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory illness by 22% but may result in little to no difference in length of hospital stay. It may reduce RSV infection rate by 67% at two years’ follow‐up. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days by 61% but may result in little to no difference in days using oxygen, length of stay in the intensive care unit, or mechanical ventilation days.  
Certainty of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the evidence was moderate to high.

Antibiotics have been considered to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) due to their antimicrobial properties against intestinal bacteria linked to inflammation. However, there are concerns about their efficacy and safety. 
Objectives
To determine whether antibiotic therapy is safe and effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in people with UC. 
Search methods
We searched five electronic databases on 10 December 2021 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic therapy to placebo or an active comparator. 
Selection criteria
We considered people with UC of all ages, treated with antibiotics of any type, dose, and route of administration for inclusion. Induction studies required a minimum duration of two weeks for inclusion. Maintenance studies required a minimum duration of three months to be considered for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome for induction studies was failure to achieve remission and for maintenance studies was relapse, as defined by the primary studies. 
Main results
We included 12 RCTs (847 participants). One maintenance of remission study used sole antibiotic therapy compared with 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA). All other trials used concurrent medications or standard care regimens and antibiotics as an adjunct therapy or compared antibiotics with other adjunct therapies to examine the effect on induction of remission. 
There is high certainty evidence that antibiotics (154/304 participants) compared to placebo (175/304 participants) result in no difference in failure to achieve clinical remission (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.06). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids, steroids plus 5‐ASA, or steroids plus 5‐ASA plus probiotics were used as additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (102/168 participants) compared to placebo (121/175 participants) may result in no difference in failure to achieve clinical response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.22). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids or steroids plus 5‐ASA were used as additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (6/342 participants) compared to placebo (5/349 participants) may result in no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.71). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids were additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (3/342 participants) compared to placebo (1/349 participants) may result in no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 2.06, 95% CI 0.27 to 15.72). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids or steroids plus 5‐ASA were additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics in combination with probiotics compared to no treatment or placebo for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.19), serious adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.08), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.08). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to 5‐ASA for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.14). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to probiotics for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.94). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to 5‐ASA for failure to maintain clinical remission (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.06). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to no treatment for failure to achieve clinical remission in a mixed population of people with active and inactive disease (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
For all other outcomes, no effects could be estimated due to a lack of data.
Authors' conclusions
There is high certainty evidence that there is no difference between antibiotics and placebo in the proportion of people who achieve clinical remission at the end of the intervention period. However, there is evidence that there may be a greater proportion of people who achieve clinical remission and probably a greater proportion who achieve clinical response with antibiotics when compared with placebo at 12 months. There may be no difference in serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events between antibiotics and placebo. 
No clear conclusions can be drawn for any other comparisons.
A clear direction for future research appears to be comparisons of antibiotics and placebo (in addition to standard therapies) with longer‐term measurement of outcomes. Additionally. As there were single studies of other head‐to‐head comparisons, there may be scope for future studies in this area. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Antibiotics for Ulcerative Colitis

### Plain Title
Do Antibiotics Help People with Ulcerative Colitis?

### Rationale
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a health issue that causes swelling and sores in the large gut. This can lead to belly pain, bleeding, and the need to use the toilet often. It makes daily life hard for many people.

Doctors thought antibiotics might help by fighting bad germs in the gut that cause swelling. But we did not know if antibiotics truly worked or if they caused problems. This study looked to see if antibiotics are safe and good at helping people with UC feel better.

We wanted to know if antibiotics could put UC into ""remission."" This means the disease is quiet and symptoms go away.

### Trial Design
We wanted to know how this study was set up. We looked at past studies called ""randomized controlled trials."" These studies are the best way to find out if a treatment works. They put people into groups by chance. One group gets the new treatment, and the other gets a fake treatment (placebo) or a standard treatment.

We looked at 12 such studies that included 847 people. These people had UC and were of all ages. They took different types and amounts of antibiotics. Some studies lasted at least two weeks to see if antibiotics helped during a flare-up. Other studies lasted at least three months to see if antibiotics helped keep UC quiet.

We looked at how many people felt better and how many had bad side effects.

### Results
We found that antibiotics did not make a big difference in getting UC into remission compared to a fake pill (placebo). About half of the people in both groups still had UC symptoms.

When we looked at serious side effects, antibiotics did not seem to cause more problems than the fake pill. Very few people in either group had serious issues. Also, about the same small number of people stopped taking the treatment because of side effects in both groups.

It was not clear if antibiotics worked better than other UC medicines or probiotics. There was not enough clear information for these comparisons.

But, when studies looked at people over a longer time (12 months), antibiotics might help more people feel better and improve their symptoms compared to a fake pill.

Our study shows that antibiotics do not seem to be a quick fix for UC. More research is needed. Doctors need to do longer studies to see if antibiotics help over time, along with other standard UC treatments.","The use of antibiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis
What was the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aimed to determine whether antibiotics are useful and safe for people with ulcerative colitis (UC) in achieving or maintaining remission. 
Key messages 
We found that antibiotics, when added to standard therapies, are similar to placebo in how often they fail to achieve remission or disease improvement for people with UC, measured up to three months from taking them. 
We found that antibiotics when compared to placebo may be useful in achieving remission or some improvement of UC symptoms, measured at 12 months from taking them. 
In terms of safety, the evidence is of low certainty, but antibiotics may be as safe as placebo. 
We have confidence in the findings up to three months, but have less confidence in the evidence at 12 months due to low numbers of study participants. 
What is ulcerative colitis? 
UC is a chronic (long term) inflammatory disease that affects the large bowel. The most common symptoms include bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and a sudden almost uncontrollable urge to pass stool. Some people have other symptoms including sore joints, mouth sores, and inflammation in their eyes. When someone is experiencing symptoms of UC, they are said to have 'active' disease. When symptoms improve with treatment, the disease is said to be responding to therapy. When symptoms stop, the disease is said to be in 'remission'. People with UC in remission are often given therapy with medicines to try and prolong (maintain) their remission or response to therapy. 
What did the review study? 
This review studied the use of antibiotics in the treatment of UC. Eleven studies considered antibiotics as a therapy for achieving remission and one study as therapy for maintaining remission. 
Antibiotics could theoretically be helpful as they might be able to fight harmful bacteria in the gut that are thought to be a partial cause for the presence of UC symptoms. 
Currently, most doctors do not recommend the use of antibiotics unless the patient has an infection. 
What were the main results of the review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing antibiotics with another treatment or dummy treatment. We found 12 RCTs including 847 participants. The trials looked at people of all ages; using different types and doses of antibiotics; and at antibiotics taken as tablets, injections, or any other way. The main results from our review are as follows. 
1. Antibiotics, when added to standard therapies, are no different from placebo in failing to achieve remission or improve disease symptoms for people with UC when measured up to three months from taking them. 
2. Antibiotics probably fail less than placebo in achieving remission or some improvement of UC symptoms measured at 12 months from taking them. 
3. In terms of safety, antibiotics may be similar to placebo, but the evidence is of low certainty. 
4. We are uncertain about how antibiotics compare to other treatments because there is not enough good evidence to make a judgement. 
Conclusion 
There is no difference between antibiotics and placebo when added to standard therapies to achieve remission or improvement of symptoms in the short term. However, they may help to lessen the number of people who do not achieve remission, and they probably lead to fewer numbers of people who have not achieved improvement of symptoms at 12 months. 
No conclusions can be drawn on other treatments or safety due to lack of evidence, even though there may be a possibility that antibiotics are as safe as placebo. Further research would be needed to clarify the usefulness of antibiotics in the treatment of UC; however, such studies should focus on longer‐term outcomes given the findings of this review.

10.1002-14651858.CD015017.pub3,"Background
Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro. The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) replication in early stages of infection. Currently, evidence on ivermectin for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 treatment is conflicting. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo, or any other proven intervention for people with COVID‐19 receiving treatment as inpatients or outpatients, and for prevention of an infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 (postexposure prophylaxis). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science (Emerging Citation Index and Science Citation Index), WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and HTA database weekly to identify completed and ongoing trials without language restrictions to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Co‐interventions had to be the same in both study arms.  
For this review update, we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity: only RCTs prospectively registered in a trial registry according to WHO guidelines for clinical trial registration were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed RCTs for bias, using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for outcomes in the following settings and populations: 1) to treat inpatients with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19, 2) to treat outpatients with mild COVID‐19 (outcomes: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, (serious) adverse events, quality of life, and viral clearance), and 3) to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (outcomes: SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, development of COVID‐19 symptoms, admission to hospital, mortality, adverse events and quality of life). 
Main results
We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review version; six were not prospectively registered and one was non‐randomized. This updated review includes 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo. No trial investigated ivermectin for prevention of infection or compared ivermectin to an intervention with proven efficacy. Five trials treated participants with moderate COVID‐19 (inpatient settings); six treated mild COVID‐19 (outpatient settings). Eight trials were double‐blind and placebo‐controlled, and three were open‐label. We assessed around 50% of the trial results as low risk of bias. 
We identified 31 ongoing trials. In addition, there are 28 potentially eligible trials without publication of results, or with disparities in the reporting of the methods and results, held in ‘awaiting classification’ until the trial authors clarify questions upon request. 
Ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 in inpatient settings with moderate‐to‐severe disease 
We are uncertain whether ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo reduces or increases all‐cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 2.51; 3 trials, 230 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); or clinical worsening, assessed by participants with new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death at day 28 (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.04; 2 trials, 118 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); or serious adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.89; 2 trials, 197 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may have little or no effect on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants discharged alive at day 28 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 trial, 73 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.79; 3 trials, 228 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at 7 days (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.58; 3 trials, 231 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No trial investigated quality of life at any time point. 
Ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease 
Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo probably has little or no effect on all‐cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25; 6 trials, 2860 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and little or no effect on quality of life, measured with the PROMIS Global‐10 scale (physical component mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.98 to 0.98; and mental component MD 0.00, 95% CI ‐1.08 to 1.08; 1358 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect on clinical worsening, assessed by admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.02; 2 trials, 590 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants with all initial symptoms resolved up to 14 days (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36; 2 trials, 478 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on serious adverse events (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.62 to 8.31; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at day 7 compared to placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; 2 trials, 331 participants; low‐certainty evidence). None of the trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta‐analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
For outpatients, there is currently low‐ to high‐certainty evidence that ivermectin has no beneficial effect for people with COVID‐19. Based on the very low‐certainty evidence for inpatients, we are still uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or clinical worsening or increases serious adverse events, while there is low‐certainty evidence that it has no beneficial effect regarding clinical improvement, viral clearance and adverse events. No evidence is available on ivermectin to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In this update, certainty of evidence increased through higher quality trials including more participants. According to this review's living approach, we will continually update our search.

### Plain Title: Does Ivermectin Help People with COVID-19?

### Rationale

Many people got sick with COVID-19. This sickness is caused by a germ called SARS-CoV-2. Some people get very sick and need to go to the hospital. Others have milder illness. Doctors wanted to find good ways to treat COVID-19. They also wanted to stop people from getting infected.

Ivermectin is a medicine that kills some tiny bugs. Some lab studies showed it might stop the COVID-19 germ from growing. This made doctors wonder if ivermectin could help people with COVID-19. The idea was that ivermectin might stop the germ from making copies of itself early in the illness. But, doctors did not have clear proof that ivermectin worked for COVID-19. So, this study looked at all the facts to see if ivermectin helps.

### Trial Design

This study asked: ""How well does ivermectin treat COVID-19?"" We looked at past studies that tested ivermectin. These studies were called randomized controlled trials. In these trials, some people got ivermectin and regular care. Other people got only regular care or a sugar pill (placebo) and regular care.

We only included studies that were set up in a fair way. This means they were registered before they started. This helped make sure the results were true. The studies included people who had COVID-19. Some were very sick in the hospital. Others had a milder illness and stayed home. The trials also looked at people who might get sick. We looked for studies with more than 1000 people. We collected all the data up to April 2022.

### Results

We looked at 11 studies with 3409 people. These studies compared ivermectin to usual care or a sugar pill. None of these studies checked if ivermectin could stop people from getting COVID-19. No studies compared ivermectin to other medicines that are known to work.

Five studies looked at people who were sick in the hospital. Six studies looked at people who had mild illness and were not in the hospital. Many studies gave people ivermectin or a sugar pill without them knowing which they got. This helps make the study fair.

For people very sick in the hospital:
We are not sure if ivermectin helps people live longer. We are also not sure if it stops people from getting worse. We saw that ivermectin may not change how quickly people get better. It also may not change how many people have side effects. It likely does not help clear the germ from the body faster.

For people with mild COVID-19 at home:
Ivermectin likely does not change how many people die. It also probably does not make them feel better about their health. It likely does not stop them from getting worse and needing the hospital. It also may not help them get better faster. It likely does not cause more serious side effects or other side effects. It probably does not clear the germ from the body faster.

Overall, the studies show that ivermectin does not help people with COVID-19. This is true for people who are very sick or have mild symptoms. We still do not know if ivermectin can stop people from getting COVID-19. We will keep looking for new studies.","Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID‐19
Is ivermectin effective for COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
We found no evidence to support the use of ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 or preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The evidence base improved slightly in this update, but is still limited. 
Evaluation of ivermectin is continuing in 31 ongoing trials, and we will update this review again when their results become available.  
What is ivermectin? 
Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals, and scabies in humans. It is inexpensive and is widely used in regions of the world where parasitic infestations are common. It has few unwanted effects.  
Medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID‐19.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID‐19, or is useful in prevention of the infection. We included trials comparing the medicine to placebo (dummy treatment), usual care, or treatments for COVID‐19 that are known to work to some extent, such as dexamethasone. We excluded trials comparing ivermectin to other medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness against COVID‐19 is uncertain. 
We evaluated the effects of ivermectin in infected people on:
– people dying;– whether people's COVID‐19 got better or worse;– quality of life;– serious and non‐serious unwanted effects;– viral clearance. 
For prevention, we sought the effect on preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease. 
What did we do?  
We searched for randomized controlled trials that investigated ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID‐19. People treated in hospital or as outpatients had to have laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19. 
In this update, we also investigated the trustworthiness of the trials and only included them if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria. 
We compared and summarized the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review as these trials did not fulfil the expected ethical and scientific criteria. Together with four new trials, we included 11 trials with 3409 participants that investigated ivermectin combined with any usual care compared to the same usual care or placebo. 
For treatment, there were five trials of people in hospital with moderate COVID‐19 and six trials of outpatients with mild COVID‐19. The trials used different doses of ivermectin and different durations of treatment.  
No trial investigated ivermectin to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.
We also found 31 ongoing trials, and an additional 28 trials still requiring clarification from the authors or not yet published. 
Main results  
Treating people in hospital with COVID‐19 
We do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment: 
– leads to more or fewer deaths (3 trials, 230 people); – worsens or improves patients' condition, assessed by need for ventilation or death (2 trials, 118 people);– increases or reduces serious unwanted events (2 trials, 197 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: 
– improving patients' condition, assessed by discharge from hospital (1 trial, 73 people);– non‐serious unwanted events (3 trials, 228 participants).  
Seven days after treatment, ivermectin may make little or no difference to reduction of negative COVID‐19 tests (3 trials, 231 participants) compared with placebo or usual care. 
Treating outpatients with COVID‐19 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, probably makes little or no difference to people dying (6 trials, 2860 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, makes little or no difference to quality of life (1 trial, 1358 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: 
– worsening patients' condition, assessed by admission to hospital or death (2 trials, 590 people);– serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 people); – non‐serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 participants); – improving people's COVID‐19 symptoms in the 14 days after treatment (2 trials, 478 people);– number of people with negative COVID‐19 tests 7 days after treatment (2 trials, 331 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review version, because we could look at more participants included in high‐quality trials. Although we are quite certain regarding our results on risk of people dying and quality of life, the confidence in the evidence is still low for many other outpatient and inpatient outcomes because there were only few events measured. The methods differed between trials, and they did not report everything we were interested in, such as relevant outcomes. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The systematic literature search is up to date to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022.

10.1002-14651858.CD013224.pub2,"Background
Chordoma is a rare primary bone tumour with a high propensity for local recurrence. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment, but complete resection is often morbid due to tumour location. Similarly, the dose of radiotherapy (RT) that surrounding healthy organs can tolerate is frequently below that required to provide effective tumour control. Therefore, clinicians have investigated different radiation delivery techniques, often in combination with surgery, aimed to improve the therapeutic ratio. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and toxicity of proton and photon adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in people with biopsy‐confirmed chordoma. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2021, Issue 4); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to April 2021); Embase Ovid (1980 to April 2021) and online registers of clinical trials, and abstracts of scientific meetings up until April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included adults with pathologically confirmed primary chordoma, who were irradiated with curative intent, with protons or photons in the form of fractionated RT, SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery), SBRT (stereotactic body radiotherapy), or IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy). We limited analysis to studies that included outcomes of participants treated with both protons and photons. 
Data collection and analysis
The primary outcomes were local control, mortality, recurrence, and treatment‐related toxicity. We followed current standard Cochrane methodological procedures for data extraction, management, and analysis. We used the ROBINS‐I tool to assess risk of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included six observational studies with 187 adult participants. We judged all studies to be at high risk of bias. Four studies were included in meta‐analysis. 
We are uncertain if proton compared to photon therapy worsens or has no effect on local control (hazard ratio (HR) 5.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 43.43; 2 observational studies, 39 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Median survival time ranged between 45.5 months and 66 months. We are uncertain if proton compared to photon therapy reduces or has no effect on mortality (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.57; 4 observational studies, 65 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Median recurrence‐free survival ranged between 3 and 10 years. We are uncertain whether proton compared to photon therapy reduces or has no effect on recurrence (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.17; 4 observational studies, 94 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
One study assessed treatment‐related toxicity and reported that four participants on proton therapy developed radiation‐induced necrosis in the temporal bone, radiation‐induced damage to the brainstem, and chronic mastoiditis; one participant on photon therapy developed hearing loss, worsening of the seventh cranial nerve paresis, and ulcerative keratitis (risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% CI 0.17 to 9.86; 1 observational study, 33 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There is no evidence that protons led to reduced toxicity. 
There is very low‐certainty evidence to show an advantage for proton therapy in comparison to photon therapy with respect to local control, mortality, recurrence, and treatment related toxicity. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a lack of published evidence to confirm a clinical difference in effect with either proton or photon therapy for the treatment of chordoma. As radiation techniques evolve, multi‐institutional data should be collected prospectively and published, to help identify persons that would most benefit from the available radiation treatment techniques.

## Plain Title: Proton vs. Photon Therapy for Chordoma Cancer

### Rationale

Chordoma is a rare bone cancer. It often grows back after treatment. Surgery helps, but it can be hard to remove all of the cancer. This is because of where it grows in the body. Radiation can also treat chordoma. But too much radiation can hurt healthy body parts. Doctors have looked at different ways to give radiation. They want to find ways to kill more cancer cells. They also want to cause less harm to the patient.

This study looked at two types of radiation. These are called proton therapy and photon therapy. We want to know if one type works better. We want to see if one has fewer side effects. This study aims to help doctors choose the best treatment. We want to give patients the best chance to get well.

### Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This study is a review of other studies. It gathers facts from many different reports. We looked for studies that included adults. All adults in these studies had chordoma cancer. Their cancer was confirmed by a test. They also received radiation treatment. These treatments included proton or photon therapy. We looked for studies that compared both types of radiation. The goal was to cure the cancer.

We searched many medical databases. We looked for studies up until April 2021. We looked at how long the cancer stayed away. We also looked at how long people lived. We checked for any bad side effects from the treatment.

### Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

We found six studies that fit our needs. These studies included 187 adult patients. All of these studies had some flaws. This means we are not very sure about their findings.

We looked at how well the cancer was controlled. We compared proton and photon therapy. We are not sure if one is better than the other. The study showed a slight trend for proton therapy to be less effective at controlling the cancer (5 times more likely to return). But this was based on very few patients, so we cannot be certain.

We looked at how long people lived. The studies showed people lived between 45 and 66 months. We are not sure if proton therapy helps people live longer. The study showed a slight trend for proton therapy to help people live longer (almost 2.5 times less likely to die). But again, this was based on very few patients, so we cannot be certain.

We looked at how long people stayed cancer-free. This ranged from 3 to 10 years. We are not sure if proton therapy helps people stay cancer-free longer. The study showed a slight trend for proton therapy to help people stay cancer-free longer (almost 3 times less likely to recur). But this was based on very few patients, so we cannot be certain.

One study looked at side effects. Four patients on proton therapy had problems. They had bone damage, brain damage, and ear infections. One patient on photon therapy had hearing loss. They also had nerve damage and eye problems. We do not have enough facts to say if one therapy has fewer side effects.

In short, we do not have strong proof. We cannot say if proton therapy is better. We cannot say if it is worse than photon therapy. We need more and better studies. These studies should follow patients over time. This will help doctors choose the best radiation. It will help patients get the best care.","Proton radiation therapy versus conventional radiation treatment (i.e. photon radiation) for the treatment of chordoma 
What is the issue?Chordoma is a rare tumour that can grow at any location in the spine. Because some of the locations are difficult to reach, some of the tumour may be left behind, even after aggressive surgery. When this happens, radiation to the postoperative area can help reduce the chance of the tumour coming back. Given the closeness to the spinal cord and other important organs, special radiation techniques are required to maximise tumour control, while minimising harm to normal tissues in the body. 
Why is this review important?At the time of this review, there is a lack of evidence to confirm a benefit with proton therapy compared to conventional photon radiation treatment. However, it is important to note that this review found a number of delivery techniques for both proton and photon therapy. As evidence comparing the latest techniques for proton and photon therapy emerges, we will update this review. 
The aim of the review:The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether proton therapy is more effective than photon therapy for improving local control, and reducing mortality, recurrence, and treatment‐related toxicity. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. 
What are the main findings?We included six studies that enrolled 187 adults with chordoma, four of which we included in a meta‐analysis. We are uncertain whether proton radiation therapy compared to conventional photon radiation treatment improves local control, because our confidence in the evidence was very low (2 observational studies, 39 participants). We are uncertain whether proton therapy compared to photon therapy reduces mortality (4 observational studies, 65 participants), recurrence (4 observational studies, 94 participants), or treatment‐related toxicity (1 observational study, 33 participants). 
Quality of the Evidence:We found very low‐certainty evidence for all outcomes due to high risk of bias in all the included observational studies, very small sample sizes, and varying ranges in the duration of participants' follow‐up period between studies. 
Authors' conclusions:From the currently available evidence, we do not know if proton therapy, used for adults with chordoma, is associated with clinically appreciable benefits and acceptable harms. 
The existing research on this question is solely of non‐randomised design, and is underpowered, with substantial imprecision. Any estimates of effect based on the existing insufficient evidence is very uncertain and is likely to change with future research.

Review Question 
What are the risks and benefits of eating food early, versus delaying food for at least 24 hours after abdominal gynaecologic surgery? 
Background 
Physicians often delay giving food and drink to women after abdominal gynaecologic surgery (uterine fibroids, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, uterine and ovarian cancer) until bowel function recommences (typically 24 hours after surgery). This is to reduce the risk of complications such as vomiting, gastrointestinal disruptions and wound rupturing or leakage. However, it has been suggested that some women may recover more quickly if food is introduced earlier. We reviewed evidence from randomised controlled trials of early and delayed feeding after abdominal gynaecologic surgery. 
Study Characteristics 
We assessed evidence on the following outcomes:
1. Nausea, vomiting, cramping abdominal pain, bloating, abdominal distension, wound complication, deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia. 
2. Time to first: bowel sound, gas, stool, start of regular diet.
3. Length of hospital stay
Early feeding was defined as having fluids or food within 24 hours of surgery. Delayed feeding was defined as having fluids or food 24 hours after surgery, and only if there are bowel sounds, passage of gas or stool, and a feeling of hunger. 
The evidence is current to April 2014
Key Results 
We included five published studies of 631 women, mainly with gynaecologic cancer.
Recovery of bowel function was faster in those with early feeding. There was no difference in rates of nausea or vomiting, abdominal distension, need for a postoperative nasogastric tube or time to first bowel movement, but early feeding was associated with a shorter time to bowel sounds and onset of gas. The early feeding group resumed a solid diet 1½ days sooner than those having delayed feeding and the hospital stay was one day shorter. Also, the early feeding group were more satisfied with the feeding schedule, although only one study reported this. 
Early feeding appeared safe, without increased postoperative complications and with fewer infectious complications overall. 
Quality of the Evidence 
Most of the evidence was moderate quality. The main limitation was lack of blinding, which could influence the findings for subjective outcomes such as self‐reported symptoms, hospital stay, patients' satisfaction and quality of life. 
Conclusions 
The evidence suggests that eating and drinking on the first day after abdominal gynaecologic surgery is safe and could reduce the length of hospital stay.

## Eating Sooner After Women's Surgery

### Rationale

Many women have surgery on their belly for issues like growths in the womb, womb lining problems, or cysts on their ovaries. After this surgery, doctors often wait to give food or drink. They wait until the gut starts working again. This usually takes a full day after surgery.

Doctors do this to stop problems like throwing up, stomach issues, or wound breaking open. But, some people think that women might get better faster if they eat food sooner.

This study looked at how fast women get better. We wanted to see if eating earlier or later after belly surgery for women's health made a difference. We also wanted to see if eating early was safe.

### Trial Design

This study looked at results from other good studies. These studies put women into two groups by chance. One group ate early, and the other group ate later.

Early eating meant having liquids or food within 24 hours of surgery. Delayed eating meant having liquids or food 24 hours after surgery. For the delayed group, doctors waited for the gut to make sounds, pass gas, or have a bowel movement. They also waited until the woman felt hungry.

The studies included women who had belly surgery for women's health. Most of these women had cancer in their womb or ovaries. We looked at how soon they could eat regular food. We also looked at how long they stayed in the hospital. We checked for problems like throwing up, pain, bloating, or wound issues. We also looked at how quickly their gut started working again.

This review included information up to April 2014.

### Results

We looked at five studies with a total of 631 women. Most of these women had cancer surgery.

Women who ate earlier had their gut start working faster. They passed gas sooner. They also had gut sounds sooner.

There was no more throwing up or feeling sick in the early eating group. There were no more problems with belly swelling. Women who ate early did not need a tube placed in their nose to empty their stomach more often.

The women who ate early also started eating solid food one and a half days sooner. They also went home from the hospital one day sooner. One study also said that women who ate early were happier with their meal plan.

Eating early seemed safe. Women in the early eating group did not have more problems after surgery. In fact, they had fewer problems from infections overall.

The results show that it is safe to eat and drink on the first day after belly surgery for women's health. This can also help women go home from the hospital sooner.","Early versus delayed feeding for reducing complications after gynaecologic surgery

10.1002-14651858.CD009134.pub2,"Background
Each year, more than four million abdominal surgeries are performed in the US and over 250,000 in England. Acute respiratory failure, a common complication that can affect 30% to 50% of people after upper abdominal surgery, can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Noninvasive ventilation has been associated with lower rates of tracheal intubation in adults with acute respiratory failure, thus reducing the incidence of complications and mortality. This review compared the effectiveness and safety of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) versus standard oxygen therapy in the treatment of acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), that is, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel NPPV, in reducing mortality and the rate of tracheal intubation in adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery, compared to standard therapy (oxygen therapy), and to assess changes in arterial blood gas levels, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, gastric insufflation, and anastomotic leakage. 
Search methods
The date of the last search was 12 May 2015. We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1966 to May 2015), EMBASE (Ovid SP, 1974 to May 2015); the physiotherapy evidence database (PEDro) (1999 to May 2015); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL, EBSCOhost, 1982 to May 2015), and LILACS (BIREME, 1986 to May 2015). We reviewed reference lists of included studies and contacted experts. We also searched grey literature sources. We checked databases of ongoing trials such as www.controlled‐trials.com/ and www.trialscentral.org/. We did not apply language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials involving adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery who were treated with CPAP or bilevel NPPV with, or without, drug therapy as standard medical care, compared to adults treated with oxygen therapy with, or without, standard medical care. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected and abstracted data from eligible studies using a standardized form. We evaluated study quality by assessing allocation concealment; random sequence generation; incomplete outcome data; blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors; selective reporting; and adherence to the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) principle. 
Main results
We included two trials involving 269 participants. The participants were mostly men (67%); the mean age was 65 years. The trials were conducted in China and Italy (one was a multicentre trial). Both trials included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. We judged both trials at high risk of bias. Compared to oxygen therapy, CPAP or bilevel NPPV may reduce the rate of tracheal intubation (risk ratio (RR) 0.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.83; low quality evidence) with a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 11. There was very low quality evidence that the intervention may also reduce ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD) ‐1.84 days; 95% CI ‐3.53 to ‐0.15). We found no differences for mortality (low quality evidence) and hospital length of stay. There was insufficient evidence to be certain that CPAP or NPPV had an effect on anastomotic leakage, pneumonia‐related complications, and sepsis or infections. Findings from one trial of 60 participants suggested that bilevel NPPV, compared to oxygen therapy, may improve blood gas levels and blood pH one hour after the intervention (partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2): MD 22.5 mm Hg; 95% CI 17.19 to 27.81; pH: MD 0.06; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11; partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PCO2) levels (MD ‐9.8 mm Hg; 95% CI ‐14.07 to ‐5.53). The trials included in this systematic review did not present data on the following outcomes that we intended to assess: gastric insufflation, fistulae, pneumothorax, bleeding, skin breakdown, eye irritation, sinus congestion, oronasal drying, and patient‐ventilator asynchrony. 
Authors' conclusions
The findings of this review indicate that CPAP or bilevel NPPV is an effective and safe intervention for the treatment of adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. However, based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, the quality of the evidence was low or very low. More good quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Plain Title
Breathing Support After Belly Surgery

### Rationale
Many people have belly surgery each year. Sometimes, after this type of surgery, people have trouble breathing. This is called acute respiratory failure. It can make people very sick. It can even lead to death.

When people cannot breathe well, doctors sometimes put a tube in their windpipe. This is called tracheal intubation. It helps them breathe. But it can cause more problems.

This study looked at a different way to help people breathe. It uses a machine called noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). This machine gives air through a mask. It does not need a tube in the windpipe. We wanted to see if NPPV helps people breathe better and avoid the tube. We also wanted to see if it was safe.

### Trial Design
This study looked at other studies that were already done. We searched many places for these studies. We looked for studies that compared NPPV to just giving oxygen.

We looked for studies with adults. These adults had breathing problems after surgery on their belly. The studies needed to be well-designed. This means people were put into groups by chance.

Two people checked all the studies. They made sure the studies were good. We wanted to see how NPPV helped people. We also wanted to see if it caused any bad effects.

### Results
We found two studies that fit what we needed. These studies included 269 people. Most of the people were men. Their average age was 65 years old. These studies were done in China and Italy.

Both studies looked at adults with breathing problems after belly surgery. The studies showed that NPPV might help. It might make it less likely for a person to need a tube in their windpipe. About 1 in 11 people avoided the breathing tube because of NPPV.

NPPV might also help people leave the intensive care unit (ICU) sooner. People might stay in the ICU almost two days less. We did not see a difference in how long people stayed in the hospital. We also did not see a difference in death rates.

One study found that NPPV helped blood oxygen levels. It also helped balance the blood. But we need more studies to be sure about these things. We also did not find enough proof about other problems. These include stomach issues or infections.

This review shows that NPPV can help people after belly surgery. It is a safe way to help them breathe. But the evidence we found was not perfect. We need more good studies. These new studies will help us be more sure about these findings.","Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure following upper abdominal surgery 
Review question 
The goal of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel NPPV) compared with oxygen therapy alone in adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. 
Background 
Acute respiratory failure , where fluid builds up in the lungs stopping oxygen from crossing into the blood, is a relatively common complication after abdominal surgery and can increase the risk of dying (mortality). 
NPPV is a type of treatment that helps to improve breathing without having to insert a tube inside a person's windpipe (tracheal intubation). This intervention is effective in several illnesses. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the treatment of adults with acute respiratory failure following abdominal surgery. The trials compared NPPV with usual care(oxygen therapy through a face mask). We included two trials involving 269 participants.The participants were mostly men (67%) and on average 65 years of age. One trial was conducted in several intensive care units (ICU). Both trials included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. The evidence is current to May 2015. 
Key results 
This review examined mortality, rate of tracheal intubation, length of stay in the ICU, length of hospital stay, complications after NPPV, and changes in the levels of gases within the blood (arterial blood gases). 
Compared with oxygen therapy, NPPV decreased the rate of tracheal intubation. Out of every 1000 adults who developed acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery, 181 adults treated with oxygen therapy would need to be intubated compared with 54 adults treated with NPPV. 
When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV tended to reduce mortality. However, since the number of participants included in the two trials was small, more studies are needed. 
The use of NPPV also reduced the length of stay in the ICU by almost two days when compared to oxygen therapy. However, the mean length of stay in the hospital was similar in the two groups. 
When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV improved blood gas levels one hour after the intervention. 
There was insufficient evidence to be certain that CPAP or NPPV had an effect on anastomotic (e.g. where two pieces of intestine are joined together) leakage, pneumonia related complications and sepsis (blood poisoning) or infections. However, adults treated with NPPV had lower rates these complications than adults treated with oxygen. 
Quality of the evidence 
There was low quality evidence for hospital mortality, low quality of evidence for rate of tracheal intubation, and very low quality of evidence for ICU length of stay. 
Authors' conclusions 
The findings of this review showed that NPPV is an effective and safe treatment for adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. However, due to the low quality of the evidence, more good quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.

10.1002-14651858.CD013180.pub2,"Background
Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with women's quality of life, regardless of the absolute amount of bleeding. It is a very common condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 2 to 5 of every 10 women. Diverse treatments, either medical (hormonal or non‐hormonal) or surgical, are currently available for HMB, with different effectiveness, acceptability, costs and side effects. The best treatment will depend on the woman's age, her intention to become pregnant, the presence of other symptoms, and her personal views and preferences. 
Objectives
To identify, systematically assess and summarise all evidence from studies included in Cochrane Reviews on treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), using reviews with comparable participants and outcomes; and to present a ranking of the first‐ and second‐line treatments for HMB. 
Methods
We searched for published Cochrane Reviews of HMB interventions in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The primary outcomes were menstrual bleeding and satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, adverse events and the requirement of further treatment. Two review authors independently selected the systematic reviews, extracted data and assessed quality, resolving disagreements by discussion. We assessed review quality using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool and evaluated the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods. We grouped the interventions into first‐ and second‐line treatments, considering participant characteristics (desire for future pregnancy, failure of previous treatment, candidacy for surgery). First‐line treatments included medical interventions, and second‐line treatments included both the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) and surgical treatments; thus the LNG‐IUS is included in both groups. We developed different networks for first‐ and second‐line treatments. We performed network meta‐analyses of all outcomes, except for quality of life, where we performed pairwise meta‐analyses. We reported the mean rank, the network estimates for mean difference (MD) or odds ratio (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and the certainty of evidence (moderate, low or very low certainty). 
We also analysed different endometrial ablation and resection techniques separately from the main network: transcervical endometrial resection (TCRE) with or without rollerball, other resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA), microwave non‐resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA), hydrothermal ablation NREA, bipolar NREA, balloon NREA and other NREA. 
Main results
We included nine systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Library up to July 2021. We updated the reviews that were over two years old. In July 2020, we started the overview with no new reviews about the topic. The included medical interventions were: non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid), combined oral contraceptives (COC), combined vaginal ring (CVR), long‐cycle and luteal oral progestogens, LNG‐IUS, ethamsylate and danazol (included to provide indirect evidence), which were compared to placebo. Surgical interventions were: open (abdominal), minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic) and unspecified (or surgeon's choice of route of) hysterectomy, REA, NREA, unspecified endometrial ablation (EA) and LNG‐IUS. We grouped the interventions as follows. 
First‐line treatments 
Evidence from 26 studies with 1770 participants suggests that LNG‐IUS results in a large reduction of menstrual blood loss (MBL; mean rank 2.4, MD −105.71 mL/cycle, 95% CI −201.10 to −10.33; low certainty evidence); antifibrinolytics probably reduce MBL (mean rank 3.7, MD −80.32 mL/cycle, 95% CI −127.67 to −32.98; moderate certainty evidence); long‐cycle progestogen reduces MBL (mean rank 4.1, MD −76.93 mL/cycle, 95% CI −153.82 to −0.05; low certainty evidence), and NSAIDs slightly reduce MBL (mean rank 6.4, MD −40.67 mL/cycle, −84.61 to 3.27; low certainty evidence; reference comparator mean rank 8.9). We are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions and the sensitivity analysis for reduction of MBL, as the evidence was rated as very low certainty. 
We are uncertain of the true effect of any intervention (very low certainty evidence) on the perception of improvement and satisfaction. 
Second‐line treatments 
Bleeding reduction is related to the type of hysterectomy (total or supracervical/subtotal), not the route, so we combined all routes of hysterectomy for bleeding outcomes. We assessed the reduction of MBL without imputed data (11 trials, 1790 participants) and with imputed data (15 trials, 2241 participants). Evidence without imputed data suggests that hysterectomy (mean rank 1.2, OR 25.71, 95% CI 1.50 to 439.96; low certainty evidence) and REA (mean rank 2.8, OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.29 to 5.66; low certainty evidence) result in a large reduction of MBL, and NREA probably results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 2.0, OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.53 to 7.23; moderate certainty evidence). Evidence with imputed data suggests hysterectomy results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 1.0, OR 14.31, 95% CI 2.99 to 68.56; low certainty evidence), and NREA probably results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 2.2, OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.29 to 6.05; moderate certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the true effect for REA (very low certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effect on amenorrhoea (very low certainty evidence). 
Evidence from 27 trials with 4284 participants suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy results in a large increase in satisfaction (mean rank 1.3, OR 7.96, 95% CI 3.33 to 19.03; low certainty evidence), and NREA also increases satisfaction (mean rank 3.6, OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.33; low certainty evidence), but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions (very low certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence suggests LNG‐IUS is the best first‐line treatment for reducing menstrual blood loss (MBL); antifibrinolytics are probably the second best, and long‐cycle progestogens are likely the third best. We cannot make conclusions about the effect of first‐line treatments on perception of improvement and satisfaction, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. For second‐line treatments, evidence suggests hysterectomy is the best treatment for reducing bleeding, followed by REA and NREA. We are uncertain of the effect on amenorrhoea, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. Minimally invasive hysterectomy may result in a large increase in satisfaction, and NREA also increases satisfaction, but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining second‐line interventions, as evidence was rated as very low certainty.

### Plain Title: Helping Women with Heavy Periods

### Rationale

Many women have very heavy periods. This is called heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). HMB can make daily life hard for 2 to 5 out of every 10 women. It can cause problems with work, school, and social life.

There are many ways to treat HMB. These include medicines and surgeries. But these treatments have different costs and side effects. Also, they work better for some women than others. The best treatment depends on a woman's age and if she wants to get pregnant. Her own choices also matter.

This study looked at all the facts about HMB treatments. We wanted to find out which treatments work best. We also wanted to see which treatments make women feel better. We hoped to give women and doctors clear choices.

### Trial Design

This study was a look at other studies. We gathered information from many reliable health reviews. These reviews had already checked many treatments for HMB.

We looked at how well each treatment worked. We checked how much bleeding was reduced. We also checked how happy women were with their treatment. We looked at side effects too.

We placed treatments into two groups. The first group was for early treatments. These were often medicines. The second group was for later treatments. These included more complex options, like some surgeries. A special device, called an LNG-IUS, was in both groups. It is a small device placed in the womb.

We checked the quality of all the studies. This helped us be sure about our findings.

### Results

We looked at 9 major studies. These studies included many women. They tested several types of treatments.

**For early treatments, we found:**

*   The LNG-IUS was the best at making periods lighter. It greatly cut down blood loss.
*   Certain medicines called antifibrinolytics also helped a lot. They were the second best at reducing bleeding.
*   Some hormone pills, used for longer times, also made periods lighter.
*   Pain relief pills, like NSAIDs, made periods a little lighter.
*   We could not be sure about how other early treatments worked. More study is needed.
*   We also could not say much about how satisfied women were with early treatments. More data is needed here.

**For later treatments, we found:**

*   Surgery to remove the womb (hysterectomy) was best at stopping heavy bleeding. It greatly cut down blood loss.
*   Other surgeries to treat the womb lining (REA and NREA) also helped a lot. They greatly cut down blood loss too.
*   We could not be sure about how well other later treatments worked.
*   Women were much happier with certain types of hysterectomy. They were also more satisfied with NREA surgery.
*   We could not be sure about how satisfied women were with other later treatments.

**In conclusion:**

For women with heavy periods, the LNG-IUS is a top choice for reducing bleeding. Antifibrinolytics and certain hormone pills also work well.

If early treatments do not work, surgery to remove the womb is the best choice for stopping heavy bleeding. Other womb surgeries (REA and NREA) also help a lot. Some surgeries also make women much happier.

More research is still needed to understand how some treatments affect satisfaction.","Which is the best treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding?
Key results 
Evidence suggests that the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) is the best first‐line option for reducing menstrual bleeding, while antifibrinolytics are probably the second best, and long‐cycle progestogens are the third best. Because of some limitations in the evidence, we are not sure what the true effect of these first‐line treatments is for the perception of improvement and satisfaction. 
For second‐line treatments, evidence suggests any type of hysterectomy is the best treatment for reducing bleeding, even though this is a major surgery, and resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA) and non‐resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA) are second and third best. We are uncertain of the true effect of the second‐line treatments on amenorrhoea (absence of menstrual blood loss). Evidence suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy results in a large increase in satisfaction, and NREA increases satisfaction, but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions. 
What is heavy menstrual bleeding? 
Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with the quality of life of people who menstruate. It is very common and can affect 20% to 50% of people who menstruate during their reproductive years. There are different treatments available, each with their own pros and cons. The best treatment depends on the person's age, whether they have or want to have children, their personal preferences, and their medical history, among other things. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to get an overview of all the published evidence on different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. We were most interested in finding out if the treatments were effective for reducing menstrual bleeding and for improving women's satisfaction. We also wanted to know how the treatment affected quality of life, what side effects it caused, and whether women required further treatment. 
What did we do? 
This study is an overview of reviews, which means we looked for published studies that synthesised the results of other studies on different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. Then we tried to give a broad overview of all that evidence. We analysed the certainty of the evidence based on factors like study size and methodological rigour. We categorised the treatments based on patient characteristics, including the desire (intention) for future pregnancy, failure of previous treatment or having been referred for surgery. First‐line treatment included medical interventions and second‐line treatment included the LNG‐IUS plus surgical interventions; thus, the LNG‐IUS was included in both first‐ and second‐line treatments. We used network meta‐analysis, a statistical method that compares all the interventions at the same time, to find out which treatments produced the best results for patients. 
What did we find? 
We found nine reviews with 104 studies, involving a total of 11,881 participants. Altogether, the data we analysed came from 85 trials and 9950 participants. The medical interventions included were: non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid), combined oral contraceptives (COC), combined vaginal ring (CVR), long‐cycle and luteal oral progestogens, the LNG‐IUS, ethamsylate and danazol (included only to provide indirect evidence). These were compared to placebo (sham treatment). The surgical interventions included were: open (abdominal), minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic) and unspecified (or surgeon's choice of) route of hysterectomy, REA, NREA and unspecified endometrial ablation (EA). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in some evidence is moderate, but for most of it, our confidence is low to very low. The main reasons were because the studies were often not blinded, which means the participants knew which treatment they were receiving, and that could have changed their perception; the direct and indirect evidence was not similar enough to compare in the network; and the range of the results was too wide. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The last search for reviews was in July 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013409.pub2,"Background
Hip fractures are a major healthcare problem, presenting a huge challenge and burden to patients, healthcare systems and society. The increased proportion of older adults in the world population means that the absolute number of hip fractures is rising rapidly across the globe. The majority of hip fractures are treated surgically. This review evaluates evidence for types of internal fixation implants used in joint‐preserving surgery for intracapsular hip fractures. 
Objectives
To determine the relative effects (benefits and harms) of different implants for the internal fixation of intracapsular hip fractures in older adults. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Epistemonikos, Proquest Dissertations and Theses, and National Technical Information Service in July 2020. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, reference lists of retrieved articles and conducted backward‐citation searches. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing implants used for internal fixation of fragility intracapsular proximal femoral fractures in older adults. Types of implants were smooth pins (these include pins with fold‐out hooks), screws, or fixed angle plates. We excluded studies in which all or most fractures were caused by specific pathologies other than osteoporosis or were the result of a high energy trauma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. One review author extracted data and assessed risk of bias which was checked by a second review author. We collected data for seven outcomes: activities of daily living (ADL), delirium, functional status, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), mobility, mortality (reported within four months of surgery as early mortality, and at 12 months since surgery), and unplanned return to theatre for treating a complication resulting directly or indirectly from the primary procedure (such as deep infection or non‐union). We assessed the certainty of the evidence for these outcomes using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 38 studies (32 RCTs, six quasi‐RCTs) with 8585 participants with 8590 intracapsular fractures. The mean ages of participants in the studies ranged from 60 to 84 years; 73% were women, and 38% of fractures were undisplaced. 
We report here the findings of the four main comparisons, which were between different categories of implants. 
We downgraded the certainty of the outcomes for imprecision (when data were available from insufficient numbers of participants or the confidence interval (CI) was wide), study limitations (e.g. high or unclear risks of bias), and inconsistency (when we noted substantial levels of statistical heterogeneity). 
Smooth pins versus fixed angle plate (four studies, 1313 participants) 
We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two implant types in independent mobility with no more than one walking stick (1 study, 112 participants), early mortality (1 study, 383 participants), mortality at 12 months (2 studies, 661 participants), and unplanned return to theatre (3 studies, 736 participants). No studies reported on ADL, delirium, functional status, or HRQoL. 
Screws versus fixed angle plates (11 studies, 2471 participants) 
We found low‐certainty evidence of no clinically important differences between the two implant types in functional status using WOMAC (MD ‐3.18, 95% CI ‐6.35 to ‐0.01; 2 studies, 498 participants; range of scores from 0 to 96, lower values indicate better function), and HRQoL using EQ‐5D (MD 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.06; 2 studies, 521 participants; range ‐0.654 (worst), 0 (dead), 1 (best)). We also found low‐certainty evidence showing little or no difference between the two implant types in mortality at 12 months (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.31; 7 studies, 1690 participants), and unplanned return to theatre (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.26; 11 studies, 2321 participants). We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two implant types in independent mobility (1 study, 70 participants), and early mortality (3 studies, 467 participants). No studies reported on ADL or delirium. 
Screws versus smooth pins (seven studies, 1119 participants) 
We found low‐certainty evidence of no or little difference between the two implant types in mortality at 12 months (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.35; 6 studies, 1005 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two implant types in early mortality (3 studies, 584 participants) and unplanned return to theatre (5 studies, 862 participants). No studies reported on ADL, delirium, functional status, HRQoL, or mobility. 
Screws or smooth pins versus fixed angle plates (15 studies, 3784 participants) 
In this comparison, we combined data from the first two comparison groups. We found low‐certainty evidence of no or little difference between the two groups of implants in mortality at 12 months (RR 1.04, 95% CI.083 to 1.31; 7 studies, 1690 participants) and unplanned return to theatre (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18; 14 studies, 3057 participants). We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two groups of implants in independent mobility (2 studies, 182 participants), and early mortality (4 studies, 850 participants). We found no additional evidence to support the findings for functional status or HRQoL as reported in 'Screws versus fixed angle plates'. No studies reported ADL or delirium. 
Authors' conclusions
There is low‐certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference between screws and fixed angle plates in functional status, HRQoL, mortality at 12 months, or unplanned return to theatre; and between screws and pins in mortality at 12 months. The limited and very low‐certainty evidence for the outcomes for which data were available for the smooth pins versus fixed angle plates comparison, as well as the other outcomes for which data were available for the screws and fixed angle plates, and screws and pins comparisons means we have very little confidence in the estimates of effect for these outcomes. Additional RCTs would increase the certainty of the evidence. We encourage such studies to report outcomes consistent with the core outcome set for hip fracture, including long‐term quality of life indicators such as ADL and mobility. 
","## Plain Language Summary: Fixation Implants for Hip Fractures

### Plain Title

A Look at Different Ways to Fix Hip Fractures

### Rationale

Breaking a hip is a very serious problem. It causes a lot of pain and makes it hard to move. Older adults are more likely to break a hip. This is a big problem for them, their families, and doctors. Most hip breaks need surgery to fix them.

Surgeons put special tools inside the hip to help it heal. These tools are called ""implants."" We want to find out which implants work best. Do some implants help people get better faster? Do some cause fewer problems?

This study looked at many past studies. We wanted to see if different implants cause different results. We hope to find the safest and best way to fix hip fractures. This could help many older adults live better lives.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. We gathered information from many past studies. These were studies where people got different implants for their hip fractures. They were called ""randomized controlled trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. Each group got a different type of implant.

The people in these studies were older adults. Their ages ranged from about 60 to 84 years old. Most of them were women, about 7 out of 10. All of them had a certain type of hip fracture. This fracture was inside the hip joint. We looked at three main types of implants. These were smooth pins, screws, and fixed angle plates.

We looked for information on many things. We checked how well people could do daily tasks. We looked at how they moved around. We also checked if they had problems after surgery. We wanted to see if they needed more surgery. We also looked at how long people lived after surgery. We checked their health and happiness. We gathered all this information to compare the implants.

### Results

We looked at 38 studies in total. These studies included over 8,500 people. All of them had hip fractures. We compared the different types of implants.

**Smooth Pins versus Fixed Angle Plates**

We found it hard to say much about these two. We did not have enough good information. The results did not show a clear difference. People had similar movement after surgery. They also had similar rates of death. They had similar needs for more surgery. We need more studies to be sure.

**Screws versus Fixed Angle Plates**

We found that these two implants were similar. People's ability to move was about the same. Their quality of life was also about the same. The risk of death was similar for both types. The need for more surgery was also similar. We had more information for this comparison. Still, the results were not very clear.

**Screws versus Smooth Pins**

We found no clear difference between these two. The risk of death was similar for both. The need for more surgery was also similar. We did not have enough information on other important things. We could not tell how well people moved or did daily tasks.

**All Screws or Pins versus Fixed Angle Plates**

When we grouped the pins and screws together, the results were still similar. There was no clear difference. People had similar rates of death. They also had similar needs for more surgery.

**What We Learned:**

Based on all the studies, we found no big differences. It seems that screws and fixed angle plates work similarly. They have similar effects on how people move. They also have similar effects on their quality of life. The risk of death and needing more surgery were also similar.

For screws and smooth pins, the risk of death was similar. We need more research for a clearer answer. It is hard to say for sure which implant is best right now. This is because many studies did not have enough people. Also, some results were not very precise.

More studies are needed. These new studies should look at how well people move. They should also look at their daily activities. This will help us find the very best way to fix hip fractures.","Metal implants used to fix broken bones in the hip joint in older adults
This review assessed evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs, on the relative benefits and harms of different metal implants used to treat one type of hip fracture in older adults (aged 60 years or over). 
Background 
A hip fracture is a break at the top of the leg bone. We included people with a break just below the ball and socket joint. These types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. They often happen after a fall from a standing or sitting position. A common way of mending this break is to fix the broken parts of bone with metal implants. During an operation, the surgeon may insert a smooth pin or screw through the two parts of broken bone. A smooth pin is not threaded like a screw but may have extra features such as a fold‐out hook. Alternatively, the surgeon may use a 'fixed angle plate' which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone and is attached to the bone with screws or pins. 
Search date 
We searched for RCTs (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), and quasi‐RCTs (in which people are put into groups by a method which is not randomised, such as date of birth or hospital record number), published up to 6 July 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We included 38 studies, involving 8585 adults with 8590 hip fractures. The average age of study participants ranged from 60 to 84 years; 73% were women, which is usual for people who have this type of hip fracture. 
Key results 
Smooth pins compared with fixed angle plates (four studies, 1313 participants): we are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in improving a person's ability to walk independently (with no more than one walking stick), in the number of people who die early (within four months of surgery) or up to 12 months after surgery, and in how many people need additional surgery (e.g. because of deep infection around the implant). 
Screws compared with fixed angle plates (11 studies, 2471 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in hip function (ability to use the hip), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), death at 12 months, and additional surgery. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in independent walking, and early deaths. 
Screws compared to smooth pins (seven studies, 1119 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in deaths at 12 months. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in early deaths and additional surgery. 
Screws or pins compared with fixed angle plates (15 studies, 3784 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in deaths at 12 months, or additional surgery. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between implants in independent walking and early death. We found no additional evidence for hip function or HRQoL. 
No studies in the review reported activities of daily living or delirium.
Certainty of the evidence 
Although there were some large studies, most of the evidence for each outcome came from only a few participants. Many older studies were not well reported. It was not possible to hide from the surgeons what type of fixing was used, which might affect a surgeon's decision on whether someone needed additional surgery. Sometimes, we found differences between the findings of individual studies that we could not explain. 
For these reasons, we assessed the evidence for the outcomes as either low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence. This means we had limited confidence or very little confidence in the results. 
Conclusions 
There may be little or no difference between screws and fixed angle plates in hip function, HRQoL, deaths at 12 months, and additional surgery, and between screws and pins in deaths at 12 months. But we are uncertain of the effects for other outcomes, including those for smooth pins versus fixed angle plates, because the evidence was very low‐certainty. More well‐designed RCTs on metal implants will be helpful.

10.1002-14651858.CD005974.pub5,"Are oral homeopathic medicinal products effective and safe to prevent and treat acute respiratory tract infections in children? 
Review question 
We investigated whether oral homeopathic medicinal products are effective and safe to prevent or treat acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children compared with an inactive (placebo) treatment or other medicines. 
Background 
Most respiratory infections resolve without treatment, but sometimes symptoms persist after the initial infection has gone. Treatment is therefore aimed at relieving symptoms. Respiratory infections are commonly caused by viruses, especially colds and flu, though some lung and ear infections are caused by bacteria. It may be difficult to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections, and they may coexist. Antibiotics are often prescribed for respiratory infections even though they are ineffective against viruses. 
Children have on average three to six respiratory tract infections annually. Although most are mild and treatable, they sometimes require hospital treatment, and very rarely result in death. 
Homeopathy may treat respiratory infections with few side effects, but its effectiveness and safety has not been well researched. 
We assessed evidence from randomised controlled trials (studies that allocate people by chance to receive treatment), which is the best way to assess the safety and efficacy of medical treatments. 
Search date 
Our evidence is current to 27 November 2017.
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies involving 1562 children that compared oral homeopathic treatment to either placebo or standard treatment to prevent or treat respiratory infections in children. All studies investigated upper respiratory tract (from the nose to the windpipe (trachea)) infections, but one combined reporting of upper and lower respiratory tract (from the windpipe to the lungs and pleura (membranes covering the lungs)) infections, so the numbers of children with upper or lower infections is unknown. 
Study funding sources 
Three studies received funding from homeopathy manufacturers; one reported support from a non‐government organisation; two received government support; one was cosponsored by a university; and one did not report funding support. 
Key results 
Studies investigated a range of interventions for various illnesses and populations using different outcome measures, so only a small number could be combined for analysis. All moderate‐quality studies (low risk of bias) showed little or no beneficial effects for homeopathic medicinal products, whether individualised by a trained homeopath or a standard, non‐individualised commercially available therapy. Where results could be combined, there was probably little or no difference in benefit on short‐ or long‐term cure, or in prevention of ARTI. 
Two low‐quality studies (unclear or high risk of bias) showed some benefit of homeopathic medicinal products for a limited number of outcomes. One study showed a reduction in disease severity for the homeopathy group at some time points. The other study showed a reduction in number of respiratory infections over the following year in the treatment groups, although more than a quarter of participants were not accounted for in the results. There was no difference between homeopathy and placebo groups for parents' time off work, antibiotic use, or adverse effects. Consequently, there is no convincing evidence homeopathic medicinal products are effective in treating ARTIs in children. We are unsure about safety because data on adverse events were poorly reported. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated evidence as moderate or low quality for most outcomes. Three outcomes provided very low‐quality evidence because study populations and results differed significantly among studies; there were significant limitations in study design and reporting; and sample sizes were small. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title
Can Homeopathic Medicine Help Children with Colds and Other Chest Illnesses?

### Rationale
Children often get sick with colds, the flu, and other breathing problems. These are called acute respiratory tract infections, or ARTIs. Kids get about three to six of these illnesses each year. Most get better on their own. But sometimes, children need to go to the hospital. Very rarely, these illnesses can be very serious.

These illnesses can cause problems like a stuffy nose or a cough. Doctors often give antibiotics for these problems. But antibiotics do not work on viruses, which cause most colds and flu.

Some people think that homeopathy might help children with these illnesses. Homeopathic medicines may have few bad side effects. But we do not know much about how well they work or if they are truly safe. This study looked at these things. We wanted to see if homeopathic medicines could help children get better or stop them from getting sick.

### Trial Design
This study looked at other studies that were done on this topic. These were special studies called ""randomized controlled trials."" In these studies, people are put into groups by chance. One group gets the treatment being tested. Another group might get a fake treatment, called a placebo. Or they might get a standard medicine. This is a very good way to test if a medicine works.

We looked at eight studies. These studies included 1,562 children in total. The children were given either homeopathic medicine, a fake medicine, or a standard medicine. These studies looked at infections from the nose down to the windpipe. One study also looked at infections in the lungs. We wanted to know if the homeopathic medicine helped. We also looked to see if it caused any problems. The information we used for this study was current up to November 27, 2017.

### Results
The studies we looked at had different ways of testing things. So, we could only combine a small number of them. Most of the good quality studies showed that homeopathic medicines did not help much. This was true whether a trained homeopath chose the medicine or if it was a common homeopathic medicine. These studies found little to no benefit for children. They did not help children get better faster. They also did not help stop them from getting sick in the first place.

Two studies that were not as good quality showed some help. One of these studies said that children who took homeopathic medicine had less severe illness at certain times. The other study said that children had fewer illnesses in the next year. But many children in that study were not fully included in the results.

Overall, the studies did not show that homeopathic medicine helped parents miss less work. It also did not show that children used fewer antibiotics. There were no big differences in bad side effects either. So, we do not have strong proof that homeopathic medicines work for these illnesses in children. We also are not sure about how safe they are. This is because the studies did not report bad side effects well.

The proof from these studies was mostly of moderate or low quality. Some of the proof was very low quality. This is because the studies were different, had problems in how they were set up, and did not include many children.","Are oral homeopathic medicinal products effective and safe to prevent and treat acute respiratory tract infections in children?

10.1002-14651858.CD013280.pub2,"Background
Breast cancer will affect one in eight women during their lifetime. The opportunity to restore the removed tissue and cosmetic appearance is provided by reconstructive breast surgery following skin‐sparing mastectomy (SSM). Mastectomy skin flap necrosis (MSFN) is a common complication following SSM breast reconstruction. This postoperative complication can be prevented by intraoperative assessment of mastectomy skin flap viability and intervention when tissue perfusion is compromised. Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography is presumed to be a better predictor of MSFN compared to clinical evaluation alone. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of indocyanine green fluorescence angiography (ICGA) for preventing mastectomy skin flap necrosis in women undergoing immediate breast reconstruction following skin‐sparing mastectomy. 
To summarise the different ICGA protocols available for assessment of mastectomy skin flap perfusion in women undergoing immediate breast reconstructions following skin‐sparing mastectomy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 3, 2019), MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Clinicaltrials.gov in April 2019. In addition, we searched reference lists of published studies. 
Selection criteria
We included studies that compared the use of ICGA to clinical evaluation to assess mastectomy skin vascularisation and recruited women undergoing immediate autologous or prosthetic reconstructive surgery following SSM for confirmed breast malignancy or high risk of developing breast cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included nonrandomised studies and extracted data on postoperative outcomes, including postoperative MSFN, reoperation, autologous flap necrosis, dehiscence, infection, haematoma and seroma, and patient‐related outcomes. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach and we constructed two 'Summary of finding's tables: one for the comparison of ICGA to clinical evaluation on a per patient basis and one on a per breast basis. 
Main results
Nine nonrandomised cohort studies met the inclusion criteria and involved a total of 1589 women with 2199 breast reconstructions. We included seven retrospective and two prospective cohort studies. Six studies reported the number of MSFN on a per breast basis for a total of 1435 breasts and three studies reported the number of MSFN on a per patient basis for a total of 573 women. Five studies reported the number of other complications on a per breast basis for a total of 1370 breasts and four studies reported the number on a per patient basis for a total of 613 patients. Therefore, we decided to pool data separately. 
Risk of bias for each included nonrandomised study was assessed using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. There was serious concern with risk of bias due to the nonrandomised study design of all included studies and the low comparability of cohorts in most studies. The quality of the evidence was found to be very low, after downgrading the quality of evidence twice for imprecision based on the small sample sizes and low number of events in the included studies. 
Postoperative complications on a per patient basis 
We are uncertain about the effect of ICGA on MSFN (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.56; three studies, 573 participants: very low quality of evidence), infection rates (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.40; four studies, 613 participants: very low quality of evidence), haematoma rates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.53; two studies, 459 participants: very low quality of evidence) and seroma rates (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.41 to 6.80; two studies, 408 participants: very low quality of evidence) compared to the clinical group. We found evidence that ICGA may reduce reoperation rates (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.72; four studies, 613 participants: very low quality of evidence). One study considered dehiscence as an outcome. In this single study, dehiscence was observed in 2.2% of participants (4/184) in the ICGA group compared to 0.5% of participants (1/184) in the clinical group (P = 0.372). The RR was 4.00 (95% CI 0.45 to 35.45; one study; 368 participants; very low quality of evidence). 
Postoperative complications on a per breast basis 
We found evidence that ICGA may reduce MSFN (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.82; six studies, 1435 breasts: very low quality of evidence), may reduce reoperation rates (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.92; five studies, 1370 breasts: very low quality of evidence) and may reduce infection rates (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97; five studies, 1370 breasts: very low quality of evidence) compared to the clinical group. We are uncertain about the effect of ICGA on haematoma rates (RR 1.53, CI 95% 0.47 to 4.95; four studies, 1042 breasts: very low quality of evidence) and seroma rates (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.35; two studies, 528 breasts: very low quality of evidence). 
None of the studies reported patient‐related outcomes.
ICGA protocols: eight studies used the SPY System and one study used the Photodynamic Eye imaging system (PDE) to assess MSFN. ICGA protocols in the included studies were not extensively described in most studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Although mastectomy skin flap perfusion is performed more frequently using ICGA as a helpful tool, there is a lack of high‐quality evidence in the context of randomised controlled trials. The quality of evidence in this review is very low, since only nonrandomised cohort studies have been included. With the results from this review, no conclusions can be drawn about what method of assessment is best to use during breast reconstructive surgery. High‐quality randomised controlled studies that compare the use of ICGA to assess MSFN compared to clinical evaluation are needed.

## Plain Title: Improving Breast Reconstruction Surgery

### Rationale

Breast cancer impacts many women. About one in eight women will get breast cancer. When doctors remove breast cancer, they often do surgery to rebuild the breast. This is called breast reconstruction.

Sometimes after this surgery, the skin does not heal well. This problem is called mastectomy skin flap necrosis, or MSFN. It means part of the skin dies. This can cause more problems and even more surgeries.

Doctors want to find ways to stop MSFN. They need to check the skin’s blood flow during surgery. If blood flow is poor, they can fix it right away.

One new way to check blood flow is with a special dye and camera. This is called indocyanine green fluorescence angiography, or ICGA. Doctors think ICGA might be better than just looking at the skin. It might help them see blood flow more clearly. This study looked at if ICGA can help prevent skin problems after breast reconstruction.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past research. It gathered results from many studies. These studies compared ICGA to the usual way of checking skin. The usual way is just by looking at the skin.

The studies included women who had breast reconstruction. These women had surgery for breast cancer. Or they were at high risk of getting breast cancer.

The studies looked at how many women had MSFN. They also looked at other problems. These problems included more surgeries, infections, or fluid buildup.

The researchers looked at studies that used ICGA. They wanted to see how ICGA helped prevent MSFN. They also wanted to see how different ICGA methods were used.

### Results

The study reviewed nine past studies. These studies included about 1600 women. They involved over 2000 breast reconstructions.

The studies found that ICGA may lower the chance of MSFN. It may also lower the need for more surgeries. ICGA may also reduce infections.

However, the quality of these studies was not high. They were not designed in a way that gives very strong answers. This means we cannot be fully sure of these results.

The studies did not give clear answers for other problems. These included fluid buildup or blood clots. No studies reported how women felt after the surgery.

Doctors need to do more strong studies. These new studies should compare ICGA to just looking at the skin. This will help us know for sure if ICGA is the best way to prevent problems after breast reconstruction.","Indocyanine green angiography versus clinical evaluation in preventing postoperative complications following breast reconstruction after mastectomy 
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out whether the use of a new imaging technique, called indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), during reconstructive breast surgery can reduce necrosis (cell death) of the overlying breast skin and other complications such as infections, following reconstructive breast surgery after mastectomy.  We included women who had undergone skin‐sparing mastectomy (that is, where the whole breast including nipple is removed, sparing the overlying breast skin) for breast cancer or women who were at high risk of developing breast cancer (because of faulty genes). We collected and analysed all relevant studies to provide a review that will inform doctors and patients on ICGA use in reconstructive breast surgery.  Key messages The use of ICGA during reconstructive breast surgery seems to reduce the chance of reoperations when compared to clinical evaluation only. We are uncertain about the effect of ICGA on reducing the chance of necrosis of the overlying breast skin and other post‐surgery complications when compared to clinical evaluation only. The quality of studies used for this review is very low, meaning that we are not confident of the results. We need high‐quality studies that have randomised women to a group of ICGA assessment or clinical evaluation alone to have a more definitive answer.  What was studied in the review? Around 40% of women with breast cancer need to undergo mastectomy (removal of the whole breast). A skin‐sparing mastectomy is a common operation in which the overlying breast skin is preserved. After skin‐sparing mastectomy, women have the option to undergo reconstructive breast surgery. This operation carries some risks and complications, including an operation to correct complications (reoperation), spontaneous reopening of the surgical wound (dehiscence), infection, blood pooling outside of a blood vessel (haematoma) and a pocket filled with blood plasma underneath the skin (seroma).  Preserving the blood supply of the overlying breast skin during skin‐sparing mastectomy is crucial. When the blood supply is poor, skin will not survive, and surgeons need to intervene to prevent postoperative complications. Usually, the surgeon will assess tissue colour, the time taken for colour to return to the skin after pressure is applied (capillary refill), temperature, skin’s elasticity, and bleeding of the skin.  ICGA is a new imaging technique that assesses the blood supply to the tissue. It can assess blood flow in the overlying breast skin better than clinical judgement alone. We collected studies that compared the use of ICGA to clinical evaluation by a surgeon during immediate reconstructive breast surgery after skin‐sparing mastectomy. In these studies, women underwent immediate reconstructive surgery with their own tissue from another area of the woman’s body or with a breast implant.  What are the main results of this review? We found nine studies that compared the number of postoperative complications in women who had ICGA assessment of their breast skin versus clinical evaluation. Six studies were performed in the USA, two in Denmark and one in Japan. There were a total 1589 women with 2199 breast reconstructions. Studies reported the number of complications on a per patient basis or on a per breast basis. We present information based on both types of data.  The main results on a per patient analysis were that: ‐ICGA may reduce reoperation rates, and ‐we are uncertain as to whether ICGA has an effect on necrosis of the overlying skin of the breast, infection, haematoma and seroma rates. 
The main results on a per breast basis were that: ‐ICGA may reduce necrosis of the overlying skin of the breast, reoperation and infection rates, and ‐we are uncertain as to whether ICGA has an effect on haematoma and seroma rates.  The evidence contributing to this review topic is considered to be very low quality. Since randomised controlled trials are found to be one of the most powerful methods in clinical research, it is a major downside that these studies are missing. We emphasise the need for randomised controlled trials to further investigate the use of ICGA in reconstructive breast surgery.  How up‐to‐date is this review? Studies published up to April 2019 have been used for this review.

Vaccines are effective in preventing severe COVID‐19, a disease for which few treatments are available and which can lead to disability or death. Widespread vaccination against COVID‐19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. In addition, new and vaccine‐resistant mutations of SARS‐CoV‐2 may be less likely to develop if the spread of COVID‐19 is limited. Different vaccines are now widely available in many settings. However, vaccine hesitancy is a serious threat to the goal of nationwide vaccination in many countries and poses a substantial threat to population health. This scoping review maps interventions aimed at increasing COVID‐19 vaccine uptake and decreasing COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy.  
Objectives
To scope the existing research landscape on interventions to enhance the willingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID‐19, increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy, and to map the evidence according to addressed populations and intervention categories.   
Search methods
We searched Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index), WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, PsycINFO, and CINAHL to 11 October 2021.  
Selection criteria
We included studies that assess the impact of interventions implemented to enhance the willingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID‐19, increase vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised studies of intervention (NRSIs), observational studies and case studies with more than 100 participants. Furthermore, we included systematic reviews and meta‐analyses. We did not limit the scope of the review to a specific population or to specific outcomes assessed. We excluded interventions addressing hesitancy towards vaccines for diseases other than COVID‐19. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were analysed according to a protocol uploaded to the Open Science Framework. We used an interactive scoping map to visualise the results of our scoping review. We mapped the identified interventions according to pre‐specified intervention categories, that were adapted to better fit the evidence. The intervention categories were: communication interventions, policy interventions, educational interventions, incentives (both financial and non‐financial), interventions to improve access, and multidimensional interventions. The study outcomes were also included in the mapping. Furthermore, we mapped the country in which the study was conducted, the addressed population, and whether the design was randomised‐controlled or not.  
Main results
We included 96 studies in the scoping review, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. We did not identify any relevant systematic reviews. For an overview, please see the interactive scoping map (https://tinyurl.com/2p9jmx24).   
Studies with published results 
Of the 61 studies with published results, 46 studies were RCTs and 15 NRSIs. The interventions investigated in the studies were heterogeneous with most studies testing communication strategies to enhance COVID‐19 vaccine uptake. Most studies assessed the willingness to get vaccinated as an outcome. The majority of studies were conducted in English‐speaking high‐income countries. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. Populations that were addressed were diverse. For example, studies targeted healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, at‐risk patients, or the general population.  
Ongoing studies 
Of the 35 ongoing studies, 29 studies are RCTs and six NRSIs. Educational and communication interventions were the most used types of interventions. The majority of ongoing studies plan to assess vaccine uptake as an outcome. Again, the majority of studies are being conducted in English‐speaking high‐income countries. In contrast to the studies with published results, most ongoing studies will not be conducted online. Addressed populations range from minority populations in the USA to healthcare workers or students. Eleven ongoing studies have estimated completion dates in 2022.   
Authors' conclusions
We were able to identify and map a variety of heterogeneous interventions for increasing COVID‐19 vaccine uptake or decreasing vaccine hesitancy. Our results demonstrate that this is an active field of research with 61 published studies and 35 studies still ongoing. This review gives a comprehensive overview of interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake and can be the foundation for subsequent systematic reviews on the effectiveness of interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake.  
A research gap was shown for studies conducted in low and middle‐income countries and studies investigating policy interventions and improved access, as well as for interventions addressing children and adolescents. As COVID‐19 vaccines become more widely available, these populations and interventions should not be neglected in research. 
","## Plain Title: Helping More People Get COVID-19 Shots

## Rationale

COVID-19 is a sickness that can make people very sick. It can cause problems that last a long time, or even death. Shots help keep people from getting very sick with COVID-19.

Not everyone can get the shot yet. Getting more people to take the shot helps keep everyone safer. It can also stop the virus from changing and becoming harder to fight.

Many good shots are out there now. But some people do not want to get the shot. This makes it hard to keep people safe from COVID-19.

We did this study to find out what things help more people get the COVID-19 shot. We wanted to see what stops people from getting it. We looked at many studies to find answers.

## Trial Design

This study looked at many other studies. We wanted to see how different ideas worked. These ideas were meant to get more people to take the COVID-19 shot. They also aimed to make people less scared of the shot.

We looked at studies from many places. These studies included people of all ages. They looked at general people, doctors, students, and more. Some studies were quick looks. Others followed people over time.

We looked at studies that tried different things. Some gave people facts. Some offered help to get the shot. Some gave small gifts. We did not limit the study to one type of person or one outcome. We only looked at studies about the COVID-19 shot.

We found 96 studies in total. Some had finished and shared what they found. Others are still going on right now.

## Results

We found many ways people are trying to get more people to take the COVID-19 shot. We saw that many studies shared facts with people. They used many ways to talk to people. Most studies looked at if people were willing to get the shot.

Most of the studies that finished were in rich countries. These countries mostly spoke English. Many studies shared facts online. They looked at groups like doctors, students, and people at higher risk.

We also found 35 studies that are still happening. These studies also share facts. They also teach people about the shot. Many of these studies are also in rich, English-speaking countries. But more of these studies are not online. They are working with people in person.

We learned that many people are working on this problem. Our study gives a full look at these efforts. It can help other studies in the future.

We also saw some things that are missing. We need more studies in poorer countries. We need more studies about plans from the government. We need more studies about making it easier to get the shot. We also need more studies about kids and teens. As more shots are ready, we must not forget these people.","Interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake 
Background 
Vaccines are effective in preventing death or severe illness from COVID‐19, a disease for which few treatments are available. Widespread vaccination against COVID‐19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. However, many people do not want to get vaccinated against COVID‐19. This can put them at increased risk of severe disease and death. 
What was our aim? 
We wanted to find out which interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake have been or are currently evaluated.  
Methods 
We searched medical databases and trial registries until the 11 of October 2021. We included all studies investigating interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake. We excluded studies looking at other vaccines, for example, measles. We included all forms of studies as long as they had more than 100 participants.  
Once we found the studies, we categorised the interventions into the following groups: communication interventions, policy interventions, interventions to improve access, educational interventions, incentives, and multidimensional interventions. We summarised the results in an interactive scoping map. Furthermore, we mapped the study outcomes, the country in which the study was conducted, the study population, and the study design. 
Results 
We included 96 studies in evidence mapping, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. The interventions tested in these studies are very diverse. Many studies used communication strategies to convince people to get vaccinated against COVID‐19.  Interventions that included information on vaccination or a mixture of different strategies were also often used.  
A majority of studies were conducted in English‐speaking countries of the global north, for example, the USA. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. The populations addressed varied across the studies. For example, studies addressed healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, villagers, at‐risk patients, or the general population.  
For an overview, please see the interactive scoping map (https://tinyurl.com/2p9jmx24).   
Conclusion 
We identified a large number of studies that investigate how COVID‐19 vaccine uptake might be increased. However, more studies are needed focusing on lower‐middle‐income countries and on children. Future research should compare the effectiveness of different interventions to improve COVID‐19 vaccine uptake.

10.1002-14651858.CD013512.pub2,"Background
Keratoconus is the most common corneal dystrophy. It can cause loss of uncorrected and best‐corrected visual acuity through ectasia (thinning) of the central or paracentral cornea, irregular corneal scarring, or corneal perforation. Disease onset usually occurs in the second to fourth decade of life, periods of peak educational attainment or career development. The condition is lifelong and sight‐threatening. 
Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) using ultraviolet A (UVA) light applied to the cornea is the only treatment that has been shown to slow progression of disease. The original, more widely known technique involves application of UVA light to de‐epithelialized cornea, to which a photosensitizer (riboflavin) is added topically throughout the irradiation process. 
Transepithelial CXL is a recently advocated alternative to the standard CXL procedure, in that the epithelium is kept intact during CXL. Retention of the epithelium offers the putative advantages of faster healing, less patient discomfort, faster visual rehabilitation, and less risk of corneal haze. 
Objectives
To assess the short‐ and long‐term effectiveness and safety of transepithelial CXL compared with epithelium‐off CXL for progressive keratoconus. 
Search methods
To identify potentially eligible studies, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not impose any date or language restrictions. We last searched the electronic databases on 15 January 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which transepithelial CXL had been compared with epithelium‐off CXL in participants with progressive keratoconus. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology.
Main results
We included 13 studies with 661 eyes of 567 participants enrolled; 13 to 119 participants were enrolled per study. Seven studies were conducted in Europe, three in the Middle East, and one each in India, Russia, and Turkey. Seven studies were parallel‐group RCTs, one study was an RCT with a paired‐eyes design, and five studies were RCTs in which both eyes of some or all participants were assigned to the same intervention. 
Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL with epithelium‐off CXL in participants with progressive keratoconus. There was no evidence of an important difference between intervention groups in maximum keratometry (denoted 'maximum K' or 'Kmax'; also known as steepest keratometry measurement) at 12 months or later (mean difference (MD) 0.99 diopters (D), 95% CI −0.11 to 2.09; 5 studies; 177 eyes; I2 = 41%; very low certainty evidence). Few studies described other outcomes of interest. The evidence is very uncertain that epithelium‐off CXL may have a small (data from two studies were not pooled due to considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 92%)) or no effect on stabilization of progressive keratoconus compared with transepithelial CXL; comparison of the estimated proportions of eyes with decreases or increases of 2 or more diopters in maximum K at 12 months from one study with 61 eyes was RR 0.32 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.12) and RR (non‐event) 0.86 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.00), respectively (very low certainty). We did not estimate an overall effect on corrected‐distance visual acuity (CDVA) because substantial heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 70%). No study evaluated CDVA gain or loss of 10 or more letters on a logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) chart. Transepithelial CXL may result in little to no difference in CDVA at 12 months or beyond. Four studies reported that either no adverse events or no serious adverse events had been observed. Another study noted no change in endothelial cell count after either procedure. Moderate certainty evidence from 4 studies (221 eyes) found that epithelium‐off CXL resulted in a slight increase in corneal haze or scarring when compared to transepithelial CXL (RR (non‐event) 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14). 
Three studies, one of which had three arms, compared outcomes among participants assigned to transepithelial CXL using iontophoresis versus those assigned to epithelium‐off CXL. No conclusive evidence was found for either keratometry or visual acuity outcomes at 12 months or later after surgery. Low certainty evidence suggests that transepithelial CXL using iontophoresis results in no difference in logMAR CDVA (MD 0.00 letter, 95% CI −0.04 to 0.04; 2 studies; 51 eyes). Only one study examined gain or loss of 10 or more logMAR letters. In terms of adverse events, one case of subepithelial infiltrate was reported after transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis, whereas two cases of faint corneal scars and four cases of permanent haze were observed after epithelium‐off CXL. Vogt's striae were found in one eye after each intervention. The certainty of the evidence was low or very low for the outcomes in this comparison due to imprecision of estimates for all outcomes and risk of bias in the studies from which data have been reported. 
Authors' conclusions
Because of lack of precision, frequent indeterminate risk of bias due to inadequate reporting, and inconsistency in outcomes measured and reported among studies in this systematic review, it remains unknown whether transepithelial CXL, or any other approach, may confer an advantage over epithelium‐off CXL for patients with progressive keratoconus with respect to further progression of keratoconus, visual acuity outcomes, and patient‐reported outcomes (PROs). Arrest of the progression of keratoconus should be the primary outcome of interest in future trials of CXL, particularly when comparing the effectiveness of different approaches to CXL. Furthermore, methods of assessing and defining progressive keratoconus should be standardized. Trials with longer follow‐up are required in order to assure that outcomes are measured after corneal wound‐healing and stabilization of keratoconus. In addition, perioperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care should be standardized to permit meaningful comparisons of CXL methods. Methods to increase penetration of riboflavin through intact epithelium as well as delivery of increased dose of UVA may be needed to improve outcomes. PROs should be measured and reported. The visual significance of adverse outcomes, such as corneal haze, should be assessed and correlated with other outcomes, including PROs.  
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the provided abstract:

### Plain Title
Comparing Two Eye Treatments for a Thinning Cornea

### Rationale
Our eyes have a clear front part called the cornea. Sometimes, the cornea gets thin and bulges out. This is a condition called keratoconus. It often starts when people are young adults. It can make vision blurry and can even lead to serious vision loss. This can make it hard to study or work.

There is a treatment called corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL). It uses special light to make the cornea stronger. This can stop the condition from getting worse. The usual CXL treatment removes a thin outer layer of the cornea. This layer is called the epithelium. Then, a special eye drop is used with the light.

A newer way to do CXL keeps this outer layer intact. This is called transepithelial CXL. Doctors think this new way might lead to faster healing. It might also cause less pain, help people see better sooner, and cause fewer cloudy spots on the eye. We need to know if this newer treatment is as good and safe as the usual treatment.

### Trial Design
This study looked at other studies that compared the two CXL treatments. We wanted to see how well each treatment worked and if they were safe. We looked for studies where people were randomly put into one treatment group or the other. This helps make sure the results are fair.

We searched many health databases to find all possible studies. We included studies that looked at people with keratoconus that was getting worse. These studies included both men and women. The people in the studies were mostly young adults. The studies followed people for at least 12 months, and some for longer, to see the effects of the treatment.

### Results
We found 13 studies that involved 567 people and 661 eyes. Most studies were done in Europe and the Middle East.

When we looked at how much the cornea flattened, there was no clear difference between the two treatments. The evidence was not strong enough to say one was much better than the other. It was also unclear if one treatment was better at stopping the condition from getting worse.

We could not get a clear picture of how much vision changed for people after either treatment. This is because the studies measured vision in different ways. Some studies did not report any bad effects from either treatment. Other studies found that the usual CXL treatment (where the outer layer is removed) caused a bit more cloudiness or scars on the eye compared to the newer treatment.

A few studies also looked at a special type of transepithelial CXL using a method called iontophoresis. Again, there was no clear proof that this was better for vision or cornea shape.

Overall, we do not know for sure if the newer transepithelial CXL is better than the usual CXL. The studies we found had some issues. They did not always report things in the same way. The results were not always clear. More studies are needed. These future studies should focus on whether the treatment stops keratoconus from getting worse. They should also follow people for a longer time to see the full effects. It is also important to measure things like pain and how people feel about their vision.","What surgical procedure works best to slow the progression of keratoconus (an eye disease)? 
Why is this question important?Keratoconus is a disease that affects the thin, clear outer layer of the eye, known as the cornea. Normally, the cornea is dome‐shaped. In people with keratoconus, the cornea slowly thins, and a cone‐shaped bulge develops in the center of the cornea. The disease usually begins between the ages of teens and 40, and persists throughout life. It causes blurry or distorted vision that may not be improved by wearing glasses and may result in perforation of the cornea and other visual problems. 
Treatments such as glasses and contact lenses can be used to improve the vision of people with keratoconus. However, these do not slow the progression of the disease. The only treatment known to slow disease progression is ‘corneal collagen crosslinking’ (CXL). 
CXL is a surgical procedure that aims to strengthen the cornea and prevent further thinning. It involves shining ultraviolet A (invisible) light rays onto eyes that have been treated with eye drops containing riboflavin (a vitamin). When the light rays meet the riboflavin, new links form between the fibers that make up the cornea. 
There are two types of CXL. One type requires the removal of the cells on surface of the cornea, to make it easier for the riboflavin to reach the cornea. This procedure is called ‘epithelium‐off CXL’. The other type does not require the removal of these cells. This procedure is called ‘transepithelial CXL’. Surgeons who carry out this procedure can use chemicals to help riboflavin penetrate the cells on the surface of the cornea. They can also deliver riboflavin to the cornea using a small electrical current (iontophoresis). 
Epithelium‐off CXL is the more commonly used procedure. However, transepithelial CXL could have advantages, such as faster healing and less patient discomfort. We reviewed the evidence to find out which of these two procedures is more beneficial and less risky for people with keratoconus. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched the medical literature for studies that compared epithelium‐off CXL against transepithelial CXL. Then we compared the results and summarized the evidence from all the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find?We found 13 studies with a total of 567 people. The studies took place in Europe, the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The shortest studies lasted six months, and the longest study lasted more than three years. Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis against epithelium‐off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis against epithelium‐off CXL. 
Transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis compared to epithelium‐off CXL 
We do not know if one procedure is better than the other for preventing progression of keratoconus or visual loss because too few robust studies have compared the effects of these two CXL methods. 
Evidence from four studies suggests that corneal hazing (clouding of the cornea) or scarring are probably more common with epithelium‐off CXL. 
Transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis compared to epithelium‐off CXL 
Evidence from two studies suggests that there may be little to no difference between the two procedures in changes to vision clarity. We do not know if one procedure is better than the other to prevent progression of keratoconus because two few robust studies have compared the two methods. 
The evidence does not suggest that one procedure leads to more unwanted events than the other. However, our confidence in this evidence is low, because it is based on three studies that did not use robust methods. 
What does this mean?Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if epithelium‐off CXL or transepithelial CXL is better for slowing keratoconus progression. 
Adverse events such as corneal hazing or scarring are probably more common with epithelium‐off CXL than with transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis. 
We need more and larger studies to strengthen the evidence. These should compare the benefits and the risks of different CXL procedures. Studies should aim to follow patients for more than 12 months, so that long‐term effects can be compared as it can take at least that much time for corneal tissue to heal from any procedure. 
How‐up‐to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to January 2020. 
"
10.1002-14651858.MR000013.pub6,"Background
Recruiting participants to trials can be extremely difficult. Identifying strategies that improve trial recruitment would benefit both trialists and health research. 
Objectives
To quantify the effects of strategies for improving recruitment of participants to randomised trials. A secondary objective is to assess the evidence for the effect of the research setting (e.g. primary care versus secondary care) on recruitment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Methodology Review Group Specialised Register (CMR) in the Cochrane Library (July 2012, searched 11 February 2015); MEDLINE and MEDLINE In Process (OVID) (1946 to 10 February 2015); Embase (OVID) (1996 to 2015 Week 06); Science Citation Index & Social Science Citation Index (ISI) (2009 to 11 February 2015) and ERIC (EBSCO) (2009 to 11 February 2015). 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials of methods to increase recruitment to randomised trials. This includes non‐healthcare studies and studies recruiting to hypothetical trials. We excluded studies aiming to increase response rates to questionnaires or trial retention and those evaluating incentives and disincentives for clinicians to recruit participants. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on: the method evaluated; country in which the study was carried out; nature of the population; nature of the study setting; nature of the study to be recruited into; randomisation or quasi‐randomisation method; and numbers and proportions in each intervention group. We used a risk difference to estimate the absolute improvement and the 95% confidence interval (CI) to describe the effect in individual trials. We assessed heterogeneity between trial results. We used GRADE to judge the certainty we had in the evidence coming from each comparison. 
Main results
We identified 68 eligible trials (24 new to this update) with more than 74,000 participants. There were 63 studies involving interventions aimed directly at trial participants, while five evaluated interventions aimed at people recruiting participants. All studies were in health care. 
We found 72 comparisons, but just three are supported by high‐certainty evidence according to GRADE. 
1. Open trials rather than blinded, placebo trials. The absolute improvement was 10% (95% CI 7% to 13%). 
2. Telephone reminders to people who do not respond to a postal invitation. The absolute improvement was 6% (95% CI 3% to 9%). This result applies to trials that have low underlying recruitment. We are less certain for trials that start out with moderately good recruitment (i.e. over 10%). 
3. Using a particular, bespoke, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets. This method involved spending a lot of time working with the target population for recruitment to decide on the content, format and appearance of the participant information leaflet. This made little or no difference to recruitment: absolute improvement was 1% (95% CI −1% to 3%). 
We had moderate‐certainty evidence for eight other comparisons; our confidence was reduced for most of these because the results came from a single study. Three of the methods were changes to trial management, three were changes to how potential participants received information, one was aimed at recruiters, and the last was a test of financial incentives. All of these comparisons would benefit from other researchers replicating the evaluation. There were no evaluations in paediatric trials. 
We had much less confidence in the other 61 comparisons because the studies had design flaws, were single studies, had very uncertain results or were hypothetical (mock) trials rather than real ones. 
Authors' conclusions
The literature on interventions to improve recruitment to trials has plenty of variety but little depth. Only 3 of 72 comparisons are supported by high‐certainty evidence according to GRADE: having an open trial and using telephone reminders to non‐responders to postal interventions both increase recruitment; a specialised way of developing participant information leaflets had little or no effect. The methodology research community should improve the evidence base by replicating evaluations of existing strategies, rather than developing and testing new ones.

## Plain Title
Making it Easier to Join Medical Studies

## Rationale
It can be very hard to find enough people to join medical studies. These studies help us learn about new ways to treat sickness. When not enough people join, it slows down our ability to find better health care. We wanted to find out what works best to get more people to join these important studies. We also looked at if where the study takes place, like a doctor's office or a hospital, makes a difference.

## Trial Design
We looked at many other studies that tested ways to get more people to join medical trials. We searched many big databases of medical research. These databases hold information from many years of studies. We looked for studies that used fair ways to compare different ways of asking people to join. This included studies about joining make-believe trials, not just real ones. We did not look at studies about keeping people in trials or paying doctors to find patients. We gathered facts about each study. This included where it was done and who was asked to join. We looked at how many people joined in each group. We then used special methods to see how much each method helped. We also checked how sure we could be about the results from each comparison.

## Results
We found 68 studies that fit our needs. Over 74,000 people were in these studies. Most of these studies looked at ways to help people join trials directly. A small number looked at ways to help the people who ask others to join. All the studies were about health care.

We found 72 different comparisons of methods. But only three of these had strong proof that they worked.

1.  **Open trials** (where everyone knows what treatment they are getting, not like a sugar pill trial). This helped 10 more people out of every 100 join the study.
2.  **Calling people** who did not reply to a letter asking them to join. This helped 6 more people out of every 100 join. This worked best when not many people were joining the study at first.
3.  **Taking a lot of time** to make special information papers for patients. This did not make much of a difference. Only 1 more person out of every 100 joined.

We found 8 other methods that might work. But we were less sure about these. Each of these ideas only came from one study. We need more studies to check if these ideas truly work. We did not find any studies about children's trials.

Most of the other 61 methods we looked at did not have strong proof. This was because the studies had problems, were only done once, or had results that were not clear.

We learned that there are many different ideas to get people to join studies. But not many of these ideas have strong proof that they work well. The medical research world should re-test ideas that show promise. They should not just keep inventing new ones. This will help us find the best ways to get more people to join important medical studies.","What improves trial recruitment?
Key messages 
We had high‐certainty evidence for three methods to improve recruitment, two of which are effective: 
1. Telling people what they are receiving in the trial rather than not telling them improves recruitment. 
2. Phoning people who do not respond to a postal invitation is also effective (although we are not certain this works as well in all trials). 
3. Using a tailored, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets makes little or no difference to recruitment. 
Of the 72 strategies tested, only 7 involved more than one study. We need more studies to understand whether they work or not. 
Our question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of things trial teams do to try and improve recruitment to their trials. We found 68 studies involving more than 74,000 people. 
Background 
Finding participants for trials can be difficult, and trial teams try many things to improve recruitment. It is important to know whether these actually work. Our review looked for studies that examined this question using chance to allocate people to different recruitment strategies because this is the fairest way of seeing if one approach is better than another. 
Key results 
We found 68 studies including 72 comparisons. We have high certainty in what we found for only three of these. 
1. Telling people what they are receiving in the trial rather than not telling them improves recruitment. Our best estimate is that if 100 people were told what they were receiving in a randomised trial, and 100 people were not, 10 more would take part n the group who knew. There is some uncertainty though: it could be as few as 7 more per hundred, or as many as 13 more. 
2. Phoning people who do not respond to a postal invitation to take part is also effective. Our best estimate is that if investigators called 100 people who did not respond to a postal invitation, and did not call 100 others, 6 more would take part in the trial among the group who received a call. However, this number could be as few as 3 more per hundred, or as many as 9 more. 
3. Using a tailored, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets did not make much difference. The researchers who tested this method spent a lot of time working with people like those to be recruited to decide what should be in the participant information leaflet and what it should look like. Our best estimate is that if 100 people got the new leaflet, 1 more would take part in the trial compared to 100 who got the old leaflet. However, there is some uncertainty, and it could be 1 fewer (i.e. worse than the old leaflet) per hundred, or as many as 3 more. 
We had moderate certainty in what we found for eight other comparisons; our confidence was reduced for most of these because the method had been tested in only one study. We had much less confidence in the other 61 comparisons because the studies had design flaws, were the only studies to look at a particular method, had a very uncertain result or were mock trials rather than real ones. 
Study characteristics 
The 68 included studies covered a very wide range of disease areas, including antenatal care, cancer, home safety, hypertension, podiatry, smoking cessation and surgery. Primary, secondary and community care were included. The size of the studies ranged from 15 to 14,467 participants. Studies came from 12 countries; there was also one multinational study involving 19 countries. The USA and UK dominated with 25 and 22 studies, respectively. The next largest contribution came from Australia with eight studies. 
The small print 
Our search updated our 2010 review and is current to February 2015. We also identified six studies published after 2015 outside the search. The review includes 24 mock trials where the researchers asked people about whether they would take part in an imaginary trial. We have not presented or discussed their results because it is hard to see how the findings relate to real trial decisions.

Bottom line 
The available evidence suggests that a course of acupuncture consisting of at least six treatment sessions can be a valuable option for people with migraine. 
Background 
Individuals with migraine have repeated attacks of severe headache, usually just on one side and often with vomiting. Acupuncture is a therapy in which thin needles are inserted into the skin at particular points. It originated in China, and is now used in many countries to treat people with migraine. We evaluated whether acupuncture reduces the number of episodes of migraine. We looked at the number of people in whom the number of migraine days per month was reduced by half or more than half. 
Key results 
For this update, we reviewed 22 trials with 4985 people, published up to January 2016. We omitted five trials from the original review because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months. We included five new trials in this update. 
In four trials, acupuncture added to usual care or treatment of migraine on onset only (usually with pain‐killers) resulted in 41 in 100 people having the frequency of headaches at least halved, compared to 17 of 100 people given usual care only. 
In 15 trials, acupuncture was compared with 'fake' acupuncture, where needles are inserted at incorrect points or do not penetrate the skin. The frequency of headaches halved in 50 of 100 people receiving true acupuncture, compared with 41 of 100 people receiving 'fake' acupuncture. The results were dominated by three good quality large trials (with about 1200 people) showing that the effect of true acupuncture was still present after six months. There were no differences in the number of side effects of real and 'fake' acupuncture, or the numbers dropping out because of side effects. 
In five trials, acupuncture was compared to a drug proven to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, but only three trials provided useful information. At three months, headache frequency halved in 57 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 46 of 100 people taking the drug. After six months, headache frequency halved in 59 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 54 of 100 people taking the drug. People receiving acupuncture reported side effects less often than people receiving drugs, and were less likely to drop out of the trial. 
Our findings about the number of days with migraine per month can be summarized as follows. If people have six days with migraine per month on average before starting treatment, this would be reduced to five days in people receiving only usual care, to four days in those receiving fake acupuncture or a prophylactic drug, and to three and a half days in those receiving true acupuncture. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall the quality of the evidence was moderate.

### **Plain Title**
Acupuncture Can Help Prevent Migraine Headaches

### **Rationale**
Many people get migraine headaches. A migraine is a very bad headache. It often hits one side of your head. It can also make you feel sick to your stomach. Migraines can make it hard to live your daily life. They can cause a lot of pain and problems for people.

Acupuncture is an old treatment from China. Thin needles go into your skin at certain spots. Some people think it can help with pain. We wanted to see if acupuncture could stop migraines. We thought acupuncture might make people have fewer migraine days. This study checks if acupuncture can be a good way to treat migraines. We wanted to see if it could help people have less pain.

### **Trial Design**
This study looked at past research. It gathered results from many smaller studies. These studies looked at 4,985 people in total. The people in these studies all had migraine headaches. They had been getting migraines for at least one year. We looked at studies published up to January 2016. We added five new studies to our review. We did not include studies where people had migraines for less than 12 months.

The studies compared acupuncture to different things. Some compared acupuncture to only getting usual care. Usual care often means taking pain pills when a migraine starts. Other studies compared real acupuncture to ""fake"" acupuncture. Fake acupuncture uses needles that don't go into the skin. Or they go into the wrong spots. Some studies even compared acupuncture to a medicine that stops migraines. We wanted to see how many people had half or more than half their migraine days cut down.

### **Results**
We looked at 22 studies with nearly 5,000 people.

In some studies, people got acupuncture plus their usual care. For every 100 people, 41 had their headaches cut in half or more. Only 17 of 100 people who got only usual care had this benefit.

Other studies compared real acupuncture to ""fake"" acupuncture. For every 100 people, 50 who got real acupuncture had fewer headaches. Only 41 of 100 people who got fake acupuncture had fewer headaches. This benefit from real acupuncture lasted for at least six months. Both real and fake acupuncture had similar low rates of side effects. Few people stopped treatment due to side effects.

Some studies compared acupuncture to a medicine that stops migraines. After three months, 57 of 100 people getting acupuncture had fewer headaches. This was better than 46 of 100 people taking the medicine. After six months, 59 of 100 people getting acupuncture had fewer headaches. This was better than 54 of 100 people taking the medicine. People getting acupuncture had fewer side effects than those taking medicine. They also stopped treatment less often.

Let's look at how many migraine days people had each month. If a person had six migraine days, on average, before treatment:
* With only usual care, this went down to five days.
* With fake acupuncture or migraine medicine, it went down to four days.
* With real acupuncture, it went down to three and a half days.

This means acupuncture can be a good choice for people with migraines. It can help them have fewer migraine attacks. It also has fewer side effects than some medicines.","Acupuncture for preventing migraine attacks

10.1002-14651858.CD013240.pub2,"Background
Endometriosis is known to have an impact on fertility and it is common for women affected by endometriosis to require fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), to improve the chance of pregnancy. It has been postulated that long‐term gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy prior to IVF or ICSI can improve pregnancy outcomes. This systematic review supersedes the previous Cochrane Review on this topic (Sallam 2006). 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of long‐term gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy (minimum 3 months) versus no pretreatment or other pretreatment modalities, such as long‐term continuous combined oral contraception (COC) or surgical therapy of endometrioma, before standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women with endometriosis. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases from their inception to 8 January 2019: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL via the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Studies ONLINE (CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We searched trial registries to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We also searched DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), Web of Knowledge, OpenGrey, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), PubMed, Google and reference lists from relevant papers for any other relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving women with surgically diagnosed endometriosis that compared use of any type of GnRH agonist for at least three months before an IVF/ICSI protocol to no pretreatment or other pretreatment modalities, specifically use of long‐term continuous COC (minimum of 6 weeks) or surgical excision of endometrioma within six months prior to standard IVF/ICSI. The primary outcomes were live birth rate and complication rate per woman randomised. 
Data collection and analysis
Two independent review authors assessed studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third review author was consulted, if required. We contacted the study authors, as required. We analysed dichotomous outcomes using Mantel‐Haenszel risk ratios (RRs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and a fixed‐effect model. For small numbers of events, we used a Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI instead. We analysed continuous outcomes using the mean difference (MD) between groups and presented with 95% CIs. We studied heterogeneity of the studies via the I2 statistic. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. 
Main results
We included eight parallel‐design RCTs, involving a total of 640 participants. We did not assess any of the studies as being at low risk of bias across all domains, with the main limitation being lack of blinding. Using GRADE methodology, the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to low quality. 
Long‐term GnRH agonist therapy versus no pretreatment 
We are uncertain whether long‐term GnRH agonist therapy affects the live birth rate (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.87; 1 RCT, n = 147; I2 not calculable; very low‐quality evidence) or the overall complication rate (Peto OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.37; to 4.14; 3 RCTs, n = 318; I2 = 73%; very low‐quality evidence) compared to standard IVF/ICSI. Further, we are uncertain whether this intervention affects the clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.41; 6 RCTs, n = 552, I2 = 66%; very low‐quality evidence), multiple pregnancy rate (Peto OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.56; 2 RCTs, n = 208, I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence), miscarriage rate (Peto OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.00; 2 RCTs, n = 208; I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence), mean number of oocytes (MD 0.72, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.38; 4 RCTs, n = 385; I2 = 81%; very low‐quality evidence) or mean number of embryos (MD ‐0.76, 95% CI ‐1.33 to ‐0.19; 2 RCTs, n = 267; I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). 
Long‐term GnRH agonist therapy versus long‐term continuous COC 
No studies reported on this comparison.
Long‐term GnRH agonist therapy versus surgical therapy of endometrioma 
No studies reported on this comparison.
Authors' conclusions
This review raises important questions regarding the merit of long‐term GnRH agonist therapy compared to no pretreatment prior to standard IVF/ICSI in women with endometriosis. Contrary to previous findings, we are uncertain as to whether long‐term GnRH agonist therapy impacts on the live birth rate or indeed the complication rate compared to standard IVF/ICSI. Further, we are uncertain whether this intervention impacts on the clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, mean number of oocytes and mean number of embryos. In light of the paucity and very low quality of existing data, particularly for the primary outcomes examined, further high‐quality trials are required to definitively determine the impact of long‐term GnRH agonist therapy on IVF/ICSI outcomes, not only compared to no pretreatment, but also compared to other proposed alternatives to endometriosis management.

### A Look at Hormonal Treatment Before IVF for Women with Endometriosis

### Rationale

Many women who have endometriosis find it hard to get pregnant. Endometriosis is a health issue where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows outside of it. This can cause pain and make it hard for a woman to get pregnant. Because of this, many women with endometriosis need help to get pregnant. This help often comes from treatments like IVF. IVF is when an egg and sperm are joined outside the body.

Some doctors thought that giving women a special medicine for a few months before IVF could help them get pregnant. This medicine is called a GnRH agonist. It works by changing hormones in the body. We wanted to see if this medicine really helped women with endometriosis who were having IVF. We also wanted to see if it was safe.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies that had already been done. It aimed to answer the question: Does long-term GnRH agonist medicine help women with endometriosis get pregnant with IVF?

We looked for studies that included women who had endometriosis that was found with surgery. These women were having IVF. The studies compared women who took GnRH agonist medicine for at least three months before IVF to women who did not. Some studies also looked at women who took birth control pills or had surgery for their endometriosis before IVF.

We wanted to know two main things. First, how many women had a baby born alive. Second, how many women had bad effects from the medicine.

### Results

We found eight studies that looked at 640 women in total. We looked at all the information from these studies very carefully. However, the quality of these studies was not very high. This means it was hard to be sure about some of the results.

When we looked at women who took GnRH agonist medicine versus no medicine, we found it hard to say if it helped them have a baby. We were not sure if it changed the number of babies born alive. We also were not sure if it caused more bad effects.

We also looked at other things. We were not sure if the medicine changed the chance of getting pregnant. We also were not sure if it changed the chance of having twins or more babies. It was also unclear if it changed the chance of a miscarriage. A miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends too early. We also could not say for sure if it changed the number of eggs or embryos that were found.

None of the studies compared GnRH agonist medicine to taking birth control pills. No studies compared GnRH agonist medicine to having surgery for endometriosis.

In the end, we are not sure if taking GnRH agonist medicine before IVF helps women with endometriosis. We need more and better studies to find a clear answer. This will help doctors know the best way to help women with endometriosis get pregnant.","Long‐term pituitary down‐regulation before in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for women with endometriosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the efficacy and safety of treating women with known endometriosis (a disease characterised by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the cavity of the womb) with gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist medication for a period of three to six months prior to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We aimed to compare this intervention to no treatment prior to IVF/ICSI, pretreatment with long‐term continuous combined oral contraception (COC) or surgical treatment to remove endometriomas (cysts forming in the ovaries as a consequence of endometriosis). 
Background 
Many women affected by endometriosis suffer with infertility and may, as a result, seek IVF/ICSI treatment. IVF/ICSI is known to be less successful in women with endometriosis and a variety of interventions prior to IVF/ICSI have been proposed to try and improve outcomes. These include long‐term GnRH agonist therapy, long‐term continuous COC therapy or surgery to remove endometriomas. 
Study characteristics 
We found eight randomised controlled trials comparing long‐term GnRH agonist therapy with no pretreatment including a total of 640 women with endometriosis prior to IVF/ICSI. The evidence is current to January 2019. 
Key results 
Compared to no pretreatment, we are uncertain whether long‐term GnRH agonist therapy prior to IVF/ICSI in women with endometriosis affects the live birth rate. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth rate is assumed to be 36% with no pretreatment, the chance following long‐term GnRH agonist therapy would be between 9% and 31%. We are also uncertain whether this intervention affects complication rate, clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, mean number of oocytes and mean number of embryos. No studies compared long‐term GnRH agonist therapy to long‐term continuous COC therapy or surgery to remove endometriomas. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low quality. The main limitations in the evidence were lack of blinding (the process where the women participating in the trial, as well as the research staff, are not aware of the intervention used), inconsistency (differences between different studies) and imprecision (random error and small size of each study).

Previous research on animal and physiological models suggests that antioxidant supplements have beneficial effects that may prolong life. Some observational studies also suggest that antioxidant supplements may prolong life, whereas other observational studies demonstrate neutral or harmful effects. Our Cochrane review from 2008 demonstrated that antioxidant supplements seem to increase mortality. This review is now updated. 
The present systematic review included 78 randomised clinical trials. In total, 296,707 participants were randomised to antioxidant supplements (beta‐carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium) versus placebo or no intervention. Twenty‐six trials included 215,900 healthy participants. Fifty‐two trials included 80,807 participants with various diseases in a stable phase (including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurological, ocular, dermatological, rheumatoid, renal, endocrinological, or unspecified diseases). A total of 21,484 of 183,749 participants (11.7%) randomised to antioxidant supplements and 11,479 of 112,958 participants (10.2%) randomised to placebo or no intervention died. The trials appeared to have enough statistical similarity that they could be combined. When all of the trials were combined, antioxidants may or may not have increased mortality depending on which statistical combination method was employed; the analysis that is typically used when similarity is present demonstrated that antioxidant use did slightly increase mortality (that is, the patients consuming the antioxidants were 1.03 times as likely to die as were the controls). When analyses were done to identify factors that were associated with this finding, the two factors identified were better methodology to prevent bias from being a factor in the trial (trials with ‘low risk of bias’) and the use of vitamin A. In fact, when the trials with low risks of bias were considered separately, the increased mortality was even more pronounced (1.04 times as likely to die as were the controls). The potential damage from vitamin A disappeared when only the low risks of bias trials were considered. The increased risk of mortality was associated with beta‐carotene and possibly vitamin E and vitamin A, but was not associated with the use of vitamin C or selenium. The current evidence does not support the use of antioxidant supplements in the general population or in patients with various diseases. 
","Here's a Plain Language Summary based on the provided abstract:

## Plain Title
Do Vitamin Pills Help You Live Longer?

## Rationale
People often wonder if taking vitamin pills can help them live a longer, healthier life. These pills are called ""antioxidant supplements."" Some past studies in animals and even some studies in people suggested that these supplements might be helpful. They might protect our bodies and help us live longer.

However, other studies gave mixed signals. Some showed no help, and some even suggested they could be harmful. We did a big review of studies back in 2008. That review found that antioxidant supplements might actually make people die sooner. We wanted to look at this again with even more recent studies. We wanted to see if our findings were still the same. This study is important because many people take these supplements hoping to improve their health.

## Trial Design
How did we study this? We looked at many research studies that were already done. These studies were called ""randomized clinical trials."" This means people were put into groups by chance. One group took the antioxidant pills. The other group took a dummy pill (placebo) or nothing at all.

We gathered results from 78 of these studies. A total of 296,707 people were in these studies. They took different antioxidant pills like beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium. About 215,900 of these people were healthy. The other 80,807 people had different health problems. These problems included issues with their stomach, heart, brain, eyes, skin, joints, kidneys, or hormones. These people were in a stable state with their health issues. We looked at how many people died in each group over the study time. We looked to see if the antioxidant pills made a difference.

## Results
What did our study find? We looked at almost 300,000 people. About 21,484 people who took antioxidant pills died. This was about 1 in 9 people. In the group who took dummy pills or nothing, about 11,479 people died. This was about 1 in 10 people.

When we put all the study results together, we found a small but important difference. People who took antioxidant pills were a little more likely to die. They were 1.03 times more likely to die than those who did not take the pills. This means if 100 people not taking pills died, 103 people taking pills died.

We also looked closely at the studies. We found that studies done in a very careful way showed this risk even more clearly. In these studies, people taking antioxidant pills were 1.04 times more likely to die. The pills linked to this higher risk were beta-carotene, and possibly vitamin E and vitamin A. We did not see this higher risk with vitamin C or selenium.

So, what does this mean? Our findings suggest that taking antioxidant supplements does not help people live longer. In fact, some of them might even slightly increase the risk of dying sooner. Because of this, we cannot say that people should take these supplements. This is true for healthy people and for people with different health problems.","Antioxidant supplements for prevention of mortality in healthy participants and patients with various diseases

10.1002-14651858.CD013860.pub2,"Background
Physicians often prescribe opioids for pain in the acute care setting. Nausea and vomiting are well‐described adverse events, occurring in over one‐third of patients. Prophylactic antiemetics may be one option to reduce opioid‐associated nausea and vomiting. However, these medications also have their own adverse effects, so it is important to understand their efficacy and safety prior to routine use. This is a review of randomized controlled trials comparing prophylactic antiemetics versus placebo or standard care for preventing opioid‐associated nausea and vomiting. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of prophylactic antiemetics for nausea and vomiting in adults (aged 16 years or older) receiving intravenous opioids in the acute care setting. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID) from inception to January 2022, and Google Scholar (17 January 2022). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and screened reference lists. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials of prophylactic antiemetics versus placebo or standard care in adults prior to receiving an intravenous opioid. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (MG, JNC) independently determined the eligibility of each study according to the inclusion criteria. Two review authors (MG, GDP) then independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and determined the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were the occurrence of nausea, vomiting, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included nausea severity, number of vomiting episodes, and number of participants requiring antiemetic rescue therapy. We presented outcomes as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data (e.g. presence of vomiting, presence of nausea, number of participants requiring rescue medication, adverse events) and mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference for continuous data (e.g. number of vomiting episodes, nausea severity) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We included three studies involving 527 participants (187 women and 340 men) with a mean age of 42 years.  All studies used intravenous metoclopramide (10 mg) as the intervention and a placebo for the comparator. No studies assessed any other antiemetic or compared the intervention to standard care. 
Compared to placebo, metoclopramide did not reduce vomiting (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.26 to 5.32; low‐certainty evidence) or nausea (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.15 to 2.03; low‐certainty evidence) and there was no difference in adverse events (RR 2.34, 95% CI 0.47 to 11.61; low‐certainty evidence).  No data were available regarding the number of vomiting episodes. Metoclopramide did reduce the severity of nausea compared with placebo (MD −0.49, 95% CI −0.75 to −0.23; low‐certainty evidence) but did not reduce the need for rescue medication (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.17 to 20.16; low‐certainty evidence).  
Two studies were at unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation, one for blinding of outcome assessors, one for incomplete outcome data, and two for selective reporting. The studies were at low risk of bias for all remaining components. 
Authors' conclusions
There was no evidence that prophylactic metoclopramide affected the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for rescue medication when provided prior to intravenous opioids in the acute care setting. There was a clinically insignificant difference in nausea severity when comparing prophylactic metoclopramide with placebo. Overall, the evidence was of low certainty. Future research could better delineate the effects of prophylactic antiemetics on specific populations, and new studies are needed to evaluate the use of other prophylactic antiemetic agents, for which there were no data. 
","**1. Plain Title: Study on Preventing Sickness from Pain Medicine**

**2. Rationale**

Many people get strong pain medicine in the hospital. This medicine is called an opioid. Opioids are good for pain. But they can make people feel very sick to their stomach. They can also make people throw up. This happens to more than one out of three patients.

Feeling sick and throwing up is a big problem. It makes people feel worse. It can make their hospital stay harder. Doctors want to help prevent this sickness. One idea is to give medicine before the opioid. This medicine is called an antiemetic. It helps stop nausea and throwing up.

But antiemetic medicines can also have problems. They can have their own side effects. So, it is important to know if they really work. It is also key to know if they are safe. This study looked at past research. We wanted to see if giving antiemetics early helps. We wanted to know if they stop sickness from opioids.

**3. Trial Design**

This study looked at other studies. We searched for all good research. These were studies where people got a pain medicine. They were also given a drug to prevent sickness. Or they got a dummy pill with no medicine.

We looked for studies that used IV opioids. This means the medicine goes right into a vein. Patients in these studies were age 16 or older. We looked for studies up until early 2022. Two doctors checked all the studies. They made sure the studies were right for our review.

They pulled out all the key facts. They looked at how well the antiemetic worked. They also checked for any bad side effects. We focused on if people felt sick. We also looked at if people threw up. We checked if people needed more medicine to stop sickness. We looked at how bad the sickness was.

We found three studies to include. These studies had a total of 527 people. There were 187 women and 340 men. Their average age was 42 years old. All these studies used one specific medicine. It was called metoclopramide. People got 10 mg of this medicine through their vein. They got it before the opioid.

The studies compared metoclopramide to a dummy pill. We found that metoclopramide did not stop throwing up. It also did not stop feeling sick. There was no real change in side effects either. These results were not very certain. We could not tell how many times people threw up. That data was not there.

Metoclopramide did make the feeling of sickness a little less bad. But this small change was not very important for patients. It did not really help them feel much better. Metoclopramide also did not stop people from needing more medicine. They still needed extra medicine to stop sickness.

The studies we looked at were mostly good. But some parts were unclear. This means we are not totally sure about all the results. Overall, the proof for these findings is low.

So, we found no clear proof. Giving metoclopramide early did not stop throwing up. It did not stop feeling sick. It also did not stop the need for more medicine. The change in how bad sickness felt was tiny. It was not a big help to patients.

More research is needed. We need to look at other antiemetic drugs. We also need to study specific groups of patients. This will help us learn more about preventing sickness from pain medicine.","Prophylactic antiemetics for adults receiving intravenous opioids in the acute care setting 
Key messages 
Metoclopramide did not reduce the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for rescue medication when provided prior to intravenous opioids in the emergency department.  
In terms of the severity of nausea, metoclopramide did not help patients any more than placebo (sham treatment). 
What is opioid‐induced emesis? 
Physicians often give patients opioids for pain in emergency departments, but over a third experience the side effects of nausea and vomiting (emesis). Some experts have suggested that taking antiemetics before receiving the opioid (that is, as a prophylactic) could prevent these symptoms from occurring. However, these medications have their own side effects, so it is important to understand whether they are effective and safe before routinely using them. 
What did we want to find out? 
This review looks at whether taking antiemetics (medications to treat or prevent nausea and vomiting) before receiving an intravenous opioid reduces the risk of experiencing nausea and vomiting as side effects. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies involving adults (aged 16 years or older) who received prophylactic antiemetics compared with either placebo or standard care before receiving an intravenous opioid. 
What did we find? 
We found three studies with a total of 527 patients. All the studies used metoclopramide as the antiemetic. Compared with placebo, metoclopramide did not reduce the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for an antiemetic later on. There was also no difference in side effects between those who received antiemetics and those who did not. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The studies investigated only one medication (metoclopramide) and did not report all the information we were interested in. The intervention probably makes little or no difference in terms of experiencing nausea or vomiting. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
This evidence is up to date to 17 January 2022.

## Plain Title
Better Check-Ups After Cancer Treatment?

## Rationale
Cancer is a very serious disease. Many people die from it.
After treatment for cancer, people need check-ups.
These check-ups often mean many hospital visits.
Going to the hospital a lot can make people worried.
It also costs a lot of money.
We asked if there was a better way to do check-ups.
Most times, if cancer comes back, people feel symptoms.
So, maybe people could report their own health.
This is called patient-reported outcome measures, or PROMs.
PROMs are when people tell us how they feel.
This might make people feel less stressed.
It might also save money for health care.
We need to know if PROMs help people live longer.
We also need to know if PROMs help people feel better.
We need to know if PROMs make people happier.
This study looked at these questions.

## Trial Design
How is this study designed?
We looked for past studies.
We searched for studies that compared two groups.
One group used PROMs for check-ups.
The other group had usual hospital visits.
We looked for studies that randomly assigned people to groups.
We wanted to find good studies.
These studies would tell us which way is better.
We looked for studies about women.
These women had been treated for cancer.
Specifically, they had cancer in female organs.
We looked at their health and how long they lived.
We looked at how happy they were with their care.
We looked at their overall quality of life.
We looked for studies with strong evidence.

## Results
What were the main results of the study?
We looked at many research papers.
We searched for studies that fit our needs.
Sadly, we did not find any good studies.
There were no studies that compared PROMs to usual check-ups.
This means we do not know the answer yet.
We do not know if PROMs are better.
We do not know if PROMs are worse.
We need new, strong studies.
These studies must compare these two ways of care.
We need studies that are fair and well-done.
These studies will help us find the best way.
The goal is to help women live longer and better.
This research is very important for patient care.
We still need clear answers.","Benefits of patient‐reported measures of health and well‐being versus traditional follow‐up after treatment of gynaecological cancer

10.1002-14651858.CD014328,"Background
Arthroscopic knee surgery remains a common treatment for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, including for degenerative meniscal tears, despite guidelines strongly recommending against its use. This Cochrane Review is an update of a non‐Cochrane systematic review published in 2017. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of arthroscopic surgery, including debridement, partial menisectomy or both, compared with placebo surgery or non‐surgical treatment in people with degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis, degenerative meniscal tears, or both). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers up to 16 April 2021, unrestricted by language. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or trials using quasi‐randomised methods of participant allocation, comparing arthroscopic surgery with placebo surgery or non‐surgical interventions (e.g. exercise, injections, non‐arthroscopic lavage/irrigation, drug therapy, and supplements and complementary therapies) in people with symptomatic degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis or degenerative meniscal tears or both). Major outcomes were pain, function, participant‐reported treatment success, knee‐specific quality of life, serious adverse events, total adverse events and knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of evidence using GRADE. The primary comparison was arthroscopic surgery compared to placebo surgery for outcomes that measured benefits of surgery, but we combined data from all control groups to assess harms and knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy). 
Main results
Sixteen trials (2105 participants) met our inclusion criteria. The average age of participants ranged from 46 to 65 years, and 56% of participants were women. Four trials (380 participants) compared arthroscopic surgery to placebo surgery. For the remaining trials, arthroscopic surgery was compared to exercise (eight trials, 1371 participants), a single intra‐articular glucocorticoid injection (one trial, 120 participants), non‐arthroscopic lavage (one trial, 34 participants), non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (one trial, 80 participants) and weekly hyaluronic acid injections for five weeks (one trial, 120 participants). The majority of trials without a placebo control were susceptible to bias: in particular, selection (56%), performance (75%), detection (75%), attrition (44%) and selective reporting (75%) biases. The placebo‐controlled trials were less susceptible to bias and none were at risk of performance or detection bias. Here we limit reporting to the main comparison, arthroscopic surgery versus placebo surgery. 
High‐certainty evidence indicates arthroscopic surgery leads to little or no difference in pain or function at three months after surgery, moderate‐certainty evidence indicates there is probably little or no improvement in knee‐specific quality of life three months after surgery, and low‐certainty evidence indicates arthroscopic surgery may lead to little or no difference in participant‐reported success at up to five years, compared with placebo surgery. 
Mean post‐operative pain in the placebo group was 40.1 points on a 0 to 100 scale (where lower score indicates less pain) compared to 35.5 points in the arthroscopic surgery group, a difference of 4.6 points better (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 better to 9 better; I2 = 0%; 4 trials, 309 participants). Mean post‐operative function in the placebo group was 75.9 points on a 0 to 100 rating scale (where higher score indicates better function) compared to 76 points in the arthroscopic surgery group, a difference of 0.1 points better (95% CI 3.2 worse to 3.4 better; I2 = 0%; 3 trials, 302 participants). 
Mean post‐operative knee‐specific health‐related quality of life in the placebo group was 69.7 points on a 0 to 100 rating scale (where higher score indicates better quality of life) compared with 75.3 points in the arthroscopic surgery group, a difference of 5.6 points better (95% CI 0.36 better to 10.68 better; I2 = 0%; 2 trials, 188 participants). We downgraded this evidence to moderate certainty as the 95% confidence interval does not rule in or rule out a clinically important change. 
After surgery, 74 out of 100 people reported treatment success with placebo and 82 out of 100 people reported treatment success with arthroscopic surgery at up to five years (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.86; I2 = 53%; 3 trials, 189 participants). We downgraded this evidence to low certainty due to serious indirectness (diversity in definition and timing of outcome measurement) and serious imprecision (small number of events). 
We are less certain if the risk of serious or total adverse events increased with arthroscopic surgery compared to placebo or non‐surgical interventions. Serious adverse events were reported in 6 out of 100 people in the control groups and 8 out of 100 people in the arthroscopy groups from eight trials (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.83; I2 = 47%; 8 trials, 1206 participants). Fifteen out of 100 people reported adverse events with control interventions, and 17 out of 100 people with surgery at up to five years (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.70; I2 = 48%; 9 trials, 1326 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low, downgraded twice due to serious imprecision (small number of events) and possible reporting bias (incomplete reporting of outcome across studies). Serious adverse events included death, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis and deep infection. 
Subsequent knee surgery (replacement or high tibial osteotomy) was reported in 2 out of 100 people in the control groups and 4 out of 100 people in the arthroscopy surgery groups at up to five years in four trials (RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.94 to 7.34; I2 = 11%; 4 trials, 864 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low, downgraded twice due to the small number of events. 
Authors' conclusions
Arthroscopic surgery provides little or no clinically important benefit in pain or function, probably does not provide clinically important benefits in knee‐specific quality of life, and may not improve treatment success compared with a placebo procedure. It may lead to little or no difference, or a slight increase, in serious and total adverse events compared to control, but the evidence is of low certainty. Whether or not arthroscopic surgery results in slightly more subsequent knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy) compared to control remains unresolved.

### Plain Title
Knee Surgery for Arthritis: Does it Help?

### Rationale
Many people get knee pain from a problem called osteoarthritis. This happens when the soft cushion in your knee, called cartilage, wears down. It can make your knee hurt and make it hard to move. Sometimes, a part of the knee called the meniscus gets torn. Doctors often suggest surgery to fix these tears. This surgery is called arthroscopic knee surgery.

But some doctors think this surgery might not always help people with arthritis. This study looked at whether this surgery truly helps or if other treatments are just as good. We wanted to see if the surgery makes pain better or helps people move more easily. We also looked at any bad things that could happen from the surgery.

### Trial Design
This study looked at many past studies. These were studies where people were put into groups by chance. Some had knee surgery. Others had fake surgery or no surgery at all. The fake surgery was like real surgery, but the doctor did not fix anything inside the knee. This helps us see if the surgery itself helps, or if just thinking you had surgery makes you feel better.

The people in these studies had knee pain from arthritis or meniscus tears. Their ages ranged from 46 to 65 years old. More than half of them were women. The studies checked how people felt for up to five years after their treatment.

### Results
We looked at 16 studies with over 2,100 people. We found that knee surgery did not make a big difference in pain or how well people could move. This was true three months after surgery. People who had surgery felt a little less pain, but it was not a big change. Their ability to move their knee was almost the same as those who did not have surgery.

The surgery probably did not make their daily life much better either. After up to five years, about 8 out of 10 people who had surgery said they felt better. But 7 out of 10 people who had fake surgery also said they felt better. This means the surgery might not be much better than just thinking you had it.

Bad things could happen after surgery. For every 100 people, 8 had serious problems after surgery. This was compared to 6 out of 100 people who did not have surgery. These problems included death, blood clots, or serious infections. We are not sure if surgery causes these problems more often.

It is also not clear if surgery leads to more knee replacements later. For every 100 people, 4 who had surgery needed another knee surgery later. This was compared to 2 out of 100 people who did not have surgery. More research is needed to be sure about this.

In short, arthroscopic knee surgery seems to offer little to no real help for pain or how well you can move if you have knee arthritis. It might not make your daily life much better than a fake surgery. It is also not certain if it increases your risk of serious problems or needing more knee surgeries later.","Arthroscopic surgery for degenerative knee disease
Background 
Degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis in the knee which affects the joint lining and menisci) is the most common cause of knee pain, swelling and stiffness in the knee joint which leads to difficulty in walking. The cartilage in the knee joint is damaged, resulting in friction in the joint surfaces and formation of new bone in severe cases. Arthroscopic knee surgery removes damaged cartilage and loose tissue and smooths the knee joint surfaces. 
Study characteristics 
We included 16 randomised trials (2105 participants) published up to 16 April 2021. Trials were conducted in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Pakistan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Netherlands and USA. 
Overall, 56% of participants were women. The average age of participants ranged from 46 to 65 years and the average duration of symptoms ranged from 1.6 months to 4.4 years. Of the nine trials reporting their funding source, none received funding from industry. The other seven trials did not report any funding source. 
We limit reporting to the main comparison, arthroscopic surgery versus placebo (dummy or sham) surgery. 
Key results 
Compared with placebo surgery, arthroscopic surgery had little benefit:
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improvement in pain was 4.6 points better (0.02 better to 9 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative pain as 35.5 points.
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative pain as 40.1 points.
Knee function (higher scores mean better function) 
Improvement in knee function was 0.1 points better (3.2 worse to 3.4 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative knee function as 76.0 points. 
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative knee function as 75.9 points. 
Knee‐specific quality of life (higher scores mean better quality of life) 
Improvement in knee‐specific quality of life was 5.6 points better (0.4 better to 10.7 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative quality of life as 75.3 points. 
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative quality of life as 69.7 points. 
Treatment success (rated by participants) 
8% more people rated their treatment a success (25% fewer to 63% more), or 8 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 82 out of 100 people reported treatment success with arthroscopic surgery.
• 74 out of 100 people reported treatment success with placebo surgery.
Serious adverse events 
2% more people (2% fewer to 10% more) had serious adverse events, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 8 out of 100 people reported serious adverse events with arthroscopic surgery.
• 6 out of 100 people reported serious adverse events with placebo surgery.
Total adverse events 
2% more people (3% fewer to 11% more), had adverse events, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 17 out of 100 people reported adverse events with arthroscopic surgery.
• 15 out of 100 people reported adverse events with placebo surgery.
Subsequent knee surgery 
2% more people (0.1% fewer to 9% more), had subsequent knee surgery, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years. 
• 4 out of 100 people had knee replacement or osteotomy (knee surgery that reshapes bone) with arthroscopic surgery. 
• 2 out of 100 people had knee replacement or osteotomy with placebo surgery.
Certainty of the evidence 
We are confident that knee arthroscopy does not provide any clinically important benefits in terms of pain and function. We are moderately confident that knee arthroscopy probably does not provide any clinically important benefits in knee‐specific quality of life over a placebo procedure. Knee arthroscopy may not increase participant‐reported success compared with placebo. We have little confidence in the evidence because of differences across trials in reporting success and the small number of events. We are less certain of the risk of serious and total adverse events in arthroscopy versus placebo surgery: the evidence was uncertain because of the small number of events and incomplete reporting of study information. 
Adverse events associated with surgery include total knee replacement, osteotomy, repeat arthroscopy, arthroscopy in opposite knee, cutaneous nerve lesion (damage to nerves in the skin), deep or superficial infection, general knee pain, swelling, instability, stiffness or decreased range of motion in the affected or opposite knee, haemarthrosis (bleeding into the knee joint), death, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), hypoxaemia (decreased oxygen in the blood), deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the deep veins), tendonitis (inflammation of tendons), pain from fall or other trauma, rupture of a Baker's cyst (a fluid‐filled sac behind the knee), and back or hip or foot pain. 
Arthroscopic surgery may or may not lead to slightly more subsequent knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy) than the placebo procedure.

Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure injuries, pressure sores and bed sores) are localised injuries to the skin or underlying soft tissue, or both, caused by unrelieved pressure, shear or friction. Specific kinds of beds, overlays and mattresses are widely used with the aim of preventing and treating pressure ulcers. 
Objectives
To summarise evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assess the effects of beds, overlays and mattresses on reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers and on increasing pressure ulcer healing in any setting and population. 
To assess the relative effects of different types of beds, overlays and mattresses for reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers and increasing pressure ulcer healing in any setting and population. 
To cumulatively rank the different treatment options of beds, overlays and mattresses in order of their effectiveness in pressure ulcer prevention and treatment. 
Methods
In July 2020, we searched the Cochrane Library. Cochrane Reviews reporting the effectiveness of beds, mattresses or overlays for preventing or treating pressure ulcers were eligible for inclusion in this overview. Two review authors independently screened search results and undertook data extraction and risk of bias assessment using the ROBIS tool. We summarised the reported evidence in an overview of reviews. Where possible, we included the randomised controlled trials from each included review in network meta‐analyses. We assessed the relative effectiveness of beds, overlays and mattresses for preventing or treating pressure ulcers and their probabilities of being, comparably, the most effective treatment. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We include six Cochrane Reviews in this overview of reviews, all at low or unclear risk of bias. 
Pressure ulcer prevention: four reviews (of 68 studies with 18,174 participants) report direct evidence for 27 pairwise comparisons between 12 types of support surface on the following outcomes: pressure ulcer incidence, time to pressure ulcer incidence, patient comfort response, adverse event rates, health‐related quality of life, and cost‐effectiveness. Here we focus on outcomes with some evidence at a minimum of low certainty. 
(1) Pressure ulcer incidence: our overview includes direct evidence for 27 comparisons that mostly (19/27) have very low‐certainty evidence concerning reduction of pressure ulcer risk. We included 40 studies (12,517 participants; 1298 participants with new ulcers) in a network meta‐analysis involving 13 types of intervention. Data informing the network are sparse and this, together with the high risk of bias in most studies informing the network, means most network contrasts (64/78) yield evidence of very low certainty. There is low‐certainty evidence that, compared with foam surfaces (reference treatment), reactive air surfaces (e.g. static air overlays) (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.75), alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (e.g. alternating pressure air mattresses, large‐celled ripple mattresses) (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.93), and reactive gel surfaces (e.g. gel pads used on operating tables) (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.01) may reduce pressure ulcer incidence. The ranking of treatments in terms of effectiveness is also of very low certainty for all interventions. It is unclear which treatment is best for preventing ulceration. 
(2) Time to pressure ulcer incidence: four reviews had direct evidence on this outcome for seven comparisons. We included 10 studies (7211 participants; 699 participants with new ulcers) evaluating six interventions in a network meta‐analysis. Again, data from most network contrasts (13/15) are of very low certainty. There is low‐certainty evidence that, compared with foam surfaces (reference treatment), reactive air surfaces may reduce the hazard of developing new pressure ulcers (hazard ratio (HR) 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.05). The ranking of all support surfaces for preventing pressure ulcers in terms of time to healing is uncertain. 
(3) Cost‐effectiveness: this overview includes direct evidence for three comparisons. For preventing pressure ulcers, alternating pressure air surfaces are probably more cost‐effective than foam surfaces (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Pressure ulcer treatment: two reviews (of 12 studies with 972 participants) report direct evidence for five comparisons on: complete pressure ulcer healing, time to complete pressure ulcer healing, patient comfort response, adverse event rates, and cost‐effectiveness. Here we focus on outcomes with some evidence at a minimum of low certainty. 
(1) Complete pressure ulcer healing: our overview includes direct evidence for five comparisons. There is uncertainty about the relative effects of beds, overlays and mattresses on ulcer healing. The corresponding network meta‐analysis (with four studies, 397 participants) had only three direct contrasts and a total of six network contrasts. Again, most network contrasts (5/6) have very low‐certainty evidence. There was low‐certainty evidence that more people with pressure ulcers may heal completely using reactive air surfaces than using foam surfaces (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.80). We are uncertain which surfaces have the highest probability of being the most effective (all very low‐certainty evidence). 
(2) Time to complete pressure ulcer healing: this overview includes direct evidence for one comparison: people using reactive air surfaces may be more likely to have healed pressure ulcers compared with those using foam surfaces in long‐term care settings (HR 2.66, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.17; low‐certainty evidence). 
(3) Cost‐effectiveness: this overview includes direct evidence for one comparison: compared with foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces may cost an extra 26 US dollars for every ulcer‐free day in the first year of use in long‐term care settings (low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Compared with foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk and may increase complete ulcer healing. Compared with foam surfaces, alternating pressure air surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk and are probably more cost‐effective in preventing pressure ulcers. Compared with foam surfaces, reactive gel surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk, particularly for people in operating rooms and long‐term care settings. There are uncertainties for the relative effectiveness of other support surfaces for preventing and treating pressure ulcers, and their efficacy ranking. 
More high‐quality research is required; for example, for the comparison of reactive air surfaces with alternating pressure air surfaces. Future studies should consider time‐to‐event outcomes and be designed to minimise any risk of bias.

### Plain Title
Special Beds Help Prevent and Heal Bed Sores

### Rationale
Bed sores are also called pressure ulcers. They are skin injuries. They happen when pressure, rubbing, or sliding on the skin does not stop. These sores can be painful. They can make people very sick. They are a big problem for many patients.

Doctors and nurses use special beds and mattresses. They hope these tools stop bed sores from forming. They also hope these tools help sores heal faster.

This study looked at past research. It wanted to see which beds work best. It wanted to know if they truly help prevent and treat bed sores.

### Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies. It gathered all the facts from them. These past studies were called ""Cochrane Reviews."" These reviews looked at how well beds and mattresses work. They focused on stopping or healing bed sores.

Two people checked all the studies. They made sure the facts were right. They also checked for any problems in how the studies were done.

We looked at how good these beds were. We checked if they stopped new sores. We also checked if they made old sores heal. We tried to find which beds were the best. We wanted to see how sure we could be about the results.

### Results
We looked at six main studies. These studies were well-done.

**For Preventing Bed Sores:**

*   **Stopping new sores:** We found that certain air beds might help. These are called ""reactive air surfaces"" and ""alternating pressure air surfaces."" Gel pads also might help. They seemed better than regular foam beds. But we are not very sure about this. More studies are needed to be truly certain. It is still hard to say which bed is the very best.
*   **How fast sores appear:** Reactive air beds might slow down how quickly new sores appear. This means people might get sores later, or not at all. But again, we are not very sure.
*   **Cost:** Alternating pressure air beds might save money. They may cost less in the long run than foam beds when preventing sores.

**For Treating Bed Sores:**

*   **Healing sores:** Reactive air beds might help sores heal completely. More people on these beds might get better. They seemed better than foam beds for healing. But we are not very sure about this.
*   **Healing time:** Reactive air beds might make sores heal faster. People in long-term care may heal sooner with these beds.
*   **Cost:** Reactive air beds might cost more at first. They may add about $26 per day in the first year. This is for each day a person does not have a sore. This is compared to foam beds.

**What we learned:**
Reactive air beds might lower the chance of getting bed sores. They also might help sores heal. Alternating pressure air beds might also lower the chance of sores. They may also be a good value for the money. Gel pads might also reduce sore risk. This is true for people having surgery or in long-term care.

We need more good studies. We need to compare reactive air beds with alternating pressure air beds more closely. Future studies should be very careful. They should look at how long it takes for things to happen. This will help us be more sure about the best beds to use.","What are the benefits and risks of beds, mattresses and overlays for preventing and treating pressure ulcers? 
The overview presents a lot of data from randomised controlled trials and contains an advanced analysis called 'network meta‐analysis'.

Key messages 
Static air mattresses or overlays, alternating pressure air mattresses or overlays, and gel pads used on operating tables may be better than foam mattresses for preventing pressure ulcers. 
Compared with foam mattresses, alternating pressure air mattresses or overlays probably result in health benefits that outweigh their costs in preventing pressure ulcers. 
Static air mattresses or overlays may be better than foam mattresses for ulcer healing, but may cost more. 
It is unclear what the best treatment is for either preventing or treating pressure ulcers; what the effects of these treatment options are on people’s comfort and quality of life; and whether or not there are any unwanted effects. 
What are pressure ulcers? 
Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores or bed sores) are wounds to the skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure or rubbing. People who have mobility problems or who lie in bed for long periods are at risk of developing pressure ulcers. 
What did we want to find out? 
There are many types of beds, mattresses and overlays specifically designed for people with pressure ulcers. These can be made from a range of materials (such as foam, air cells and gel pads) and are divided into two groups: 
‐ reactive (static) surfaces that apply a constant pressure to the skin; and
‐ active (alternating pressure) surfaces that regularly redistribute the pressure under the body. 
We wanted to find out if different types of reactive and active surfaces:
‐ prevent pressure ulcers;
‐ help ulcers to heal;
‐ are comfortable and improve people’s quality of life;
‐ have health benefits that outweigh their costs; and
‐ have any unwanted effects.
We also wanted to find out what the best treatment options are for either preventing or healing pressure ulcers. 
What did we do? 
We searched for Cochrane Reviews that summarised the results of all available carefully designed studies (controlled trials) evaluating different beds, mattresses and overlays in preventing and treating pressure ulcers. A Cochrane Review provides a high level of evidence on the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. We summarised the results of these reviews in a single document (called an overview of reviews). 
We also collected studies included in these reviews and compared all available treatments at the same time in a single analysis (called network meta‐analysis). We then summarised these results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
Effects in preventing pressure ulcers  
We found four reviews on the use of beds, mattresses and overlays for preventing pressure ulcers. From these, we included 40 studies (12,517 people) in a network meta‐analysis evaluating reduction of pressure ulcer risk. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that static (reactive) air overlays, alternating pressure air mattresses, and (reactive) gel pads used on operating tables may reduce pressure ulcer risk compared with foam mattresses. 
We also included 10 studies (7211 people) in a network meta‐analysis evaluating the time taken for new ulcers to develop. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that reactive air surfaces may reduce the chances of developing new ulcers compared with foam surfaces. 
Effects in treating pressure ulcers  
We found two reviews on pressure ulcer healing. From these, we included four studies (397 people) in a network meta‐analysis. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that more people with ulcers may heal completely using reactive air surfaces than foam surfaces. 
The overview evidence suggests that, if the time needed to completely heal an ulcer is looked at, reactive air surfaces may improve the chances of pressure ulcers healing when compared with foam mattresses. 
However, it is unclear which treatment is best for either preventing or treating pressure ulcers. 
Other effects in preventing and treating pressure ulcers  
The overview evidence suggests that:
‐ compared with foam mattresses, alternating pressure air surfaces probably result in health benefits that outweigh their costs in preventing pressure ulcers; 
‐ reactive air‐filled surfaces may cost more than foam mattresses in healing ulcers; and 
‐ the other benefits and risks of these beds, mattresses and mattress overlays are unclear. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Although the reviews we found used reliable methods, most of the studies in them were small and used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence in this overview is current to July 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013829.pub2,"Background
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer‐related death in the world, however lung cancer screening has not been implemented in most countries at a population level. A previous Cochrane Review found limited evidence for the effectiveness of lung cancer screening with chest radiography (CXR) or sputum cytology in reducing lung cancer‐related mortality, however there has been increasing evidence supporting screening with low‐dose computed tomography (LDCT).  
Objectives
To determine whether screening for lung cancer using LDCT of the chest reduces lung cancer‐related mortality and to evaluate the possible harms of LDCT screening. 
Search methods
We performed the search in collaboration with the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group and included the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library, current issue), MEDLINE (accessed via PubMed) and Embase in our search. We also searched the clinical trial registries to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We did not impose any restriction on language of publication. The search was performed up to 31 July 2021.  
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lung cancer screening using LDCT and reporting mortality or harm outcomes.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors were involved in independently assessing trials for eligibility, extraction of trial data and characteristics, and assessing risk of bias of the included trials using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Primary outcomes were lung cancer‐related mortality and harms of screening. We performed a meta‐analysis, where appropriate, for all outcomes using a random‐effects model. We only included trials in the analysis of mortality outcomes if they had at least 5 years of follow‐up. We reported risk ratios (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used the I2 statistic to investigate heterogeneity.  
Main results
We included 11 trials in this review with a total of 94,445 participants. Trials were conducted in Europe and the USA in people aged 40 years or older, with most trials having an entry requirement of ≥ 20 pack‐year smoking history (e.g. 1 pack of cigarettes/day for 20 years or 2 packs/day for 10 years etc.). One trial included male participants only. Eight trials were phase three RCTs, with two feasibility RCTs and one pilot RCT. Seven of the included trials had no screening as a comparison, and four trials had CXR screening as a comparator. Screening frequency included annual, biennial and incrementing intervals. The duration of screening ranged from 1 year to 10 years. Mortality follow‐up was from 5 years to approximately 12 years.  
None of the included trials were at low risk of bias across all domains. The certainty of evidence was moderate to low across different outcomes, as assessed by GRADE. 
In the meta‐analysis of trials assessing lung cancer‐related mortality, we included eight trials (91,122 participants), and there was a reduction in mortality of 21% with LDCT screening compared to control groups of no screening or CXR screening (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87; 8 trials, 91,122 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were probably no differences in subgroups for analyses by control type, sex, geographical region, and nodule management algorithm. Females appeared to have a larger lung cancer‐related mortality benefit compared to males with LDCT screening. There was also a reduction in all‐cause mortality (including lung cancer‐related) of 5% (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.99; 8 trials, 91,107 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Invasive tests occurred more frequently in the LDCT group (RR 2.60, 95% CI 2.41 to 2.80; 3 trials, 60,003 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, analysis of 60‐day postoperative mortality was not significant between groups (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.94; 2 trials, 409 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
False‐positive results and recall rates were higher with LDCT screening compared to screening with CXR, however there was low‐certainty evidence in the meta‐analyses due to heterogeneity and risk of bias concerns. Estimated overdiagnosis with LDCT screening was 18%, however the 95% CI was 0 to 36% (risk difference (RD) 0.18, 95% CI ‐0.00 to 0.36; 5 trials, 28,656 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Four trials compared different aspects of health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) using various measures. Anxiety was pooled from three trials, with participants in LDCT screening reporting lower anxiety scores than in the control group (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.43, 95% CI ‐0.59 to ‐0.27; 3 trials, 8153 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
There were insufficient data to comment on the impact of LDCT screening on smoking behaviour.  
Authors' conclusions
The current evidence supports a reduction in lung cancer‐related mortality with the use of LDCT for lung cancer screening in high‐risk populations (those over the age of 40 with a significant smoking exposure). However, there are limited data on harms and further trials are required to determine participant selection and optimal frequency and duration of screening, with potential for significant overdiagnosis of lung cancer. Trials are ongoing for lung cancer screening in non‐smokers.  
","Here is a Plain Language Summary of the study:

### Plain Title
Checking for Lung Cancer with Special X-rays Can Save Lives

### Rationale
Lung cancer is a very serious disease. It kills more people than any other cancer in the world. Often, people do not find out they have it until it is too late. This makes it hard to treat.

For a long time, doctors used chest X-rays to look for lung cancer. They also checked spit samples. But these methods did not work well enough to save many lives.

Now, there is a new way to look for lung cancer. It uses a special type of X-ray called a low-dose CT scan (LDCT). This scan takes very detailed pictures of the lungs. Doctors think this scan might help find lung cancer earlier. Finding cancer early can make it easier to treat. This study wanted to see if LDCT scans truly reduce deaths from lung cancer. It also looked at any possible problems from these scans.

### Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies. These studies were called randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This is the best type of study to see if a treatment works.

The studies included 94,445 people in total. They took place in Europe and the USA. All people were 40 years old or older. Most of them had a history of heavy smoking. For example, they smoked one pack of cigarettes a day for 20 years. One study only looked at men.

In these studies, some people had LDCT scans. Others had no screening or had regular chest X-rays. The scans happened at different times. Some people had them every year. Others had them every two years. Some studies scanned for 1 year. Others scanned for up to 10 years. Doctors followed the people for 5 to 12 years. They watched to see if they got lung cancer and how long they lived.

### Results
The main results showed that LDCT scans helped save lives.
*   People who had LDCT scans had a 21% lower chance of dying from lung cancer. This was compared to those who did not get screened or had chest X-rays.
*   Overall, there was a 5% lower chance of dying from any cause (not just lung cancer) for those who had LDCT scans.
*   Women seemed to benefit even more from LDCT scans than men.

There were some downsides to LDCT scans.
*   People who had LDCT scans were more likely to have extra tests. These tests involved going into the body. However, these tests did not lead to more deaths from surgery.
*   LDCT scans also showed more false alarms. This means the scan looked like cancer, but it was not. These false alarms can cause worry.
*   Sometimes, LDCT scans found very slow-growing cancers. These cancers might never have caused problems. This is called overdiagnosis. This happened in about 18 out of 100 cases.

The study also found that people who had LDCT scans felt less anxious. This was compared to those who did not get screened.

In conclusion, this study shows that LDCT scans can lower the risk of dying from lung cancer. This is especially true for people who have a high risk, like older smokers. However, doctors still need to learn more. They need to figure out who should get screened and how often. They also need to understand the problems of false alarms and overdiagnosis better.","Impact of computed tomography (CT) on lung cancer screening
Background 
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer‐related death worldwide. Lung cancer survival is significantly dependent on when a person is diagnosed with the disease. It is essential to detect the disease as early as possible by radiography (chest x‐ray) or by computed tomography (CT) scan, which is a more detailed type of radiography where multiple images of the lung are taken. The aim of this review was to gather information on the use of CT scan to detect lung cancer earlier and to find out if early detection of lung cancer reduces death from lung cancer. We also evaluated potential harms that can occur from using CT to screen for lung cancer, such as additional investigations and their related complications. 
Description of included trials 
The evidence is current to 31 July 2021. We included 11 trials, with a total of 94,445 participants. The trials came from the USA and Europe. The earliest trial started in 1991, and the most recent started in 2011. The participants were adults over the age of 40. The frequency of screening with CT ranged from yearly to more than 2.5 years. 
Key findings 
Eight of the trials (91,122 participants) were included in the main outcome analysis of lung cancer‐related mortality. In people over 40 years with significant smoking exposure, CT screening reduced deaths from lung cancer by 21%, with 226 people needing to undergo screening to prevent one death from lung cancer. We also found that deaths from any cause (including lung cancer) were less with CT screening. However, the effect was much lower (only 5% reduction in risk). Lung cancer was detected more frequently in the group of people who had CT screening compared with no screening. However, CT scans can induce false‐positive scans (a test that is positive or indeterminate for lung cancer, when the person does not actually have lung cancer). We found that false‐positive results were more common among people who were screened with CT than chest x‐ray. Because of that, those that underwent CT screening had more tests to investigate both cancer and non‐cancer‐related diseases. Screening also implies a risk of detecting lung cancers that may have never progressed to cause harm to the person (this is referred to as overdiagnosis). The risk of lung cancer overdiagnosis with CT screening was estimated to be 18%. 
The trials were too different or did not provide enough information to look at the impact of screening on stopping smoking or quality of life. There was some evidence to suggest there were no long‐term psychological harms from screening, with some people in the CT screening group feeling less anxious compared to the control groups who were not offered screening. 
Certainty of evidence 
The overall certainty of evidence was moderate when it came to outcomes regarding death, with moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence for other outcomes. The certainty rating for outcomes reflects the authors' confidence and certainty in the outcome being correct.

Relapse (the re‐emergence of depressive symptoms after some level of improvement but preceding recovery) and recurrence (onset of a new depressive episode after recovery) are common in depression, lead to worse outcomes and quality of life for patients and exert a high economic cost on society. Outcomes can be predicted by using multivariable prognostic models, which use information about several predictors to produce an individualised risk estimate. The ability to accurately predict relapse or recurrence while patients are well (in remission) would allow the identification of high‐risk individuals and may improve overall treatment outcomes for patients by enabling more efficient allocation of interventions to prevent relapse and recurrence. 
Objectives
To summarise the predictive performance of prognostic models developed to predict the risk of relapse, recurrence, sustained remission or recovery in adults with major depressive disorder who meet criteria for remission or recovery. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (current issue); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 onwards); Ovid Embase (1980 onwards); Ovid PsycINFO (1806 onwards); and Web of Science (1900 onwards) up to May 2020. We also searched sources of grey literature, screened the reference lists of included studies and performed a forward citation search. There were no restrictions applied to the searches by date, language or publication status . 
Selection criteria
We included development and external validation (testing model performance in data separate from the development data) studies of any multivariable prognostic models (including two or more predictors) to predict relapse, recurrence, sustained remission, or recovery in adults (aged 18 years and over) with remitted depression, in any clinical setting. We included all study designs and accepted all definitions of relapse, recurrence and other related outcomes. We did not specify a comparator prognostic model. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references; extracted data (using a template based on the CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS)); and assessed risks of bias of included studies (using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST)). We referred any disagreements to a third independent review author. Where we found sufficient (10 or more) external validation studies of an individual model, we planned to perform a meta‐analysis of its predictive performance, specifically with respect to its calibration (how well the predicted probabilities match the observed proportions of individuals that experience the outcome) and discrimination (the ability of the model to differentiate between those with and without the outcome). Recommendations could not be qualified using the GRADE system, as guidance is not yet available for prognostic model reviews. 
Main results
We identified 11 eligible prognostic model studies (10 unique prognostic models). Seven were model development studies; three were model development and external validation studies; and one was an external validation‐only study. Multiple estimates of performance measures were not available for any of the models and, meta‐analysis was therefore not possible. Ten out of the 11 included studies were assessed as being at high overall risk of bias. Common weaknesses included insufficient sample size, inappropriate handling of missing data and lack of information about discrimination and calibration. One paper (Klein 2018) was at low overall risk of bias and presented a prognostic model including the following predictors: number of previous depressive episodes, residual depressive symptoms and severity of the last depressive episode. The external predictive performance of this model was poor (C‐statistic 0.59; calibration slope 0.56; confidence intervals not reported). None of the identified studies examined the clinical utility (net benefit) of the developed model. 
Authors' conclusions
Of the 10 prognostic models identified (across 11 studies), only four underwent external validation. Most of the studies (n = 10) were assessed as being at high overall risk of bias, and the one study that was at low risk of bias presented a model with poor predictive performance. There is a need for improved prognostic research in this clinical area, with future studies conforming to current best practice recommendations for prognostic model development/validation and reporting findings in line with the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement.

## How to Better Predict When Depression Might Return

### Rationale

Depression is a common illness. Many people get better, but then their symptoms can come back. This is called a ""relapse."" Sometimes, a person feels better for a long time, but then a whole new episode of depression starts again. This is called a ""recurrence.""

When depression comes back, it makes life harder for patients. It also costs a lot of money for society. Doctors want to find a way to tell which patients are most likely to have their depression return. If they can find these patients, they can offer extra help to try and stop it from happening.

Some doctors use special tools called ""models."" These models use many pieces of information to guess a person's risk. This study looked at how well these models work. We wanted to see if they can truly predict when depression will return. If we find good models, we can help people stay well.

### Trial Design

This study was like a deep dive into other studies. We looked at past research about depression. We wanted to find studies that created or tested models. These models tried to predict if depression would come back.

We searched many health databases. We looked for studies up until May 2020. We did not care when or where the studies were done. We also looked for studies written in any language.

We picked studies that focused on adults aged 18 or older. These adults had already felt better from their depression. The models in these studies had to use two or more pieces of information to make their predictions. We looked at how well these models predicted relapse or recurrence.

Two people checked each study to make sure it fit our rules. They also looked at how well each study was done. If they did not agree, a third person helped them decide. This study did not put patients in groups. Instead, it reviewed what other studies had found.

### Results

We found 11 studies that fit our needs. These studies looked at 10 different ways to predict when depression might return.

Most of these studies were about creating a new prediction model. Only a few studies checked if a model worked in new patients. This is called ""external validation."" It is very important to see if a model works for more than just the first group of patients.

We found that most of the studies had problems. They did not have enough people in them. Or they did not handle missing information well. This means we cannot trust their results much.

One study was done very well. It looked at a model that used three things to predict risk:
* How many times a person had depression before.
* If a person still had some small signs of depression.
* How bad their last depression was.

But even this good study found the model did not predict very well. It was hard for the model to tell who would get sick again and who would stay well.

No studies looked at if using these models actually helped patients. They did not see if patients who used the models had better health or felt better.

In short, most of the models were not checked well enough. And the one good study found its model was not very helpful.

### Authors' Conclusions

We looked at 10 different ways to predict if depression would return. Only 4 of these ways were tested in new groups of people. Most of the studies we looked at had flaws.

The one study that was done well had a model that did not predict accurately. This means we still need better ways to predict when depression might come back.

Doctors and researchers need to do more and better studies. These new studies should follow the best rules for creating and testing these prediction tools. This will help us find better ways to keep people healthy and free from depression.","Predicting relapse or recurrence of depression
What is the aim of this review? 
Relapse and recurrence (becoming unwell again after making an improvement) are common in depression and lead to increased disability and decreased quality of life for patients. Relapse is a re‐emergence of the initial episode of depression after some initial improvement, whereas recurrence is the onset of a new episode of depression after recovery. Outcomes, such as relapse and recurrence, can sometimes be predicted while people are well, using information available at the time. A mathematical calculation can be performed to assess an individual person's risk; this calculation is known as a 'prognostic model' or a prediction tool. In most health services, including the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, resources such as doctors and therapists need to be used in the best way possible, for the people who will gain the most benefit from them. If accurate prediction tools are available, the information can be used to identify the most 'high risk' patients and make sure they receive additional support to try to prevent a relapse or a recurrence. 
The aim of this review was to identify studies that have attempted to develop a prediction tool for relapse or recurrence of depression in adults. We were interested in studies that had attempted to make this prediction while patients were well. We also included tools that predicted the chance of patients staying well. If we had found multiple studies that tested the same prediction tool, we planned to combine these to work out a better summary of how well that tool worked. 
Key messages 
We identified 10 prediction tools (over 11 studies) for relapse or recurrence. These were either not proven to be good at predicting relapse/recurrence, or the studies had problems with how they were carried out, meaning that none of the prediction tools were at a stage where they could be used in the real world. Further work is needed to improve prediction of relapse or recurrence of depression. 
What was studied in the review? 
We collected and analysed the results of 11 relevant studies. We were interested in several things: how researchers had defined relapse and recurrence (for example, whether they had used clinical interviews or self‐report questionnaires to diagnose depressive symptoms); what information was gathered to help make predictions; the techniques used by the researchers to help develop the tools; and how well the tools predicted. We were also interested in whether the tools were tested in a separate group of participants, which is essential to ensure that the model can predict accurately in patients in the real world. 
Finally, we assessed the studies to determine how confident we could be in the results, given the approaches taken by researchers (this is called 'risk of bias') and how relevant the studies were to our review (this is called 'applicability'). 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 11 studies. Ten of these developed different models and one study tested one of the models developed in a previous study. It was not possible to combine results for any particular tool. 
Ten of the 11 studies were rated at high risk of bias. This means that we cannot be confident in the results that were presented, due to some issues with the way the studies were conducted. The most common issue was that there were not enough participants included in the studies. Other common problems involved the statistical approaches used by the researchers. 
One study was at low overall risk of bias, which means that we can be more confident in trusting the results. However, this tool did not make accurate predictions about relapse or recurrence. 
We found no studies that could be used in clinical practice; further work is needed to develop tools for predicting relapse or recurrence of depression. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
The literature search for this review was completed in May 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD012665.pub2,"Bilateral (two) versus unilateral (one) hearing aid(s) for bilateral hearing impairment in adults 
Review question 
Should adult patients with bilateral (two‐sided) hearing loss be fitted with one or two hearing aids? 
Background 
Hearing loss can be present from birth or can come on in later life. The latter is called 'acquired' hearing loss and is common. Its incidence increases markedly with age. In most people, 'age‐related' hearing loss is due to the loss of cells in the inner ear (so called 'sensorineural hearing loss') and affects both ears to the same degree. Hearing loss categorised as mild, moderate or severe is primarily managed with hearing aids. People with bilateral hearing loss may be offered one aid, fitted to one specific ear, or two aids fitted to both ears. There is uncertainty about the relative benefits to patients of these different strategies. 
Study characteristics 
We included four studies with a total of 209 patients, ranging in age from 23 to 85 and with more men than women. All the studies allowed the use of hearing aids for a total period of at least eight weeks before questions were asked about their preference for one or two aids. In all the studies the patients had bilateral hearing loss but there was considerable variation in what type of hearing loss they suffered from and how bad their hearing was. 
Three of the studies were published before the mid‐1990s and the fourth study was published in 2011. Therefore, only the most recent study used 'modern' hearing aids similar to those that are widely available in high‐income countries. Of the four studies, two were conducted in the UK in National Health Service (NHS – public sector) patients. One of these looked at patients from primary care whose hearing loss had been picked up by a screening programme. The other looked at patients whose primary care practitioner thought they might benefit from hearing aids so had referred them to the local ENT department to get them. The other two studies were conducted in the United States: one study recruited only people on active military duty, or who had served in the military and had hearing loss due to being exposed to loud noises. About half of the people in the other study were ex‐military. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Only one of the outcomes we thought was most important ‐ patient preference ‐ was reported in all studies. The percentage of patients who preferred two hearing aids to one varied between studies: this was 54% (51 out of 94), 39% (22 out of 56), 55% (16 out of 29) and 77% (23 out of 30), respectively. We did not combine the numbers from these four studies because it would not have been right to do so. We graded the quality of evidence for this outcome as very low on a scale that goes high – medium – low – very low. There was no information in the four studies on the other outcomes we were interested in. 
Conclusions 
This review identified only four studies comparing the use of one hearing aid with two. The studies were small and included people of widely varying ages. There was also considerable variation in the types of their deafness and in how deaf they were. 
For the most part, the types of hearing aid evaluated would now be regarded, in high‐income countries, as 'old technology', with only one study looking at 'modern' digital aids. However, we do not know if this is relevant or not. This review did not look at the differences between other 'old' and 'new' types of hearing aid. 
We could not combine the numbers from the four studies. Overall, this fact and the very low quality of the evidence leads us to conclude that we do not know if patients have a preference for one aid or two. Similarly, we do not know if a patient's quality of life is better with one or two aids. 
","## Plain Language Summary: One or Two Hearing Aids for Adults with Hearing Loss?

### Rationale

Many people have trouble hearing. This often happens as people get older. Their inner ears lose special cells. This makes it hard to hear sounds well. This is called hearing loss. It can affect both ears the same way.

Hearing aids help people hear better. They are small devices that make sounds louder. People with hearing loss can use one hearing aid. They can also use two hearing aids. We wanted to know if one or two aids is better. This study helps us learn if people like one or two aids more. It also helps us see if two aids make life better.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. We looked at four past studies. These studies checked if people liked one or two hearing aids. A total of 209 people were in these studies. They were between 23 and 85 years old. More men were in the studies than women. All people had hearing loss in both ears.

The studies let people use hearing aids for at least eight weeks. Then, people answered questions. They said if they liked one or two aids better. The studies had different types of hearing loss. How bad their hearing was also varied.

Three studies were old. They used older types of hearing aids. One study was newer, from 2011. It used modern hearing aids. Two studies were in the UK. They looked at patients from public healthcare. Two studies were in the US. Some people in these studies were in the military. They had hearing loss from loud noises.

### Results

We looked at what patients preferred. This was the most important thing. Did they like one or two hearing aids? The number of people who liked two aids changed in each study.

One study found that about 5 out of 10 people liked two aids. Another found 4 out of 10 people liked two aids. A third found about 5 out of 10 liked two aids. The last study found about 8 out of 10 people liked two aids.

We could not put these numbers together. The studies were too different. We felt the proof was not strong. It was ""very low quality."" This means we are not sure about the results. The studies did not tell us about other things. They did not say if one or two aids made life better.

So, we still do not know for sure. We do not know if people like one or two aids more. We also do not know if two aids make life better than one. The studies were small. They used many old hearing aids. More research is needed to find clear answers.","Bilateral (two) versus unilateral (one) hearing aid(s) for bilateral hearing impairment in adults

All the studies allowed the use of hearing aids for a total period of at least eight weeks before questions were asked about their preference for one or two aids. In all the studies the patients had bilateral hearing loss but there was considerable variation in what type of hearing loss they suffered from and how bad their hearing was. 
Three of the studies were published before the mid‐1990s and the fourth study was published in 2011. Therefore, only the most recent study used 'modern' hearing aids similar to those that are widely available in high‐income countries. Of the four studies, two were conducted in the UK in National Health Service (NHS – public sector) patients. One of these looked at patients from primary care whose hearing loss had been picked up by a screening programme. The other looked at patients whose primary care practitioner thought they might benefit from hearing aids so had referred them to the local ENT department to get them. The other two studies were conducted in the United States: one study recruited only people on active military duty, or who had served in the military and had hearing loss due to being exposed to loud noises. About half of the people in the other study were ex‐military. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Only one of the outcomes we thought was most important ‐ patient preference ‐ was reported in all studies. The percentage of patients who preferred two hearing aids to one varied between studies: this was 54% (51 out of 94), 39% (22 out of 56), 55% (16 out of 29) and 77% (23 out of 30), respectively. We did not combine the numbers from these four studies because it would not have been right to do so. We graded the quality of evidence for this outcome as very low on a scale that goes high – medium – low – very low. There was no information in the four studies on the other outcomes we were interested in. 
Conclusions 
This review identified only four studies comparing the use of one hearing aid with two. The studies were small and included people of widely varying ages. There was also considerable variation in the types of their deafness and in how deaf they were. 
For the most part, the types of hearing aid evaluated would now be regarded, in high‐income countries, as 'old technology', with only one study looking at 'modern' digital aids. However, we do not know if this is relevant or not. This review did not look at the differences between other 'old' and 'new' types of hearing aid. 
We could not combine the numbers from the four studies. Overall, this fact and the very low quality of the evidence leads us to conclude that we do not know if patients have a preference for one aid or two. Similarly, we do not know if a patient's quality of life is better with one or two aids.

Peripheral joint osteoarthritis is a major cause of pain and functional limitation. Few treatments are safe and effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of acupuncture for treating peripheral joint osteoarthritis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE, and EMBASE (both through December 2007), and scanned reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing needle acupuncture with a sham, another active treatment, or a waiting list control group in people with osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, or hand. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated standardized mean differences using the differences in improvements between groups. 
Main results
Sixteen trials involving 3498 people were included. Twelve of the RCTs included only people with OA of the knee, 3 only OA of the hip, and 1 a mix of people with OA of the hip and/or knee. In comparison with a sham control, acupuncture showed statistically significant, short‐term improvements in osteoarthritis pain (standardized mean difference ‐0.28, 95% confidence interval ‐0.45 to ‐0.11; 0.9 point greater improvement than sham on 20 point scale; absolute percent change 4.59%; relative percent change 10.32%; 9 trials; 1835 participants) and function (‐0.28, ‐0.46 to ‐0.09; 2.7 point greater improvement on 68 point scale; absolute percent change 3.97%; relative percent change 8.63%); however, these pooled short‐term benefits did not meet our predefined thresholds for clinical relevance (i.e. 1.3 points for pain; 3.57 points for function) and there was substantial statistical heterogeneity. Additionally, restriction to sham‐controlled trials using shams judged most likely to adequately blind participants to treatment assignment (which were also the same shams judged most likely to have physiological activity), reduced heterogeneity and resulted in pooled short‐term benefits of acupuncture that were smaller and non‐significant. In comparison with sham acupuncture at the six‐month follow‐up, acupuncture showed borderline statistically significant, clinically irrelevant improvements in osteoarthritis pain (‐0.10, ‐0.21 to 0.01; 0.4 point greater improvement than sham on 20 point scale; absolute percent change 1.81%; relative percent change 4.06%; 4 trials;1399 participants) and function (‐0.11, ‐0.22 to 0.00; 1.2 point greater improvement than sham on 68 point scale; absolute percent change 1.79%; relative percent change 3.89%). In a secondary analysis versus a waiting list control, acupuncture was associated with statistically significant, clinically relevant short‐term improvements in osteoarthritis pain (‐0.96, ‐1.19 to ‐0.72; 14.5 point greater improvement than sham on 100 point scale; absolute percent change 14.5%; relative percent change 29.14%; 4 trials; 884 participants) and function (‐0.89, ‐1.18 to ‐0.60; 13.0 point greater improvement than sham on 100 point scale; absolute percent change 13.0%; relative percent change 25.21%). In the head‐on comparisons of acupuncture with the 'supervised osteoarthritis education' and the 'physician consultation' control groups, acupuncture was associated with clinically relevant short‐ and long‐term improvements in pain and function. In the head on comparisons of acupuncture with 'home exercises/advice leaflet' and 'supervised exercise', acupuncture was associated with similar treatment effects as the controls. Acupuncture as an adjuvant to an exercise based physiotherapy program did not result in any greater improvements than the exercise program alone. Information on safety was reported in only 8 trials and even in these trials there was limited reporting and heterogeneous methods. 
Authors' conclusions
Sham‐controlled trials show statistically significant benefits; however, these benefits are small, do not meet our pre‐defined thresholds for clinical relevance, and are probably due at least partially to placebo effects from incomplete blinding. Waiting list‐controlled trials of acupuncture for peripheral joint osteoarthritis suggest statistically significant and clinically relevant benefits, much of which may be due to expectation or placebo effects.

### **Plain Title: How Acupuncture Helps with Joint Pain**

**Rationale**

Many people have joint pain. This pain comes from a problem called osteoarthritis. It makes it hard to move and do daily tasks. There are not many good ways to treat this pain safely.

Doctors want to find new ways to help. Acupuncture is an old treatment. It uses thin needles placed in the skin. Some people think it can ease pain. This study looked to see if acupuncture truly helps people with joint pain.

We wanted to know if acupuncture could make joint pain less. We also wanted to see if it could help people move better. This study checked if acupuncture works better than fake treatments or no treatment at all.

**Trial Design**

This study looked at many other studies. We gathered information from 16 past studies. These studies included 3498 people. All these people had osteoarthritis. They had pain in their knee, hip, or hand joints.

These studies were ""randomized controlled trials."" This means some people got real acupuncture. Other people got a ""sham"" treatment. A sham treatment looks like real acupuncture but does not work the same way. Some people also got other treatments or no treatment.

We looked at how much pain people had. We also checked how well they could move. The studies checked these things for a short time. They also checked them for a longer time, up to six months. Two doctors reviewed all the information carefully.

**Results**

The study found some interesting things.

When we compared real acupuncture to a fake treatment, people felt a little less pain. They also moved a little better. These changes were small. They were not as big as what doctors think is truly helpful. It means the small benefit might be from people expecting to feel better. This is called a ""placebo effect.""

When people did not get any treatment, acupuncture helped a lot more. People had much less pain. They also moved much better. This benefit was big enough to be truly helpful. But again, part of this could be from people hoping to get better.

Acupuncture also helped more than just getting advice or seeing a doctor. It helped with pain and movement for a short time and a long time.

However, if people were already doing exercises, adding acupuncture did not help more.

We also looked at how safe acupuncture was. Not all studies gave clear details about this.

In short, acupuncture may help some people with joint pain. The help might be small if compared to a fake treatment. But it offers a good deal of help if compared to no treatment. This help could be from the mind expecting to feel better.","Acupuncture for osteoarthritis
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of acupuncture on osteoarthritis. 
The review shows that in people with osteoarthritis, 
‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 8 weeks. 
‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 26 weeks. 
We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects of acupuncture treatment include minor bruising and bleeding at the site of needle insertion. 
What is osteoarthritis and what is acupuncture? 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as your knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try and repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen and make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect your physical function or ability to use your knee. 
According to the philosophy of traditional acupuncture, energy circulates in 'meridians' located throughout the body.  Pain or ill health happens when something occurs to cause this meridian energy circulation to be blocked. The way to restore health is to stimulate the appropriate combination of acupuncture points in the body by inserting very thin needles.  Sometimes in painful conditions, electrical stimulation along with the needles is also used.  According to acupuncture theory, one way you can tell that acupuncture is relieving pain is that you may feel numbness or tingling, called de qi, where the needle is inserted. 
Best estimate of what happens to people with osteoarthritis who have acupuncture: 
Pain after 8 weeks: 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 4 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. 
‐People who received acupuncture had a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.  (5% absolute improvement). 
Pain after 26 weeks: 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly more than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly less than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. 
‐People who received acupuncture had under a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.  (2% absolute improvement).  
Physical function after 8 weeks : 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 8 points on a scale of 0 to 68. 
‐People who received acupuncture had about a 3 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐68.  (4% absolute improvement)  
Physical function after 26 weeks : 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 10 points on a scale of 0 to 68. 
‐People who received acupuncture had about a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐68.  (2% absolute improvement)

Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility tests are expected to reduce the time to clinically important results of a blood culture. This might enable clinicians to better target therapy to a person's needs, and thereby, improve health outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay), and reduce unnecessary prescribing of broad‐spectrum antibiotics; thereby reducing antimicrobial resistance rates. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of rapid susceptibility testing versus standard susceptibility testing for bloodstream infections (BSIs). 
Search methods
To identify studies with selected outcomes, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, and two trials registries, between 1987 and October 2020. We used 'bloodstream infection' and 'antimicrobial susceptibility tests' as search terms. We had no language or publication status limitations. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (with a time‐to‐result of ≤ 8 hours) versus conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in people with a BSI caused by any bacteria, as identified by a positive blood culture. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references, full‐text reports of potentially relevant studies, extracted data from the studies, and assessed risk of bias. Any disagreement was discussed and resolved with a third review author. For mortality, a dichotomous outcome, we extracted the number of events in each arm, and presented a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare rapid susceptibility testing to conventional methods. We used Review Manager 5.4 to meta‐analyse the data. For other outcomes, which are time‐to‐event outcomes (time‐to‐discharge from hospital, time‐to‐first appropriate antibiotic change), we conducted qualitative narrative synthesis, due to heterogeneity of outcome measures.  
Main results
We included six trials, with 1638 participants. For rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.46; 6 RCTs, 1638 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, for rapid genotypic or molecular antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.49; 4 RCTs, 1074 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For phenotypic rapid susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups  (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.35; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
In qualitative analysis, rapid susceptibility testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐discharge (4 RCTs, 1165 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In qualitative analysis, rapid genotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (3 RCTs, 929 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, rapid phenotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may improve time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (RR ‐17.29, CI ‐45.05 to 10.47; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
Authors' conclusions
The theoretical benefits of rapid susceptibility testing have not been demonstrated to directly improve mortality, time‐to‐discharge, or time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic in these randomized studies. Future large prospective studies should be designed to focus on the most clinically meaningful outcomes, and aim to optimize blood culture pathways. 
","## Fast Germ Tests for Bloodstream Illness

### Rationale

Bloodstream infections are serious. Germs get into the blood. This can make people very sick. It can even cause death. People may stay in the hospital for a long time. Doctors need to find the right medicine fast.

Germs can get used to medicines. This makes medicines not work well. This is called antibiotic resistance. We want to stop this. Giving the right medicine helps. It stops germs from getting stronger.

Doctors test blood to find germs. They want to know what medicine will work. Standard tests take time. New, fast tests might give answers quicker. We want to see if fast tests help people get better. They might save lives. They might get people home sooner. They might also help fight germs that are hard to kill.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. We wanted to see how fast germ tests work. We compared them to normal germ tests. We looked for studies that used a special design. These were ""randomized controlled trials."" This means some people got the fast test. Others got the standard test. A computer chose who got which test. This makes the studies fair.

The studies we looked at included people of all ages. They had a bloodstream infection. This means germs were in their blood. We looked for studies where the fast test gave results in 8 hours or less. We wanted to see if these fast tests changed how sick people got. We also checked how long people stayed in the hospital.

We searched many health databases. We looked for studies from 1987 to October 2020. We did not care what language the studies were in. Two different people checked all the studies. If they did not agree, a third person helped. This made sure we found the best studies.

### Results

We found six studies. These studies included 1638 people. We looked at how many people died. We found that fast germ tests did not change how many people died. This was compared to standard tests. The chance of dying was about the same.

We also looked at how long people stayed in the hospital. Fast tests did not make people go home sooner. This was also about the same.

We looked at how fast doctors changed to the right medicine. Some fast tests look at germ genes. These are ""genotypic"" tests. They did not make doctors change medicines faster. Other fast tests look at how germs grow. These are ""phenotypic"" tests. These tests might help doctors change to the right medicine sooner. But we are not sure yet.

Our main finding is that fast germ tests did not clearly help people live longer. They did not get people out of the hospital faster. More studies are needed. We need to focus on what helps patients most. We need to make sure blood tests are done in the best way.","Tests for identifying the most suitable antibiotics for a bacterial blood infection: are rapid tests better than standard tests? 
What is the aim of this Cochrane Review? 
People with blood infections need urgent treatment with antibiotics. Identifying the bacteria causing the infection helps ensure the right antibiotic is given. Rapid susceptibility tests are a technology to do this quickly, and aim to improve care. We sought to evaluate whether their use reduce deaths or shortens the illness. 
Key messages 
Rapid susceptibility tests to identify an appropriate antibiotic quickly for people with blood sepsis may make little to no difference to: 
· how many people die within 30 days of diagnosis of blood sepsis;
· how long people stay in hospital; 
· whether given a suitable antibiotic. 
Larger studies will help determine if using rapid susceptibility tests improves these outcomes. 
What was studied in this review? 
Susceptibility tests are done in a laboratory, and measure whether bacteria can grow when exposed to a variety of antibiotics, to assure that the antibiotics given are active against the organism causing the infection. The standard approach is to culture the blood samples, but this takes up to 36 hours to obtain a result. Rapid tests to identify bacteria causing blood infections, and their susceptibilities to antibiotics, provide results in eight hours or less. These rapid susceptibility tests include: 
· tests that look at the direct effect of antibiotics on bacteria (called phenotypic tests); and 
· tests that look for particular genes in the bacteria to see if they are susceptible, or resistant, to an antibiotic (called genotypic tests). 
What are the main results of this review? 
We found six studies that involved 1638 adults with blood infections. All studies took place in specialized medical centres in high‐income countries in Europe, the USA, and East Asia. 
Compared with standard tests, rapid susceptibility tests may make little to no difference to 
· how many people died within 30 days (evidence from six studies in 1638 people);
· how long people stayed in hospital (4 studies in 1165 people); or
· how long it took for people to be given the right antibiotic to treat the infection (5 studies in 1493 people). 
Phenotypic rapid susceptibility tests may reduce the time it takes to receive the right antibiotic; but this is uncertain (evidence from 2 studies in 564 people). 
Genotypic rapid susceptibility tests may make little or no difference to the time it takes to receive the right antibiotic (evidence from 4 studies in 1074 people). 
Our confidence in the results is limited because:
· the numbers of deaths reported in the studies were too low to show an important difference; 
· the tests used and the results from the studies varied widely;
· the studies did not include enough participants to enable firm conclusions.
Further research is likely to change these results.
How up to date is this review? 
We included evidence published up to 21 October 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013440.pub2,"Background
Primary malignant brain tumours can have an unpredictable course, but high‐grade gliomas typically have a relentlessly progressive disease trajectory. They can cause profound symptom burden, affecting physical, neurocognitive, and social functioning from an early stage in the illness. This can significantly impact on role function and on the experiences and needs of informal caregivers. Access to specialist palliative and supportive care early in the disease trajectory, for those with high‐grade tumours in particular, has the potential to improve patients' and caregivers' quality of life. However, provision of palliative and supportive care for people with primary brain tumours ‐ and their informal caregivers ‐ is historically ill‐defined and ad hoc, and the benefits of early palliative interventions have not been confirmed. It is therefore important to define the role and effectiveness of early referral to specialist palliative care services and/or the effectiveness of other interventions focused on palliating disease impact on people and their informal caregivers. This would help guide improvement to service provision, by defining those interventions which are effective across a range of domains, and developing an evidence‐based model of integrated supportive and palliative care for this population. 
Objectives
To assess the evidence base for early palliative care interventions, including referral to specialist palliative care services compared to usual care, for improving outcomes in adults diagnosed with a primary brain tumour and their carers. 
Search methods
We conducted searches of electronic databases, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO (last searched 16 November 2021). We conducted searches to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative search terms. In addition to this, we searched for any currently recruiting trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and in the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal, and undertook citation tracking via Scopus. We also handsearched reference lists of potentially eligible systematic review articles to identify any other relevant studies, contacted experts in the field and searched key authors via Web of Science and searched SIGLE (System of Information on Grey Literature in Europe). 
Selection criteria
We included studies looking at early referral to specialist palliative care services ‐ or early targeted palliative interventions by other healthcare professionals ‐ for improving quality of life, symptom control, psychological outcomes, or overall survival as a primary or secondary outcome measure. Studies included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised studies (NRS), as well as qualitative and mixed‐methods studies where both qualitative and quantitative data were included. Participants were adults with a confirmed radiological and/or histological diagnosis of a primary malignant brain tumour, and/or informal adult carers (either at individual or family level) of people with a primary malignant brain tumour. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodological procedures for data extraction, management, and analysis. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for symptom control, i.e. cognitive function. 
Main results
We identified 9748 references from the searches, with 8337 remaining after duplicates were removed. After full‐text review, we included one trial. There were no studies of early specialist palliative care interventions or of early, co‐ordinated generalist palliative care approaches. 
The included randomised trial addressed a single symptom area, focusing on early cognitive rehabilitation, administered within two weeks of surgery in a mixed brain tumour population, of whom approximately half had a high‐grade glioma. The intervention was administered individually as therapist‐led computerised exercises over 16 one‐hour sessions, four times/week for four weeks. Sessions addressed several cognitive domains including time orientation, spatial orientation, visual attention, logical reasoning, memory, and executive function. 
There were no between‐group differences in outcome for tests of logical‐executive function, but differences were observed in the domains of visual attention and verbal memory. Risk of bias was assessed and stated as high for performance bias and attrition bias but for selective reporting it was unclear whether all outcomes were reported. We considered the certainty of the evidence, as assessed by GRADE, to be very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently there is a lack of research focusing on the introduction of early palliative interventions specifically for people with primary brain tumours, either as co‐ordinated specialist palliative care approaches or interventions focusing on a specific aspect of palliation. Future research should address the methodological shortcomings described in early palliative intervention studies in other cancers and chronic conditions. In particular, the specific population under investigation, the timing and the setting of the intervention should be clearly described and the standardised palliative care‐specific components of the intervention should be defined in detail. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title: Helping People with Brain Tumors Feel Better Sooner

### Rationale

Brain tumors can cause many problems for people. These problems can affect how they move, think, and interact with others. This can make life hard for patients and their loved ones.

It is important to help people with brain tumors feel better. This help is called ""palliative care."" It aims to improve quality of life. We want to know if getting this care early helps.

Palliative care can help with pain and other tough symptoms. It can also help families cope. We need to find out the best ways to offer this support. This study wants to find good ways to care for people with brain tumors.

### Trial Design

This study looked at other studies. It asked: ""What proof do we have for early palliative care?"" We searched many health databases. We looked for studies that helped adults with brain tumors. We also looked for studies that helped their caregivers.

We looked for studies about getting early help from special palliative care teams. Or, studies about other ways health workers gave early palliative care. We wanted to see if this care improved life quality. We also looked for help with symptoms or how long people lived.

We included different types of studies. These were studies that compared groups. Some studies just observed people. We also looked at studies that gathered stories and numbers. The people in these studies had a brain tumor. Or, they were adult family members caring for someone with a brain tumor.

### Results

We found many studies, almost 10,000. After removing copies, we had over 8,000. But, only one study met all our rules.

This one study looked at special brain exercises. People did these exercises soon after surgery. About half of these people had a serious brain tumor. They worked with a therapist. They used computers for one hour, four times a week, for four weeks. These exercises helped with thinking, memory, and focus.

The study found some good things. It showed that these exercises helped with paying attention and remembering words. But, it did not find big changes in other thinking skills. We found that the study might have some problems. So, we are not very sure about these results.

Overall, there is not much research on early palliative care for brain tumors. We need more studies. Future studies should be very clear. They should say who they are helping. They should also say when and how they give help. This will show us the best ways to care for people with brain tumors.","Improving the outcome of people with primary brain tumours and their carers using early palliative interventions 
Why this question is important 
Brain tumours can have a significant impact on people and their carers. Brain tumours can impair people's physical, neurocognitive, and social functioning, which can affect the whole family, particularly informal caregivers, who often receive inadequate support. There is evidence in other cancers that providing access to palliative support in the early stages of a person's illness can help to improve their, and their caregivers', quality of life. However, it has not been confirmed that this is the case for people with brain tumours. 
Objectives 
We aimed to assess studies that included early palliative care interventions, including referral to specialist palliative care services compared to usual care, for improving outcomes in adults diagnosed with a primary brain tumour and their carers. 
How we searched for evidence 
We searched electronic medical literature databases for studies that included a range of different types of medical trials, both published and ongoing. We handsearched the reference lists of key papers and searched for key authors of research in the area. We included adults confirmed with a primary brain tumour and informal caregivers such as relatives. 
What we found 
We could not find any trials examining the impact of specialist palliative care teams on outcomes for patients or their carers. We included one trial which focused on a single symptom area – that of cognition – in a patient group of whom about half had a high‐grade tumour. The trial randomised patients between a group receiving a structured cognitive rehabilitation intervention and a group receiving usual rehabilitation care of medications and physiotherapy. Cognitive rehabilitation consisted of supervised computer‐based exercises, lasting 45 minutes at a time, four times a week, over a four‐week period. There was no important difference between the two groups apart from some improvement in visual attention and verbal memory in those who received the cognitive rehabilitation intervention. However, we assessed the certainty of the evidence as being very low, and we could find no evidence in this or other studies on any other aspect of palliative care. 
What this means 
Not enough research has been undertaken on early palliative care interventions which support people with primary brain tumours, and their caregivers. Research is needed which examines co‐ordinated approaches to overall palliative care provision, and interventions which focus on specific aspects of palliation in this population.

People with neuromuscular disorders may have a weak, ineffective cough predisposing them to respiratory complications. Cough augmentation techniques aim to improve cough effectiveness and mucous clearance, reduce the frequency and duration of respiratory infections requiring hospital admission, and improve quality of life. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders. 
Search methods
On 13 April 2020, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and randomised cross‐over trials. 
Selection criteria
We included trials of cough augmentation techniques compared to no treatment, alternative techniques, or combinations thereof, in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were the number and duration of unscheduled hospitalisations for acute respiratory exacerbations. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
The review included 11 studies involving 287 adults and children, aged three to 73 years. Inadequately reported cross‐over studies and the limited additional information provided by authors severely restricted the number of analyses that could be performed. 
Studies compared manually assisted cough, mechanical insufflation, manual and mechanical breathstacking, mechanical insufflation‐exsufflation, glossopharyngeal breathing, and combination techniques to unassisted cough and alternative or sham interventions. None of the included studies reported on the primary outcomes of this review (number and duration of unscheduled hospital admissions) or listed 'adverse events' as primary or secondary outcome measures. 
The evidence suggests that a range of cough augmentation techniques may increase peak cough flow compared to unassisted cough (199 participants, 8 RCTs), but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little to no difference in peak cough flow outcomes between alternative cough augmentation techniques (216 participants, 9 RCTs). 
There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of interventions on measures of gaseous exchange, pulmonary function, quality of life, general function, or participant preference and satisfaction. 
Authors' conclusions
We are very uncertain about the safety and efficacy of cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders and further studies are needed.

## Plain Title: Helping People with Weak Coughs Breathe Better

### Rationale

Many people have health problems that make their muscles weak. These are called neuromuscular disorders. This weakness can affect the muscles needed to cough well. A weak cough makes it hard to clear mucus from the lungs. This can lead to serious lung problems and trips to the hospital.

Doctors want to find ways to make coughs stronger. These methods are called cough help techniques. They aim to help people clear their lungs. This may mean fewer lung infections and less time in the hospital. It could also make life better for these patients.

This study looked at different ways to help people cough. It wanted to see if these methods work and if they are safe. We needed this study to understand how these techniques can help people with weak muscles breathe easier.

### Trial Design

This study looked at how other studies were set up. It searched for past research on cough help techniques. These studies compared different ways to help coughs. They looked at people with muscle problems who had weak coughs.

The studies included both adults and children. Their ages ranged from three years old to 73 years old. All of them had long-term muscle problems. The studies looked at if these techniques worked better than no help or other ways of helping.

Two experts checked each study. They looked at how well the studies were done. They also pulled out the important facts. The main things they looked for were how many times people went to the hospital and for how long.

### Results

This review looked at 11 studies in total. These studies included 287 people. They were both adults and children. The studies used many types of cough help. Some used hands to help, others used machines. Some taught special breathing.

The studies did not report how many times people went to the hospital. They also did not say how long people stayed. This was a main goal of our review. So, we could not answer those key questions.

The studies did suggest that some cough help techniques made people cough stronger. This was compared to not getting any help. However, we are not very sure about this finding. There may be little or no difference between different types of cough help.

We did not have enough facts to know about other things. We could not tell if the techniques helped with breathing, lung health, or how people felt about their lives. We also don't know if people liked these techniques.

The main conclusion is that we are not sure if cough help techniques are safe or if they work well. This is for both adults and children with muscle problems. More studies are needed to find clear answers.","The safety and effectiveness of techniques to assist coughing in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of techniques used to assist coughing in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders (cough augmentation techniques). 
Background 
People with neuromuscular disorders (nerve‐related conditions that affect the muscles) may have difficulty coughing and clearing mucous from the airways, placing them at risk of choking, recurrent chest infections, and ongoing lung disease. Cough augmentation techniques, such as manually assisted cough, bagging (using a self‐inflating bag commonly used for resuscitation), mechanical Cough Assist (a device that clears secretions by applying a positive pressure to the airway, then rapidly shifting to a negative pressure), 'frog' breathing (a method of breathing to help a person take in a bigger volume of air), and breathstacking (the person takes a number of sequential breaths in, stacking one breath on top of the other without breathing out in between breaths) aim to improve cough effectiveness, with the eventual aim of reducing the number or severity (or both) of chest infections, and improving the ability of people to perform daily activities (functional ability) and quality of life. 
Methods 
We carried out a wide database search for studies of cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders. We selected studies that assigned people to the treatment(s) or treatment order by chance, as this study type provides the best evidence. 
Results and quality of the evidence 
We found 11 studies with 287 people and several cough augmentation techniques. One study measured the long‐term effects of treatment, but was only published as an abstract without enough information to accurately analyse the study findings. Many included studies had problems with how they were performed, how their findings were reported, or both, which made it difficult to fully interpret their results. None of the studies reported on the outcomes we thought were the most important for making decisions about the effectiveness and safety of cough augmentation techniques. For example, the studies did not report on the number or duration of unscheduled hospital admissions for chest infections, survival, functional ability, or quality of life. The safety of cough augmentation techniques could not be determined. Some studies suggested that cough augmentation techniques may be better than an unassisted cough, but the results are very uncertain. There was not enough evidence to show that any one technique was better than another in improving cough effort. 
Conclusions and recommendation 
The findings of this review provided insufficient information to make decisions about when and how to use cough augmentation techniques in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders. There is currently very low certainty evidence for or against the safety and effectiveness of cough augmentation techniques in people with chronic neuromuscular diseases and more studies are needed. 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 13 April 2020.

Disease recurrence and progression remain major challenges in the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Blue light‐enhanced transurethral resection of bladder cancer (TURBT) is an approach to improve staging and achieve a complete resection of NMIBC. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of blue light‐enhanced TURBT compared to white light‐based TURBT in the treatment of NMIBC. 
Search methods
We searched several medical literature databases, including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase, as well as trial registers, including ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We performed a comprehensive search with no restrictions on language of publication or publication status until March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials using blue light versus white light TURBT. Included participants had a high level of suspicion based on imaging or ‘visible diagnosis’ for primary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder or recurrent urothelial carcinoma of the bladder upon cytoscopy. We excluded studies in which blue light was used in a surveillance setting.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Our primary outcomes were time to disease recurrence, time to disease progression, and serious surgical complications. Secondary outcomes were time to death from bladder cancer, any adverse events, and non‐serious complications. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 16 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 4325 participants in the review. The studies compared blue light versus white light TURBT for treatment of NMIBC.  
Primary outcomes 
Blue light TURBT may reduce the risk of disease recurrence over time (hazard ratio (HR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.81; low‐certainty evidence) depending on baseline risk. For participants with low‐, intermediate‐, and high‐risk NMIBC, this corresponded to 48 (66 fewer to 27 fewer), 109 (152 fewer to 59 fewer), and 147 (211 fewer to 76 fewer) fewer recurrences per 1000 participants when compared to white light TURBT, respectively.  
Blue light TURBT may also reduce the risk of disease progression over time (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.84; low‐certainty evidence) depending on baseline risk. For participants with low‐, intermediate‐, and high‐risk NMIBC, this corresponded to 1 (1 fewer to 0 fewer), 17 (25 fewer to 8 fewer), and 56 (81 fewer to 25 fewer) fewer progressions per 1000 participants when compared to white light TURBT, respectively. 
Blue light TURBT may have little or no effect on serious surgical complications (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.14; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponded to 10 fewer (19 fewer to 25 more) surgical complications per 1000 participants with blue light TURBT.  
Secondary outcomes 
Blue light TURBT may have little or no effect on the risk of death from bladder cancer over time (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.61; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponded to 22 deaths per 1000 participants with white light TURBT and 10 fewer (17 fewer to 13 more) deaths per 1000 participants with blue light TURBT.   
We are very uncertain how blue light TURBT affects the outcome adverse events of any grade (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33; low‐certainty evidence).  
No analysis was possible for the outcome non‐serious surgical complications, as it was not reported by any of the included studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Blue light‐enhanced TURBT for the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer compared to white light‐based TURBT may reduce the risk of disease recurrence and disease progression over time depending on baseline risk. There may be little or no effect on serious surgical complications. The certainty of evidence for our findings was low, meaning that future studies are likely change to the reported estimates of effect. Frequent issues that led to downgrading of the certainty of the evidence were study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision.

### Plain Title
Better Light for Bladder Cancer Surgery

### Rationale
Bladder cancer can come back or get worse. This is a big problem for people who have it. Doctors want to find better ways to treat it.

This study looks at a special light for surgery. This surgery is called TURBT. It removes cancer from the bladder.

The new light is blue light. It helps doctors see the cancer better. If they see it better, they can remove it all. This might stop the cancer from coming back. It might also stop it from getting worse. This study wants to see if blue light is better than white light for TURBT surgery.

### Trial Design
This study looked at many other studies. These studies were fair tests. They compared blue light TURBT to white light TURBT.

People in these studies had bladder cancer. Doctors suspected they had it. Or they had it come back. The studies included people of different ages. They looked at men and women.

The studies compared two types of surgery. One used a special blue light. The other used a normal white light. Researchers checked what happened to people after surgery. They looked at if the cancer came back. They looked at if it got worse. They also looked at if people had bad problems from the surgery.

### Results
We looked at 16 studies. A total of 4,325 people were in these studies. They all had bladder cancer surgery.

**Less Cancer Coming Back:**
Blue light surgery may make the cancer less likely to come back. This was true for people with all types of bladder cancer. For every 1,000 people:
* Low risk: 48 fewer times the cancer came back.
* Medium risk: 109 fewer times the cancer came back.
* High risk: 147 fewer times the cancer came back.

**Less Cancer Getting Worse:**
Blue light surgery may also make the cancer less likely to get worse. For every 1,000 people:
* Low risk: 1 fewer time the cancer got worse.
* Medium risk: 17 fewer times the cancer got worse.
* High risk: 56 fewer times the cancer got worse.

**Surgery Problems:**
Blue light surgery did not seem to cause more serious problems. It also did not seem to cause fewer serious problems. For every 1,000 people, there were about 10 fewer problems. But this could also be 19 fewer or 25 more.

**Death from Cancer:**
Blue light surgery did not seem to change the risk of death from bladder cancer. For every 1,000 people, there were about 10 fewer deaths. But this could also be 17 fewer or 13 more.

**Other Problems:**
We are not sure how blue light surgery affects other types of problems. The studies did not give enough clear facts about this. No studies reported small problems from surgery.

**Conclusion:**
Blue light surgery for bladder cancer may help reduce the chance of cancer coming back. It may also reduce the chance of cancer getting worse. It does not seem to change the risk of serious problems from surgery. More studies are needed to be sure.","Blue light‐enhanced versus white light resection in the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer 
Review question 
How does a resection (surgical removal) of bladder cancer supported with a special visualization method (blue light) compare to a standard resection with white light in people in whom a tumor of the inner bladder wall is suspected? 
Background 
In people suspected of having bladder cancer, suspicious tissue is cut from the inner bladder wall using a special instrument inserted through the urethra into the bladder. However, it is sometimes difficult to tell what is normal bladder versus what is cancer. In order to see the tumor better and remove it completely, a substance, or 'contrast agent,' is put into the bladder through a catheter. During surgery, a special light is used that is meant to make the cancerous area light up blue.  
Study characteristics 
We only included randomized controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) for inclusion in the review, as this type of clinical study is considered to be of the highest quality producing the most reliable results. We included people who were very likely to have had bladder cancer because if had been seen on an imaging study (like a computed tomography (CT) scan) or when looking into the bladder. We included studies of people with newly suspected tumors and those who had been treated for bladder cancer before and there was concern it had come back.  
Key results 
We included 16 studies addressing our review question. Overall, blue light‐enhanced resection of bladder cancer may reduce the risk of disease recurrence over time compared to white light resection (low‐certainty evidence) and may reduce the risk of disease progression over time (low‐certainty evidence). However, whether this effect is big enough to be meaningful to people with bladder cancer depends on whether they belong to the low, intermediate and high risk group for disease recurrence or progression.   
We also found that blue light may have little or no effect on the occurrence of serious surgical complications (low‐certainty evidence) or the risk of death from bladder cancer over time (low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain as to whether blue light TURBT reduces the incidence of unwanted side effects, as the certainty of the evidence was assessed as low. We do not know how non‐serious surgical complications are affected as no data were reported for this outcome. 
Quality of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence was low, meaning that future research would likely change our results.

10.1002-14651858.CD011345.pub2,"Background
Fertility problems are very common, as subfertility affects about 10% to 15% of couples trying to conceive. There are many factors that may impact a couple's ability to conceive and one of these may be incorrect timing of intercourse. Conception is only possible from approximately five days before up to several hours after ovulation. Therefore, to be effective, intercourse must take place during this fertile period. 'Timed intercourse' is the practice of prospectively identifying ovulation and, thus, the fertile period to increase the likelihood of conception. Whilst timed intercourse may increase conception rates and reduce unnecessary intervention and costs, there may be associated adverse aspects including time consumption and stress. Ovulation prediction methods used for timing intercourse include urinary hormone measurement (luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen), tracking basal body temperatures, cervical mucus investigation, calendar charting and ultrasonography. This review considered the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the use of timed intercourse on positive pregnancy outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and risks of ovulation prediction methods for timing intercourse on conception in couples trying to conceive. 
Search methods
We searched the following sources to identify relevant randomised controlled trials, the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, LILACS, Web of Knowledge, the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Register Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Furthermore, we manually searched the references of relevant articles. The search was not restricted by language or publication status. The last search was on 5 August 2014. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction or comparing different methods of ovulation prediction for timing intercourse against each other in couples trying to conceive. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The primary review outcomes were cumulative live birth and adverse events (such as quality of life, depression and stress). Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, pregnancy (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) and time to conception. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods. 
Main results
We included five RCTs (2840 women or couples) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction. Unfortunately one large study (n = 1453) reporting live birth and pregnancy had not published outcome data by randomised group and therefore could not be analysed. Consequently, four RCTs (n = 1387) were included in the meta‐analysis. The evidence was of low to very low quality. Main limitations for downgrading the evidence included imprecision, lack of reporting clinically relevant outcomes and the high risk of publication bias. 
One study reported live birth, but the sample size was too small to draw any relevant conclusions on the effect of timed intercourse (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.41, 1 RCT, n = 17, very low quality). One study reported stress as an adverse event. There was no evidence of a difference in levels of stress (mean difference 1.98, 95 CI% ‐0.87 to 4.83, 1 RCT, n = 77, low level evidence). No other studies reported adverse events. Two studies reported clinical pregnancy. There was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.12, 2 RCTs, n = 177, I2 = 0%, low level evidence). This suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 16%, the chance of success following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%.Four studies reported pregnancy rate (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy). Timed intercourse was associated with higher pregnancy rates compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction in couples trying to conceive (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.71, 4 RCTs, n = 1387, I2 = 0%, very low level evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. Subgroup analysis by duration of subfertility showed no difference in effect between couples trying to conceive for < 12 months versus couples trying for ≥ 12 months. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. 
Authors' conclusions
There are insufficient data available to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of timed intercourse for the outcomes of live birth, adverse events and clinical pregnancy. Timed intercourse may improve pregnancy rates (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction. The quality of this evidence is low to very low and therefore findings should be regarded with caution. There is a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished 8 years after recruitment finished. Further research is required, reporting clinically relevant outcomes (live birth, clinical pregnancy rates and adverse effects), to determine if timed intercourse is safe and effective in couples trying to conceive. 
","## Plain Title
Learning About When to Have Sex to Get Pregnant

## Rationale
Many couples want to have a baby. But about 1 or 2 out of every 10 couples have trouble. This is called subfertility. It means it is harder for them to get pregnant.

One reason for this problem can be when they have sex. A woman can only get pregnant a few days a month. This is around the time she releases an egg. This is called ovulation. Having sex during this time makes it more likely to get pregnant.

Doctors call this ""timed intercourse."" It means using methods to find out when a woman is ovulating. Then, couples can have sex at the right time. This might help couples get pregnant faster. It might also help them avoid unneeded tests or treatments. But it can also cause stress or take a lot of time.

This study looked at many ways to predict ovulation. These include checking pee for hormones or watching body temperature. The main goal was to see if timed intercourse helps couples get pregnant. We also wanted to see if it causes any problems.

## Trial Design
This study looked at other studies. These studies were called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, some couples used timed intercourse. Other couples just had sex without trying to time it. Or, they compared different ways to time sex.

The studies looked at couples who were trying to get pregnant. This review did not say how old the couples were. It also did not say how long each person was in the studies.

Two people checked all the studies. They made sure the studies were good and gathered the facts. The main things they looked for were if a baby was born alive. They also looked for bad effects like stress. Other things they checked were if a woman got pregnant. They also looked at how long it took to get pregnant.

## Results
We looked at five studies in total. These studies included 2840 women or couples. But one very large study could not be used. It did not share all its results. So, we used four studies with 1387 people.

The results from these studies were not very strong. This means we need to be careful with what we learn. This is because some studies did not give exact numbers. Some did not report important things like live births. It is also possible some studies were not published.

Only one study looked at live births. It was very small. So, we cannot say much from it.

One study looked at stress. It showed no clear difference in stress levels. Timed intercourse did not seem to make people more or less stressed.

Two studies looked at clinical pregnancy. This is when a doctor confirms a pregnancy. These studies showed no clear difference in how many women got pregnant. If 16 out of 100 women got pregnant without timing sex, then 9 to 33 out of 100 might get pregnant with timing sex.

Four studies looked at any pregnancy. This included pregnancies that women reported themselves. These studies showed that timed intercourse might lead to more pregnancies. If 13 out of 100 women got pregnant without timing sex, then 14 to 23 out of 100 might get pregnant with timing sex. We also looked at how long couples had tried to get pregnant. It did not change the results. One study looked at how long it took to get pregnant. It found no clear difference.

We do not have enough facts to say for sure if timed intercourse helps with live births. We also do not have enough facts about stress or clinical pregnancy. But it might help more women get pregnant in general.

The facts we have are not very strong. We need more studies. These new studies should look at live births and actual pregnancies. They should also look at any bad effects. This will help us know if timed intercourse is safe and truly helpful.","Timed intercourse for couples with subfertility
Review question 
Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the effect of timed intercourse versus spontaneous intercourse in couples trying to conceive. 
Background 
Many couples find it difficult to achieve a pregnancy and have concerns about their fertility. Each cycle, a woman is fertile from approximately five days before ovulation until several hours after ovulation, due to limited survival times of the sperm and egg. Therefore, prospectively identifying this fertile period of a woman's menstrual cycle, to guide timing of intercourse, may improve conception rates. This may reduce unnecessary medical treatment and costs of advanced infertility treatment, but could also cause adverse events such as stress. The fertile period can be identified by different methods including urinary fertility monitoring, calendar charting, observing changes in cervical mucous and basal body temperatures or follicular maturation on ultrasound. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and risks of timed intercourse on pregnancy outcomes in couples trying to conceive. 
Study characteristics 
We found five randomised controlled trials comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction, in a total of 2840 women or couples trying to conceive. The evidence was current to August 2014. 
Key results 
One large included study (1453 women) has not published usable results and could therefore not be analysed. One study reported live birth rates and found no evidence of a difference; however, the study was too small to have any clinical value. Only one study reported levels of stress and showed no evidence of a difference between timed intercourse with urinary fertility monitoring and intercourse without urinary fertility monitoring. No other adverse events were reported. Only two studies reported clinical pregnancy rates, and showed no evidence of a difference in pregnancy rates in couples with subfertility. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was assumed to be 16%, the chance of a clinical pregnancy following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%. However, if including self‐reported pregnancies (not confirmed by ultrasound), pregnancy rates were higher after timed intercourse. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. 
No difference in effect was found between couples trying to conceive for less than 12 months versus 12 months or more. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low for all outcomes. The main limitations of the evidence were imprecision, poor reporting of clinically relevant outcomes and a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished. Therefore, the findings should be regarded with caution. 
"
10.1002-14651858.CD013792.pub2,"Background
Miscarriage, defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks’ gestation, is common with approximately 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime, and 15% to 20% of pregnancies ending in a miscarriage. Progesterone has an important role in maintaining a pregnancy, and supplementation with different progestogens in early pregnancy has been attempted to rescue a pregnancy in women with early pregnancy bleeding (threatened miscarriage), and to prevent miscarriages in asymptomatic women who have a history of three or more previous miscarriages (recurrent miscarriage). 
Objectives
To estimate the relative effectiveness and safety profiles for the different progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage, and provide rankings of the available treatments according to their effectiveness, safety, and side‐effect profile. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to 15 December 2020: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE(R), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness or safety of progestogen treatment for the prevention of miscarriage. Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Randomised trials published only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information could be retrieved. We excluded quasi‐ and non‐randomised trials. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We performed pairwise meta‐analyses and indirect comparisons, where possible, to determine the relative effects of all available treatments, but due to the limited number of included studies only direct or indirect comparisons were possible. We estimated the relative effects for the primary outcome of live birth and the secondary outcomes including miscarriage (< 24 weeks of gestation), preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, congenital abnormalities, and adverse drug events. Relative effects for all outcomes are reported separately by the type of miscarriage (threatened and recurrent miscarriage). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
Our meta‐analysis included seven randomised trials involving 5,682 women, and all provided data for meta‐analysis. All trials were conducted in hospital settings. Across seven trials (14 treatment arms), the following treatments were used: three arms (21%) used vaginal micronized progesterone; three arms (21%) used dydrogesterone; one arm (7%) used oral micronized progesterone; one arm (7%) used 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone, and six arms (43%) used placebo. 
Women with threatened miscarriage  
Based on the relative effects from the pairwise meta‐analysis, vaginal micronized progesterone (two trials, 4090 women, risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.07, high‐certainty evidence), and dydrogesterone (one trial, 406 women, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.07, moderate‐certainty evidence) probably make little or no difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo for women with threatened miscarriage. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with threatened miscarriage. 
The pre‐specified subgroup analysis by number of previous miscarriages is only possible for vaginal micronized progesterone in women with threatened miscarriage. In women with no previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, there is probably little or no improvement in the live birth rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04, high‐certainty evidence) when treated with vaginal micronized progesterone compared to placebo. However, for women with one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, vaginal micronized progesterone increases the live birth rate compared to placebo (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15, high‐certainty evidence). 
Women with recurrent miscarriage  
Based on the results from one trial (826 women) vaginal micronized progesterone (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.15, high‐certainty evidence) probably makes little or no difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage. The evidence for dydrogesterone compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage is of very low‐certainty evidence, therefore the effects remain unclear. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage. 
Additional outcomes  
All progestogen treatments have a wide range of effects on the other pre‐specified outcomes (miscarriage (< 24 weeks of gestation), preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy) in comparison to placebo for both threatened and recurrent miscarriage. Moderate‐ and low‐certainty evidence with a wide range of effects suggests that there is probably no difference in congenital abnormalities and adverse drug events with vaginal micronized progesterone for threatened (congenital abnormalities RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.46, moderate‐certainty evidence; adverse drug events RR 1.07 95% CI 0.81 to 1.39, moderate‐certainty evidence) or recurrent miscarriage (congenital abnormalities 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.85, low‐certainty evidence; adverse drug events RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.29, moderate‐certainty evidence) compared with placebo. There are limited data and very low‐certainty evidence on congenital abnormalities and adverse drug events for the other progestogens. 
Authors' conclusions
The overall available evidence suggests that progestogens probably make little or no difference to live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. However, vaginal micronized progesterone may increase the live birth rate for women with a history of one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, with likely no difference in adverse events. There is still uncertainty over the effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage.

## Plain Title: Help for Women Who Lose a Baby

### Rationale

Losing a baby before 24 weeks of pregnancy is called a miscarriage. This is common. About one in four women will have a miscarriage in their life. Between one and two out of every ten pregnancies end in a miscarriage. This can be very hard for women and their families.

A hormone called progesterone helps a pregnancy grow. Doctors have tried giving extra progesterone to women. They hope it will save a pregnancy. Some women have bleeding early in pregnancy. This is called a ""threatened miscarriage."" Other women have had three or more miscarriages before. This is called ""recurrent miscarriage."" They get extra progesterone to try and stop another loss.

This study looked at different types of progesterone. We wanted to see how well they work. We also checked if they are safe. We wanted to know the best ways to use them to help women.

### Trial Design

This study asked: ""How well do progesterone treatments work to prevent miscarriage?""

We looked at studies that already happened. These were called ""randomized controlled trials."" In these studies, some women got progesterone. Other women got a dummy pill, called a placebo. This helps us see if the treatment really works. We searched many places for these studies. We looked at studies up to December 2020.

We included studies that looked at progesterone for preventing miscarriage. We looked at how well it worked. We also looked at how safe it was. We wanted to find out if the treatments helped women have a live baby. We also checked for things like early birth or birth defects.

We looked at studies that included women of different ages. They all had early pregnancy bleeding. Or they had a history of losing babies. We combined the results from many studies. This helped us get a clearer picture.

### Results

We looked at seven studies. These studies included 5,682 women in total. All these studies took place in hospitals. The studies tested different types of progesterone. Some women got vaginal progesterone. Some got dydrogesterone. Some got oral progesterone. Some got 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. Others got a dummy pill (placebo).

**For women with early pregnancy bleeding (threatened miscarriage):**

*   Vaginal progesterone did not greatly change the chance of a live birth. This was compared to a dummy pill.
*   Dydrogesterone also did not greatly change the chance of a live birth. This was compared to a dummy pill.
*   We did not have enough information for other types of progesterone.

*   **But there was good news for some women.** If a woman had early pregnancy bleeding *and* had lost one or more babies before, vaginal progesterone helped. It increased their chance of having a live baby. For women who had bleeding but no past miscarriages, it did not help much.

**For women who lost many babies before (recurrent miscarriage):**

*   Vaginal progesterone did not greatly change the chance of a live birth. This was compared to a dummy pill.
*   We are not sure about dydrogesterone. We did not have enough strong information.
*   We did not have enough information for other types of progesterone.

**Other important results:**

*   Progesterone treatments did not seem to cause more birth defects. They also did not cause more side effects. This was true for both types of miscarriage.
*   We need more research on other types of progesterone.

**What the study means:**

Overall, progesterone treatments may not greatly change the chance of a live birth for many women. But vaginal progesterone can help women with early pregnancy bleeding *and* a history of losing babies. It seems safe to use. We still need to learn more about other progesterone treatments.","Are progestogen treatments effective in preventing miscarriage?
We set out to find out which progestogen treatment is most effective, safe, and has fewer side‐effects for preventing miscarriage in women with threatened and with recurrent miscarriage, using evidence from randomised controlled trials. We looked at the number of women who went on to have a live birth, or miscarriage. 
What is the issue? 
Miscarriage is the most common cause of early pregnancy loss in the first 24 weeks and one of the most common complications in early pregnancy. An estimated 15% to 20% of pregnancies will end in a miscarriage, with 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. Women can be at risk of a miscarriage if they experience early pregnancy bleeding, or if they have a history of previous miscarriages. 
Why is this important? 
Progesterone is an important pregnancy hormone that helps to maintain a pregnancy. A variety of different progesterone‐like treatments (known as progestogens) have been used to treat women with early pregnancy bleeding. They are also used to prevent miscarriage in women with a history of previous miscarriages. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness, safety, and side‐effects of the available progestogens for preventing miscarriage in these different groups of women. We wanted to find out which, if any, of the treatments is the most effective and safest. We collected and analysed all the relevant studies to answer this question. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in December 2020 and identified seven studies involving 5,682 women. All women were managed in hospitals. Women were diagnosed with early pregnancy bleeding (known as threatened miscarriage), or had a history of three or more previous miscarriages (known as recurrent miscarriage). Four different progestogen treatments were used: vaginal micronized progesterone, oral dydrogesterone, oral micronized progesterone and 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone injected into muscle. In six of the studies the treatments were compared to inactive placebo. 
Three studies involved 4496 women with threatened miscarriage, some of whom had previously experienced a miscarriage. Overall, vaginal micronized progesterone (high‐quality evidence) and oral dydrogesterone (moderate‐quality evidence) made little difference to the number of women who went on to have a live birth when compared with placebo. We further studied the women who had experienced a previous miscarriage, were now presenting with a threatened miscarriage, and were given vaginal micronized progesterone or placebo. For women with one or more previous miscarriages, vaginal micronized progesterone increased the live birth rate compared to placebo (high‐quality evidence). Those women who had no previous miscarriages, but were now presenting with early pregnancy bleeding showed no improvement in live birth rate (high‐certainty evidence). 
For women with recurrent miscarriage, we based our findings on one study involving 826 women. Overall, vaginal micronized progesterone made little difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo. The evidence for dydrogesterone compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage is of very low‐certainty evidence, therefore the effects remain unclear. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage. 
From the available data, there are likely no differences in adverse events associated with vaginal micronized progesterone. There was no difference in birth defects and side effects with vaginal micronized progesterone when compared with placebo. There was not enough information about safety and birth defects for us to analyse for all the other treatments. 
What does this mean? 
The overall available evidence suggests that progestogens probably make little or no difference to live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. Vaginal micronized progesterone may increase the live birth rate for women who are experiencing early pregnancy bleeding and have a history of one or more previous miscarriages, with likely no difference in adverse events. There is still uncertainty over the effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage.

Human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a severe disease affecting people in the poorest parts of Africa. It is usually fatal without treatment. Conventional treatments require days of intravenous infusion, but a recently developed drug, fexinidazole, can be given orally. Another oral drug candidate, acoziborole, is undergoing clinical development and will be considered in subsequent editions.   
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of currently used drugs for treating second‐stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense trypanosomiasis (gambiense human African trypanosomiasis, g‐HAT). 
Search methods
On 14 May 2021, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database, BIOSIS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also searched reference lists of included studies, contacted researchers working in the field, and contacted relevant organizations. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials that included adults and children with second‐stage g‐HAT, treated with anti‐trypanosomal drugs currently in use. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias; a third review author acted as an arbitrator if needed. The included trial only reported dichotomous outcomes, which we presented as risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).   
Main results
We included one trial comparing fexinidazole to nifurtimox combined with eflornithine (NECT). This trial was conducted between October 2012 and November 2016 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic, and included 394 participants. The study reported on efficacy and safety, with up to 24 months' follow‐up.  We judged the study to be at low risk of bias in all domains except blinding;  as the route of administration and dosing regimens differed between treatment groups,  participants and personnel were not blinded, resulting in a high risk of performance bias.   
Mortality with fexinidazole may be higher at 24 months compared to NECT. There were 9/264 deaths in the fexinidazole group and 2/130 deaths in the NECT group (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.49 to 10.11; 394 participants; low‐certainty evidence). None of the deaths were related to treatment. 
Fexinidazole likely results in an increase in the number of people relapsing during follow‐up, with 14 participants in the fexinidazole group (14/264) and none in the NECT group (0/130) relapsing at 24 months (RD 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.08; 394 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
 We are uncertain whether there is any difference between the drugs regarding the incidence of serious adverse events at 24 months. (31/264 with fexinidazole and 13/130 with NECT group at 24 months). Adverse events were common with both drugs (247/264 with fexinidazole versus 121/130 with NECT), with no difference between groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; 394 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Authors' conclusions
Oral treatment with fexinidazole is much easier to administer than conventional treatment, but deaths and relapse appear to be more common. However, the advantages or an oral option are considerable, in terms of convenience, avoiding hospitalisation and multiple intravenous infusions, thus increasing adherence.

New Pill for Sleeping Sickness: How Good Is It?

### Rationale

Sleeping sickness is a very bad disease. It affects people in Africa. Without help, people usually die. Old treatments need many shots into a vein. This takes many days in the hospital. This is hard for patients. A new drug, fexinidazole, is a pill. We want to know if this pill works well. We also want to know if it is safe for people. This study helps us learn if a pill can treat sleeping sickness.

### Trial Design

How was this study set up? We looked at studies that compared drugs for sleeping sickness. These studies included adults and kids. All these people had the second stage of sleeping sickness. This is when the disease is more serious. We looked for studies that randomly put people into groups. This means each person had an equal chance to get a certain drug. This helps us see which drug works best. We searched many places to find all such studies. We wanted to see how well and how safe the drugs were. We only found one study to use for our review.

The one study we found compared fexinidazole to an older drug mix. The older drug mix was called NECT. This study had 394 people. It took place in two African countries. People in the study were watched for up to two years. This helped us see long-term effects.

### Results

What did we find out? We looked at one main study. This study compared fexinidazole pills to NECT. NECT is given as shots.

More people died with fexinidazole. For every 264 people on fexinidazole, 9 died. For every 130 people on NECT, 2 died. The study showed that deaths might be more common with fexinidazole. But the deaths were not caused by the drugs.

More people got sick again with fexinidazole. For every 264 people on fexinidazole, 14 got sick again. No one on NECT got sick again. This means fexinidazole might not stop the disease as well.

Both drugs had side effects. About 247 out of 264 people on fexinidazole had side effects. About 121 out of 130 people on NECT had side effects. There was no clear difference in side effects between the two drugs.

The doctors concluded that taking a pill like fexinidazole is much easier. People do not need to stay in the hospital. They do not need many shots. This makes it easier to take the medicine. But the pill might not work as well. More people might die or get sick again. But the ease of taking a pill is a big plus. It helps more people get treatment.","Medicines for second‐stage human African trypanosomiasis
What is the aim of this review? 
Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (g‐HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a severe disease transmitted through the bite of infected tsetse flies found in rural parts of sub‐Saharan Africa. Sleeping sickness has two clinical stages. This review only examines treating the second‐stage, where people develop symptoms caused by invasion of the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in changes in the nervous system. Death is inevitable without treatment. Drugs for treatment are few, often require intravenous infusion every day over several weeks, and have serious side effects. In this review we aimed to compare the effects of current drugs for gambiense sleeping sickness and we examined nifurtimox‐eflornithine combination (NECT) with a new drug, fexinidazole, that can be taken orally. 
Key messages 
Whilst fexinidazole cures some people, deaths from any cause and treatment failure rates are higher than with conventional treatment. Adverse events were common in both groups. Fexinidazole is more practical to give, and means less time in hospital for intravenous treatment infusion. 
What was studied in this review? 
We looked at the evidence about the benefits and harms of current drugs used in people with second stage g‐HAT. We searched for randomized trials, which provide robust evidence about the various treatments. We aimed to determine whether any drug provides a definite advantage over the other, measured in terms of clinical outcomes and in relation to the severity of adverse effects. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We only identified one suitable trial, which included 394 people and was conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. The trial showed that deaths from any cause at 24 months may be higher with fexinidazole compared with NECT. Nine of the 264 people who took fexinidazole died, compared with two of the 130 people who took NECT. Fexinidazole probably increases the number of people who relapse during two years. Fourteen people in the fexinidazole group relapsed, and none in the NECT group. Adverse events were very common in both groups over the two years, and there is not likely to be much difference between the two drugs (247/264 in the fexinidazole group and 121/130 in the NECT group). We do not know about the effect of fexinidazole on serious adverse events, as the evidence is very uncertain. There were 31/264 serious adverse events in the fexinidazole group and 13/130 in the NECT group at 24 months.  
How up to date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 14 May 2021.

18F‐florbetapir uptake by brain tissue measured by positron emission tomography (PET) is accepted by regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agencies (EMA) for assessing amyloid load in people with dementia. Its added value is mainly demonstrated by excluding Alzheimer's pathology in an established dementia diagnosis. However, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA‐AA) revised the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease and confidence in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease may be increased when using amyloid biomarkers tests like 18F‐florbetapir. These tests, added to the MCI core clinical criteria, might increase the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of a testing strategy. However, the DTA of 18F‐florbetapir to predict the progression from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia (ADD) or other dementias has not yet been systematically evaluated. 
Objectives
To determine the DTA of the 18F‐florbetapir PET scan for detecting people with MCI at time of performing the test who will clinically progress to ADD, other forms of dementia (non‐ADD), or any form of dementia at follow‐up. 
Search methods
This review is current to May 2017. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), BIOSIS Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection, including the Science Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science) and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/). We also searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia & Cognitive Improvement Group’s specialised register of dementia studies (http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois/). We checked the reference lists of any relevant studies and systematic reviews, and performed citation tracking using the Science Citation Index to identify any additional relevant studies. No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches. 
Selection criteria
We included studies that had prospectively defined cohorts with any accepted definition of MCI at time of performing the test and the use of 18F‐florbetapir scan to evaluate the DTA of the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia. In addition, we only selected studies that applied a reference standard for Alzheimer’s dementia diagnosis, for example, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS‐ADRDA) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders‐IV (DSM‐IV) criteria. 
Data collection and analysis
We screened all titles and abstracts identified in electronic‐database searches. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data to create two‐by‐two tables, showing the binary test results cross‐classified with the binary reference standard. We used these data to calculate sensitivities, specificities, and their 95% confidence intervals. Two independent assessors performed quality assessment using the QUADAS‐2 tool plus some additional items to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. 
Main results
We included three studies, two of which evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, and one evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. 
Progression from MCI to ADD was evaluated in 448 participants. The studies reported data on 401 participants with 1.6 years of follow‐up and in 47 participants with three years of follow‐up. Sixty‐one (15.2%) participants converted at 1.6 years follow‐up; nine (19.1%) participants converted at three years of follow‐up. 
Progression from MCI to any form of dementia was evaluated in five participants with 1.5 years of follow‐up, with three (60%) participants converting to any form of dementia. 
There were concerns regarding applicability in the reference standard in all three studies. Regarding the domain of flow and timing, two studies were considered at high risk of bias. 
MCI to ADD;
Progression from MCI to ADD in those with a follow‐up between two to less than four years had a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 30 to 93) and a specificity of 71% (95% CI 54 to 85) by visual assessment (n = 47, 1 study). 
Progression from MCI to ADD in those with a follow‐up between one to less than two years had a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 78 to 95) and a specificity of 58% (95% CI 53 to 64) by visual assessment, and a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI 76 to 94) and a specificity of 51% (95% CI 45 to 56) by quantitative assessment by the standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR)(n = 401, 1 study). 
MCI to any form of dementia;
Progression from MCI to any form of dementia in those with a follow‐up between one to less than two years had a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI 9 to 99) and a specificity of 50% (95% CI 1 to 99) by visual assessment (n = 5, 1 study). 
MCI to any other forms of dementia (non‐ADD);
There was no information regarding the progression from MCI to any other form of dementia (non‐ADD). 
Authors' conclusions
Although sensitivity was good in one included study, considering the poor specificity and the limited data available in the literature, we cannot recommend routine use of 18F‐florbetapir PET in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD. 
Because of the poor sensitivity and specificity, limited number of included participants, and the limited data available in the literature, we cannot recommend its routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. 
Because of the high financial costs of 18F‐florbetapir, clearly demonstrating the DTA and standardising the process of this modality are important prior to its wider use.

Brain Scans and Memory Loss: Can They Predict Alzheimer's?

## Rationale

Some people have mild memory problems. Doctors call this mild cognitive impairment, or MCI. People with MCI sometimes get worse. They can develop Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's makes it hard to think and remember. It is a big problem for many patients.

A special brain scan can see changes in the brain. This scan uses a tracer called 18F-florbetapir. It helps doctors see something called amyloid. Amyloid builds up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.

We wanted to know if this scan helps predict who will get Alzheimer's. If the scan can tell us this, it could help patients. They might get help sooner.

## Trial Design

This study looked at past research. We searched many databases. We looked for studies about MCI and the 18F-florbetapir scan.

We chose studies that followed people over time. These people had MCI. They had the scan. Doctors then watched them. They saw if they got Alzheimer's or other memory problems. We only picked studies that used clear rules to say someone had Alzheimer's.

We looked at how good the scan was. Did it correctly find people who would get Alzheimer's? Did it correctly find people who would not?

## Results

We found three studies to review. These studies looked at 453 people in total. Most of these people were followed for about one to two years.

One study looked at 47 people. After about three years, the scan found 7 out of 10 people who got Alzheimer's. It also correctly found 7 out of 10 people who did not.

Another study looked at 401 people. After about one to two years, the scan found about 9 out of 10 people who got Alzheimer's. But it only found about 6 out of 10 people who did not.

One small study looked at 5 people. It looked at who got any kind of memory problem. The scan found 7 out of 10 people who got worse. It found 5 out of 10 people who did not.

Overall, the scan was good at finding people who later got Alzheimer's. But it was not very good at finding people who did *not* get Alzheimer's. There were also concerns about how well the studies were done.

Because of this, we cannot say for sure. We cannot suggest using this scan for everyone. It does not clearly predict who will get worse. The scan is also very costly. More studies are needed to see if it truly helps patients.","18F‐florbetapir PET scan for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment 
Review question: In people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), does using a 18F PET scan with florbetapir predict the progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) and other dementias? 
Background 
Due to global ageing, the number of people with dementia is expected to increase dramatically in the next few decades. Diagnosing dementia at an early stage is desirable, but there is no widespread agreement on the best approach. A range of simple pen and paper tests used by healthcare professionals can assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. Whether or not using special PET scans that detect amyloid —one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease— improves our ability to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia remains unclear. Since these tests are expensive, it is important that they provide additional benefits. 
Aim 
We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the 18F‐florbetapir PET scan in identifying those people with MCI who clinically progress to ADD, other types of dementia, or any form of dementia over a period of time. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to May 2017. We found three studies including 453 participants with MCI. Two studies evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD and one study evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. 
Regarding the two studies that evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, one study had 401 participants with a follow‐up of 1.6 years and the mean age was 72 years. The other study had 47 participants with a follow‐up of three years, and the mean age was 72 years. 
The other study that looked at any form of dementia included 5 participants over 90 years old. 
Two of the studies were funded by the test manufacturer.
Quality of the evidence 
The main limitation of this review was that our findings were based on only three studies, with insufficient detail on how the people were selected, whether the information from the scan was assessed separately from the final diagnosis. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias due to potential conflicts of interest detected. 
Key findings 
In this review, we found the following results based on the three studies.
At a follow‐up of 1.6 years, using visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 89% of the participants who progressed to ADD but only 58% of the participants who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 15% of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 of 15 people to have a positive result and the other 2 participants to be falsely negative. Also 49 people who will not develop ADD would have a negative result, but 36 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). 
In the study that followed up people for three years and used visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 67% of people who progressed to ADD and 71% who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 19 of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 people to have a positive result of the scan and 6 people to have a falsely negative result. In addition, 58 of 81 participants who will not progress to ADD would have a negative result, but 23 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). The small number of participants evaluated at three years lowered our confidence on these estimates of accuracy. 
Regarding progression to any form of dementia, the extremely small number of participants meant that we were unable to provide meaningful estimates of accuracy. 
We conclude that 18F‐florbetapir PET scans cannot be recommended for routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or any form of dementia based on the currently available data. More studies are needed to demonstrate its usefulness.

Toxoplasmosis infection is caused by a parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Eating or handling raw or insufficiently‐cooked meat, not washing hands thoroughly after gardening, handling contaminated soil or water, or contact with cats' faeces can cause infection. Usually it is asymptomatic and self‐limiting. Primary prevention involves educating the general public, filtering water and improving farm hygiene to reduce animal infection. 
If pregnant women have not previously been exposed to the parasite and develop antibodies while pregnant, the infection can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus (congenital toxoplasmosis). This is rare but potentially has serious consequences such as malformation, mental retardation, deafness and blindness of the infected infant, intrauterine death or stillbirth. The probability of infection is greater during the third trimester but the risk of the fetus developing major clinical signs is greater early in pregnancy. Pregnant women are often unaware of risk factors for congenital toxoplasmosis. Offering prenatal education could mean that women adopt simple behavioral measures to avoid toxoplasmosis. 
This review included two randomized controlled trials (involving 5455 women). Data could not be combined because each trial measured effectiveness in different ways. One study was from Canada and involved 432 women randomly assigned to a 10‐minute presentation during a prenatal class about toxoplasmosis prevention or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 285 completed the post‐test questionnaire in the third trimester. Only 5% of the intervention women recalled having obtained information on toxoplasmosis prevention during prenatal classes. However, the authors concluded that prenatal education can effectively change pregnant women's behavior as it increased pet, personal and food hygiene. The other trial conducted in France involved 5023 pregnant women with no evidence of toxoplasmosis infection (seronegative) who were randomly assigned to receive a brochure and an audiotape containing information for toxoplasmosis prevention, or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 2790 completed both pre‐test and post‐test questionnaire on behavior (44.5% loss to follow‐up), whereas 3949 women were tested for blood antibodies (22.4% loss to follow‐up). Women's behavior did not change after the intervention. Similarly, the seroconversion rate did not differ between groups (13 out of 2591 women seroconverted in the intervention and four out of 1358 in the control group). 
Both trials were judged as having low methodological quality as assessed by the GRADE approach. This limits our confidence in the results. Evidence supporting prenatal education to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis is therefore limited.

Teaching Pregnant Women About a Parasite Infection

### Rationale

A small bug called *Toxoplasma gondii* can cause an illness called toxoplasmosis. You can get this bug from eating meat that is not cooked enough. You can also get it from dirt or cat waste. Most of the time, this illness is not serious for most people. It often goes away on its own.

But this bug can be very bad for a baby if a pregnant woman gets infected. This is called congenital toxoplasmosis. It can cause problems like birth defects. It can also cause blindness or deafness. Sometimes, it can cause a baby to die before birth.

Women who are pregnant often do not know how to avoid this bug. We need to teach them simple ways to stay safe. If women learn how to avoid the bug, it could help protect their babies. This study looked at teaching pregnant women about this infection.

### Trial Design

**How is this study designed?**

This study looked at two past studies. These studies checked if teaching pregnant women about toxoplasmosis worked.

One study was in Canada. It had 432 women. Some women got a 10-minute talk about how to stop the infection. Other women went to a normal class. They then filled out a paper later in pregnancy.

The other study was in France. It had 5023 pregnant women. These women did not have the infection yet. Some women got a booklet and a tape with safety tips. Other women went to a normal class. They filled out papers about their habits. Some also had blood tests.

These studies checked how women's habits changed. They also looked at how many women got the infection. The studies followed women for the rest of their pregnancy.

### Results

**What were the main results of the study?**

The results from the two studies were different. We could not combine them.

In the Canada study, a small number of women remembered the safety tips. But the study found that women changed their habits. They were better at cleaning pets, themselves, and their food. This might help stop the infection.

In the France study, women's habits did not change. The number of women who got the infection was the same in both groups. There were 13 women who got the infection after learning about it. There were 4 women who got the infection in the normal class group.

Both studies had some issues with how they were done. This means we cannot fully trust the results.

**Conclusion:**

There is not enough strong proof that teaching pregnant women about this infection helps prevent it. More studies are needed to be sure.","Prenatal education for congenital toxoplasmosis

Hospital‐acquired pneumonia is one of the most common hospital‐acquired infections in children worldwide. Most of our understanding of hospital‐acquired pneumonia in children is derived from adult studies. To our knowledge, no systematic review with meta‐analysis has assessed the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens in neonates and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia. 
Objectives
To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in neonates and children. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trial registers to February 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials comparing one antibiotic regimen with any other antibiotic regimen for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in neonates and children. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality and serious adverse events; our secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, pneumonia‐related mortality, non‐serious adverse events, and treatment failure. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow‐up. 
Main results
We included four randomised clinical trials (84 participants). We assessed all trials as having high risk of bias. 
We did not conduct any meta‐analyses, as the included trials did not compare similar antibiotic regimens. 
Each of the four trials assessed a different comparison, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Only one trial reported our primary outcomes of all‐cause mortality and serious adverse events. Three trials reported our secondary outcome of treatment failure. Two trials primarily included community‐acquired pneumonia and hospitalised children with bacterial infections, hence the children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia constituted subgroups of the total sample sizes. 
Where outcomes were reported, the certainty of the evidence was very low for each of the comparisons. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
None of the included trials assessed health‐related quality of life, pneumonia‐related mortality, or non‐serious adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions
The relative beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the very low certainty of the available evidence. The current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. Randomised clinical trials assessing different antibiotic regimens for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in children and neonates are warranted. 
","## Plain Language Summary

### Plain Title
Studying the Best Germ-Fighting Drugs for Kids in the Hospital

### Rationale
Sometimes, kids in the hospital get sick with an infection in their lungs. This is called hospital-acquired pneumonia. It is a common problem for children all over the world. This lung infection can make kids very ill. It can cause them to stay in the hospital longer. It can even be very serious.

Doctors often use special drugs called antibiotics to fight these germs. But we do not know enough about which antibiotics work best for children with this type of lung infection. Most of what we know comes from studies in adults. Kids are different from adults, so what works for adults may not be best for children.

This study wanted to find out which antibiotic drugs are the safest and work the best for babies and children who get pneumonia in the hospital. We wanted to see if one drug was better than another at helping kids get well. We also wanted to see if any drugs caused bad side effects. Finding the best treatment can help kids get better faster and be safer.

### Trial Design
This study looked at many other research studies. We wanted to find studies that compared different germ-fighting drugs (antibiotics). We only looked for studies that included babies and children. These studies had to be ""randomized clinical trials."" This means the kids were put into groups by chance. Each group got a different antibiotic. This helps make sure the results are fair.

We searched many health databases and trial records. We looked for studies up until February of 2021. We also checked references in papers and asked study authors for more information.

Three different people reviewed each study. They made sure the studies met our rules. They also pulled out important information. We looked at how well the studies were done. We wanted to see if the studies were fair and had good information.

Our main goal was to see if the drugs stopped kids from dying or caused serious problems. We also looked at other things. These included how well kids felt, if the pneumonia itself caused death, if there were small problems from the drugs, and if the drugs failed to work. We looked at how kids were doing for the longest time recorded in each study.

### Results
We found four studies that met our rules. These studies included a total of 84 children. All of these studies had some issues that made it hard to be sure of their results.

The studies did not compare the same drugs. So, we could not combine their results to get a big picture. Each study looked at a different set of drugs. For example, one study compared ""cefepime"" with ""ceftazidime."" Another compared ""linezolid"" with ""vancomycin."" Another compared ""meropenem"" with ""cefotaxime."" And the last compared ""ceftobiprole"" with ""cephalosporin.""

Only one of the four studies gave us information about kids dying or having serious problems. Three studies talked about the drugs failing to work. Some of these studies also included kids who got pneumonia outside the hospital. So, only some of the children in those studies had the type of pneumonia we were focused on.

The information from these studies was not very strong or clear. This means we cannot say for sure if one drug is better or worse than another. We could not make any strong conclusions from the numbers we saw.

None of the studies looked at how the drugs affected a child's quality of life. They also did not report if the pneumonia itself caused death, or if there were small problems from the drugs.

Right now, we do not have enough clear proof to say which antibiotic drugs are best for babies and children with hospital-acquired pneumonia. We need more and better studies to help doctors make the best choices for these kids.","Antibiotics for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in newborns and children
Review question 
Which antibiotic regimen is safer and more effective in treating neonates (newborns) and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia? 
Background 
Hospital‐acquired pneumonia is an inflammation of the tissue of one or both lungs caused by an infection that occurs during a hospital stay (i.e. 48 hours or more after hospital admission). It is one of the most common hospital‐acquired infections in children worldwide, and is associated with a high death rate. Most of our understanding of hospital‐acquired pneumonia in children is drawn from adult studies. To our knowledge this is the first review with meta‐analysis that assesses the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens in newborns and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to February 2021.
Study characteristics 
We included four trials randomising 84 children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia to different antibiotic regimens. Three trials were multicentre trials from the USA, Latin America, Europe, and South Africa. The South African trial included one site in Malaysia. Each of the four included trials compared different antibiotic regimens, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Study funding sources 
Three trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Pharmacia Corp, and Basilea Pharmaceutica International Ltd.), indicating a possible risk of bias related to a vested interest risk. 
Key results 
Each of the four included trials compared different antibiotic regimens, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Only one trial reported our primary outcomes of death from all causes and serious adverse events (major complications). Three trials reported our secondary outcome of treatment failure. Two trials primarily included community‐acquired pneumonia and hospitalised children with bacterial infections, hence the children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia constituted only subgroups of the total study populations. 
Where outcomes were reported, the certainty of the evidence was very low for each of the comparisons. We were unable to draw any meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
None of the included trials assessed health‐related quality of life, pneumonia‐related death, or non‐serious adverse events (minor complications). 
Conclusions 
The available evidence does not suggest that one antibiotic regimen is safer and more effective than another in treating newborns and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia. Further research is needed. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of evidence is very low. All four included trials had high risk of bias (i.e. the studies were designed in such a way that the results may have been skewed). In addition, the included trials involved few participants, which is likely to have led to inaccurate results.

10.1002-14651858.MR000051.pub2,"Background
Trial monitoring is an important component of good clinical practice to ensure the safety and rights of study participants, confidentiality of personal information, and quality of data. However, the effectiveness of various existing monitoring approaches is unclear. Information to guide the choice of monitoring methods in clinical intervention studies may help trialists, support units, and monitors to effectively adjust their approaches to current knowledge and evidence. 
Objectives
To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of different monitoring strategies (including risk‐based strategies and others) for clinical intervention studies examined in prospective comparative studies of monitoring interventions. 
Search methods
We systematically searched CENTRAL, PubMed, and Embase via Elsevier for relevant published literature up to March 2021. We searched the online 'Studies within A Trial' (SWAT) repository, grey literature, and trial registries for ongoing or unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized or non‐randomized prospective, empirical evaluation studies of different monitoring strategies in one or more clinical intervention studies. We applied no restrictions for language or date of publication. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on the evaluated monitoring methods, countries involved, study population, study setting, randomization method, and numbers and proportions in each intervention group. Our primary outcome was critical and major monitoring findings in prospective intervention studies. Monitoring findings were classified according to different error domains (e.g. major eligibility violations) and the primary outcome measure was a composite of these domains. Secondary outcomes were individual error domains, participant recruitment and follow‐up, and resource use. If we identified more than one study for a comparison and outcome definitions were similar across identified studies, we quantitatively summarized effects in a meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model. Otherwise, we qualitatively summarized the results of eligible studies stratified by different comparisons of monitoring strategies. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for different groups of comparisons. 
Main results
We identified eight eligible studies, which we grouped into five comparisons.
1. Risk‐based versus extensive on‐site monitoring: based on two large studies, we found moderate certainty of evidence for the combined primary outcome of major or critical findings that risk‐based monitoring is not inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring. Although the risk ratio was close to 'no difference' (1.03 with a 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.81 to 1.33, below 1.0 in favor of the risk‐based strategy), the high imprecision in one study and the small number of eligible studies resulted in a wide CI of the summary estimate. Low certainty of evidence suggested that monitoring strategies with extensive on‐site monitoring were associated with considerably higher resource use and costs (up to a factor of 3.4). Data on recruitment or retention of trial participants were not available. 
2. Central monitoring with triggered on‐site visits versus regular on‐site visits: combining the results of two eligible studies yielded low certainty of evidence with a risk ratio of 1.83 (95% CI 0.51 to 6.55) in favor of triggered monitoring intervention. Data on recruitment, retention, and resource use were not available. 
3. Central statistical monitoring and local monitoring performed by site staff with annual on‐site visits versus central statistical monitoring and local monitoring only: based on one study, there was moderate certainty of evidence that a small number of major and critical findings were missed with the central monitoring approach without on‐site visits: 3.8% of participants in the group without on‐site visits and 6.4% in the group with on‐site visits had a major or critical monitoring finding (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.7; P = 0.03). The absolute number of monitoring findings was very low, probably because defined major and critical findings were very study specific and central monitoring was present in both intervention groups. Very low certainty of evidence did not suggest a relevant effect on participant retention, and very low‐quality evidence indicated an extra cost for on‐site visits of USD 2,035,392. There were no data on recruitment. 
4. Traditional 100% source data verification (SDV) versus targeted or remote SDV: the two studies assessing targeted and remote SDV reported findings only related to source documents. Compared to the final database obtained using the full SDV monitoring process, only a small proportion of remaining errors on overall data were identified using the targeted SDV process in the MONITORING study (absolute difference 1.47%, 95% CI 1.41% to 1.53%). Targeted SDV was effective in the verification of source documents but increased the workload on data management. The other included study was a pilot study which compared traditional on‐site SDV versus remote SDV and found little difference in monitoring findings and the ability to locate data values despite marked differences in remote access in two clinical trial networks. There were no data on recruitment or retention. 
5. Systematic on‐site initiation visit versus on‐site initiation visit upon request: very low certainty of evidence suggested no difference in retention and recruitment between the two approaches. There were no data on critical and major findings or on resource use. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence base is limited in terms of quantity and quality. Ideally, for each of the five identified comparisons, more prospective, comparative monitoring studies nested in clinical trials and measuring effects on all outcomes specified in this review are necessary to draw more reliable conclusions. However, the results suggesting risk‐based, targeted, and mainly central monitoring as an efficient strategy are promising. The development of reliable triggers for on‐site visits is ongoing; different triggers might be used in different settings. More evidence on risk indicators that identify sites with problems or the prognostic value of triggers is needed to further optimize central monitoring strategies. In particular, approaches with an initial assessment of trial‐specific risks that need to be closely monitored centrally during trial conduct with triggered on‐site visits should be evaluated in future research. 
","## How We Watch Over Health Studies

### Rationale

When people join a health study, we must keep them safe. We also need to keep their health data private. Good safety checks are a key part of all health studies. But we do not know the best ways to do these checks. Some ways may work better or cost less.

This study looked at different ways to watch over health studies. We wanted to see what works best. This can help us pick the best way to watch over future health studies. This makes sure people are safe and studies are well-run.

### Trial Design

This study looked at past studies. These past studies compared different ways to watch over health trials. We looked at studies from a few large health databases. We also looked at new or unshared studies.

We chose studies that truly compared one watching method to another. These studies could be random or not random. We did not care about the language of the study. We did not care when it was published.

We took out details from these studies. We looked at the ways they watched over health studies. We looked at where they were done. We looked at the people in the studies. We also looked at any problems they found. Problems could be major or small errors. We also looked at how many people joined the studies. We checked how many stayed in the studies. We also looked at how much money was spent.

If many studies looked at the same thing, we put their results together. This helped us see a bigger picture. If studies were very different, we just wrote down what each one found. We also checked how sure we were about the results.

### Results

We found eight studies that fit our needs. We put these into five groups to compare.

**1. Watching based on risk versus watching everything on-site:**

Two big studies showed that watching based on risk is just as good. It found major problems just as well. But it saved a lot of money. It cost about one-third less. We did not have data on how many people joined or stayed in the studies.

**2. Watching from a main office with site visits only when needed versus regular site visits:**

Two studies showed that visiting sites only when needed might be better. But we are not very sure about this result. We did not have data on how many people joined or stayed in the studies. We also did not have data on costs.

**3. Watching with computers and staff at the site with yearly visits versus watching with computers and staff at the site only:**

One study found that not having site visits missed a few problems. About 4 people out of 100 had a problem when there were no visits. About 6 people out of 100 had a problem when there were visits. The total number of problems was very low. This way saved a lot of money. It saved about two million dollars. It did not seem to change how many people stayed in the study. We did not have data on how many people joined.

**4. Checking all records versus checking some records or checking them from far away:**

Two studies looked at this. Checking only some records still found most errors. But it made more work for data people. The other study found little difference between checking records on-site versus checking them from far away. We did not have data on how many people joined or stayed in the studies.

**5. Always having an in-person first visit versus having one only if asked:**

This did not seem to change how many people joined or stayed in the study. We did not have data on problems found. We also did not have data on costs.

Overall, there are not many good studies on this topic. We need more studies that compare different ways to watch over health trials. These new studies need to look at all the things we cared about. But our results are promising. They show that watching based on risk, checking only some records, and watching from a main office can be good and save money. We need to learn more about how to know when a site visit is truly needed.","New monitoring strategies for clinical trials
Our question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of new monitoring strategies on monitoring findings, participant recruitment, participant follow‐up, and resource use in clinical trials. We also summarized the different components of tested strategies and qualitative evidence from process evaluations. 
Background 
Monitoring a clinical trial is important to ensure the safety of participants and the reliability of results. New methods have been developed for monitoring practices but further assessments of these new methods are needed to see if they do improve effectiveness without being inferior to established methods in terms of patient rights and safety, and quality assurance of trial results. We reviewed studies that examined this question within clinical trials, i.e. studies comparing different monitoring strategies used in clinical trials. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies which covered a variety of monitoring strategies in a wide range of clinical trials, including national and large international trials. They included primary (general), secondary (specialized), and tertiary (highly specialized) health care. The size of the studies ranged from 32 to 4371 participants at one to 196 sites. 
Key results 
We identified five comparisons. The first comparison of risk‐based monitoring versus extensive on‐site monitoring found no evidence that the risk‐based approach is inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring in terms of the proportion of participants with a critical or major monitoring finding not identified by the corresponding method, while resource use was three‐ to five‐fold higher with extensive on‐site monitoring. For the second comparison of central statistical monitoring with triggered on‐site visits versus regular (untriggered) on‐site visits, we found some evidence that central statistical monitoring can identify sites in need of support by an on‐site monitoring intervention. In the third comparison, the evaluation of adding an on‐site visit to local and central monitoring revealed a high percentage of participants with major or critical monitoring findings in the on‐site visit group, but low numbers of absolute monitoring findings in both groups. This means that without on‐site visits, some monitoring findings will be missed, but none of the missed findings had any serious impact on patient safety or the validity of the trial's results. In the fourth comparison, two studies assessed new source data verification processes, which are used to check that data recorded within the trial Case Report Form (CRF) match the primary source data (e.g. medical records), and reported little difference to full source data verification processes for the targeted as well as for the remote approach. In the fifth comparison, one study showed no difference in participant recruitment and participant follow‐up between a monitoring approach with systematic initiation visits versus an approach with initiation visits upon request by study sites. 
Certainty of evidence 
We are moderately certain that risk‐based monitoring is not inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring with respect to critical and major monitoring findings in clinical trials. For the remaining body of evidence, there is low or very low certainty in results due to imprecision, small number of studies, or high risk of bias. Ideally, for each of the five identified comparisons, more high‐quality monitoring studies that measure effects on all outcomes specified in this review are necessary to draw more reliable conclusions. 
"
10.1002-14651858.CD013487,"Background
Multiple myeloma is a bone marrow‐based hematological malignancy accounting for approximately two per cent of cancers. First‐line treatment for transplant‐ineligible individuals consists of multiple drug combinations of bortezomib (V), lenalidomide (R), or thalidomide (T). However, access to these medicines is restricted in many countries worldwide. 
Objectives
To assess and compare the effectiveness and safety of multiple drug combinations of V, R, and T for adults with newly diagnosed transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma and to inform an application for the inclusion of these medicines into the World Health Organization's (WHO) list of essential medicines. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL and MEDLINE, conference proceedings and study registries on 14 February 2019 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing multiple drug combinations of V, R and T for adults with newly diagnosed transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing combination therapies of V, R, and T, plus melphalan and prednisone (MP) or dexamethasone (D) for first‐line treatment of adults with transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma. We excluded trials including adults with relapsed or refractory disease, trials comparing drug therapies to other types of therapy and trials including second‐generation novel agents. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included trials. As effect measures we used hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) and risk ratios (RRs) for adverse events. An HR or RR < 1 indicates an advantage for the intervention compared to the main comparator MP. Where available, we extracted quality of life (QoL) data (scores of standardised questionnaires). Results quoted are from network meta‐analysis (NMA) unless stated. 
Main results
We included 25 studies (148 references) comprising 11,403 participants and 21 treatment regimens. Treatments were differentiated between restricted treatment duration (treatment with a pre‐specified amount of cycles) and continuous therapy (treatment administered until disease progression, the person becomes intolerant to the drug, or treatment given for a prolonged period). Continuous therapies are indicated with a ""c"". Risk of bias was generally high across studies due to the open‐label study design. 
Overall survival (OS) 
Evidence suggests that treatment with RD (HR 0.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.99), median OS 55.2 months (35.2 to 87.0)); TMP (HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.97), median OS: 46.4 months (35.9 to 60.0)); and VRDc (HR 0.49 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.92), median OS 71.0 months (37.8 to 133.8)) probably increases survival compared to median reported OS of 34.8 months with MP (moderate certainty). Treatment with VMP may result in a large increase in OS, compared to MP (HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.45 to 1.07), median OS 49.7 months (32.5 to 77.3)), low certainty). 
Progression‐free survival (PFS) 
Treatment withRD (HR 0.65 (95% CI0.44 to 0.96), median PFS: 24.9 months (16.9 to 36.8)); TMP (HR 0.63 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.78), median PFS:25.7 months (20.8 to 32.4)); VMP (HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.90), median PFS: 28.9 months (18.0 to 46.3)); and VRDc (HR 0.34 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.58), median PFS: 47.6 months (27.9 to 81.0)) may result in a large increase in PFS (low certainty) compared to MP (median reported PFS: 16.2 months). 
Adverse events 
The risk of polyneuropathies may be lower with RD compared to treatment with MP (RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.99), risk for RD: 0.5% (0.1 to 1.8), mean reported risk for MP: 0.9% (10 of 1074 patients affected), low certainty). However, the CIs are also compatible with no difference or an increase in neuropathies. Treatment with TMP (RR 4.44 (95% CI1.77 to 11.11), risk: 4.0% (1.6 to 10.0)) and VMP (RR 88.22 (95% CI 5.36 to 1451.11), risk: 79.4% (4.8 to 1306.0)) probably results in a large increase in polyneuropathies compared to MP (moderate certainty). No study reported the amount of participants with grade ≥ 3 polyneuropathies for treatment with VRDc. 
VMP probably increases the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) compared to MP (RR 1.28 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.54), risk for VMP: 46.2% (38.3 to 55.6), mean risk for MP: 36.1% (177 of 490 patients affected), moderate certainty). RD, TMP, and VRDc were not connected to MP in the network and the risk of SAEs could not be compared. 
Treatment with RD (RR 4.18 (95% CI 2.13 to 8.20), NMA‐risk: 38.5% (19.6 to 75.4)); and TMP (RR 4.10 (95% CI 2.40 to 7.01), risk: 37.7% (22.1 to 64.5)) results in a large increase of withdrawals from the trial due to adverse events (high certainty) compared to MP (mean reported risk: 9.2% (77 of 837 patients withdrew)). The risk is probably slightly increased with VMP (RR 1.06 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.81), risk: 9.75% (5.8 to 16.7), moderate certainty), while it is much increased with VRDc (RR 8.92 (95% CI 3.82 to 20.84), risk: 82.1% (35.1 to 191.7), high certainty) compared to MP. 
Quality of life 
QoL was reported in four studies for seven different treatment regimens (MP, MPc, RD, RMP, RMPc, TMP, TMPc) and was measured with four different tools. Assessment and reporting differed between studies and could not be meta‐analysed. However, all studies reported an improvement of QoL after initiation of anti‐myeloma treatment for all assessed treatment regimens. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on our four pre‐selected comparisons of interest, continuous treatment with VRD had the largest survival benefit compared with MP, while RD and TMP also probably considerably increase survival. However, treatment combinations of V, R, and T also substantially increase the incidence of AEs, and lead to a higher risk of treatment discontinuation. Their effectiveness and safety profiles may best be analysed in further randomised head‐to‐head trials. Further trials should focus on consistent reporting of safety outcomes and should use a standardised instrument to evaluate QoL to ensure comparability of treatment‐combinations. 
","**Plain Title: Better Drug Choices for a Blood Cancer**

**Rationale**

Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer. It affects the bone marrow. This is the soft, spongy tissue inside your bones. This cancer makes up about 2 out of every 100 cancers. It can cause many problems for people.

For many patients, especially older ones, doctors use different drug groups. These groups often include bortezomib (V), lenalidomide (R), or thalidomide (T). But many places around the world cannot get these drugs.

This study looked at how well these drug groups work. It also looked at how safe they are. We want to help make these drugs available to more people. We hope to add them to a list of important medicines from the World Health Organization. These drugs could greatly help patients with this cancer.

**Trial Design**

This study asked: ""How well do different drug groups work for multiple myeloma?"" We looked at many past studies. These studies were called randomized controlled trials. This is a good way to test drugs.

We looked for studies that compared combinations of V, R, and T. These drugs were used with melphalan and prednisone (MP) or dexamethasone (D). We only included adults. These adults had newly found multiple myeloma. They could not have a stem cell transplant.

We did not include people whose cancer came back. We also did not include studies that looked at other types of treatments. We searched many medical databases and meeting notes. We wanted to find all helpful studies.

Two experts checked all the information. They looked for how well the drugs worked. They also looked at side effects. We wanted to know how these drugs helped people live longer. We also wanted to know if the cancer stayed away longer. We looked at how patients felt about their lives.

**Results**

We found 25 studies to include in our review. These studies involved 11,403 patients. They looked at 21 different ways to treat the cancer. Some treatments were given for a set time. Others were given until the cancer got worse.

Our main findings showed that some drug groups worked better. Treatments with RD, TMP, and VRDc helped people live longer. They lived longer than those who only got MP. For example, VRDc helped people live about 71 months. MP helped people live about 34.8 months. This is a big help for patients.

These drug groups also helped keep the cancer away longer. For instance, VRDc helped keep the cancer away for about 47.6 months. MP kept it away for about 16.2 months. This means patients had more time without their cancer growing.

However, these drug groups also had more side effects. Some caused nerve problems like tingling or numbness. This was more common with TMP and VMP. Some patients also had to stop treatment due to side effects. This happened more with RD, TMP, and VRDc.

For example, about 38.5% of people on RD stopped treatment. Only about 9.2% of people on MP stopped. This is a big difference.

We also looked at how patients felt about their lives. All the studies said that patients felt better after starting treatment. But it was hard to compare this part. Different studies used different ways to measure it.

In conclusion, drug groups with V, R, and T can help patients live longer. They can also keep cancer away longer. But they also cause more side effects. It is important to weigh these benefits and risks. More studies are needed to compare these drugs directly. These future studies should also look at side effects and quality of life in a better way.","Multiple drug combinations of bortezomib, lenalidomide and thalidomide for initial treatment of adults with transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma 
Background 
Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer. It accounts for approximately 2% of all cancers and is still considered incurable. For people with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), who are unsuitable for a procedure where damaged blood cells are replaced with healthy ones (stem‐cell transplant), treatment is usually a multiple drug combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide, or thalidomide, plus melphalan and prednisolone (MP) or dexamethasone (D). Multiple drug combinations are approved for initial anti‐myeloma therapy, however, access to these medicines is restricted in many countries worldwide. 
Aim of the review 
To compare the benefits and harms of selected anti‐myeloma drugs (bortezomib (V), lenalidomide (R), thalidomide (T)) for transplant‐unsuitable NDMM. 
Study characteristics 
We searched selected medical databases and trial registries until 14th February 2019. We included studies comparing multiple drug combinations of V, R, and T for the treatment of people with NDMM who were unsuitable for a stem‐cell transplant. We differentiated between fixed treatment duration and continuous therapy. Fixed therapy is a pre‐specified number of cycles, while a continuous therapy is given until the disease gets worse, the person finds the drug hard to tolerate, or when the treatment is given for a prolonged period. Continuous therapies are indicated with a ""c"". 
Key results 
We identified 25 studies involving 11,403 transplant‐unsuitable adults with NDMM, and comparing 21 different treatment regimens. 
Survival 
People who had the standard treatment, MP, lived for an average of 35 months. People treated with RD, TMP, and VRDc probably live for much longer (moderate certainty). Treatment with VMP may also lead to much longer survival, compared to MP (low certainty). People treated with RD lived for an additional 20.4 months; with TMP an additional 11.6 months; with VRDc an additional 36.2 months, and with VMP an additional 14.9 months. 
Harms 
On average, 0.9% (9 out of 1000) of people treated with MP experienced peripheral nerve damage (polyneuropathies).The evidence was inconclusive whether treatment with RD decreases the risk of developing a polyneuropathy, compared to MP. The estimated risk of polyneuropathies with RD was 0.5%. Treatment with TMP and VMP probably increases the risk of experiencing polyneuropathies compared to MP (moderate certainty). The estimated risk with TMP was 4.0%, and with VMP 79.4%. No VRDc treatment study reported the number of participants with severe polyneuropathies. 
On average, 36.1% (361 out of 1000) of people on MP‐treatment experienced at least one serious adverse event (SAE). VMP probably increases the proportion of participants with SAEs compared to MP to 46.2% (moderate certainty). 
On average, 9.2% (92 out of 1000) of people treated with MP stop the treatment because of adverse events (AEs). Treatment with RD, TMP, and VRDc leads to a much higher proportion of people stopping treatment because of AEs than MP (high certainty). The risk of stopping treatment with RD is 38.5%; with TMP 37.7%, with VRDc 82.1%. Treatment with VMP probably increases the risk of stopping treatment because of AEs compared to MP (9.75%, moderate certainty). 
Quality of life 
Quality of life (QoL) was reported in four studies for seven different treatments and was measured with four different tools. Assessment and reporting differed between studies and could not be meta‐analysed. However, all studies reported an improvement in QoL after anti‐myeloma treatment was started for all assessed treatments. 
Conclusions 
VRDc showed the highest overall survival benefits, compared to MP. RD and TMP also improved OS compared to MP. However, these combinations of drugs also led to more adverse events compared to MP, and led to more people stopping treatment. More trials are needed that look carefully at both harms and QoL.
