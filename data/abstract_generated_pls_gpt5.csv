People with neuromuscular disorders may have a weak, ineffective cough predisposing them to respiratory complications. Cough augmentation techniques aim to improve cough effectiveness and mucous clearance, reduce the frequency and duration of respiratory infections requiring hospital admission, and improve quality of life. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders. 
Search methods
On 13 April 2020, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and randomised cross‐over trials. 
Selection criteria
We included trials of cough augmentation techniques compared to no treatment, alternative techniques, or combinations thereof, in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were the number and duration of unscheduled hospitalisations for acute respiratory exacerbations. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
The review included 11 studies involving 287 adults and children, aged three to 73 years. Inadequately reported cross‐over studies and the limited additional information provided by authors severely restricted the number of analyses that could be performed. 
Studies compared manually assisted cough, mechanical insufflation, manual and mechanical breathstacking, mechanical insufflation‐exsufflation, glossopharyngeal breathing, and combination techniques to unassisted cough and alternative or sham interventions. None of the included studies reported on the primary outcomes of this review (number and duration of unscheduled hospital admissions) or listed 'adverse events' as primary or secondary outcome measures. 
The evidence suggests that a range of cough augmentation techniques may increase peak cough flow compared to unassisted cough (199 participants, 8 RCTs), but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little to no difference in peak cough flow outcomes between alternative cough augmentation techniques (216 participants, 9 RCTs). 
There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of interventions on measures of gaseous exchange, pulmonary function, quality of life, general function, or participant preference and satisfaction. 
Authors' conclusions
We are very uncertain about the safety and efficacy of cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders and further studies are needed.

Do cough help methods work and are they safe for weak cough?

Rationale
Some people have nerve or muscle disease. Their cough can be weak. Mucus then stays in the lungs. This can cause chest infections.

Infections can lead to breath trouble. People may need to go to the hospital. These events can last a long time. They can harm daily life and mood.

Doctors use ways to help the cough. We call these cough help methods. Some use hands to aid a cough. Some use a machine to move air. These ways may clear mucus and ease breath. This review asked if these ways help and are safe.

Trial Design
This study is a review of past fair tests. In fair tests, chance picks who gets which method. Some tests also used a cross over. That means each person tried both ways.

The team looked for these tests in big study lists. They searched on April 13, 2020. They found 11 studies to include. These had 287 people in total. People were ages 3 to 73. Both children and adults took part. All had long term nerve or muscle disease.

Tests compared many cough help ways. Methods used included hand help for cough. Some used a machine to push air in and pull out. Some used breath stacking by hand or by machine. Some used a throat gulp breathing method. Some used a mix of these ways. Tests also compared to no extra help or a sham way. A sham is a fake way meant to look real.

The plan was to track unplanned hospital stays for lung flare ups. The plan was also to track how long the stay took. Two people checked each study and pulled out key facts. They judged how strong the proof is. The time in each study was not clear in this review.

Results
No study reported the main results. No study gave the number of hospital stays. No study gave how long the stays took. No study set out side effect counts as a key goal.

Many studies had weak reports. They hid key facts that we need. This made it hard to run math checks. It also meant we could not pool many results.

Eight fair tests, with 199 people, looked at cough speed and force. The proof hints these ways may raise peak cough flow. Peak cough flow means how fast and strong a cough is. This was compared to no extra help. But we are not very sure about this result.

Nine fair tests, with 216 people, matched one way to another. They found little or no clear gap between ways. So one way did not stand out over the others. This also had low certainty.

We lack proof on blood gas levels. That means oxygen and carbon dioxide in blood. We lack proof on lung test scores. We lack proof on day to day life. Quality of life means how you feel and do daily tasks. We also lack proof on what people prefer.

Safety is still not clear. We do not know the harms well. We do not know how often harms may occur. No study put side effects first in its goals.

What does this mean for you? These ways may help some people now. But we can not be sure yet. Please talk with your care team. Ask what may fit your needs best. Ask how to use these ways at home and in clinic.

We need better and longer tests. They should track hospital use and time. They should track side effects in all people. They should track how people feel and function. This will help clear the picture. It will guide care choices for people with weak cough.","The safety and effectiveness of techniques to assist coughing in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of techniques used to assist coughing in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders (cough augmentation techniques). 
Background 
People with neuromuscular disorders (nerve‐related conditions that affect the muscles) may have difficulty coughing and clearing mucous from the airways, placing them at risk of choking, recurrent chest infections, and ongoing lung disease. Cough augmentation techniques, such as manually assisted cough, bagging (using a self‐inflating bag commonly used for resuscitation), mechanical Cough Assist (a device that clears secretions by applying a positive pressure to the airway, then rapidly shifting to a negative pressure), 'frog' breathing (a method of breathing to help a person take in a bigger volume of air), and breathstacking (the person takes a number of sequential breaths in, stacking one breath on top of the other without breathing out in between breaths) aim to improve cough effectiveness, with the eventual aim of reducing the number or severity (or both) of chest infections, and improving the ability of people to perform daily activities (functional ability) and quality of life. 
Methods 
We carried out a wide database search for studies of cough augmentation techniques in adults and children with chronic neuromuscular disorders. We selected studies that assigned people to the treatment(s) or treatment order by chance, as this study type provides the best evidence. 
Results and quality of the evidence 
We found 11 studies with 287 people and several cough augmentation techniques. One study measured the long‐term effects of treatment, but was only published as an abstract without enough information to accurately analyse the study findings. Many included studies had problems with how they were performed, how their findings were reported, or both, which made it difficult to fully interpret their results. None of the studies reported on the outcomes we thought were the most important for making decisions about the effectiveness and safety of cough augmentation techniques. For example, the studies did not report on the number or duration of unscheduled hospital admissions for chest infections, survival, functional ability, or quality of life. The safety of cough augmentation techniques could not be determined. Some studies suggested that cough augmentation techniques may be better than an unassisted cough, but the results are very uncertain. There was not enough evidence to show that any one technique was better than another in improving cough effort. 
Conclusions and recommendation 
The findings of this review provided insufficient information to make decisions about when and how to use cough augmentation techniques in people with chronic neuromuscular disorders. There is currently very low certainty evidence for or against the safety and effectiveness of cough augmentation techniques in people with chronic neuromuscular diseases and more studies are needed. 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 13 April 2020.

Team care after hip or knee joint surgery: what helps most

Rationale
Hip or knee joint disease can cause bad pain and loss of movement. Many people then need a new joint. Surgery helps, but healing needs more than an operation. Care from a team can help people move and live well again. This team care is also called rehabilitation.

Team care brings many staff together. They may include doctors, nurses, physios, and others. They teach safe moves and self care. They help set goals and plan home life. A “care path” is a step-by-step plan the team follows.

The main question was simple. Does early team care help more after surgery? The idea was yes. Early care might help people walk, dress, and wash sooner. It might also lower time in the hospital and reduce problems.

This study looked at care in two places. One was in the hospital. The other was at home. The team also looked at how long these effects last. They asked what type or dose of rehab works best.

Trial Design
This was a review of five trials. It included 619 people after hip or knee surgery. Two trials tested care in the hospital. Three trials tested team care at home. None tested care in an outpatient center.

The trials used different methods and tools. So the teams could not combine the data. The trials were low in quality. The abstract did not report ages or sex. Most results covered three to four months, or up to six months.

The hospital trials tested early rehab and set care paths. “Early” means soon after surgery. The home trials tested a full team plan at home. All trials looked at how well people moved and lived day to day.

Some trials used score tests. One test rates how well people move and do tasks. Another test rates hip pain and function. They also looked at time in the hospital. They noted health problems after surgery and health care costs.

Results
In the hospital, early team care helped people reach goals faster. People got in and out of bed sooner. They walked sooner as well. They spent less time in the hospital. They had fewer problems after surgery.

Costs were also lower in the first few months. A set care path helped guide the team. Scores that rate daily tasks got better. A “number needed to treat” can show how big the gain is. It shows how many need the care for one extra person to benefit.

For some goals, this number was about 6. For walking goals, it was about 3. This means early team care can help one extra person when 3 to 6 get it. That is a useful gain for many people. It can also ease strain on beds and staff.

Home team care also helped. People did more and felt better by six months. A hip function score showed clear gains at that time. Quality of life also got better. “Quality of life” means how you feel and live day to day.

Home team care also cut time in the hospital. This helps people heal in their own space. It may also save money for care systems. The number needed to treat for some gains was about 2. This shows a strong effect for some people.

There were also gaps. No trials tested care in outpatient centers. The teams could not combine results due to study differences. They did not report longer-term results for hip surgery alone. So we still do not know the long-term picture.

What does this mean for care? The proof was “silver level.” This means moderate proof, not the strongest. The take-home point is still clear. Early team care can help people do daily tasks and take part in life.

We still need to learn the best rehab “dose.” This means how often and how hard to do it. We also need to know the long-term effects. We must learn more about cost to families and society. Future trials should also use the same score tools.

In short, team care matters after joint surgery. Starting soon after surgery helps most. Home team care can also add gains. Better trials will help fine-tune what to do, how much, and for how long.","Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes following joint replacement at the hip and knee in chronic arthropathy

10.1002-14651858.CD013717.pub2,"Background
In late 2019, the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) were reported in Wuhan, China, followed by a worldwide spread. Numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, travel restrictions, screening at borders, and quarantine of travellers. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of international travel‐related control measures during the COVID‐19 pandemic on infectious disease transmission and screening‐related outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID‐19‐specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the WHO Global Database on COVID‐19 Research to 13 November 2020. 
Selection criteria
We considered experimental, quasi‐experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel‐related control measures affecting human travel across international borders during the COVID‐19 pandemic. In the original review, we also considered evidence on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In this version we decided to focus on COVID‐19 evidence only. Primary outcome categories were (i) cases avoided, (ii) cases detected, and (iii) a shift in epidemic development. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts. For studies included in the analysis, one review author extracted data and appraised the study. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of data. To assess the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed these GRADE judgements. 
Main results
Overall, we included 62 unique studies in the analysis; 49 were modelling studies and 13 were observational studies. Studies covered a variety of settings and levels of community transmission. 
Most studies compared travel‐related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of stringency of the measures (including relaxation of restrictions), or a combination of measures. 
Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to the selection of travellers and the reference test, and unclear reporting of certain methodological aspects. 
Below we outline the results for each intervention category by illustrating the findings from selected outcomes. 
Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel (31 modelling studies) 
The studies assessed cases avoided and shift in epidemic development. We found very low‐certainty evidence for a reduction in COVID‐19 cases in the community (13 studies) and cases exported or imported (9 studies). Most studies reported positive effects, with effect sizes varying widely; only a few studies showed no effect. 
There was very low‐certainty evidence that cross‐border travel controls can slow the spread of COVID‐19. Most studies predicted positive effects, however, results from individual studies varied from a delay of less than one day to a delay of 85 days; very few studies predicted no effect of the measure. 
Screening at borders (13 modelling studies; 13 observational studies) 
Screening measures covered symptom/exposure‐based screening or test‐based screening (commonly specifying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing), or both, before departure or upon or within a few days of arrival. Studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Studies generally predicted or observed some benefit from screening at borders, however these varied widely. 
For symptom/exposure‐based screening, one modelling study reported that global implementation of screening measures would reduce the number of cases exported per day from another country by 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72% to 95%) (moderate‐certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted delays in epidemic development, although there was wide variation in the results between the studies (very low‐certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted that the proportion of cases detected would range from 1% to 53% (very low‐certainty evidence). Nine observational studies observed the detected proportion to range from 0% to 100% (very low‐certainty evidence), although all but one study observed this proportion to be less than 54%. 
For test‐based screening, one modelling study provided very low‐certainty evidence for the number of cases avoided. It reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases as well as secondary cases. Five observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90% (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Quarantine (12 modelling studies) 
The studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. All studies suggested some benefit of quarantine, however the magnitude of the effect ranged from small to large across the different outcomes (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence). Three modelling studies predicted that the reduction in the number of cases in the community ranged from 450 to over 64,000 fewer cases (very low‐certainty evidence). The variation in effect was possibly related to the duration of quarantine and compliance. 
Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies; 4 observational studies) 
The studies assessed shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Most studies predicted positive effects for the combined measures with varying magnitudes (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence). Four observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected for quarantine and screening at borders ranged from 68% to 92% (low‐certainty evidence). The variation may depend on how the measures were combined, including the length of the quarantine period and days when the test was conducted in quarantine. 
Authors' conclusions
With much of the evidence derived from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real‐world' evidence. The certainty of the evidence for most travel‐related control measures and outcomes is very low and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Symptom/exposure‐based screening measures at borders on their own are likely not effective; PCR testing at borders as a screening measure likely detects more cases than symptom/exposure‐based screening at borders, although if performed only upon arrival this will likely also miss a meaningful proportion of cases. Quarantine, based on a sufficiently long quarantine period and high compliance is likely to largely avoid further transmission from travellers. Combining quarantine with PCR testing at borders will likely improve effectiveness. Many studies suggest that effects depend on factors, such as levels of community transmission, travel volumes and duration, other public health measures in place, and the exact specification and timing of the measure. Future research should be better reported, employ a range of designs beyond modelling and assess potential benefits and harms of the travel‐related control measures from a societal perspective.

Do travel rules like border checks, tests, and quarantine help slow COVID-19?

Rationale
COVID-19 began in late 2019 and spread fast around the world. It can lead to cough, fever, and trouble breathing. It can also lead to time in the hospital or death. This harms people, families, and health care.

Many countries used travel rules to try to slow the spread. These rules can help find sick travelers. They can also keep new cases out of a country. The main question was: do these rules work?

The study looked at three main rules. These were limits on cross‑border travel, checks at borders, and quarantine after travel. The idea was that these steps could cut the number of new cases. They might also delay an outbreak in a place.

Trial Design
This was not one trial. It was a review of many studies. The team searched several medical databases. They searched up to 13 November 2020.

The review included 62 studies. Of these, 49 used computer models. A model is a math tool that predicts what may happen. Thirteen used real‑world data on travelers and cases.

The studies looked at four types of rules. These were travel limits, border checks, quarantine, and a mix of quarantine and checks. Border checks were based on symptoms or exposure, or on a lab test. The lab test (PCR) looks for the virus in the nose or throat.

The studies asked three main things. How many cases were avoided? How many cases were found? Did the rules slow the start of an outbreak? The team also judged how sure we can be about the results. Most findings had low or very low certainty.

There were no new patients in this review. So there was no time in the study for a person. The studies took place in many countries and at different times in the pandemic.

Results
Limits on cross‑border travel
Most model studies found these limits helped. They often showed fewer cases in the country. They also showed fewer cases moved in or out of a country. The size of the effect was very mixed. Some studies found a small change. Others found a large change. The certainty of these results was very low.

Most models also found travel limits could delay an outbreak. The delay ranged from less than a day to 85 days. A few studies showed no delay. Again, the certainty was very low.

Border checks based on symptoms or exposure
These checks ask about fever, cough, or close contact. Some models found that, if every country used such checks, about 4 in 5 cases leaving a country might be stopped. This had moderate certainty. Other models showed a delay in an outbreak. But the size of the delay varied a lot. Certainty was very low.

Models predicted that symptom checks would find from about 1 in 100 to about 1 in 2 cases. Real‑world studies saw a range from none to all. But in most of these, checks found less than half of cases. Certainty was very low.

Border checks based on tests (PCR)
PCR is a lab test. It checks if the virus is in a person’s nose or throat. One model found that testing travelers cut imported or exported cases. It also cut the number of people they later infected. Certainty was very low.

Five real‑world studies asked how many cases PCR found. They found between a little over half and 9 in 10 cases. Certainty was very low. A single test on arrival can still miss cases.

Quarantine after travel
Quarantine means you stay at home or in a set place after travel. You do not meet others. All model studies showed some benefit from quarantine. But the size of the effect ranged from small to large. Some models showed 450 fewer cases. Others showed over 64,000 fewer cases. Certainty ranged from very low to low.

The length of quarantine and how well people followed the rules seemed to matter. Longer and stricter periods worked better.

Quarantine plus border testing
Most studies showed this mix worked better than one step alone. It could slow the start of an outbreak and find more cases. Four real‑world studies found this mix detected about 7 in 10 to about 9 in 10 cases. Certainty was low.

The results seemed to depend on how the steps were set up. Key points were how long quarantine lasted and on what day tests were done.

What this means for patients and the public
The findings suggest several points. Travel limits may help slow spread across borders. Checks based on symptoms alone are likely not enough. PCR testing finds more cases than symptom checks. A single test on arrival can still miss cases.

Quarantine helps, if long enough and if people follow the rules. Quarantine plus PCR seems to work best. These steps can buy time. They can lower cases. They may ease stress on hospitals. They can help protect those at high risk.

Limits of the evidence
Much of the evidence came from computer models. Real‑world data were fewer. Methods and quality varied. The true effects may be very different. Many factors can change the impact. These include how much virus is in the community, how many people travel, and what other public health steps are in place. Few studies looked at harms, costs, or wider effects.

Investigator conclusions
Travel rules can help, but none is perfect. Symptom checks alone likely do not work well. PCR testing is better, but it can miss cases if done once. Quarantine works best when long enough and well followed. Mixing quarantine with PCR likely adds benefit. Future studies should use more real‑world data. They should also report both benefits and harms for society.","Can international travel‐related control measures contain the spread of the COVID‐19 pandemic? 
What are international travel‐related control measures? 
International travel control measures are methods to manage international travel to contain the spread of COVID‐19. Measures include: 
‐ closing international borders to stop travellers crossing from one country to another;
‐ restricting travel to and from certain countries, particularly those with high infection levels; 
‐ screening or testing travellers entering or leaving a country if they have symptoms or have been in contact with an infected person; 
‐ quarantining newly‐arrived travellers from another country, that is, requiring travellers to stay at home or in a specific place for a certain time. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how effective international travel‐related control measures are in containing the COVID‐19 pandemic. 
What we did 
We searched for studies on the effects of these measures on the spread of COVID‐19. Studies had to report how many cases these measures prevented or detected, or whether they changed the course of the pandemic. The studies could include people of any age, anywhere. They could be of any design including those that used ‘real‐life’ data (observational studies) or hypothetical data from computer‐generated simulations (modelling studies). 
This is the first update of our review. This update includes only studies on COVID‐19, published up to 13 November 2020. 
What we found 
We found 62 studies. Most (49 studies) were modelling studies; only 13 used real‐life data (observational studies). Studies took place across the world and at different times during the pandemic. Levels of COVID‐19 within countries varied. 
Most studies compared current travel‐related control measures with no travel‐related controls. However, some modelling studies also compared current measures against possible measures, for example, to see what might happen if controls were more or less relaxed or were combined with other measures. 
Main results 
Below we summarise the findings of some outcomes.
Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel (31 modelling studies) 
Most studies showed that travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross‐border travel were beneficial, but this beneficial effect ranged from small to large. Additionally, some studies found no effect. Studies also predicted that these restrictions would delay the outbreak, but the delay ranged from one day to 85 days in different studies. 
Screening at borders (13 modelling studies and 13 observational studies) 
These studies assessed screening at borders, including screening people with symptoms or who had potentially been exposed to COVID‐19, or testing people, before or after they travelled. 
For screening based on symptoms or potential exposure to COVID‐19, modelling studies found that screening reduced imported or exported cases and delayed outbreaks. Modelling studies predicted that 1% to 53% of cases would be detected. Observational studies reported a wide range of cases detected, from 0% to 100%, with the majority of studies reporting less than 54% of cases detected. 
For screening based on testing, studies reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases, and cases detected. Observational studies reported that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90%. This variation might be due to the timing of testing. 
Quarantine (12 modelling studies) 
All studies suggested that quarantine may be beneficial, but the size of this effect ranged from small to large in the different studies. Modelling studies, for example, predicted that quarantine could lead to between 450 and over 64,000 fewer cases in the community. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how well they followed the rules. 
Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies and 4 observational studies) 
For quarantine and screening at borders, most studies suggested some benefit, however the size of this effect differed between studies. For example, observational studies reported that between 68% and 92% of cases would be detected. Differences in effects may depend on how long people were quarantined for and how often they were tested while in quarantine. 
How reliable are these results? 
Our confidence in these results is limited. Most studies were based on mathematical predictions (modelling), so we lack real‐life evidence. Further, we were not confident that models used correct assumptions, so our confidence in the evidence on travel restrictions and quarantine, in particular, is very low. Some studies were published quickly online as ‘preprints’. Preprints do not undergo the normal rigorous checks of published studies, so we are not certain how reliable they are. Also, the studies were very different from each other and their results varied according to the specification of each travel measure (e.g. the type of screening approach), how it was put into practice and enforced, the amount of cross‐border travel, levels of community transmission and other types of national measures to control the pandemic. 
What this means 
Overall, international travel‐related control measures may help to limit the spread of COVID‐19 across national borders. Restricting cross‐border travel can be a helpful measure. Screening travellers only for symptoms at borders is likely to miss many cases; testing may be more effective but may also miss cases if only performed upon arrival. Quarantine that lasts at least 10 days can prevent travellers spreading COVID‐19 and may be more effective if combined with another measure such as testing, especially if people follow the rules. 
Future research needs to be better reported. More studies should focus on real‐life evidence, and should assess potential benefits and risks of travel‐related control measures to individuals and society as a whole.

10.1002-14651858.CD013384.pub2,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by shortness of breath, cough and recurrent exacerbations. People with COPD often live with one or more co‐existing long‐term health conditions (comorbidities). People with more severe COPD often have a higher number of comorbidities, putting them at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of any single intervention for COPD adapted or tailored to their comorbidity(s) compared to any other intervention for people with COPD and one or more common comorbidities (quantitative data, RCTs) in terms of the following outcomes: Quality of life, exacerbations, functional status, all‐cause and respiratory‐related hospital admissions, mortality, pain, and depression and anxiety. 
To assess the effectiveness of an adapted or tailored single COPD intervention (simple or complex) that is aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and one or more common comorbidities (quantitative data, RCTs) compared to usual care in terms of the following outcomes: Quality of life, exacerbations, functional status, all‐cause and respiratory‐related hospital admissions, mortality, pain, and depression and anxiety. 
To identify emerging themes that describe the views and experiences of patients, carers and healthcare professionals when receiving or providing care to manage multimorbidities (qualitative data). 
Search methods
We searched multiple databases including the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL, to identify relevant randomised and qualitative studies. We also searched trial registries and conducted citation searches. The latest search was conducted in January 2021. 
Selection criteria
Eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) compared a) any single intervention for COPD adapted or tailored to their comorbidity(s) compared to any other intervention, or b) any adapted or tailored single COPD intervention (simple or complex) that is aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and one or more comorbidities, compared to usual care. We included qualitative studies or mixed‐methods studies to identify themes. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods for analysis of the RCTs. We used Cochrane's risk of bias tool for the RCTs and the CASP checklist for the qualitative studies. We planned to use the Mixed Methods Appraisal tool (MMAT) to assess the risk of bias in mixed‐methods studies, but we found none. We used GRADE and CERQual to assess the quality of the quantitative and qualitative evidence respectively. The primary outcome measures for this review were quality of life and exacerbations. 
Main results
Quantitative studies 
We included seven studies (1197 participants) in the quantitative analyses, with interventions including telemonitoring, pulmonary rehabilitation, treatment optimisation, water‐based exercise training and case management. Interventions were either compared with usual care or with an active comparator (such as land‐based exercise training). Duration of trials ranged from 4 to 52 weeks. Mean age of participants ranged from 64 to 72 years and COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. Trials included either people with COPD and a specific comorbidity (including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, lung cancer, head or neck cancer, and musculoskeletal conditions), or with one or more comorbidities of any type. 
Overall, we judged the evidence presented to be of moderate to very low certainty (GRADE), mainly due to the methodological quality of included trials and imprecision of effect estimates. 
Intervention versus usual care 
Quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score may improve with tailored pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care at 52 weeks (mean difference (MD) −10.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) −12.66 to −9.04; 1 study, 70 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Tailored pulmonary rehabilitation is likely to improve COPD assessment test (CAT) scores compared with usual care at 52 weeks (MD −8.02, 95% CI −9.44 to −6.60; 1 study, 70 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and with a multicomponent telehealth intervention at 52 weeks (MD −6.90, 95% CI −9.56 to −4.24; moderate‐certainty evidence). Evidence is uncertain about effects of pharmacotherapy optimisation or telemonitoring interventions on CAT improvement compared with usual care. 
There may be little to no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations, or mean exacerbations with case management compared with usual care (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.57; 1 study, 470 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
For secondary outcomes, six‐minute walk distance (6MWD) may improve with pulmonary rehabilitation, water‐based exercise or multicomponent interventions at 38 to 52 weeks (low‐certainty evidence). A multicomponent intervention may result in fewer people being admitted to hospital at 17 weeks, although there may be little to no difference in a telemonitoring intervention. There may be little to no difference between intervention and usual care for mortality. 
Intervention versus active comparator 
We included one study comparing water‐based and land‐based exercise (30 participants). We found no evidence for quality of life or exacerbations. 
There may be little to no difference between water‐ and land‐based exercise for 6MWD (MD 5 metres, 95% CI −22 to 32; 38 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Qualitative studies 
One nested qualitative study (21 participants) explored perceptions and experiences of people with COPD and long‐term conditions, and of researchers and health professionals who were involved in an RCT of telemonitoring equipment. 
Several themes were identified, including health status, beliefs and concerns, reliability of equipment, self‐efficacy, perceived ease of use, factors affecting usefulness and perceived usefulness, attitudes and intention, self‐management and changes in healthcare use. We judged the qualitative evidence presented as of very low certainty overall. 
Authors' conclusions
Owing to a paucity of eligible trials, as well as diversity in the intervention type, comorbidities and the outcome measures reported, we were unable to provide a robust synthesis of data. Pulmonary rehabilitation or multicomponent interventions may improve quality of life and functional status (6MWD), but the evidence is too limited to draw a robust conclusion. The key take‐home message from this review is the lack of data from RCTs on treatments for people living with COPD and comorbidities. 
Given the variation in number and type of comorbidity(s) an individual may have, and severity of COPD, larger studies reporting individual patient data are required to determine these effects.

Do COPD care plans that fit other health problems help?

Rationale
COPD is a long-term lung disease. It can cause short breath, cough, and flare-ups. A flare-up is when your breath gets much worse for a while.

Many people with COPD also have other long-term health problems. These can include heart disease, joint pain, or cancer. People with more than one health issue often feel worse and may go to the hospital more.

Care plans often treat one disease at a time. That can miss what people with many health needs face each day. This study looked at care for COPD that was shaped to fit a person’s other health problems.

The main idea was simple. If we plan COPD care to fit other health needs, people may feel better. They may move more, have fewer flare-ups, and stay out of the hospital more. We also need to know if home tech tools can help.

Trial Design
This was a review of many past trials. It also looked at one study that asked people and staff about their views. The team searched many medical libraries and trial lists.

The team found seven trials with 1,197 people. Ages ranged from 64 to 72 years. COPD ranged from mild to very bad. People had one or more other long-term health problems. These included heart disease, body weight and blood sugar issues, lung cancer, head or neck cancer, and joint or muscle problems.

The trials ran from one month to one year. The care plans were each a “single” COPD plan that had been tailored. They included:
- Pulmonary rehab: a plan with exercise, breath training, and support.
- Telemonitoring: home tools and calls to track health and symptoms.
- Water exercise training.
- Case management: a nurse or team helps plan and guide care.
- Medicine tune-up: doctors adjust drugs to fit all health needs.

The trials compared these plans to usual care. Some also used an active match, such as land-based exercise. The team checked how fair and strong the trials were. They also looked at one small study that spoke with 21 people and staff about home tech.

Results
The team set two main goals. These were quality of life and flare-ups. Quality of life means how you feel and live day to day. A flare-up means your COPD gets much worse for a time.

Pulmonary rehab that fit a person’s other health needs likely helped quality of life. This was seen after one year when compared with usual care. In one pair-wise check, tailored pulmonary rehab also did better than a multi-part telehealth plan for a COPD symptom score.

Home tech tools did not clearly help with symptom scores when used alone. A plan to fine-tune drugs also did not show clear gains on those scores. These results were not firm and may change with more data.

A case management plan did not seem to change flare-ups. The number of people with a flare-up looked close to usual care. Again, the data here was weak.

Some plans helped people move more. In some trials, people could walk farther in six minutes. The “six-minute walk” is a simple test of how far you can walk in that time. This was seen in people in pulmonary rehab, water exercise, or multi-part plans.

Hospital stays were mixed. One multi-part plan led to fewer people going to the hospital after about four months. A telemonitor plan did not seem to change hospital stays by much. Death rates looked about the same across groups.

One small trial compared water exercise to land exercise. It did not find a clear gain in walk distance with water over land. It did not report on quality of life or flare-ups.

One small study asked people and staff about home tech to track health. People cared if the gear was easy to use and if it worked well. They also spoke about trust, fears, skills, and if it helped them feel in charge. Staff spoke about the same points. But this was a small study, so we must be careful with what we take from it.

Across all trials, the strength of the proof ranged from moderate to very low. That means we can trust some parts more than others. There were few trials. The plans and the other health problems were not the same across trials. So it is hard to give one clear answer for all.

What does this mean for people with COPD and other health needs? Tailored pulmonary rehab may help you feel better and move more. A mix of tools may help keep you out of the hospital for a time. Home tech alone did not show clear gains. Flare-ups and deaths did not change much in most plans.

More and larger trials are needed. These trials should run long enough and track each person’s other health needs. This can help us learn which plan works best for whom, and when. For now, this review shows a gap in care. It also gives a clue that tailored rehab and some mix care can help some people.","Approaches to help people with COPD who have one or more long‐term conditions
What is COPD and comorbidity? 
COPD is a common condition caused mainly by smoking and can lead to long‐term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, and cough with sputum production due to airways and lung damage. People with COPD may have one or more other long‐term conditions (comorbidities) such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, asthma and lung cancer which can lead to poor health. People living with two or more comorbidities can also be known as living with multimorbidity. 
Why did we do this review?  
Because many people with COPD live with multimorbidity, naturally people in clinical trials will have multimorbidities. However, the results of those trials are usually not reported broken down by multimorbidity. People with comorbidities may need to adapt interventions to take account of their comorbidity — for example taking exercise in water instead of on land so that their bodies are better supported. Historically, Cochrane Airways Reviews have not taken into account people's comorbidities, and this review is a first step to addressing this. We decided to complete a review that centres on people with COPD and comorbidities following a meeting with our COPD patient group, who highlighted concerns over comorbidities. After some deliberation, we decided to include the following two sorts of trials. 
1. Any single intervention for COPD delivered to people with COPD adapted to or targeting their comorbidity compared to routine care or any other intervention. 
2. Any intervention aimed at changing the management of people with COPD and comorbidities, which could be simple (e.g. scheduling COPD and heart clinics on the same day) or more complex (e.g. developing a new care package for management of people with COPD across a local health service), compared to routine care. 
We wanted to know which treatments improve quality of life and reduce exacerbations for people living with COPD and one or more comorbidities. 
We also wanted to find out about how people with COPD, carers and health professionals felt about those treatments. 
What information did we find? 
We carried out a search for studies in January 2021. We found seven  eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 1197 people, and one qualitative study which was part of one of the randomised trials and provided information about people's opinions and experiences of using telehealth equipment. People included in the trials were aged between 64 and 72 years, and their COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. The trials either included people with COPD and a specific comorbidity such as cardiovascular disease or lung cancer, or they included people with COPD and one or more other conditions of any sort. 
Results and conclusions 
There is not enough evidence on people with COPD and other comorbidities to draw firm conclusions about interventions aimed at COPD that are adapted for the comorbidity. The available evidence indicated the following:  
‐ Quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score may improve with tailored pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care (note that there is a strong evidence base for pulmonary rehabilitation in people with COPD). 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation is likely to improve quality of life as measured by the COPD assessment test (CAT) scores compared with usual care at 52 weeks and with a multicomponent telehealth intervention.  
‐ Evidence is uncertain about the effects of pharmacotherapy optimisation or telemonitoring interventions on CAT improvement compared with usual care. 
‐ There may be little to no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations, or mean exacerbations with case management compared with usual care.  
‐ For secondary outcomes, the distance walked by participants in six minutes may improve with pulmonary rehabilitation, water‐based exercise or multicomponent interventions. A multicomponent intervention may result in fewer people being admitted to hospital, although there may be little to no difference in a telemonitoring intervention.  
‐ There may be little to no difference between intervention and usual care for deaths across several studies. 
‐ One study compared water‐based exercise with land‐based exercise. We found no evidence for quality of life or exacerbations. There may be little to no difference between water‐ and land‐based exercise on the distance walked by participants in six minutes. 
‐ One qualitative study explored perceptions and experiences of people with COPD and long‐term conditions, and of researchers and health professionals who were involved in an RCT of telemonitoring equipment. Several themes were identified, including health status, beliefs and concerns, reliability of equipment, self‐efficacy, perceived ease of use, factors affecting usefulness and perceived usefulness, attitudes and intention, self‐management and changes in healthcare use.  
Larger studies with more people with COPD and comorbidities could help to find out if targeted approaches can improve health. 
Certainty of the information 
Overall there were very few studies and most studies were small. This means the results are based on a small amount of information. Trials with different interventions and different or more people may give a different result.

10.1002-14651858.CD013674.pub2,"Background
Major depressive disorders have a significant impact on children and adolescents, including on educational and vocational outcomes, interpersonal relationships, and physical and mental health and well‐being. There is an association between major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. Antidepressant medication is used in moderate to severe depression; there is now a range of newer generations of these medications. 
Objectives
To investigate, via network meta‐analysis (NMA), the comparative effectiveness and safety of different newer generation antidepressants in children and adolescents with a diagnosed major depressive disorder (MDD) in terms of depression, functioning, suicide‐related outcomes and other adverse outcomes. The impact of age, treatment duration, baseline severity, and pharmaceutical industry funding was investigated on clinician‐rated depression (CDRS‐R) and suicide‐related outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR)), together with Ovid Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO till March 2020. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of six to 18 year olds of either sex and any ethnicity with clinically diagnosed major depressive disorder were included. Trials that compared the effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants with each other or with a placebo were included. Newer generation antidepressants included: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors; norepinephrine dopamine disinhibitors (NDDIs); and tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs). 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We analysed dichotomous data as Odds Ratios (ORs), and continuous data as Mean Difference (MD) for the following outcomes: depression symptom severity (clinician rated), response or remission of depression symptoms, depression symptom severity (self‐rated), functioning, suicide related outcomes and overall adverse outcomes. Random‐effects network meta‐analyses were conducted in a frequentist framework using multivariate meta‐analysis. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Confidence in Network Meta‐analysis (CINeMA). We used ""informative statements"" to standardise the interpretation and description of the results. 
Main results
Twenty‐six studies were included. There were no data for the two primary outcomes (depressive disorder established via clinical diagnostic interview and suicide), therefore, the results comprise only secondary outcomes. Most antidepressants may be associated with a ""small and unimportant"" reduction in depression symptoms on the CDRS‐R scale (range 17 to 113) compared with placebo (high certainty evidence: paroxetine: MD ‐1.43, 95% CI ‐3.90, 1.04; vilazodone: MD ‐0.84, 95% CI ‐3.03, 1.35; desvenlafaxine MD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐3.51, 3.36; moderate certainty evidence: sertraline: MD ‐3.51, 95% CI ‐6.99, ‐0.04; fluoxetine: MD ‐2.84, 95% CI ‐4.12, ‐1.56; escitalopram: MD ‐2.62, 95% CI ‐5.29, 0.04; low certainty evidence: duloxetine: MD ‐2.70, 95% CI ‐5.03, ‐0.37; vortioxetine: MD 0.60, 95% CI ‐2.52, 3.72; very low certainty evidence for comparisons between other antidepressants and placebo). 
There were ""small and unimportant"" differences between most antidepressants in reduction of depression symptoms (high‐ or moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Results were similar across other outcomes of benefit.
In most studies risk of self‐harm or suicide was an exclusion criterion for the study. Proportions of suicide‐related outcomes were low for most included studies and 95% confidence intervals were wide for all comparisons. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of mirtazapine (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.03, 8.04), duloxetine (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.72, 1.82), vilazodone (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.68, 1.48), desvenlafaxine (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.59, 1.52), citalopram (OR 1.72, 95% CI 0.76, 3.87) or vortioxetine (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.29, 8.60) on suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo. There is low certainty evidence that escitalopram may ""at least slightly"" reduce odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.43, 1.84). There is low certainty evidence that fluoxetine (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87, 1.86), paroxetine (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.85, 3.86), sertraline (OR 3.03, 95% CI 0.60, 15.22), and venlafaxine (OR 13.84, 95% CI 1.79, 106.90) may ""at least slightly"" increase odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo. 
There is moderate certainty evidence that venlafaxine probably results in an ""at least slightly"" increased odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with desvenlafaxine (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01, 0.56) and escitalopram (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01, 0.56). There was very low certainty evidence regarding other comparisons between antidepressants. 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, methodological shortcomings of the randomised trials make it difficult to interpret the findings with regard to the efficacy and safety of newer antidepressant medications. Findings suggest that most newer antidepressants may reduce depression symptoms in a small and unimportant way compared with placebo. Furthermore, there are likely to be small and unimportant differences in the reduction of depression symptoms between the majority of antidepressants. However, our findings reflect the average effects of the antidepressants, and given depression is a heterogeneous condition, some individuals may experience a greater response. Guideline developers and others making recommendations might therefore consider whether a recommendation for the use of newer generation antidepressants is warranted for some individuals in some circumstances. Our findings suggest sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine, as well as fluoxetine (which is currently the only treatment recommended for first‐line prescribing) could be considered as a first option. 
Children and adolescents considered at risk of suicide were frequently excluded from trials, so that we cannot be confident about the effects of these medications for these individuals. If an antidepressant is being considered for an individual, this should be done in consultation with the child/adolescent and their family/caregivers and it remains critical to ensure close monitoring of treatment effects and suicide‐related outcomes (combined suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) in those treated with newer generation antidepressants, given findings that some of these medications may be associated with greater odds of these events. Consideration of psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy, as per guideline recommendations, remains important. 
","1. Plain Title
How well do newer antidepressants help kids and teens with major depression?

2. Rationale
Major depression is a medical illness. It can last many weeks or more. It can harm school, work plans, and friends. It can hurt body and mind health.

Some young people with moderate or bad depression take antidepressants. These drugs may lift mood. There are many newer drugs to choose from. Families and doctors want to know which ones help, and which ones may harm.

This study asked two main things. Do newer antidepressants ease low mood and help daily life? Do they raise or lower thoughts of self harm or suicide? The team also looked at side effects. They hoped to guide care for young people.

3. Trial Design
How is this study designed?
The team pulled together many past trials. These were strong trials where chance chose the drug. They compared newer antidepressants with each other or with a fake pill. A fake pill has no drug.

The trials were in children and teens. Ages ran from six to eighteen years. Boys and girls took part. All had a doctor’s diagnosis of major depression.

The study looked at mood ratings by doctors and by youth. It looked at daily life and school. It looked at getting better or well. It also looked at thoughts of self harm or a try at suicide. It counted other bad effects too.

Drugs in the trials included fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, mirtazapine, vilazodone, and vortioxetine. The team searched large medical libraries up to March 2020. Two reviewers checked and took down the data.

How long people stayed in each trial was not the same. This summary did not give one set time. Some trials left out youth at risk of self harm. That is key to note.

4. Results
What were the main results of the study?
The team found twenty six trials. The trials did not report on two main results. They did not report a new diagnosis by a full interview. They did not report suicide deaths. So, the results here are for other outcomes.

For most drugs, the drop in low mood scores was small. The team judged that drop as small and not important. This was true when they compared each drug with a fake pill. It was also true when they compared most drugs with each other. In short, most newer drugs changed mood scores only a little.

Other helpful results looked much the same. These include getting better, or how well kids functioned. The gains were small. They were like the mood score results.

What about self harm or suicide related events?
Many trials did not enroll youth at risk. The number of these events in trials was low. The math around these results was not sure.

For some drugs, the team could not tell if risk went up or down. This was the case for mirtazapine, duloxetine, vilazodone, desvenlafaxine, citalopram, and vortioxetine. For escitalopram, the team found a small chance it may lower risk a bit. For fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine, the team found a small chance they may raise risk a bit. One drug, venlafaxine, seemed to raise risk more than desvenlafaxine and escitalopram.

These risk results were not firm for most drugs. This is due to few events. It is also due to who was left out of trials. Because of this, we cannot be sure about risk for youth who have self harm risk.

What about safety and study limits?
Many trials had method issues. This makes it hard to judge the full effect. The team said their findings show only the average effect. Some youth may still do much better on a given drug. Depression is not the same in all people.

What do these results mean for patients and families?
Most newer antidepressants gave only small mood gains in these trials. Differences between drugs were also small. For care choices, other things still matter a lot. These include each person’s symptoms, past drug use, side effects, and what the family wants.

The study team said some drugs could be first options. These include sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine, and fluoxetine. Fluoxetine is now the most common first choice. But choice should fit the person.

Close watch is key if a doctor starts a drug. This is true for thoughts of self harm and suicide. It is also true for mood, sleep, and other side effects. Talk often with the care team. Share any new or worse thoughts at once.

Talk therapy still matters. One type, called cognitive behavioral therapy, can help a lot. Many care guides suggest it. It can be used with or without a drug.

In sum, the study found small mood gains with most newer drugs. It found small or unclear differences between drugs. It found unsure effects on self harm related events for many drugs. Care should be tailored, careful, and closely watched.","Newer generation antidepressants for depression in children and adolescents: a network meta‐analysis 
How well do newer formulations of antidepressants work for children and adolescents with clinical depression? 
Children and adolescents (6 to 18 years) with depression (also called ‘major depressive disorder’) experience a range of negative impacts in all areas of their lives and have an increased risk of suicide, suicidal thinking and suicide attempts. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression, but can also increase the risk of suicide‐related outcomes. 
Who will be interested in this research? 
The research in this Cochrane Review will interest:
‐ people who decide policy, and influence decisions about the prescription of antidepressant medicines to children and adolescents; 
‐ people who prescribe these medicines to children and adolescents;
‐ children and adolescents with depression; and
‐ those who support and care for them (including their parents and caregivers and clinicians who provide treatment). 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how well newer formulations (called ‘new generation’) antidepressants work to improve depression in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years. New generation antidepressants are those that have been developed recently. They are sometimes referred to as ‘second‐‘ and ‘third‐generation’ antidepressants; they do not include older formulations (tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors). 
We wanted to know how these antidepressants affect:
‐ symptoms of depression;
‐ recovery: no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder;
‐ response or remission: scores on a scale indicating an important reduction in depression or no longer experiencing depression; 
‐ ability to function in daily life;
‐ suicide‐related outcomes; and
‐ whether they cause any unwanted effects in children and adolescents.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that tested new generation antidepressants on children or adolescents (or both) who had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. We identified 26 such studies. We then assessed the trustworthiness of those studies, and synthesized the findings across the studies. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
Most newer antidepressants probably reduce depression symptoms better than a placebo (a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain any medicine but looks identical to the medicine being tested). However, the reduction is small and may not be experienced as important by children and adolescents, their parents and caregivers, or clinicians. When different medications are compared against each other, there may be only small and unimportant differences between most of them for the reduction of symptoms. 
Our findings reflect what happens on average to individuals, but some individuals may experience a greater response. This might lead to recommendations being made for the use of antidepressants for some individuals in some circumstances. Our findings suggest that sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine and fluoxetine can be used if medication is being considered. 
The impact of medication on depression symptoms should be closely monitored by those prescribing the medication, especially as suicide‐related thinking and behaviour may be increased in those taking these medications. Close monitoring of suicide‐related behaviours is vital in those treated with new generation antidepressants. 
What should happen next? 
The studies that provided this evidence largely excluded children and adolescents who: 
‐ were already thinking about suicide and wanting to take their own lives (i.e. had suicidal ideation); 
‐ were self‐harming;
‐ had other mental health conditions; and
‐ had psychosocial difficulties.
Future research should aim to understand the impacts of these medicines in children and adolescents with these problems, who are more typical of those who request clinical services.

10.1002-14651858.CD006251.pub4,"Interventions to reduce injuries in construction workers
Occupational injury rates among construction workers are the highest among the major industries. While various organisations have proposed several injury control strategies, their effectiveness for reducing the rate of injuries in the construction industry remains uncertain. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To find out which interventions are most effective for reducing on‐the‐job injuries in construction workers. 
Key messages 
We conducted a systematic search of the literature on preventing occupational injuries among construction workers. We included 17 studies in this updated review, rating the evidence as very low quality. Multifaceted interventions and company incentives for upgrading equipment may be effective in reducing injury. However, an evidence base is still needed for the vast majority of safety measures that safety manuals, consultants and safety courses routinely recommend. 
What was studied in the review? 
We looked at different types of workplace interventions, including the introduction of new regulations, safety campaigns, training, inspections, occupational health services, and company subsidies. We evaluated the quality of the studies and the effectiveness of interventions, rating the evidence as very low quality. 
What are the main results of the review? 
Introducing regulations alone may or may not be effective for preventing non‐fatal and fatal injuries in construction workers. Regionally oriented interventions such as a safety campaigns, training, inspections or occupational health services may not be effective for reducing non‐fatal injuries in construction workers. However, a multifaceted safety campaign and a multifaceted drug‐free workplace programme at the company level, along with subsidies for replacement of scaffoldings, may be effective in reducing non‐fatal injuries. 
Additional strategies are needed to increase the employers' and workers' adherence to the safety measures that are prescribed by regulation. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to 1 April 2017.

What Helps Keep Construction Workers Safe at Work

Rationale
Construction work is hard and risky.
Many workers get hurt on the job.
Injuries cause pain, time off work, and lost pay.
Some injuries can lead to death.
Families and companies also face high costs.

Many groups share safety rules and tips.
They offer training, gear, and checks.
But we do not know which steps work best.
Some steps may help in one place, not another.
We need clear proof to guide choices.

This study asked a simple question.
Which steps cut injury for construction workers?
The team hoped to find what helps most.
They also looked at how strong the proof is.

Trial Design
This was a planned review of past studies.
A review adds up what many studies found.
The team set rules and searched for studies.
They looked for work on injury in construction.

They found 17 studies to include.
The studies tested many kinds of safety steps.
These steps were rules, training, site checks, and work health care.
They also looked at pay help to upgrade gear.

The team rated how strong the proof was.
They said the proof was very low.
That means we should be careful with the results.
New, better studies are still needed.

The people in these studies were construction workers.
The review did not list ages or genders.
The time in each study was not clear.
The search covered papers up to April 1, 2017.

Results
The team asked if rules alone help.
Rules are laws or site rules for safety.
The review found mixed results for rules alone.
Rules may help or may not help with injury and death.

They next asked about wide steps in a region.
These were safety ads, training, site checks, or work health care.
These wide steps did not seem to cut non-fatal injury.
Non-fatal means hurt but not death.

Some steps did seem to help.
A plan with many parts at one firm helped.
This kind of plan used more than one step at once.
It had a safety push and a drug-free work plan.
A drug-free plan means steps to prevent drug use at work.

Money help to swap old scaffolds also seemed to help.
A scaffold is a raised work frame used on site.
New, safe gear may lower falls and other harms.
These gains were for non-fatal injury.

Still, the proof for all steps was very weak.
Study methods had limits and gaps.
So we cannot be sure these steps work in all places.
We need better tests of safety steps.

The work also showed a clear need.
Bosses and crews must follow safety rules to see gains.
We need new ways to boost rule use on sites.
Good follow-through may be as key as the rule itself.

What does this mean for you?
If you run a site, use plans with many parts.
Try gear upgrades, like safer scaffolds, when you can.
Do not rely on one step or broad ads alone.
Track results and keep what seems to help.

For workers, speak up about safe gear and plans.
Ask for clear rules and steady follow-through.
Take part in training and report risks you see.
Choose to not use drugs or seek help if needed.

For policy and research, the job is not done.
We need strong, fair tests of safety steps.
Tests should track harm, death, and cost over time.
The aim is clear, solid steps that keep crews safe.

In sum, this review found some hope but no sure fix.
Many-part plans and gear swaps may help the most.
Wide ads, training, or checks alone may not help much.
Strong, new studies will help us know what works.","Interventions to reduce injuries in construction workers
Occupational injury rates among construction workers are the highest among the major industries. While various organisations have proposed several injury control strategies, their effectiveness for reducing the rate of injuries in the construction industry remains uncertain. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To find out which interventions are most effective for reducing on‐the‐job injuries in construction workers. 
Key messages 
We conducted a systematic search of the literature on preventing occupational injuries among construction workers. We included 17 studies in this updated review, rating the evidence as very low quality. Multifaceted interventions and company incentives for upgrading equipment may be effective in reducing injury. However, an evidence base is still needed for the vast majority of safety measures that safety manuals, consultants and safety courses routinely recommend. 
What was studied in the review? 
We looked at different types of workplace interventions, including the introduction of new regulations, safety campaigns, training, inspections, occupational health services, and company subsidies. We evaluated the quality of the studies and the effectiveness of interventions, rating the evidence as very low quality. 
What are the main results of the review? 
Introducing regulations alone may or may not be effective for preventing non‐fatal and fatal injuries in construction workers. Regionally oriented interventions such as a safety campaigns, training, inspections or occupational health services may not be effective for reducing non‐fatal injuries in construction workers. However, a multifaceted safety campaign and a multifaceted drug‐free workplace programme at the company level, along with subsidies for replacement of scaffoldings, may be effective in reducing non‐fatal injuries. 
Additional strategies are needed to increase the employers' and workers' adherence to the safety measures that are prescribed by regulation. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to 1 April 2017.

10.1002-14651858.CD013285.pub2,"Background
There are many accepted airway clearance techniques (ACTs) for managing the respiratory health of people with cystic fibrosis (CF); none of which demonstrate superiority. Other Cochrane Reviews have reported short‐term effects related to mucus transport, but no evidence supporting long‐term benefits. Exercise is an alternative ACT thought to produce shearing forces within the lung parenchyma, which enhances mucociliary clearance and the removal of viscous secretions. 
Recent evidence suggests that some people with CF are using exercise as a substitute for traditional ACTs, yet there is no agreed recommendation for this. Additionally, one of the top 10 research questions identified by people with CF is whether exercise can replace other ACTs. 
Systematically reviewing the evidence for exercise as a safe and effective ACT will help people with CF decide whether to incorporate this strategy into their treatment plans and potentially reduce their treatment burden. The timing of this review is especially pertinent given the shifting landscape of CF management with the advent of highly‐effective small molecule therapies, which are changing the way people with CF are cared for. 
Objectives
To compare the effect of exercise to other ACTs for improving respiratory function and other clinical outcomes in people with CF and to assess the potential adverse effects associated with this ACT. 
Search methods
On 28 February 2022, we searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
We searched online clinical trial registries on 15 February 2022.
We emailed authors of studies awaiting classification or potentially eligible abstracts for additional information on 1 February 2021. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled studies (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing exercise to another ACT in people with CF for at least two treatment sessions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for the included studies. They assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Review authors contacted investigators for further relevant information regarding their publications. 
Main results
We included four RCTs. The 86 participants had a wide range of disease severity (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ranged from 54% to 95%) and were 7 to 41 years old. Two RCTs were cross‐over and two were parallel in design. Participants in one RCT were hospitalised with an acute respiratory exacerbation, whilst the participants in three RCTs were clinically stable. All four RCTs compared exercise either alone or in combination with another ACT, but these were too diverse to allow us to combine results. The certainty of the evidence was very low; we downgraded it due to low participant numbers and high or unclear risks of bias across all domains. 
Exercise versus active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) 
One cross‐over trial (18 participants) compared exercise alone to ACBT. There was no change from baseline in our primary outcome FEV1, although it increased in the exercise group before returning to baseline after 30 minutes; we are unsure if exercise affected FEV1 as the evidence is very low‐certainty. Similar results were seen for other measures of lung function. No adverse events occurred during the exercise sessions (very low‐certainty evidence). We are unsure if ACBT was perceived to be more effective or was the preferred ACT (very low‐certainty evidence). 24‐hour sputum volume was less in the exercise group than with ACBT (secondary outcome). Exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics were not reported. 
Exercise plus postural drainage and percussion (PD&P) versus PD&P only 
Two trials (55 participants) compared exercise and PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial narratively reported a greater increase in FEV1 % predicted with PD&P alone. At six months, the other trial reported a greater increase with exercise combined with PD&P, but did not provide data for the PD&P group. We are uncertain whether exercise with PD&P improves FEV1 as the certainty of evidence is very low. Other measures of lung function did not show clear evidence of effect. One trial reported no difference in exercise capacity (maximal work rate) after two weeks. No adverse events were reported (1 trial, 17 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Adherence was high, with all PD&P sessions and 96% of exercise sessions completed (1 trial, 17 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There was no difference between groups in 24‐hour sputum volume or in the mean duration of hospitalisation, although the six‐month trial reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Quality of life, ACT preference and need for antibiotics were not reported. 
Exercise versus underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP) 
One trial (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group (very low‐certainty evidence). Trial investigators reported that participants perceived exercise as more fatiguing but also more enjoyable than bubble PEP (very low‐certainty evidence). There were no differences found in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The trial did not report the primary outcomes (FEV1, quality of life, exercise capacity) or the secondary outcomes (other measures of lung function, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations). 
Authors' conclusions
As one of the top 10 research questions identified by clinicians and people with CF, it is important to systematically review the literature regarding whether or not exercise is an acceptable and effective ACT, and whether it can replace traditional methods. We identified an insufficient number of trials to conclude whether or not exercise is a suitable alternative ACT, and the diverse design of included trials did not allow for meta‐analysis of results. The evidence is very low‐certainty, so we are uncertain about the effectiveness of exercise as an ACT. Longer studies examining outcomes that are important to people with CF are required to answer this question. 
","Plain Title
Can exercise clear the lungs in cystic fibrosis as well as other methods?

Rationale
Cystic fibrosis, or CF, is a life‑long disease. Thick, sticky mucus builds up in the lungs. This can cause cough, chest infections, and lung damage over time. Daily care to move mucus is hard and takes time.

Many airway clearance methods exist. These include deep breathing patterns, chest claps, and devices. No single method is best. Many people with CF also use exercise to help move mucus.

Some people now use exercise instead of other airway care. They hope to save time and still stay well. But we do not know if this is safe or wise. New CF drugs also change care needs. So, we need clear proof to guide choices.

This study looked at the best proof we have. The team asked: Can exercise clear the lungs as well as other methods? They also asked if it is safe and if people like it.

Trial Design
This was a review of prior trials. The team searched many sources for trials up to early 2022. They looked for trials that put people into groups by chance. They also looked for trials where each person tried both methods.

They found four trials with 86 people. People were 7 to 41 years old. Lung health varied a lot. Some people were in the hospital for a flare. Others felt stable at home.

Two trials had people try both methods at different times. Two trials kept people in one group. Each trial used at least two treatment sessions. Some trials lasted two weeks. One trial followed people for six months.

The trials compared exercise to common airway care. One trial compared exercise to a deep and huff breathing method. This method is called the active cycle of breathing technique, or ACBT. Two trials tested exercise plus chest claps and body positions. This is called postural drainage and percussion, or PD&P. One trial compared exercise to a “bubble” device. This device helps you breathe out against water. It is called underwater positive expiratory pressure, or uPEP.

The trials checked several things. These included a breathing test score. This score measures how much air you can blow out in one second. Trials also checked how much mucus (also called sputum) people cleared. Some checked fitness, how people felt, hospital stays, and side effects.

Results
Overall, the proof was very weak. The trials were small. They used different plans and goals. So, we cannot tell if exercise can replace other care.

Exercise versus ACBT
One trial with 18 people compared exercise to ACBT. The key breathing test score did not end up higher after exercise. It rose during exercise, then went back to the start level in 30 minutes. People coughed up less mucus over a day with exercise than with ACBT. No harms happened during the exercise sessions.

The trial did not report on fitness, mood, or hospital stays. We do not know which method people liked more. We also do not know if people needed more antibiotics.

Exercise plus PD&P versus PD&P only
Two trials with 55 people tested this. After two weeks, one trial saw a larger rise in the breathing score with PD&P alone. After six months, the other trial saw a larger rise with exercise plus PD&P. But that trial did not give full data for the PD&P group. So, we cannot be sure.

One trial found no change in fitness after two weeks. There was no clear change in other lung tests. Both groups cleared about the same mucus over a day. The time spent in the hospital was also about the same. In the six‑month trial, people who did exercise plus PD&P had fewer stays due to flares. No harms were reported. People did most of their sessions. They did all PD&P sessions and almost all exercise sessions.

Exercise versus uPEP (bubble device)
One trial with 13 people tested this. No harms happened. People said exercise felt more fun. They also said it felt more tiring. People cleared the same weight of mucus during sessions with both methods.

This trial did not report the breathing test score. It also did not report fitness, mood, more antibiotics, or hospital stays. So, we cannot tell which way works better.

What this means for people with CF
This review asked a top question from the CF community. Can exercise replace other airway care? Based on the proof we have now, we cannot say yes. We also cannot say no. The proof is too weak to guide a full swap.

Exercise is good for health in many ways. It may help move mucus for some people. Some people also enjoy it more. But we do not have strong proof that it clears lungs as well as other care. We also do not know who might do well with exercise alone.

What should happen next
We need more and better trials. They should be larger and last longer. They should test the results that matter to people with CF. These include lung health over time, daily symptoms, time spent on care, mood, and life quality. They should also track hospital stays and side effects.

For now, do not change your care plan on your own. Talk with your CF care team. Ask how to fit exercise into your plan. Ask what airway care is best for you.","Exercise versus airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
Can exercise replace other methods of airway clearance for people with cystic fibrosis (CF)? 
Background 
CF affects many systems in the body, mainly the respiratory system. It causes a build‐up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs which causes irritation and damage to the lining of the airways. CF treatment involves chest physiotherapy, also called airway clearance, which uses a range of devices or techniques to get rid of this mucus. It has been suggested that exercise may have a similar effect. Exercising results in a person taking different volumes and depths of breaths. This leads to pressure changes and forces within the airways that move secretions out of the lungs. We compared the effect on lung function of exercise versus other techniques, to see if exercise is a suitable alternative for people with CF. We wanted to answer our review question to potentially reduce their treatment burden. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 15 February 2022.
Study characteristics 
We searched the literature for studies where people received at least two treatment sessions of exercise or another airway clearance technique, and report on four studies including 86 people with CF in the review. The people in the studies were aged between 7 and 41 years and had varying degrees of disease severity. Three studies included people who were clinically well and one study included people admitted to hospital for a chest infection. The studies lasted between four days and six months and compared exercise (alone or in combination with another airway clearance technique) to other techniques. Two studies compared exercise with postural drainage and percussion (PD&P), one study compared exercise with the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT) and one study compared exercise with underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP), also known as bubble PEP. Three studies received financial support from funding bodies such as the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, the Buffalo Foundation and the Romanian National Council for Scientific Research in Higher Education. 
Key results 
We did not find enough evidence to conclude whether or not exercise can replace other methods of airway clearance. We did not find any evidence to suggest that exercise was either better or worse than other methods to improve lung function or clear mucus from the airways, although exercising did improve people's exercise ability, and it was the preferred choice of treatment in one study. None of the studies reported any negative effects of exercise therapy. None of the studies evaluated quality of life or the need for extra antibiotic treatment. One study did suggest that exercise alone was less effective at clearing sputum than ACBT. 
Exercise versus ACBT 
One study (18 participants) found that a measure of lung function temporarily (up to 30 minutes) increased in the exercise group only, otherwise there was no difference between the ACBT or the exercise group. No adverse events were reported, and it is not certain if ACBT was thought to be more effective or was preferred. The exercise group produced less sputum than the ACBT group. The study did not report on exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics. 
Exercise plus PD&P versus PD&P alone 
Two studies (55 participants) compared exercise plus PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial described a greater increase in lung function with PD&P alone, while at six months the second study reported a greater increase with exercise plus PD&P (but did not provide data for the PD&P group). One study reported no side effects at all, and also reported no difference between groups in exercise capacity (maximal work rate), sputum volume or the average length of time spent in hospital. Conversely, the second study reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Neither study reported on quality of life, preference and the need for antibiotics. 
Exercise versus uPEP 
One study (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group and investigators reported that those taking part thought that, while exercise was more tiring, it was also more enjoyable than bubble PEP. We found no differences in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The study did not report on lung function, quality of life, exercise capacity, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Overall, we had very little confidence in the evidence because all four studies had few participants and two studies only presented results as a shortened report given at a conference.  
We do not think the fact that participants and people measuring the outcomes knew which treatment the participants were receiving influenced the results of outcomes such as lung function and sputum weight. We do not think the fact that these studies were financed should influence the interpretation of the results in this review.

10.1002-14651858.CD015397,"Background
With the emergence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in late 2019, governments worldwide implemented a multitude of non‐pharmaceutical interventions in order to control the spread of the virus. Most countries have implemented measures within the school setting in order to reopen schools or keep them open whilst aiming to contain the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. For informed decision‐making on implementation, adaptation, or suspension of such measures, it is not only crucial to evaluate their effectiveness with regard to SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission, but also to assess their unintended consequences. 
Objectives
To comprehensively identify and map the evidence on the unintended health and societal consequences of school‐based measures to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. We aimed to generate a descriptive overview of the range of unintended (beneficial or harmful) consequences reported as well as the study designs that were employed to assess these outcomes. This review was designed to complement an existing Cochrane Review on the effectiveness of these measures by synthesising evidence on the implications of the broader system‐level implications of school measures beyond their effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, four non‐health databases, and two COVID‐19 reference collections on 26 March 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and Google searches. 
Selection criteria
We included quantitative (including mathematical modelling), qualitative, and mixed‐methods studies of any design that provided evidence on any unintended consequences of measures implemented in the school setting to contain the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. Studies had to report on at least one unintended consequence, whether beneficial or harmful, of one or more relevant measures, as conceptualised in a logic model.  
Data collection and analysis
We screened the titles/abstracts and subsequently full texts in duplicate, with any discrepancies between review authors resolved through discussion. One review author extracted data for all included studies, with a second review author reviewing the data extraction for accuracy. The evidence was summarised narratively and graphically across four prespecified intervention categories and six prespecified categories of unintended consequences; findings were described as deriving from quantitative, qualitative, or mixed‐method studies. 
Main results
Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 13 used quantitative methods (3 experimental/quasi‐experimental; 5 observational; 5 modelling); four used qualitative methods; and one used mixed methods. Studies looked at effects in different population groups, mainly in children and teachers. The identified interventions were assigned to four broad categories: 14 studies assessed measures to make contacts safer; four studies looked at measures to reduce contacts; six studies assessed surveillance and response measures; and one study examined multiple measures combined. Studies addressed a wide range of unintended consequences, most of them considered harmful. Eleven studies investigated educational consequences. Seven studies reported on psychosocial outcomes. Three studies each provided information on physical health and health behaviour outcomes beyond COVID‐19 and environmental consequences. Two studies reported on socio‐economic consequences, and no studies reported on equity and equality consequences. 
Authors' conclusions
We identified a heterogeneous evidence base on unintended consequences of measures implemented in the school setting to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2, and summarised the available study data narratively and graphically. Primary research better focused on specific measures and various unintended outcomes is needed to fill knowledge gaps and give a broader picture of the diverse unintended consequences of school‐based measures before a more thorough evidence synthesis is warranted. The most notable lack of evidence we found was regarding psychosocial, equity, and equality outcomes. We also found a lack of research on interventions that aim to reduce the opportunity for contacts. Additionally, study investigators should provide sufficient data on contextual factors and demographics in order to ensure analyses of such are feasible, thus assisting stakeholders in making appropriate, informed decisions for their specific circumstances.

School COVID-19 rules: what else they did to kids and staff

Rationale
COVID-19 is an illness caused by a new virus. It spread fast across the world. To slow the spread, schools used many rules. Schools did this so kids could learn in class.

These rules may help limit COVID-19. But they may also cause other effects. Some may help. Some may harm. Leaders need clear facts on both.

This study asked a simple question. What unplanned health and social effects came from school COVID-19 rules? The team looked for good and bad effects. They also looked at how people studied these effects. This work adds to a Cochrane review on how well the rules block spread.

Trial Design
How is this study designed? It is a review of other studies. The team did not test a rule in a new trial. They looked at reports that were already done. They made a map of what we know.

The team searched many places for studies. They checked health research lists like CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. They also checked four non‑health lists and two COVID‑19 lists. They added checks of lists of refs, cites, and Google. The search date was March 26, 2021.

They set clear rules for what to include. A study had to look at a school rule to curb COVID-19. It had to report at least one unplanned effect. The effect could be good or bad. The study could use numbers, people’s views, both, or math models.

Two team members checked study titles and short texts. They then read the full texts. They talked through any split views. One team member pulled out the data. A second team member checked it.

They grouped the school rules into four types. They looked at six types of unplanned effects. They wrote what they found in plain words and with simple charts. They said if each finding used numbers, people’s views, or both. The studies looked at children and teachers. Ages and gender were not the focus here.

Since this was a review, there was no set time in the study for a person. Each report had its own time frame. The team did not change that.

Results
The review found 18 studies that fit the rules. Thirteen used numbers. Of these, a few tested a change and watched what came next. Some watched what was going on. Some used math models. Four used people’s views and words. One used both numbers and views.

Most studies looked at kids and teachers. The rules in schools fell into four groups. Fourteen studies looked at ways to make contact safer. Four studies looked at ways to cut how much people meet. Six studies looked at watch and act steps, like check and respond. One study looked at more than one rule at once.

The studies found many kinds of unplanned effects. Most were harmful. Many were in school and learning. Eleven studies found school and learning effects. Seven studies found mind and social effects. These are things like mood, stress, and how we get on with others.

Three studies found other health or habit effects. These were not about COVID-19. Three studies found effects on the world around us. Two studies found money or job effects. No study looked at fairness or equal chance.

What does this mean? Many school rules may have side effects. Some may set back school work. Some may affect mood or how kids feel. Some may change sleep, food, or play. Some may touch the home or the planet. But the size of each effect is not clear. The studies were very mixed. They used many ways to ask and to test. This makes it hard to compare.

The team saw big gaps. They saw too little on mind and social effects. They saw no work on fairness and equal chance. There was also too little on rules that aim to cut how much people meet. We need more clear work on these.

The team also asked for better study reports. Future work should tell us more about the school and the place. It should say more on who was in the study. That means age, needs, and other facts. This can help leaders pick the right rule for their place.

What are the take‑home points for families and staff? School rules can help slow a virus. But they can also touch learning, mood, and life in many ways. We need to weigh both sides. We need strong, clear studies to guide us. We should not assume all rules work the same in all schools.

In sum, this review mapped what we know so far. It found 18 studies on unplanned effects of school COVID‑19 rules. Most talked about harm, not help. Big gaps remain, such as mind health and fairness. We need more focused studies on single rules and clear outcomes. With better facts, leaders can make wise, kind, and safe plans for schools.","Unintended consequences of school‐based measures to manage the COVID‐19 pandemic
Why is this question important? 
Countries worldwide have taken many public health and social measures to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2, a highly contagious respiratory virus responsible for COVID‐19. A range of measures have been put in place to minimise transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 within schools and the wider community. Schools have the potential to be settings of high viral transmission because they involve extended interactions amongst people in close proximity. A previous review located and examined studies on the effectiveness of such school‐based measures regarding SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission. It is equally important to look at their unintended consequences on health and society in order that policymakers and parents can make informed decisions. Unintended consequences of a public health measure may be beneficial or harmful (or a mix of both). A public health measure may result in a mix of benefits and harms. For this review, we planned to examine the unintended consequences of measures designed to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 in schools. This review can therefore be seen as complementing the previous review on the effectiveness of such measures.    
What did we do? 
Firstly, we searched nine databases for studies that assessed any measure put in place in the school settings (primary or secondary schools, or both) to prevent transmission of the virus. We considered all types of studies and a broad range of outcomes. 
Secondly, we grouped the identified studies according to the types of measures they examined. We then described which approaches were used in the studies, where these were conducted, and which unintended consequences were evaluated.  
What did we find? 
We found 18 studies that matched our inclusion criteria. Five studies used ‘real‐life’ data (observational studies); five studies used data generated by a computer and based on a set of assumptions (modelling studies); three studies were experimental studies (e.g. laboratory‐based); and four studies used qualitative methods, meaning they based their findings on interviews with people. One study used mixed methods, combining numerical and non‐numerical (qualitative) information.  
Studies examined four different types of measures, as follows.
‐ Measures to reduce contacts (4 studies): policies to reduce the number of students in the school building (i.e. reducing the number of students present per class) and/or to reduce the number of contacts of students (e.g. through defined groups or staggered arrival, breaks, and departures). 
‐ Measures to make contacts safer (14 studies): practices to ensure safer contacts between people in the school and classroom setting (e.g. mask mandates or distancing regulations), to modify the environment or activities (e.g. enhanced cleaning or ventilation practices). 
‐ Surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (6 studies): testing and/or screening strategies (e.g. temperature taking, screening tests for students and staff, and testing of symptomatic students and staff) and self‐isolation or quarantine measures. 
‐ Multicomponent measures (1 study): interventions using a combination of at least two of the above measures. 
We looked at the following unintended outcomes.
‐ Educational consequences (11 studies), e.g. changes in school performance, advancement to the next grade, or change in graduation numbers. 
‐ Psychosocialoutcomes (7 studies), e.g. mental health, anxieties about going to school. 
‐ Physical health and health behaviour outcomes beyond COVID‐19 (3 studies), e.g. hand eczema due to increased handwashing. 
‐ Environmental consequences (3 studies), e.g. changes in air quality in classrooms. 
‐ Socio‐economic consequences (2 studies), e.g. economic burden on families.  
What did we conclude? 
We identified a wide range of unintended consequences of school‐based measures designed to prevent the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. However, the evidence base is small, and there are large gaps where more research is needed. This scoping review is a first step in gauging the extent of those consequences. More research is needed to collect additional information and to enable a more thorough analysis of the evidence. Psychosocial consequences (e.g. mental health issues, depression, loneliness) and equity and equality consequences (e.g. disadvantages for children from low‐income households, unfair distribution of work between genders for parents, are in need of further attention. We recommend that future research look at interventions such as fixed groups, alternating physical presence at school and staggered arrival departure and break times, as well as testing and quarantine measures.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to March 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD003552.pub4,"Skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control
The skin patch and the vaginal (birth canal) ring are two methods of birth control. Both methods contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. The patch is a small, thin, adhesive square that is applied to the skin. The contraceptive vaginal ring is a flexible, lightweight device that is inserted into the vagina. Both methods release drugs like those in birth control pills. These methods could be used more consistently than pills because they do not require a daily dose. This review looked at how well the methods worked to prevent pregnancy, if they caused bleeding problems, if women used them as prescribed, and how safe they were. 
Through February 2013, we did computer searches for randomized controlled trials of the skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control. Pills included types with both estrogen and progestin. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. 
We found 18 trials. Of six patch trials, five compared the marketed patch to birth control pills and one studied a patch being developed. Of 12 ring trials, 11 looked at the marketed ring and pills while one studied a ring being developed. The methods compared had similar pregnancy rates. Patch users reported using their method more consistently than the pill group did. Only half of the patch studies had data on pregnancy or whether the women used the method correctly. However, most of the ring studies had those data. 
Patch users were more likely than pill users to drop out early from the trial. Ring users were not more likely to drop out early. Compared to pill users, users of the marketed patch had more breast discomfort, painful periods, nausea, and vomiting. Ring users had more vaginal irritation and discharge than pill users but less nausea, acne, irritability, depression, and emotional changes. Ring users often had fewer bleeding problems than pill users. 
The quality of information was classed as low for the patch trials and moderate for the ring studies. Lower quality was due to not reporting how groups were assigned or not having good outcome measures. Other issues were high losses and taking assigned women out of the analysis. Studies of the patch and ring should provide more detail on whether women used the method correctly.

Birth control by skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills

Rationale
Many people use birth control to avoid a pregnancy. The pill can work well. But you must take it each day. It is easy to miss a pill.

A skin patch and a soft ring are other ways to take the same type of hormones. Hormones are body signals. These two are called estrogen and progestin. The patch goes on the skin. The ring goes in the vagina.

You do not need to remember a pill each day with these ways. So, some people may use them more as told. This could mean fewer missed doses. That could help prevent a pregnancy.

This study asked a simple set of questions. Do the patch or ring work as well as pills to prevent pregnancy? Do they cause more or fewer side effects than pills? Do people use them as told? Are they safe to use?

The goal was to help people choose a method. The team also asked if the proof was strong. Strong proof helps us trust the results. It also guides doctors and patients.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team looked for fair tests that put people into groups by chance. The team looked at trials through February of 2013. They also wrote to study teams to find more trials.

The trials compared the patch or ring to a birth control pill. The pills had both hormones named above. The trials were for women who could get pregnant. The trials took place in many sites.

The review found 18 trials. Six trials looked at the patch. Five used a brand patch on the market. One used a test patch still in study.

Twelve trials looked at the ring. Eleven used a brand ring on the market. One used a test ring still in study. Each trial had its own time line.

The review did not list one set time in a trial. So we do not know how long each person was in a trial. Some trials did not share all key facts. That limits what we can say.

Results
The patch, the ring, and the pill worked about the same to prevent pregnancy. This came from the trials that gave those data. Many ring trials shared those data. Only about half of the patch trials shared those data.

People who used the patch said they used it as told more than pill users. But only half of the patch trials gave use data. Many ring trials gave use data as well. This helps us trust the ring results more.

More people stopped the patch early than the pill. This means they left the trial before it was done. Ring users were not more likely to stop than pill users. This was a steady trend in the trials.

Side effects were not the same across methods. Patch users had more breast pain. They also had more bad cramps. They felt sick to the gut and threw up more often.

Ring users had more vaginal itch or pain. They also had more vaginal fluid. But ring users had less nausea. They had fewer pimples.

Ring users also had fewer mood issues than pill users. They were less irritable. They felt less sad or low. They had fewer sudden mood swings.

Bleeding can be a concern with birth control. Some have spotting or bleed at odd times. Ring users often had fewer bleed issues than pill users. That may be a plus for some users.

The review also judged how strong the proof was. The patch trials had low proof strength. Some did not tell how they chose who went in each group. Some did not track the right things well.

Many patch trials also lost many people. Some left out people in the math at the end. These things make the proof less strong. So we must be more careful with patch results.

The ring trials had mid-level proof strength. They did a better job of sharing key facts. They tracked the right things more often. Fewer did not share how they set up the groups.

What does this mean for you? The patch and ring seem to prevent pregnancy as well as pills. The ring may cause less nausea and fewer mood issues. But it may cause more vaginal itch and fluid.

The patch may be easy to use. Some people may use it more as told. But more people stopped it early. Patch users had more breast pain and stomach upset.

No one method is best for all. Your choice may rest on what side effects you wish to avoid. It may also rest on how you like to take your birth control. Daily pills, a weekly patch, or a ring you place and leave in can all work.

This review shows we need better trials. We need clear facts on how people use each method. We need clear rules on how to track key things. That will help us trust the results more.

Talk with your nurse or doctor. Share what matters most to you. Use this plain guide to ask good questions. Then choose the method that fits your life.","Skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control
The skin patch and the vaginal (birth canal) ring are two methods of birth control. Both methods contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. The patch is a small, thin, adhesive square that is applied to the skin. The contraceptive vaginal ring is a flexible, lightweight device that is inserted into the vagina. Both methods release drugs like those in birth control pills. These methods could be used more consistently than pills because they do not require a daily dose. This review looked at how well the methods worked to prevent pregnancy, if they caused bleeding problems, if women used them as prescribed, and how safe they were. 
Through February 2013, we did computer searches for randomized controlled trials of the skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control. Pills included types with both estrogen and progestin. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. 
We found 18 trials. Of six patch trials, five compared the marketed patch to birth control pills and one studied a patch being developed. Of 12 ring trials, 11 looked at the marketed ring and pills while one studied a ring being developed. The methods compared had similar pregnancy rates. Patch users reported using their method more consistently than the pill group did. Only half of the patch studies had data on pregnancy or whether the women used the method correctly. However, most of the ring studies had those data. 
Patch users were more likely than pill users to drop out early from the trial. Ring users were not more likely to drop out early. Compared to pill users, users of the marketed patch had more breast discomfort, painful periods, nausea, and vomiting. Ring users had more vaginal irritation and discharge than pill users but less nausea, acne, irritability, depression, and emotional changes. Ring users often had fewer bleeding problems than pill users. 
The quality of information was classed as low for the patch trials and moderate for the ring studies. Lower quality was due to not reporting how groups were assigned or not having good outcome measures. Other issues were high losses and taking assigned women out of the analysis. Studies of the patch and ring should provide more detail on whether women used the method correctly.

10.1002-14651858.CD013699,"Background
Reducing the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is a global priority. Contact tracing identifies people who were recently in contact with an infected individual, in order to isolate them and reduce further transmission. Digital technology could be implemented to augment and accelerate manual contact tracing. Digital tools for contact tracing may be grouped into three areas: 1) outbreak response; 2) proximity tracing; and 3) symptom tracking. We conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of digital solutions to contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits, harms, and acceptability of personal digital contact tracing solutions for identifying contacts of an identified positive case of an infectious disease. 
Search methods
An information specialist searched the literature from 1 January 2000 to 5 May 2020 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. Additionally, we screened the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, quasi‐RCTs, cohort studies, cross‐sectional studies and modelling studies, in general populations. We preferentially included studies of contact tracing during infectious disease outbreaks (including COVID‐19, Ebola, tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome) as direct evidence, but considered comparative studies of contact tracing outside an outbreak as indirect evidence. 
The digital solutions varied but typically included software (or firmware) for users to install on their devices or to be uploaded to devices provided by governments or third parties. Control measures included traditional or manual contact tracing, self‐reported diaries and surveys, interviews, other standard methods for determining close contacts, and other technologies compared to digital solutions (e.g. electronic medical records). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened records and all potentially relevant full‐text publications. One review author extracted data for 50% of the included studies, another extracted data for the remaining 50%; the second review author checked all the extracted data. One review author assessed quality of included studies and a second checked the assessments. Our outcomes were identification of secondary cases and close contacts, time to complete contact tracing, acceptability and accessibility issues, privacy and safety concerns, and any other ethical issue identified. Though modelling studies will predict estimates of the effects of different contact tracing solutions on outcomes of interest, cohort studies provide empirically measured estimates of the effects of different contact tracing solutions on outcomes of interest. We used GRADE‐CERQual to describe certainty of evidence from qualitative data and GRADE for modelling and cohort studies. 
Main results
We identified six cohort studies reporting quantitative data and six modelling studies reporting simulations of digital solutions for contact tracing. Two cohort studies also provided qualitative data. Three cohort studies looked at contact tracing during an outbreak, whilst three emulated an outbreak in non‐outbreak settings (schools). Of the six modelling studies, four evaluated digital solutions for contact tracing in simulated COVID‐19 scenarios, while two simulated close contacts in non‐specific outbreak settings. 
Modelling studies 
Two modelling studies provided low‐certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases using digital contact tracing (measured as average number of secondary cases per index case ‐ effective reproductive number (Reff)). One study estimated an 18% reduction in Reff with digital contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone, and a 35% reduction with manual contact‐tracing. Another found a reduction in Reff for digital contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone (26% reduction) and a reduction in Reff for manual contact tracing compared to self‐isolation alone (53% reduction). However, the certainty of evidence was reduced by unclear specifications of their models, and assumptions about the effectiveness of manual contact tracing (assumed 95% to 100% of contacts traced), and the proportion of the population who would have the app (53%). 
Cohort studies 
Two cohort studies provided very low‐certainty evidence of a benefit of digital over manual contact tracing. During an Ebola outbreak, contact tracers using an app found twice as many close contacts per case on average than those using paper forms. Similarly, after a pertussis outbreak in a US hospital, researchers found that radio‐frequency identification identified 45 close contacts but searches of electronic medical records found 13. The certainty of evidence was reduced by concerns about imprecision, and serious risk of bias due to the inability of contact tracing study designs to identify the true number of close contacts. 
One cohort study provided very low‐certainty evidence that an app could reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts. The certainty of evidence for this outcome was affected by imprecision and serious risk of bias. Contact tracing teams reported that digital data entry and management systems were faster to use than paper systems and possibly less prone to data loss. 
Two studies from lower‐ or middle‐income countries, reported that contact tracing teams found digital systems simpler to use and generally preferred them over paper systems; they saved personnel time, reportedly improved accuracy with large data sets, and were easier to transport compared with paper forms. However, personnel faced increased costs and internet access problems with digital compared to paper systems. 
Devices in the cohort studies appeared to have privacy from contacts regarding the exposed or diagnosed users. However, there were risks of privacy breaches from snoopers if linkage attacks occurred, particularly for wearable devices. 
Authors' conclusions
The effectiveness of digital solutions is largely unproven as there are very few published data in real‐world outbreak settings. Modelling studies provide low‐certainty evidence of a reduction in secondary cases if digital contact tracing is used together with other public health measures such as self‐isolation. Cohort studies provide very low‐certainty evidence that digital contact tracing may produce more reliable counts of contacts and reduce time to complete contact tracing. Digital solutions may have equity implications for at‐risk populations with poor internet access and poor access to digital technology. 
Stronger primary research on the effectiveness of contact tracing technologies is needed, including research into use of digital solutions in conjunction with manual systems, as digital solutions are unlikely to be used alone in real‐world settings. Future studies should consider access to and acceptability of digital solutions, and the resultant impact on equity. Studies should also make acceptability and uptake a primary research question, as privacy concerns can prevent uptake and effectiveness of these technologies.

Do phone and tech tools help trace COVID-19 and other germs?

Rationale
When a germ spreads, time matters. We need to find people who were near a sick person. This is called contact tracing. It helps stop the spread.

Old, paper based steps can be slow. They can miss people. Tech tools may help. A phone app or a small badge can log who you were near. This may help teams find close contacts fast.

The team asked a clear question. Do digital tools help contact tracing work better than paper or memory? They also looked at harms and what people think of these tools. They asked if the tools keep data safe.

The focus was the virus that causes COVID-19. But they also looked at other outbreaks. These include Ebola, TB (a lung germ), SARS, and MERS. They hoped to learn if tech can cut new cases. They also asked if people can and will use these tools.

Trial Design
This was a rapid review. A review sums up many past studies. It was not a new trial in people.

The team searched for studies from early 2000 to early May 2020. They used big health data banks. They also used a COVID-19 study list. They set firm rules for which studies to include.

They looked at several study types. These were computer models and real world reports. Some were set in an outbreak. Some were set in schools. People in the studies were from the general public. Some had close contact with sick people. The review did not list age or sex.

Digital tools were phone apps, badges, or other device tools. Some tools were on phones people already had. Some tools were on devices from a group or a clinic. The tools found people who were near a sick person. The tools also helped teams store and sort data.

The review also looked at usual ways to trace contacts. These were phone calls, paper forms, talks with staff, and lists from clinics. The team compared digital tools to these usual ways.

Main outcomes were clear. How many close contacts did teams find? How fast did they finish the list? What did staff think about the tools? Were there access or cost issues? Were there privacy risks?

No one joined this review as a trial volunteer. So there was no set time that a person stayed in a study.

Results
The team found twelve studies. Six were computer models. Six were real world reports. Two of the real world reports also had staff views.

The computer models gave low certainty signs. In plain words, we are not very sure. Some models said apps may help cut new cases. This was when people who were sick or exposed also stayed home. One model found apps could cut new cases by about one fifth. It found manual tracing could cut by about one third. Another model found apps could cut new cases by about one quarter. It found manual tracing could cut by about one half.

These models had limits. They made strong guesses. For example, some guessed that almost all contacts could be found by hand. Some guessed that over half of people would use the app. The model plans were not always clear.

The real world reports gave very low certainty signs. In plain words, we are very unsure. In one Ebola study, app use found twice as many close contacts per case as paper. In one U.S. hospital after a whooping cough case, radio badges found 45 close contacts. A search of clinic records found 13.

One study said an app helped trace contacts faster. But this also had limits. The team could not tell the true total count of close contacts. The samples were small. This makes the data less sure.

Staff views gave mixed news. Teams in low or mid income places liked digital tools. They said the tools were easy to carry and to use. They said the tools saved time and helped with huge data sets. But teams also faced extra costs. Some had poor internet. These made the tools hard to use.

The review also looked at privacy and safety. In the studies, most tools hid who was sick from contacts. But there were risks. A person who snoops could link data and guess who was sick. This risk may be higher with badges you wear.

These tools may also raise fairness issues. People with poor internet or old phones may be left out. That can widen gaps in health.

What does all this mean? We still lack strong proof from real life outbreaks. Apps may help a bit. They may help most when used with other steps. These steps include stay at home when you are sick, wash hands, and wear masks when told. Manual tracing still seems key.

We need better studies. These should test app use along with manual steps. They should ask first if people can and will use the tools. They should test ways to guard privacy. They should also look at costs and access. We need to make sure the tools help all groups, not just some.

In short, tech tools may help contact tracing. But they are not a magic fix. They may work best as one part of a full public health plan.","Are digital contact tracing technologies effective during infectious disease outbreaks?
Why is this question important? 
The global COVID‐19 pandemic highlights the importance of accurate and timely contact tracing. Contact tracing tells people that they may have been near someone with ‐ or showing symptoms of ‐ an infectious disease, allowing them to self‐isolate and helping to stop the spread of infection. Traditionally, contact tracing begins with notification that someone has an infectious disease. They are asked to recall their contacts, going back two to three days before symptom onset. This is time‐consuming and may not always give a complete picture, so digital aids could help contact tracers. 
Digital contact tracing uses technology to track and trace contacts. Individuals download an app onto their smartphones and record location and symptom information, or their devices might use location‐finding technology, like Bluetooth or GPS (global positioning system). If the user is infected, the technology identifies close contacts and/or secondary infections (people to whom they passed the disease), and informs people whom they have been near. The technology identifies where the infection was passed on and its duration (the context). 
However, problems may occur where access to technology is limited, in low‐income settings or for elderly people, for example. Also, some people see it as an invasion of privacy and are suspicious of how their data will be used. 
We wanted to know whether digital contact tracing, compared to manual contact tracing, is effective in reducing the spread of infection, as measured by secondary infections, identifying close contacts, tracing a complete set of contacts, and identifying the context of infection. 
What did we do? 
We searched medical databases for studies that assessed digital contact tracing. We preferred studies set during infectious disease outbreaks, which assessed real people in real time, but we included studies in any setting and of any design. 
To answer our question quickly, we shortened some steps of the Cochrane review process, however, we are confident in our conclusions. 
What we found 
We found 12 relevant studies. Six assessed the effectiveness of digital contact tracing on specific groups (cohorts) of people: three during an outbreak (Ebola in Sierra Leone; tuberculosis in Botswana; and whooping cough (pertussis) in USA); and three replicated an outbreak in schools to assess systems for identifying close contacts of participants. The remaining six were modelling studies, which simulated digital contact tracing. 
Main results 
Digital contact tracing with self‐isolation probably reduces the number of secondary infections, but not as much as manual contact tracing with self‐isolation (2 modelling studies). 
Digital contact tracing found more close contacts in two outbreaks than manual (2 studies in USA and Sierra Leone). Devices in non‐outbreak settings can identify more close contacts than self‐reported diaries or surveys. 
An app may reduce the time to complete a set of close contacts (1 study). Digital systems were faster to use than paper systems for recording new contacts and monitoring known contacts, and possibly less prone to data loss. 
Problems with system access (2 studies) included patchy network coverage, lack of data, technical problems and higher staff training needs. Contact tracers' personal expenses increased (1 study) due to travel and recharging phone batteries. Devices all appeared to protect diagnosed users from contacts, snoopers and authorities but one app's users were members of public health agencies. Studies recorded stolen hardware (second‐hand mobile phones); reported that paper forms were ""often lost"", and that digital data were password protected (2 studies) and encrypted (1 study). 
We found no evidence on contextual information and acceptability.
What this means 
It is unlikely that digital technologies would be the sole method of contact tracing during an outbreak; they would probably be used alongside manual methods. Unfortunately, the technology is largely unproven in real‐world outbreak settings and none of our included studies assessed digital plus manual contact tracing with digital contact tracing alone. Our included studies assessed different technologies and used different methods from each other, so we are uncertain about their evidence. 
Governments that implement digital contact tracing should ensure that at‐risk populations are not disadvantaged and take privacy concerns into account. 
This review is up to date to May 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013515.pub2,"Background
Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a group of musculoskeletal disorders affecting the jaw. They are frequently associated with pain that can be difficult to manage and may become persistent (chronic). Psychological therapies aim to support people with TMDs to manage their pain, leading to reduced pain, disability and distress. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychological therapies in people (aged 12 years and over) with painful TMD lasting 3 months or longer. 
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched six bibliographic databases up to 21 October 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any psychological therapy (e.g. cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), behaviour therapy (BT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), mindfulness) for the management of painful TMD. We compared these against control or alternative treatment (e.g. oral appliance, medication, physiotherapy). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We reported outcome data immediately after treatment and at the longest available follow‐up. 
We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies. Two review authors independently assessed each included study for any risk of bias in sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting of outcomes, and other issues. We judged the certainty of the evidence for each key comparison and outcome as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE criteria. 
Main results
We identified 22 RCTs (2001 participants), carried out between 1967 and 2021. We were able to include 12 of these studies in meta‐analyses. The risk of bias was high across studies, and we judged the certainty of the evidence to be low to very low overall; further research may change the findings. Our key outcomes of interest were: pain intensity, disability caused by pain, adverse events and psychological distress. Treatments varied in length, with the shortest being 4 weeks. The follow‐up time ranged from 3 months to 12 months. Most studies evaluated CBT.   
At treatment completion, there was no evidence of a benefit of CBT on pain intensity when measured against alternative treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.03, confidence interval (CI) ‐0.21 to 0.28; P = 0.79; 5 studies, 509 participants) or control (SMD ‐0.09, CI ‐0.30 to 0.12; P = 0.41; 6 studies, 577 participants). At follow‐up, there was evidence of a small benefit of CBT for reducing pain intensity compared to alternative treatment (SMD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.50 to ‐0.08; 5 studies, 475 participants) and control (SMD ‐0.30, CI ‐0.51 to ‐0.09; 6 studies, 639 participants). 
At treatment completion, there was no evidence of a difference in disability outcomes (interference in activities caused by pain) between CBT and alternative treatment (SMD 0.15, CI ‐0.40 to 0.10; P = 0.25; 3 studies, 245 participants), or between CBT and control/usual care (SMD 0.02, CI ‐0.21 to 0.24; P = 0.88; 3 studies, 315 participants). Nor was there evidence of a difference at follow‐up (CBT versus alternative treatment: SMD ‐0.15, CI ‐0.42 to 0.12; 3 studies, 245 participants; CBT versus control: SMD 0.01 CI ‐ 0.61 to 0.64; 2 studies, 240 participants). 
There were very few data on adverse events. From the data available, adverse effects associated with psychological treatment tended to be minor and to occur less often than in alternative treatment groups. There were, however, insufficient data available to draw firm conclusions. 
CBT showed a small benefit in terms of reducing psychological distress at treatment completion compared to alternative treatment (SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.50 to ‐0.15; 6 studies, 553 participants), which was maintained at follow‐up (SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.51 to ‐0.13; 6 studies, 516 participants). For CBT versus control, only one study reported results for distress and did not find evidence of a difference between groups at treatment completion (mean difference (MD) 2.36, 95% CI ‐1.17 to 5.89; 101 participants) or follow‐up (MD ‐1.02, 95% CI ‐4.02 to 1.98; 101 participants). 
We assessed the certainty of the evidence to be low or very low for all comparisons and outcomes. 
The data were insufficient to draw any reliable conclusions about psychological therapies other than CBT. 
Authors' conclusions
We found mixed evidence for the effects of psychological therapies on painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). There is low‐certainty evidence that CBT may reduce pain intensity more than alternative treatments or control when measured at longest follow‐up,  but not at treatment completion. There is low‐certainty evidence that CBT may be better than alternative treatments, but not control, for reducing psychological distress at treatment completion and follow‐up. There is low‐certainty evidence that CBT may not be better than other treatments or control for pain disability outcomes.  
There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about alternative psychological therapeutic approaches, and there are insufficient data to be clear about adverse effects that may be associated with psychological therapies for painful TMD.  
Overall, we found insufficient evidence on which to base a reliable judgement about the efficacy of psychological therapies for painful TMD. Further research is needed to determine whether or not psychological therapies are effective, the most effective type of therapy and delivery method, and how it can best be targeted. In particular, high‐quality RCTs conducted in primary care and community settings are required, which evaluate a range of psychological approaches against alternative treatments or usual care, involve both adults and adolescents, and collect measures of pain intensity, pain disability and psychological distress until at least 12 months post‐treatment.

Do talk and mind therapies help long‑lasting jaw pain?

Rationale
Jaw joint and muscle problems are called temporomandibular disorders, or TMD. They can cause pain in the jaw, face, head, or neck. This pain can last a long time. It can make it hard to eat, sleep, work, or enjoy life.

Many people find this pain hard to treat. Pain can also affect mood and stress. Stress, worry, and pain can make each other worse.

Talk and mind therapies try to help with this cycle. These include cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT. CBT helps people change thoughts and acts linked to pain. Other types include behavior therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and mindfulness. These aim to teach skills to cope with pain and stress.

This study asked two main questions. Do these therapies lower pain and the limits pain can cause? Do they help mood and worry? The study also asked if they are safe. We need this review to guide care now. We also need it to plan better tests in the future.

Trial Design
This was a review of many fair tests. In these tests, people got one of two or more treatments by chance. The team looked for all the tests they could find up to late 2021.

They included people age 12 and older. All had painful TMD for 3 months or more. The review found 22 tests. These tests took place from 1967 to 2021. In total, 2001 people took part.

Most tests looked at CBT. A few looked at other mind therapies. The therapies were compared to no extra care, or to other care. Other care could be a bite splint for the teeth. It could be drugs, or body therapy like physio, or usual care.

Therapy time was often short. The shortest time was 4 weeks. After care, teams checked on people for 3 to 12 months. The review looked at pain, daily life limits due to pain, mood and worry, and side effects. The team also judged how strong or weak the proof was.

Results
Pain levels:
- At the end of care, CBT did not beat other care for pain. It also did not beat no extra care at that time.
- At later checks, CBT showed a small drop in pain. It did a bit better than other care. It also did a bit better than no extra care.

Limits due to pain:
- CBT did not lower pain limits more than other care. This was true at the end of care and later.
- CBT did not lower pain limits more than no extra care. This was true at the end of care and later.

Mood and worry:
- At the end of care, CBT helped mood and worry a bit more than other care. This small gain stayed at later checks.
- Against no extra care, only one test gave mood results. That test found no clear edge for CBT at the end of care or later.

Side effects:
- Few tests told us about harms. In those that did, harms seemed rare and mild. People in mind therapy groups had fewer harms than those in other care. But there was not enough data to be sure.

Other mind therapies:
- There were not enough tests on behavior therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, or mindfulness. We cannot say if they help or not.

What this means for patients:
- CBT may help lower pain a bit over time. It may help mood and worry a bit more than other care. It may not change how much pain limits daily life. The size of these gains seems small.
- We do not know much about side effects. The few reports suggest low risk. But we need more data.

How strong is the proof:
- The proof was weak. Many tests had limits in how they were done or reported. The results may change if we get better tests.

What comes next:
- We need new, high‑quality tests. These tests should be in regular clinics and the community. They should include teens and adults. They should compare mind therapy to other care and to usual care. They should check pain, life limits, and mood for at least 12 months.

Bottom line:
- Mind therapy, mostly CBT, may help pain and mood a little over time. It may not change how much pain gets in the way of life. We are not yet sure. Talk with your care team about what matters most to you. Ask about all care options, risks, and what you can expect.","What are the benefits and risks of psychological therapies for adults and young people over 12 years old with painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? 
Key messages 
The overall results are mixed, but indicate that psychological therapies may be a useful approach for painful TMD as there is some limited evidence that they can reduce the pain. Our review suggests that they may do this at least as well as other available treatments. Any negative effects of psychological therapies are unclear, and more research is needed before we can know whether they provide a noticeable benefit while causing no or few problems. 
What is the condition? 
Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are conditions that affect the jaw joint and the muscles that move it. They are often associated with pain that lasts more than 3 months (known as chronic pain). Other symptoms include limited mouth opening, and jaw clicking and locking. All symptoms can interfere with quality of life and mood. 
What did we want to know? 
We wanted to find out how effective psychological therapies are for adults and young people over the age of 12 years who have painful TMD that has lasted at least 3 months. 
What did we do? 
We searched databases of medical and dental journals and research studies. We only selected studies known as 'randomised controlled trials (RCTs)'. In this type of study, participants are allocated to groups randomly. One group receives the intervention and the other receives a different treatment or no treatment at all. RCTs aim to reduce the risk of introducing bias in clinical studies. 
We looked for reports of RCTs of psychological therapies compared to different treatments or no treatment in people over 12 years of age. Most of the reports we found compared psychological therapy to medication or the use of a special mouthguard.  
We chose to focus on three measures of success. These were reduction in pain intensity, interference with activities caused by pain ('pain disability'), and psychological distress. We looked for details of these measures immediately after treatment and a few months later. We also looked for information on any 'adverse effects' (negative side effects of the treatments).  
We used standard Cochrane methods to decide which studies to include, collect the key information from the studies, judge whether or not the studies were biased in any way, and judge how certain we can be about the results. 
What did we find? 
Overall we found 22 relevant studies. Most of the studies reported on one particular form of psychological therapy called cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). We did not have enough information to draw any conclusions about any other psychological therapies. 
The results told us that CBT was no different to other treatments (e.g. oral splints, medicine) or usual care/no treatment in reducing the intensity of the TMD pain by the end of treatment. There was some evidence that people who had CBT might have slightly less pain a few months after treatment.  
There was some evidence that CBT might be better than other treatments for reducing psychological distress both at the end of treatment and a few months later. This was not seen in the one study that compared CBT against usual care. 
In terms of how much pain interfered with activities, there was no evidence that there was any difference between CBT and other treatments.  
There was too little information to be sure about whether psychological treatments cause adverse effects (problems caused by treatment such as feeling unwell or worse pain or unexpected effects). Only six of the 22 studies measured what adverse effects participants experienced. In these six studies, adverse effects associated with psychological treatment seemed to be minor in general and to occur less often than in alternative treatment groups.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We have little confidence in the evidence because many of the studies had design limitations. There was also variation in the length of treatment and in how it was delivered. This means that we need to be cautious in interpreting the results that we found and they may not be reliable. 
How up to date is the evidence? 
We searched for studies up to 21 October 2021.

New minimal invasive surgeries have been suggested as alternative options to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy is a new technology that uses targeted, controlled water vapour energy (steam) to create necrotic tissue in the prostate. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and the Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings published up to 18 February 2020, with no restriction on the language or status of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, and non‐randomised observational prospective studies with concurrent comparison groups, in which men with BPH underwent convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy, another active therapy, or a sham procedure. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We had planned to perform statistical analyses using a random‐effects model, and interpret them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the certainty of the evidence according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included a single, industry‐sponsored RCT, with 197 randomised men, that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to a sham procedure. The mean age 62.9 years, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was 21.97, and the mean prostate volume was 45.4 mL. We only found short‐term data, measured up to three months. 
Primary outcomes 
Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may improve urologic symptom scores more than a sham procedure, measured on a IPSS scale (0 to 35; higher score represents worse urological symptoms) by a mean difference (MD) of ‐6.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐9.06 to ‐4.74; 195 men; low‐certainty evidence), and likely improves quality of life (QoL), measured on a IPSS‐QoL scale (0 to 6; higher score represents worse QoL), by a MD of ‐1.2 (95% CI ‐1.66 to ‐0.74; 195 men; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on major adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 6.79, 95% CI 0.39 to 117.00; 197 men; very low‐certainty evidence) assessed by the Clavien‐Dindo classification system of III, IV, and V complications. 
Secondary outcomes 
We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on retreatment (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.06 to 32.86; 197 men; very low‐certainty evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may have little to no effect on erectile function (MD 0.4, 95% CI ‐1.91 to 2.71; 130 men; low‐certainty evidence) and ejaculatory function (MD 0.5, 95% CI ‐0.83 to 1.83; 130 men; low‐certainty evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may increase minor adverse events assessed by the Clavien‐Dindo classification system of Grade I and II complications (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.11; 197 men; low‐certainty evidence). This would correspond to 434 minor adverse events per 1000 men (95% CI 264 more to 714 more). We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on acute urinary retention (RR 4.98, 95% CI 0.28 to 86.63; 197 men; very low‐certainty evidence). It likely greatly increases the rate of men requiring indwelling urinary catheters (RR 35.58, 95% CI 15.37 to 82.36; 197 men; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
We were unable to perform any of the predefined secondary analyses.
We found no evidence for other comparisons, such as convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy versus TURP or other minimal invasive procedures. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared to a sham procedure, urologic symptom scores and quality of life appear to improve with convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy, but we are very uncertain about major adverse events. The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, with study limitations and imprecision being the most common reasons for rating down. These findings are based on a single industry‐sponsored study, with three‐month short‐term follow‐up. We did not find any studies comparing convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to any other active treatment form, such as TURP.

Steam treatment for an enlarged prostate: what one study found

Rationale
Many men have an enlarged prostate as they age. Doctors call this benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. BPH can cause lower urinary tract symptoms, or LUTS. These include a weak stream, a stop‑start flow, and many night trips to the bathroom.

These symptoms can hurt sleep, mood, and daily life. Surgery called TURP can help. But TURP is invasive and can have risks. New, less invasive care may let men heal faster with fewer risks.

One new option uses steam. It sends small bursts of water vapor into the prostate. The heat kills small areas of extra tissue. The goal is to open the urine path and ease symptoms. This review asked if steam therapy helps men with BPH. It also asked if it is safe.

Trial Design
Researchers looked for all good quality studies on steam therapy for BPH. They searched many medical libraries and trial lists up to February 18, 2020. They found only one randomized controlled trial. In a randomized trial, chance decides who gets which care. This helps make the groups alike.

This trial had 197 men. The average age was about 63. Their urine symptom score was about 22 on a 0 to 35 scale. Higher numbers mean worse symptoms. The average prostate size was about 45 mL.

Men got steam therapy or a sham procedure. A sham is a “fake” procedure. It looks the same but does not give the real treatment. This trial was paid for by the maker of the steam device. Men were followed for up to three months.

Results
Symptoms improved more with steam than with sham. On the 0 to 35 symptom scale, scores fell by about 7 points more with steam. A lower score means fewer symptoms. This means many men felt better in the short term.

Quality of life also improved. On a 0 to 6 scale, scores fell by about 1 point more with steam. A lower score means a better life day to day. These results were short term only.

Erection and ejaculation did not change much. Scores for these were about the same in both groups. This means steam did not seem to harm sex function in this short time.

We do not know the risk of major side effects from this trial. The data were too small to be sure. Major side effects are the kinds that need more care in the hospital. We need larger and longer studies to be sure.

Mild side effects were more common with steam. These are problems like pain, burning, or blood in urine that go away with time. In 1000 men, there may be about 434 extra mild problems with steam. This estimate comes from the trial data. But the exact number is not clear.

Needing a bladder tube, called a catheter, was much more common after steam. A catheter is a soft tube that drains urine. Many more men who had steam needed a catheter for a time. The trial suggests this rise was large. But it did not give simple counts for how many men this was.

We do not know if men needed more treatment later. The trial could not tell if steam changed retreatment needs. We also do not know if steam changed the risk of sudden urine block. Doctors call this acute urine retention. The data were too limited to be sure.

This review did not find any trials that compared steam to TURP. It also found no trials that compared steam to other less invasive procedures. So we cannot say how well steam stacks up against those options.

What this means for patients
Steam therapy may ease urine symptoms and raise quality of life in the short term. Many men in the trial felt better within three months. Sex function did not seem to get worse. But mild side effects were more common. Many more men needed a catheter for a time after the procedure.

We do not know the risk of serious side effects from this trial. We also do not know how long the benefits last. The results came from one study paid for by the device maker. The follow‑up was short, only up to three months.

If you think about steam therapy, ask your doctor:
- Will this help my main symptoms?
- How likely is a need for a catheter after the procedure?
- What mild problems might I have, and for how long?
- What are the risks of serious problems?
- How does steam compare to TURP or other options in our clinic?

Bottom line
In one short study, steam therapy helped men feel better within three months. Mild side effects were more common, and many more men needed a catheter for a time. We cannot tell the risk of major harms or long‑term results. We need more and longer trials. We also need direct tests that compare steam with TURP and with other options.","Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia 
Review Question 
What are the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy in men with bothersome urinary symptoms because of an enlarged prostate? 
Background 
Prostate enlargement is common in older men, and can cause bothersome urinary symptoms, such as having to pass their water (voiding) often, a weak stream while voiding, or dribbling. If lifestyle changes and medications don't help, a variety of surgical procedures, including transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), can improve these symptoms. They may also cause unwanted effects, such as problems with ejaculation or erections. Recently, a new procedure called 'convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy' has become available. It is unclear how it compares to other treatments, such as TURP. 
Study characteristics  We found a single study, with 197 men, that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to a sham procedure (men were made to believe they received treatment, while in reality, they did not), funded by the device company. The men's average age was 62.9 years, and most had a moderate degree of bothersome urinary symptoms. 
We found no studies that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to another form of active treatment, such as TURP that men with an enlarged prostate and bothersome symptoms might otherwise choose. 
Key results 
Compared to a sham procedure, and with a three‐month follow‐up, convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may improve urinary symptoms (low certainty of evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy also likely improves quality of life (moderate certainty of evidence). We are very uncertain whether serious unwanted side effects are more common or not (very low certainty of evidence). Men's erections and ejaculations may be similar in men who have convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy and those who receive the sham procedure (low certainty of evidence). 
Findings of this review are up to date until 18 February 2020.
Certainty of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes to be moderate, low or very low. Reasons for not being so confident had to do with the study design and the study size.

10.1002-14651858.CD013190,"Background
Melanoma has one of the fastest rising incidence rates of any cancer. It accounts for a small percentage of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. Early detection and treatment is key to improving survival; however, anxiety around missing early cases needs to be balanced against appropriate levels of referral and excision of benign lesions. Used in conjunction with clinical or dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, or both, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) may reduce unnecessary excisions without missing melanoma cases. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of reflectance confocal microscopy for the detection of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in adults with any lesion suspicious for melanoma and lesions that are difficult to diagnose, and to compare its accuracy with that of dermoscopy. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; and seven other databases. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design that evaluated RCM alone, or RCM in comparison to dermoscopy, in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities per algorithm and threshold using the bivariate hierarchical model. To compare RCM with dermoscopy, we grouped studies by population (defined by difficulty of lesion diagnosis) and combined data using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) methods. Analysis of studies allowing direct comparison between tests was undertaken. To facilitate interpretation of results, we computed values of specificity at the point on the SROC curve with 90% sensitivity as this value lies within the estimates for the majority of analyses. We investigated the impact of using a purposely developed RCM algorithm and in‐person test interpretation. 
Main results
The search identified 18 publications reporting on 19 study cohorts with 2838 lesions (including 658 with melanoma), which provided 67 datasets for RCM and seven for dermoscopy. Studies were generally at high or unclear risk of bias across almost all domains and of high or unclear concern regarding applicability of the evidence. Selective participant recruitment, lack of blinding of the reference test to the RCM result, and differential verification were particularly problematic. Studies may not be representative of populations eligible for RCM, and test interpretation was often undertaken remotely from the patient and blinded to clinical information. 
Meta‐analysis found RCM to be more accurate than dermoscopy in studies of participants with any lesion suspicious for melanoma and in participants with lesions that were more difficult to diagnose (equivocal lesion populations). Assuming a fixed sensitivity of 90% for both tests, specificities were 82% for RCM and 42% for dermoscopy for any lesion suspicious for melanoma (9 RCM datasets; 1452 lesions and 370 melanomas). For a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the median observed melanoma prevalence of 30%, this equated to a reduction in unnecessary excisions with RCM of 280 compared to dermoscopy, with 30 melanomas missed by both tests. For studies in equivocal lesions, specificities of 86% would be observed for RCM and 49% for dermoscopy (7 RCM datasets; 1177 lesions and 180 melanomas). At the median observed melanoma prevalence of 20%, this reduced unnecessary excisions by 296 with RCM compared with dermoscopy, with 20 melanomas missed by both tests. Across all populations, algorithms and thresholds assessed, the sensitivity and specificity of the Pellacani RCM score at a threshold of three or greater were estimated at 92% (95% confidence interval (CI) 87 to 95) for RCM and 72% (95% CI 62 to 81) for dermoscopy. 
Authors' conclusions
RCM may have a potential role in clinical practice, particularly for the assessment of lesions that are difficult to diagnose using visual inspection and dermoscopy alone, where the evidence suggests that RCM may be both more sensitive and specific in comparison to dermoscopy. Given the paucity of data to allow comparison with dermoscopy, the results presented require further confirmation in prospective studies comparing RCM with dermoscopy in a real‐world setting in a representative population.

Can a no-cut skin scan help find melanoma and avoid needless cuts?

Rationale
Melanoma is a serious skin cancer. It causes most deaths from skin cancer. It can spread fast. Early find and treat can save lives.

Doctors work hard not to miss it. To be safe, they often cut out many spots. Most of those spots are not cancer. Each cut can leave a scar. It can also cause worry and cost.

A hand-held skin check, called dermoscopy, helps a lot. It uses a light and a lens to see the skin. But it still leads to many cuts of spots that are not cancer.

Reflectance confocal microscopy, or RCM, is a skin scan. It uses light to see skin cells in fine detail. It does not need a cut. Doctors think RCM may help tell bad spots from safe ones. This may lower needless cuts while still finding cancer.

This study asked a core question. Is RCM better than dermoscopy at telling which skin spots are melanoma? The team also looked at hard to judge spots. These are spots that even experts find hard to call.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team did not run a new trial. They looked in many data lists from the start of each list to August 2016. They also checked other review papers.

They picked studies of adults with a spot that looked like melanoma. They also picked studies with hard to judge spots. The studies tested RCM alone or RCM and dermoscopy. The “true answer” came from a lab check of a cut-out spot. Or it came from follow-up if no cut was done.

Two team members took the data with a set plan. They wrote to study authors if key facts were not clear. They grouped studies by how hard the spots were to judge. Some studies gave both tests to the same spots. The team used sound math to join the data.

This review did not add new people. Time in each study was not clear in this report. Each person likely had the tests in a short time. But the exact time was not given here.

Results
The search found 18 papers. These told of 19 groups of people. In all, there were 2,838 skin spots. Of these, 658 were melanoma.

The studies had some weak points. Some did not match real clinic life well. In some, the readers saw only skin images, not the person. In some, the judge may have known a test result. Some groups may have picked easier cases.

Even with these weak points, some clear things stood out. RCM did better than dermoscopy in two groups. It did better in “any spot that looks like melanoma.” It also did better in “hard to judge” spots.

Here is what that could mean in real life. Think of 1,000 skin spots. In one set, 300 of the 1,000 are melanoma. Set both tests to catch about nine out of ten melanomas. With that set-up, RCM would lead to 280 fewer needless cuts than dermoscopy. Both tests would still miss 30 melanomas.

Now think of a harder set of spots. In that set, 200 of the 1,000 are melanoma. Again, set both tests to catch about nine out of ten melanomas. With that set-up, RCM would lead to 296 fewer needless cuts than dermoscopy. Both tests would still miss 20 melanomas.

Why does this matter? Each saved cut means less pain, less scar, and less stress. It can also mean lower cost and faster care. A no-cut scan can help doctors choose which spots to cut. It can also help which spots to watch.

But no test is perfect. Some cancers were still missed. This means follow-up and good safety plans still matter. A biopsy, which is a small cut to test tissue, is still key when cancer seems likely.

So what can we say now? RCM looks like a helpful tool. It seems to find melanoma at least as well as dermoscopy. It also seems to cut down on needless cuts. This seems most true for hard to judge spots.

Still, we need more proof. We need studies that look like real clinics. We need both tests used on the same people, at the same visit. We need readers who use the tests as they would in daily care. We also need clear rules for how to read RCM.

In sum, RCM can add value to skin checks. It may help you avoid a cut when a spot is safe. It may also help find cancer when a spot is risky. Ask your skin doctor if this scan is right for you.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of the imaging test reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) for the detection of melanoma in adults? 
What was the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) was on its own and used in addition to dermoscopy compared to dermoscopy alone for diagnosing melanoma. Review authors in Cochrane included 18 publications to answer this question. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of melanoma important? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. Not recognising a melanoma when it is present (called a false negative test result) delays surgery to remove it, risking cancer spreading to other parts in the body and possibly death. Diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not present (called a false positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery, further investigations, and patient anxiety. 
What did the review study? 
Microscopic techniques are used by skin cancer specialists to allow a more detailed, magnified examination of suspicious skin lesions than can be achieved using the naked eye alone. Currently, dermoscopy (a handheld device using natural light) can be used as part of the clinical examination of suspicious skin lesions. RCM is a new microscopic technique (a handheld device or static unit using infrared light) that can visualise deeper layers of the skin compared to dermoscopy. Both techniques are painless procedures, but RCM is more expensive, time consuming, and requires additional training. Dermoscopy can be used by general practitioners whereas RCM is likely to only be used by secondary care specialists in people who have been referred with a lesion suspicious for skin cancer. We sought to find out whether RCM should be used instead of, or in addition to, dermoscopy, to diagnose melanoma in any suspicious skin lesion or only in particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions. 
What were the main results of the review? 
The review included 18 publications reporting data for 19 groups of participants with lesions suspected of melanoma. The main results were based on 16 of the 19 datasets (sets of information and results). 
The review included nine datasets with 1452 lesions in people with any suspicious skin lesion, three of which compared RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that in 1000 lesions, of which 300 (30%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ an estimated 396 would have an RCM result indicating melanoma was present, and of these, 126 (32%) would not be melanoma (false positive results); ‐ in the same group of 1000 lesions, dermoscopy would produce 406 false positive results, meaning RCM would avoid unnecessary surgery in 280 lesions compared to dermoscopy; ‐ of the 604 lesions with an RCM result indicating that melanoma was not present (and 324 lesions with a dermoscopy result indicating that melanoma was not present), 30 would actually be melanoma (false negative results). This equated to a false negative rate of 5% for RCM and 9% for dermoscopy. 
The review also included seven datasets with 1177 lesions in people with particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions, three of which compared RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that if skin specialists used RCM in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 200 (20%) were actually melanoma: 
‐ an estimated 292 would have an RCM result indicating melanoma was present, and of these, 112 (38%) would not be melanoma (false positive results); ‐ in the same group of 1000 lesions, dermoscopy would produce 408 false positive results, meaning RCM would avoid unnecessary surgery in 296 lesions compared to dermoscopy; ‐ of the 708 lesions with an RCM result indicating that melanoma was not present (and 412 lesions with a dermoscopy result indicating that melanoma was not present), 20 would actually have melanoma (false negative results). This equates to a false negative rate of 3% for RCM and 5% for dermoscopy. 
How reliable were the results of the studies of this review? 
In all included studies, the diagnosis of melanoma was made by lesion biopsy (RCM/dermoscopy positive) (a biopsy involves taking a sample of body cells and examining them under a microscope), and the absence of melanoma was confirmed by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma (RCM/dermoscopy negative)*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had melanoma. Only a small number of studies compared the accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM. Most were conducted by specialist research teams with high levels of experience with RCM. Therefore, RCM may have appeared more accurate than it actually was. Participants in the nine studies of any suspicious lesion may have had very obvious disease compared to that seen in practice leading to a lower number of false positive results than would actually occur. It is not possible to recommend a definition of a positive RCM test that will reliably produce the results presented here due to differences between studies. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Eleven studies were undertaken in Europe (61%), with the remainder undertaken in Oceania, North America, or more than one continent. Mean age ranged from 39 to 54.7 years. The percentage of people with melanoma ranged between 1.9% and 41.5% (a median (midpoint reading) of 19% for difficult to diagnose skin lesions and 32% for any suspicious lesion). The majority of studies only included people with certain types of skin lesion. In many studies, it was not clear what tests participants had received before RCM. 
What are the implications of this review? 
RCM appears to be an accurate test for identifying melanoma, and it may reduce the number of people receiving unnecessary surgery by up to three‐quarters compared to dermoscopy. There is considerable variation and uncertainty in results and in study conduct, reducing the reliability of findings. Use of RCM may be of most benefit in people with particularly difficult to diagnose lesions rather than people with any lesion suspicious for melanoma. Further research comparing RCM and dermoscopy in well described groups of people with difficult to diagnose skin lesions is needed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses).

What are the effects of medical interventions for chronic rhinosinusitis on people with cystic fibrosis? 
Background 
Chronic rhinosinusitis is long‐term infection and inflammation of the nasal cavity and air‐filled spaces around the eyes and nose. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that makes secretions in the body thick, and hence stagnant. When this occurs in and around the nose, it causes chronic rhinosinusitis. Better care of people with cystic fibrosis has led to them living longer, increasing the chance of developing chronic rhinosinusitis. Early and effective interventions with antibiotics, steroids, drugs that thin the mucus (e.g. dornase alfa) and drugs to improve how the cell membrane channel functions (CFTR modulators) can help to improve quality of life and prevent the development of lower airway disease. Currently, there are no guidelines based on trials to know how best to treat chronic rhinosinusitis in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 09 September 2021.
Study characteristics 
We found no trials in our search that met our inclusion criteria. We have listed 12 trials as excluded and one trial as ongoing in the current review. 
Key results 
Although chronic rhinosinusitis is common in people with cystic fibrosis, there is not enough evidence available on its management. This review highlights the need for well‐designed trials assessing which treatment is best for managing chronic rhinosinusitis, preventing lower airway disease and improving quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis.

Medicines for long-term nose and sinus problems in cystic fibrosis: what we know

Rationale
Cystic fibrosis is a life-long inherited disease. It makes mucus thick and sticky. Mucus is the wet layer that lines the nose, lungs, and gut. Thick mucus can clog tiny tubes in the body.

The sinuses are air spaces near the nose and eyes. When thick mucus blocks them, germs can grow. This can lead to long-term infection and swelling. Doctors call this chronic rhinosinusitis, or long-term nose and sinus problems.

These nose and sinus problems can cause pain, stuffiness, and loss of smell. They can also drip into the lungs. That can make lung problems worse over time. Better care now means people with cystic fibrosis live longer. So more people may face these nose and sinus issues.

Doctors use several types of drugs to try to help. These include antibiotics to fight germs. Steroids can lower swelling. Mucus thinners, like dornase alfa, can help clear thick mucus. CFTR modulators help the broken salt and water channel work better. These drugs may improve daily life and protect the lungs.

But we still do not know which drug plan works best. Past reports give mixed messages. We need strong proof to guide care. This review asked a clear question. Which medical treatments help nose and sinus problems in people with cystic fibrosis?

Trial Design
This was not a single patient trial. It was a review of trials. A review looks for all fair tests of a treatment. A fair test is often called a clinical trial. In a trial, groups of people get one treatment or another. The results show what works and what does not.

The team searched for trials of medicines for nose and sinus problems in cystic fibrosis. They planned to include studies that tested antibiotics, steroids, mucus thinners, or CFTR modulators. The focus was people who have cystic fibrosis and long-term nose and sinus problems. The review did not report age or sex details.

The team looked for all studies up to September 9, 2021. They checked many sources. They used strict rules to pick high quality trials. This helps avoid bias and error. It makes the results more trustworthy.

The review found no trials that met the plan. Twelve trials did not fit the rules. One trial is still running. Because no trials fit, time in study did not apply.

Results
The main result is simple. We still do not know which medicine works best. The review found no trials that fit the rules. So there is not enough proof to guide care. We cannot say which drug helps most, or for how long.

This gap matters to patients. Nose and sinus problems can hurt daily life. They can cause pain, poor sleep, and less smell and taste. They can also harm lung health. If we can treat the nose and sinuses well, we may also help the lungs. But we need good trials to know.

Doctors now use several drug types in practice. These include antibiotics, steroids, mucus thinners like dornase alfa, and CFTR modulators. Some people feel better with these drugs. But we need strong tests to compare them. We need to learn which drug helps which person, and when.

The review calls for well planned trials. Trials should test clear goals that matter to patients. These can include less pain or stuffiness, better smell, better sleep, and better daily life. Trials should also look at lung health over time. They should track safety and side effects.

A good trial should have clear steps and fair groups. It should enroll enough people to give clear answers. It should follow people long enough to see lasting change. It should share results in a clear way. This helps doctors and patients make choices based on proof.

What does this mean for you now? There is no one best drug plan proven by trials. Care will depend on your symptoms and history. Your care team may try one or more drug types. They will watch how you feel and adjust as needed. Share your goals and what matters most to you.

This review is important for the field. It shows a clear need for research. It points to key questions to answer next. With good trials, we can learn what helps most. That can improve daily life and protect lung health.

In short, long-term nose and sinus problems are common in cystic fibrosis. Medicines may help, but we lack strong proof. This review found no trials that fit its rules, twelve that did not fit, and one still running. We need well designed trials to guide care and improve life for people with cystic fibrosis.","Medical interventions for chronic inflammation of the nose and sinuses in cystic fibrosis

The evidence is current to: 09 September 2021.
Study characteristics 
We found no trials in our search that met our inclusion criteria. We have listed 12 trials as excluded and one trial as ongoing in the current review. 
Key results 
Although chronic rhinosinusitis is common in people with cystic fibrosis, there is not enough evidence available on its management. This review highlights the need for well‐designed trials assessing which treatment is best for managing chronic rhinosinusitis, preventing lower airway disease and improving quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis.

Why is this question important?Glaucoma and cataract are a global problem that can impact a person's economic and social circumstances. Vision loss from glaucoma is permanent, as the increased eye pressure that occurs in glaucoma damages the optic nerve which carries signals from the eye to the brain. The primary aim of treatment for glaucoma is to reduce this pressure, hence slowing down any progressive damage to vision. 
Although medical and laser treatments are effective in treating glaucoma, an operation known as a trabeculectomy is required when these treatments do not stop progression of damage to vision. A small hole is cut in the white of the eye to allow excess fluid to drain from the eye. When a person with a trabeculectomy undergoes cataract surgery, an additional medication is often used to stop the eye healing too much and creating scar tissue, which can block the drainage hole and cause the trabeculectomy to fail. 
In this review, we looked at patients with a functioning trabeculectomy who were undergoing cataract surgery and who received additional medication (5‐fluorouracil, mitomycin C, or anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor therapy) versus those who did not receive any additional medication. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies in which people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the strongest evidence about the effects of a given treatment. We planned to combine the results of the included studies to arrive at an answer to our research question. 
What did we find?We found no randomised controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria. 
What does this mean?We do not know whether an additional medical treatment during cataract surgery improves the chances of the drainage hole remaining open, as there is no evidence at present. It would be helpful if more studies were conducted in this area in future.

Do extra drugs during cataract surgery help a glaucoma drain keep working?

Rationale
Glaucoma is a common eye disease.
It raises pressure inside the eye.
This pressure can harm the optic nerve.
That nerve sends sight signals to the brain.
Lost sight from glaucoma does not come back.

Doctors try to lower this eye pressure.
Eye drops and laser can help for many.
When they fail, surgery may be used.
One surgery is called trabeculectomy.
In it, a small new drain hole is made.

Fluid can then leave the eye through this hole.
This can lower pressure and protect sight.
Later, many people also get cataracts.
Cataracts make the eye lens go cloudy.
Doctors can fix this with cataract surgery.

Cataract surgery can trigger healing and scars.
Scars can block the drain hole.
Then the glaucoma surgery may fail.
Some surgeons use extra drugs during surgery.
These drugs aim to slow scars from forming.

These extra drugs include 5‑fluorouracil and mitomycin C.
Doctors also use drugs that block new tiny blood vessels.
People call these anti‑VEGF drugs.
All these drugs try to keep the drain open.
We need to know if they truly help.

Trial Design
This study was a review of past research.
It was a Cochrane Review.
Cochrane reviews check health studies with strict methods.
The team searched for fair tests of these drugs.
In a fair test, chance picks the treatment group.

They looked for people with a working drain.
The drain came from a trabeculectomy.
All would be having cataract surgery.
One group would get extra drugs in surgery.
The other group would not get extra drugs.

The main question was simple.
Do extra drugs help keep the drain hole open?
The team also planned to combine study results.
This helps give a clear, strong answer.
They set rules for which trials to include.

They also cared about who would be in trials.
People would have glaucoma and a working drain.
The review did not state age or gender limits.
It did not give a set time in a study.
Each trial would set its own time.

Results
The review found no fair tests to include.
No random trials met the entry rules.
So the team could not compare groups.
They could not join results across studies.
They could not judge if extra drugs work.

What does this mean for people with glaucoma?
We do not yet know if extra drugs help.
We do not know if they harm or help safety.
We do not know if they protect the drain.
Better trials are needed to answer this.

Doctors and patients should talk about choices.
Each eye is different.
Your doctor may suggest extra drugs in surgery.
This choice should weigh risks and gains.
Ask what is known and what is not known.

This review is up to April 2021.
New trials may have started since then.
More high quality trials are needed.
They should test these drugs in clear, fair ways.
They should look at sight and drain health over time.","The use of additional medication during cataract surgery to improve the continued success of a pre‐existing operation (trabeculectomy)

10.1002-14651858.CD013196.pub2,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, including bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic condition causing shortness of breath, cough, and exacerbations leading to poor health outcomes. Face‐to‐face visits with health professionals can be hindered by severity of COPD or frailty, and by people living at a distance from their healthcare provider and having limited access to services. Telehealth technologies aimed at providing health care remotely through monitoring and consultations could help to improve health outcomes of people with COPD. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of telehealth interventions that allow remote monitoring and consultation and multi‐component interventions for reducing exacerbations and improving quality of life, while reducing dyspnoea symptoms, hospital service utilisation, and death among people with COPD. 
Search methods
We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register. Additional sources searched included the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the IEEEX Xplore Digital Library. The latest search was conducted in April 2020. We used the GRADE approach to judge the certainty of evidence for outcomes. 
Selection criteria
Eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included adults with diagnosed COPD. Asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and other respiratory conditions were excluded. Interventions included remote monitoring or consultation plus usual care, remote monitoring or consultation alone, and mult‐component interventions from all care settings. Quality of life scales included St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). The dyspnoea symptom scale used was the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire Self‐Administered Standardized Scale (CRQ‐SAS). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We assessed confidence in the evidence for each primary outcome using the GRADE method. Primary outcomes were exacerbations, quality of life, dyspnoea symptoms, hospital service utilisation, and mortality; a secondary outcome consisted of adverse events. 
Main results
We included 29 studies in the review (5654 participants; male proportion 36% to 96%; female proportion 4% to 61%). Most remote monitoring interventions required participants to transfer measurements using a remote device and later health professional review (asynchronous). Only five interventions transferred data and allowed review by health professionals in real time (synchronous). Studies were at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. We found no evidence on comparison of remote consultations with or without usual care. 
Remote monitoring plus usual care (8 studies, 1033 participants)  
Very uncertain evidence suggests that remote monitoring plus usual care may have little to no effect on the number of people experiencing exacerbations at 26 weeks or 52 weeks. There may be little to no difference in effect on quality of life (SGRQ) at 26 weeks (very low to low certainty) or on hospitalisation (all‐cause or COPD‐related; very low certainty). COPD‐related hospital re‐admissions are probably reduced at 26 weeks (hazard ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.93; 106 participants; moderate certainty). There may be little to no difference in deaths between intervention and usual care (very low certainty). We found no evidence for dyspnoea symptoms or adverse events. 
Remote monitoring alone (10 studies, 2456 participants)  
Very uncertain evidence suggests that remote monitoring may result in little to no effect on the number of people experiencing exacerbations at 41 weeks (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.55). There may be little to no effect on quality of life (SGRQ total at 17 weeks, or CAT at 38 and 52 weeks; very low certainty). There may be little to no effect on dyspnoea symptoms on the CRQ‐SAS at 26 weeks (low certainty). There may be no difference in effects on the number of people admitted to hospital (very low certainty) or on deaths (very low certainty). We found no evidence for adverse events. 
Multi‐component interventions with remote monitoring or consultation component (11 studies, 2165 participants)  
Very uncertain evidence suggests that multi‐component interventions may have little to no effect on the number of people experiencing exacerbations at 52 weeks. Quality of life at 13 weeks may improve as seen in SGRQ total score (mean difference ‐9.70, 95% CI ‐18.32 to ‐1.08; 38 participants; low certainty) but not at 26 or 52 weeks (very low certainty). COPD assessment test (CAT) scores may improve at a mean of 38 weeks, but evidence is very uncertain and interventions are varied. 
There may be little to no effect on the number of people admitted to hospital at 33 weeks (low certainty). Multi‐component interventions are likely to result in fewer people re‐admitted to hospital at a mean of 39 weeks (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.81; 344 participants, 3 studies; moderate certainty). There may be little to no difference in death at a mean of 40 weeks (very low certainty). There may be little to no effect on people experiencing adverse events (very low certainty). We found no evidence for dyspnoea symptoms. 
Authors' conclusions
Remote monitoring plus usual care provided asynchronously may not be beneficial overall compared to usual care alone. Some benefit is seen in reduction of COPD‐related hospital re‐admissions, but moderate‐certainty evidence is based on one study. We have not found any evidence for dyspnoea symptoms nor harms, and there is no difference in fatalities when remote monitoring is provided in addition to usual care. 
Remote monitoring interventions alone are no better than usual care overall for health outcomes. 
Multi‐component interventions with asynchronous remote monitoring are no better than usual care but may provide short‐term benefit for quality of life and may result in fewer re‐admissions to hospital for any cause. We are uncertain whether remote monitoring is responsible for the positive impact on re‐admissions, and we are unable to discern the long‐term benefits of receiving remote monitoring as part of patient care. 
Owing to paucity of evidence, it is unclear which COPD severity subgroups would benefit from telehealth interventions. Given there is no evidence of harm, telehealth interventions may be beneficial as an additional health resource depending on individual needs based on professional assessment. Larger studies can determine long‐term effects of these interventions.

Remote care for COPD: what it can and cannot do

Rationale
COPD is a long-term lung disease. It includes bronchitis and emphysema. It can cause short breath, cough, and low energy. People may have flare-ups. A flare-up is when symptoms get much worse fast.

Trips to clinic can be hard. Some people live far away. Some feel weak or short of breath. Bad weather or lack of transport can also block care. This can delay help and raise stress.

Remote care may help. Remote care means care by phone, video, or a home device. People can send health signs, like symptoms or oxygen levels, from home. A nurse or doctor can then guide care from afar.

The goal is simple. Will remote care cut flare-ups? Will it help daily life? Will it cut stays in the hospital or death? The team asked if remote care could be a safe and good add-on to usual care.

Trial Design
This report is a summary of many trials. The team looked for the best type of trials. These are called randomized trials. People with COPD joined by chance to a type of care. This helps test what really works.

The team used large health trial lists to find studies. The last search was in April of 2020. They found 29 trials. In all, 5654 people took part. Both men and women took part. All were adults with COPD. People with asthma, cystic fibrosis, or bronchiectasis were not in these trials.

The trials tested three kinds of care. One was remote check-ins plus usual care. One was remote check-ins alone. The third was a mixed plan. This mixed plan had remote care plus other parts, like education or rehab.

What is “remote check-in”? People used a device at home. They sent their signs or answers to a nurse or doctor. In most trials, the nurse or doctor read the data later, not live. Only a few trials used live review.

Time in the trials varied. Many lasted from about three months to one year. The trials checked for flare-ups, daily life, short breath, stays in hospital, and death. They also looked for harms. The team rated how sure we can be about each result.

Results
First, the big picture. Many trials had limits. People and staff knew who got which care. This can affect results. So, for many points, we are not very sure. When you read “may” below, it means we are not very sure.

Remote check-ins plus usual care: What did we learn? We are not sure if this plan cuts flare-ups at about six or twelve months. It may have little to no effect on daily life scores. It may have little to no effect on going to the hospital for any cause.

There is one bright spot. One trial found fewer people went back to the hospital for COPD within six months. Deaths were about the same as with usual care. We do not know if this plan helps short breath. We also do not know about harms, since trials did not report them here.

Remote check-ins alone: What did we learn? This plan may have little to no effect on flare-ups at around ten months. It may have little to no effect on daily life. It may have little to no effect on short breath. It may have little to no effect on trips to the hospital or deaths. Trials did not give harm data.

Mixed plans with remote care as one part: What did we learn? These plans may have little to no effect on flare-ups at one year. Daily life may improve at about three months. But this gain did not last at six or twelve months.

Fewer people may go back to the hospital for any cause within about nine months. This seems more likely than not. But the plans varied a lot. So we cannot say if remote care was the key part that helped. There may be little to no effect on deaths. Trials did not show clear harm.

What does “how sure” mean here? When we say “very unsure,” the data are weak or mixed. When we say “likely,” the data give us more trust. In this review, many points had weak or mixed data. A few had stronger data.

What does this mean for you? Remote care can help you keep in touch. It may help you act fast when you feel worse. It may save a trip when you feel weak or live far. It may help cut a return stay in the hospital in the short term. But for most goals, it did not do better than usual care.

There was no sign of harm. But many trials did not measure harm well. We also do not know which people with COPD gain the most. We do not know the long-term effect past one year.

What should you do? Ask your care team if remote care fits your needs. It may be a useful add-on to your usual care. It can be a tool, not a cure. Your plan should match your goals, your home life, and your tech skills.

What should researchers do next? Run larger, longer trials. Test live check-ins versus later review. Learn which people gain the most. Study harms and costs. This can guide better care for all people with COPD.","Telehealth technologies for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Review question 
Do telehealth technologies help improve the health of people who have COPD?
Background 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes a group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnoea), coughing, and increased mucus. COPD causes limited airflow in the lungs when breathing out; this can be measured by spirometry (a measure to assess how well the lungs function). The spirometer takes two measurements: volume of air when breathing out forcefully in one second, and total amount of air breathed out. When COPD gets worse over time, this leads to greater symptom severity and can reduce quality of life. Disease progression and sudden flare‐ups (exacerbations) of symptoms can increase someone's risks of hospitalisation and death. Telehealth technologies could improve delivery of health care for people with COPD, which could reduce exacerbations, improve quality of life, and lower rates of hospitalisation. However, it is unclear whether providing telehealth care improves health‐related outcomes for people with COPD. We wanted to explore whether telehealth technologies were helpful for people with COPD. 
What are telehealth technologies? 
Study investigators used a range of telehealth technologies. Some included remote monitoring technology, which requires daily use of a laptop or a tablet with monitoring equipment, with results received by the healthcare professional. Typical monitoring equipment included a stethoscope (to measure blood pressure and heart rate), a pulse oximeter (to measure oxygen levels in the blood), a spirometer (to measure lung function), a thermometer, and other devices. Interventions involved regular phone calls with healthcare professionals for patients to talk about their symptoms and completion of health questionnaires. 
Identifying and selecting studies 
We searched online databases up until April 2020. We searched for studies published worldwide, in any language, at any time. Two review authors looked at lists of studies separately, then agreed on which studies should be included. 
To find the best answer to our question, we looked for studies that recruited people with COPD of any severity. To make the comparison fair, we looked for studies in which investigators compared remote monitoring, remote monitoring plus usual care, and multi‐component treatments. People included in these studies had to have the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive one of these teleheath technologies or usual care. 
Key results 
We found 29 studies (5654 people with moderate to very severe COPD) that were suitable for inclusion in our review. Duration of these studies ranged from 3 to 12 months. 
We did not find any important benefits or harms for patients who were monitored with any of the telehealth technologies when we looked at number of exacerbations, improvement in quality of life, and reduction in breathing distress symptoms, hospitalisations, or death. However, people who were monitored through telehealth technology plus usual care had some reduction in risk of hospital re‐admission. Thus, telehealth technologies that were part of a care package reduced COPD‐related hospital re‐admissions. 
We could not be certain of any harms of stand‐alone remote monitoring. We are also uncertain of any benefits or harms of stand‐alone remote monitoring of patient experiences or reports of breathing distress. 
Quality of evidence 
Currently, no good quality evidence is available. We are very uncertain about evidence for exacerbations, quality of life, dyspnoea symptoms, hospitalisations, deaths, and side effects. However, we are moderately certain about our findings for hospital re‐admissions. 
Conclusion 
We are not clear whether telehealth technologies for monitoring or consultation provide benefit, but we have not found any information on harms. Telehealth could play a role in the care and management of people with COPD. Telehealth as part of multi‐component care packages may provide short‐term benefit for quality of life and hospital re‐admissions. Telehealth in the form of remote monitoring in addition to usual care may reduce the risk of hospital re‐admission. There is little impact on exacerbations, quality of life, and death. Owing to limited information, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. More studies are needed to determine whether telehealth provides any long‐term benefits for people with COPD of varying severity.

Diet plays a major role in the aetiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and as a modifiable risk factor is the focus of many prevention strategies. Recently vegan diets have gained popularity and there is a need to synthesise existing clinical trial evidence for their potential in CVD prevention. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of following a vegan dietary pattern for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases on 4 February 2020: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov in January 2021. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) and those with established CVD (secondary prevention). A vegan dietary pattern excludes meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey; the intervention could be dietary advice, provision of relevant foods, or both. The comparison group received either no intervention, minimal intervention, or another dietary intervention. Outcomes included clinical events and CVD risk factors. We included only studies with follow‐up periods of 12 weeks or more, defined as the intervention period plus post‐intervention follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risks of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We conducted three main comparisons: 
1. Vegan dietary intervention versus no intervention or minimal intervention for primary prevention;2. Vegan dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for primary prevention;3. Vegan dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for secondary prevention. 
Main results
Thirteen RCTs (38 papers, 7 trial registrations) and eight ongoing trials met our inclusion criteria. Most trials contributed to primary prevention: comparisons 1 (four trials, 466 participants randomised) and comparison 2 (eight trials, 409 participants randomised). We included only one secondary prevention trial for comparison 3 (63 participants randomised). 
None of the trials reported on clinical endpoints. Other primary outcomes included lipid levels and blood pressure. 
For comparison 1 there was moderate‐certainty evidence from four trials with 449 participants that a vegan diet probably led to a small reduction in total cholesterol (mean difference (MD) −0.24 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.36 to −0.12) and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (MD −0.22 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.32 to −0.11), a very small decrease in high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (MD −0.08 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.11 to −0.04) and a very small increase in triglyceride levels (MD 0.11 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21). The very small changes in HDL and triglyceride levels are in the opposite direction to that expected. There was a lack of evidence for an effect with the vegan dietary intervention on systolic blood pressure (MD 0.94 mmHg, 95% CI −1.18 to 3.06; 3 trials, 374 participants) and diastolic blood pressure (MD −0.27 mmHg, 95% CI −1.67 to 1.12; 3 trials, 372 participants) (low‐certainty evidence). 
For comparison 2 there was a lack of evidence for an effect of the vegan dietary intervention on total cholesterol levels (MD −0.04 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.28 to 0.20; 4 trials, 163 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There was probably little or no effect of the vegan dietary intervention on LDL (MD −0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.21 to 0.11; 4 trials, 244 participants) or HDL cholesterol levels (MD −0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.08 to 0.05; 5 trials, 256 participants) or triglycerides (MD 0.21 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.49; 5 trials, 256 participants) compared to other dietary interventions (moderate‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about any effect of the vegan dietary intervention on systolic blood pressure (MD 0.02 mmHg, 95% CI −3.59 to 3.62)  or diastolic blood pressure (MD 0.63 mmHg, 95% CI −1.54 to 2.80; 5 trials, 247 participants (very low‐certainty evidence)). 
Only one trial (63 participants) contributed to comparison 3, where there was a lack of evidence for an effect of the vegan dietary intervention on lipid levels or blood pressure compared to other dietary interventions (low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence). 
Four trials reported on adverse events, which were absent or minor.
Authors' conclusions
Studies were generally small with few participants contributing to each comparison group. None of the included studies report on CVD clinical events. There is currently insufficient information to draw conclusions about the effects of vegan dietary interventions on CVD risk factors. The eight ongoing studies identified will add to the evidence base, with all eight reporting on primary prevention. There is a paucity of evidence for secondary prevention.

Can a Vegan Diet Help Prevent Heart Disease?

2. Rationale
Heart disease is common. It can lead to heart attack or stroke. Food choices can raise or lower risk. Many people now want to try a vegan diet.

A vegan diet has no meat, fish, eggs, milk, or honey. Some think this diet can help the heart. It may change blood fats that affect risk. It may also change blood pressure.

We need clear proof to guide people. This study set out to find that proof. The team asked: does a vegan diet help prevent heart disease? They looked at people with and without heart disease.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. In these trials, people were put into groups by chance. One group tried a vegan diet. The other group got no help, little help, or a different diet.

The team looked at adult men and women. Some did not have heart disease. Some had a high risk. Some already had heart disease. Each trial lasted at least 12 weeks.

The study looked for heart events. These include heart attack, stroke, and death. The study also looked at blood fats and blood pressure. Blood fats include cholesterol and triglycerides. Cholesterol is a fat in the blood. LDL is the “bad” type. HDL is the “good” type. Triglycerides are another blood fat.

The team searched medical databases up to early 2021. They found 13 trials that fit the plan. They also found 8 trials still in progress. Most trials looked at people without heart disease.

Four trials compared a vegan diet to no or little help. These trials had 466 people. Eight trials compared a vegan diet to another diet. These trials had 409 people. One small trial looked at people with heart disease. It had 63 people.

4. Results
No trial tracked heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. So we do not know if a vegan diet lowers these events.

In people without heart disease, vegan diet versus no or little help showed small changes. Total cholesterol went down a little. LDL, the “bad” cholesterol, went down a little. HDL, the “good” cholesterol, went down a tiny amount. A blood fat called triglycerides went up a tiny amount. Those last two go the wrong way.

In this same group, blood pressure did not change in a clear way. Systolic and diastolic numbers stayed about the same. So we cannot say the diet helps blood pressure.

In people without heart disease, vegan diet versus another diet showed little or no change. Total cholesterol was about the same. LDL and HDL were about the same. Triglycerides were about the same. Blood pressure results were not clear here either.

In people with heart disease, only one small trial was found. It did not show clear change in blood fats. It did not show clear change in blood pressure. One small trial cannot give a firm answer.

Four trials looked at side effects. These were none or minor. No serious harms were seen.

What do these results mean? The trials were small. Few people were in each group. The proof we have now is not strong. We need more and larger trials.

There are 8 new trials still in progress. All focus on people without heart disease. We still need more trials in people who already have heart disease.

Today, we cannot say a vegan diet prevents heart disease. We also cannot say it helps people who already have it. A vegan diet may lower “bad” cholesterol a little when compared to no help. But we do not know if it lowers the chance of a heart attack or stroke.

This review helps the field by summing up the best tests so far. It shows where the gaps are. It points to what new trials must do. Future work should track real heart events. It should include more people and last longer.

In short, a vegan diet may change some blood fats a little. But we do not yet know if it cuts heart risk. More high-quality trials will help give a clear answer.","Vegan diets for the prevention of cardiovascular disease
Background 
It is well known that diet plays a major role in cardiovascular disease risk. This review assesses the effects of providing dietary advice to follow a vegan diet (excluding all meat, fish, eggs, dairy and honey) or providing foods relevant to the diet (or both) to healthy adults, to people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and to those with cardiovascular disease, in order to prevent new or recurrent cardiovascular disease, and to reduce the risk factors associated with it. 
Study characteristics 
We searched key databases of medical studies up to February 2020 and found 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (in 38 papers) that met our criteria. We grouped studies into the following three categories to help us with our interpretation of the results: 
1. Vegan dietary intervention compared to no intervention or a minimal intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;2. Vegan dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention to prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease;3. Vegan dietary intervention compared to another dietary intervention for people with existing cardiovascular disease, to prevent recurrence. 
Key results 
None of the trials reported on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease either in those with or without disease to begin with. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease were reported in the included studies. There was moderate‐certainty evidence for some small reductions in lipid levels with the vegan diet compared to no or minimal intervention in people without disease, but also some very small changes in measures in the opposite direction for cardiovascular benefit. In people who already had cardiovascular disease there was very limited information, as only one trial met our criteria. Four trials reported on side effects of the diet, which were either absent or minor. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Most studies had limitations in study design, so the evidence should be interpreted cautiously. In particular, the overall number of people who took part in the studies was too small to rule out the possibility of chance findings, and too small to pick up any differences in effect on our measures. 
Conclusions 
The review concludes that there is no information currently about the effects of a vegan diet on cardiovascular disease occurrence. There is limited information on the effects of the diet on those who already have cardiovascular disease, and mixed results about risk factors for those without disease. We found eight studies that are still ongoing, and when we have the results from these we will incorporate them into the review to help reduce the uncertainty.

Carotid artery stenosis is an important cause of stroke and transient ischemic attack. Correctly and rapidly identifying patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis is essential for adequate treatment with early cerebral revascularization. Doubts about the diagnostic value regarding the accuracy of duplex ultrasound (DUS) and the possibility of using DUS as the single diagnostic test before carotid revascularization are still debated. 
Objectives
To estimate the accuracy of DUS in individuals with symptomatic carotid stenosis verified by either digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). 
Search methods
We searched CRDTAS, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), ISI Web of Science, HTA, DARE, and LILACS up to 15 February 2021. We handsearched the reference lists of all included studies and other relevant publications and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies or unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We included studies assessing DUS accuracy against an acceptable reference standard (DSA, MRA, or CTA) in symptomatic patients. We considered the classification of carotid stenosis with DUS defined with validated duplex velocity criteria, and the NASCET criteria for carotid stenosis measures on DSA, MRA, and CTA. We excluded studies that included < 70% of symptomatic patients; the time between the index test and the reference standard was longer than four weeks or not described, or that presented no objective criteria to estimate carotid stenosis. 
Data collection and analysis
The review authors independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS‐2 domain list. We extracted data with an effort to complete a 2 × 2 table (true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives) for each of the different categories of carotid stenosis and reference standards. We produced forest plots and summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots to summarize the data. Where meta‐analysis was possible, we used a bivariate meta‐analysis model. 
Main results
We identified 25,087 unique studies, of which 22 were deemed eligible for inclusion (4957 carotid arteries). The risk of bias varied considerably across the studies, and studies were generally of moderate to low quality. We narratively described the results without meta‐analysis in seven studies in which the criteria used to determine stenosis were too different from the duplex velocity criteria proposed in our protocol or studies that provided insufficient data to complete a 2 × 2 table for at least in one category of stenosis. Nine studies (2770 carotid arteries) presented DUS versus DSA results for 70% to 99% carotid artery stenosis, and two (685 carotid arteries) presented results from DUS versus CTA in this category. Seven studies presented results for occlusion with DSA as the reference standard and three with CTA as the reference standard. Five studies compared DUS versus DSA for 50% to 99% carotid artery stenosis. Only one study presented results from 50% to 69% carotid artery stenosis. 
For DUS versus DSA, for < 50% carotid artery stenosis, the summary sensitivity was 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48 to 0.76) and the summary specificity was 0.99 (95% CI 0.96 to 0.99); for the 50% to 69% range, only one study was included and meta‐analysis not performed; for the 50% to 99% range, the summary sensitivity was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.98) and the summary specificity was 0.70 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.73); for the 70% to 99% range, the summary sensitivity was 0.85 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.91) and the summary specificity was 0.98 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.90); for occlusion, the summary sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.97) and the summary specificity was 0.95 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.99). 
For sensitivity analyses, excluding studies in which participants were selected based on the presence of occlusion on DUS had an impact on specificity: 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 0.99). For DUS versus CTA, we found two studies in the range of 70% to 99%; the sensitivity varied from 0.57 to 0.94 and the specificity varied from 0.87 to 0.98. For occlusion, the summary sensitivity was 0.95 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.99) and the summary specificity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.99). For DUS versus MRA, there was one study with results for 50% to 99% carotid artery stenosis, with a sensitivity of 0.88 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.98) and specificity of 0.60 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.95); in the 70% to 99% range, two studies were included, with sensitivity that varied from 0.54 to 0.99 and specificity that varied from 0.78 to 0.89. We could perform only a few of the proposed sensitivity analyses because of the small number of studies included. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides evidence that the diagnostic accuracy of DUS is high, especially at discriminating between the presence or absence of significant carotid artery stenosis (< 50% or 50% to 99%). This evidence, plus its less invasive nature, supports the early use of DUS for the detection of carotid artery stenosis. The accuracy for 70% to 99% carotid artery stenosis and occlusion is high. Clinicians should exercise caution when using DUS as the single preoperative diagnostic method, and the limitations should be considered. There was little evidence of the accuracy of DUS when compared with CTA or MRA. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution because they are based on studies of low methodological quality, mainly due to the patient selection method. Methodological problems in participant inclusion criteria from the studies discussed above apparently influenced an overestimated estimate of prevalence values. Most of the studies included failed to precisely describe inclusion criteria and previous testing. Future diagnostic accuracy studies should include direct comparisons of the various modalities of diagnostic tests (mainly DUS, CTA, and MRA) for carotid artery stenosis since DSA is no longer considered to be the best method for diagnosing carotid stenosis and less invasive tests are now used as reference standards in clinical practice. Also, for future studies, the participant inclusion criteria require careful attention.

How well does a neck artery ultrasound find bad blockages after stroke signs?

Rationale
The carotid arteries are in the neck. They bring blood to the brain. When these arteries get narrow, blood flow drops. This can cause a stroke or a mini stroke.

When a stroke sign starts, time is key. Fast and right tests help the team plan care. A blocked neck artery may need a fast fix. This may be surgery or a stent to open the artery.

Doctors often start with a duplex ultrasound, or DUS. This is a scan that uses sound waves. It shows blood flow in the neck arteries. It is quick and safe. It uses no needles or dye. But some ask if this one test is enough before surgery.

This study review asked a clear question. Can DUS tell who has a big block and who does not? The idea was that DUS may find bad blocks fast. If so, it could guide early care and save brain tissue.

Trial Design
This was a review of many past studies. The team looked for reports up to mid‑February 2021. They searched many large medical data banks. They also checked lists of papers and asked field experts.

They picked studies with people who had stroke or mini stroke signs. Each person had a DUS test. Each person also had one other test. The other test was one of three types:
- DSA: an x‑ray of the arteries with dye.
- CTA: a CT scan of the arteries with dye.
- MRA: an MRI scan that shows blood in the arteries.

People had both tests within four weeks. Studies that did not meet these rules did not count. The team only used studies that set clear rules to judge how narrow the artery was.

They found 22 studies to include. These had 4,957 neck artery scans. The team checked how often DUS was right or wrong. They used the second test as the truth guide. They also checked how good each study was. Many studies had some risk of bias. Some had unclear ways they picked patients.

The team looked at set groups of block size. They used three main groups. Less than half blocked, half to near full blocked, and near full blocked. They also looked at a full block, called an occlusion.

Results
Big picture first: DUS worked well in most groups. It did best at telling if a person had a big block or not. It was also good at finding a full block. It did less well at finding small blocks.

Now the key numbers, when DUS was checked against DSA. For people with a bad block of half to near full, DUS found about 97 in 100 who had it. But it called “bad block” in about 30 in 100 who did not have it. So it found most real cases, but it had some false alarms.

For people with a very bad block of seven‑tenths to near full, DUS found about 85 in 100 who had it. It said “no very bad block” in about 98 in 100 who did not have it. So it was strong at ruling out a very bad block.

For people with a full block, DUS found about 91 in 100 who had it. It said “no full block” in about 95 in 100 who did not have it. This means it was strong at finding a full stop of blood flow.

For people with small blocks, less than half, DUS missed some. It found about 63 in 100 who had only a small block. But when it said “small block,” it was almost always right.

Some studies chose people who were more likely to have a full block. When these were left out, DUS was even better at saying “no very bad block” when that was true. In that check, it was right in about 98 in 100 such cases.

There were fewer studies that used CTA as the truth guide. In the very bad block group, DUS found about 57 to 94 in 100 who had it. It said “no very bad block” in about 87 to 98 in 100 who did not have it. For a full block, DUS found about 95 in 100 and said “no full block” in about 91 in 100. But the number of studies was small. So we should be cautious.

There were even fewer studies that used MRA as the truth guide. One study, for half to near full block, found DUS got about 88 in 100 right for those with a block. It got about 60 in 100 right for those without. For very bad block, two studies showed a wide range. DUS found about 54 to 99 in 100 who had it. It said “no very bad block” in about 78 to 89 in 100 who did not have it.

What does this mean for patients? If you have stroke signs, a DUS can help fast. It is safe and not invasive. It can show if you likely have a big block. That can guide next steps. If surgery or a stent is in view, your team may want a second scan. This helps them plan and lower risk.

This review has limits. Many of the studies had weak parts. They did not always describe who they included, or why. This can make the test look better than it is. Also, the best truth guide may no longer be DSA in real life. Today, many teams use CTA or MRA as the guide. We need new, high‑quality studies that compare DUS, CTA, and MRA in the same people.

In sum, DUS is a good first test. It works well to find or rule out a big neck artery block. It is also good at finding a full block. It is less strong at small blocks. Use care if it is the only test before surgery. More high‑quality work will help make care even better.","How accurate is duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging for diagnosing carotid artery stenosis in symptomatic patients? 
Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) is a narrowing of the lumen (the inside space) of the carotid artery (usually due to cholesterol deposits called plaque). CAS is responsible for 8% of all strokes due to a blocked blood vessel (ischemic strokes) and is associated with a high chance of recurrence. In such circumstances, the treatment is to re‐establish adequate blood flow (by surgery or other approaches to open the artery) to prevent further neurologic episodes. Duplex ultrasound (DUS) can help identify the appropriate patients who will benefit from a more invasive treatment and those who should be with drugs alone. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine how accurate DUS is for diagnosing different grades of CAS in individuals with neurologic symptoms. 
What was studied in the review? 
DUS is used in clinical practice as the first test to detect carotid artery stenosis, usually with the result confirmed by other more expensive and invasive tests, such as computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The advantage of DUS is that it is less expensive and helps to reduce the time required to select patients for treatment. We included studies assessing the accuracy of DUS compared with DSA, MRA, or CTA in patients with recent stroke symptoms. We grouped the results from studies that used approximately the same method and threshold to assess accuracy in the following categories of carotid artery stenosis: < 50%, 50% to 99%, 50% to 69%, 70% to 99%, and occlusion (blockage of the vessel). 
What are the main results of this review? 
This review included 22 studies (4957 carotid arteries tested). The searches were performed up to 15 February 2021. The results indicate the following: If DUS were to be used in a standardized cohort of 1000 patients: 
For DUS versus DSA  
< 50% CAS (4 studies, 1495 carotid arteries): Estimated 299 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of non‐significant CAS, of whom eight (2.7%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 701 people with a result indicating that < 50% carotid stenosis is not present, 169 (24.1%) would be incorrectly classified. 
50% to 99% CAS (5 studies, 1536 carotid arteries): Estimated 642 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of 50% to 99% CAS; of these, 147 (22.8%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 358 people with a result indicating that 50% to 99% carotid stenosis is not present, 15 (4.2%) would be incorrectly classified. 
70% to 99% CAS (9 studies, 2770 carotid arteries): Estimated 390 patients would have a DUS result indicating the presence of 70% to 99% CAS; of these, eight (2%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 610 people with a result indicating that 70% to 99% carotid stenosis is not present, 68 (11.1%) would be incorrectly classified. 
Occlusion (7 studies, 1212 carotid arteries): Estimated 205 patients would have a DUS result indicating carotid artery occlusion; of these, 41 (20%) would be incorrectly classified. Of the 795 people with a result indicating that carotid occlusion is not present, 16 (2%) would be incorrectly classified. 
For DUS versus CTA  
Occlusion (3 studies, 833 carotid arteries): An estimated 606 patients would have a DUS result indicating carotid artery occlusion; of these, 36 (6%) would be incorrectly classified. 394 people with a result indicating that carotid occlusion is not present, 30 (8%) would be incorrectly classified. 
For DUS versus MRA  
Meta‐analysis was not performed.
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
There were some problems with how the studies were conducted that could impair the correct estimates of the diagnostic accuracy. Many of the studies were of poor or unclear quality. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
The results are relevant for patients with neurologic symptoms who are suspected of having carotid artery stenosis. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The diagnostic accuracy of DUS is high, especially at discriminating between the presence or absence of significant carotid artery stenosis. This evidence, plus its less invasive nature, supports the early use of DUS for the detection of carotid artery stenosis.

10.1002-14651858.CD013679,"Background
The global burden of poor maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) accounts for more than a quarter of healthy years of life lost worldwide. Targeted client communication (TCC) via mobile devices (MD) (TCCMD) may be a useful strategy to improve MNCH. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of TCC via MD on health behaviour, service use, health, and well‐being for MNCH. 
Search methods
In July/August 2017, we searched five databases including The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched two trial registries. A search update was carried out in July 2019 and potentially relevant studies are awaiting classification. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that assessed TCC via MD to improve MNCH behaviour, service use, health, and well‐being. Eligible comparators were usual care/no intervention, non‐digital TCC, and digital non‐targeted client communication. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane, although data extraction and risk of bias assessments were carried out by one person only and cross‐checked by a second. 
Main results
We included 27 trials (17,463 participants). Trial populations were: pregnant and postpartum women (11 trials conducted in low‐, middle‐ or high‐income countries (LMHIC); pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV (three trials carried out in one lower middle‐income country); and parents of children under the age of five years (13 trials conducted in LMHIC). Most interventions (18) were delivered via text messages alone, one was delivered through voice calls only, and the rest were delivered through combinations of different communication channels, such as multimedia messages and voice calls. 
Pregnant and postpartum women 
TCCMD versus standard care 
For behaviours, TCCMD may increase exclusive breastfeeding in settings where rates of exclusive breastfeeding are less common (risk ratio (RR) 1.30, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.06 to 1.59; low‐certainty evidence), but have little or no effect in settings where almost all women breastfeed (low‐certainty evidence). For use of health services, TCCMD may increase antenatal appointment attendance (odds ratio (OR) 1.54, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.96; low‐certainty evidence); however, the CI encompasses both benefit and harm. The intervention may increase skilled attendants at birth in settings where a lack of skilled attendants at birth is common (though this differed by urban/rural residence), but may make no difference in settings where almost all women already have a skilled attendant at birth (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.94; low‐certainty evidence). There were uncertain effects on maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity because the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low. 
TCCMD versus non‐digital TCC (e.g. pamphlets) 
TCCMD may have little or no effect on exclusive breastfeeding (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.07; low‐certainty evidence). TCCMD may reduce 'any maternal health problem' (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.79) and 'any newborn health problem' (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.06) reported up to 10 days postpartum (low‐certainty evidence), though the CI for the latter includes benefit and harm. The effect on health service use is unknown due to a lack of studies. 
TCCMD versus digital non‐targeted communication 
No studies reported behavioural, health, or well‐being outcomes for this comparison. For use of health services, there are uncertain effects for the presence of a skilled attendant at birth due to very low‐certainty evidence, and the intervention may make little or no difference to attendance for antenatal influenza vaccination (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.58), though the CI encompasses both benefit and harm (low‐certainty evidence). 
Pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV 
TCCMD versus standard care 
For behaviours, TCCMD may make little or no difference to maternal and infant adherence to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (low‐certainty evidence). For health service use, TCC mobile telephone reminders may increase use of antenatal care slightly (mean difference (MD) 1.5, 95% CI –0.36 to 3.36; low‐certainty evidence). The effect on the proportion of births occurring in a health facility is uncertain due to very low‐certainty evidence. For health and well‐being outcomes, there was an uncertain intervention effect on neonatal death or stillbirth, and infant HIV due to very low‐certainty evidence. No studies reported on maternal mortality or morbidity. 
TCCMD versus non‐digital TCC 
The effect is unknown due to lack of studies reporting this comparison.
TCCMD versus digital non‐targeted communication 
TCCMD may increase infant ARV/prevention of mother‐to‐child transmission treatment adherence (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.48; low‐certainty evidence). The effect on other outcomes is unknown due to lack of studies. 
Parents of children aged less than five years 
No studies reported on correct treatment, nutritional, or health outcomes.
TCCMD versus standard care 
Based on 10 trials, TCCMD may modestly increase health service use (vaccinations and HIV care) (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.34; low‐certainty evidence); however, the effect estimates varied widely between studies. 
TCCMD versus non‐digital TCC 
TCCMD may increase attendance for vaccinations (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.28; low‐certainty evidence), and may make little or no difference to oral hygiene practices (low‐certainty evidence). 
TCCMD versus digital non‐targeted communication 
TCCMD may reduce attendance for vaccinations, but the CI encompasses both benefit and harm (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.20; low‐certainty evidence). 
No trials in any population reported data on unintended consequences.
Authors' conclusions
The effect of TCCMD for most outcomes is uncertain. There may be improvements for some outcomes using targeted communication but these findings were of low certainty. High‐quality, adequately powered trials and cost‐effectiveness analyses are required to reliably ascertain the effects and relative benefits of TCCMD. Future studies should measure potential unintended consequences, such as partner violence or breaches of confidentiality.

Do phone messages help mothers, babies, and young children stay healthy?

Rationale
Many mothers and young children get sick or die each year. This harm takes a large toll on families. It also hurts whole communities.

Health care can help, but some people miss care. They may not know when to go. They may not know why care matters for them or their child.

Mobile phones are now common in rich and poor places. Phone texts or calls can reach people where they live. A message at the right time may help a person act.

This study looked at “targeted client communication.” That means phone messages made for one person’s needs. For example, a message based on due date, baby age, or health needs. The idea was that the right message at the right time could improve care and health.

Trial Design
This was not one trial. It was a review of fair tests from many places. In fair tests, people join groups by chance. This helps us judge what really works.

The team searched five large research lists in 2017. They also checked trial records. They updated the search in 2019 for new trials. Some new trials were found but not yet rated.

They found 27 trials with 17,463 people. Most people got text messages. Some got voice calls. Some got both.

The people in these trials were three groups. One group was pregnant women and new mothers. A smaller group was pregnant women and new mothers with HIV. The last group was parents of children under age five.

The trials took place in many kinds of countries. These were low, middle, and high income places. This helps us see if results might apply in many settings.

The messages were “targeted.” They fit the person’s stage, like weeks of pregnancy or child age. The messages aimed to help a person act. For example, to start breast milk only, to attend checkups, or to get shots.

The trials compared phone messages to usual care with no messages. Some trials compared phone messages to paper handouts. Some compared phone messages to digital messages that were not tailored. How long each person took part was not clear in this summary.

Results
First, we explain what “certainty” means. “Low certainty” means we are not very sure. The true effect could be small or none. “Very low certainty” means we do not know if there is any effect.

Pregnant women and new mothers, phone messages versus usual care: Phone messages may raise breast milk only feeding in places where few women do this. In places where most women already do this, messages may not help. Phone messages may help some women go to pregnancy visits. But we are not sure. Messages may help some women have a trained health worker at birth in places where this is rare. In places where this is common, messages may not help. We do not know if messages change death or serious illness for moms or babies.

Pregnant women and new mothers, phone messages versus paper handouts: Phone messages may not change breast milk only feeding. Messages may reduce health problems for moms in the first ten days after birth. They may also reduce health problems for newborns in that time. But we are not sure about the newborn result. We do not know if messages change use of care in this match.

Pregnant women and new mothers, phone messages versus non‑targeted digital messages: No trials looked at breast milk only feeding or health in this match. For use of care, we are not sure if messages help women get a trained health worker at birth. Phone messages may not change flu shots in pregnancy.

Pregnant women and new mothers with HIV, phone messages versus usual care: Phone messages may not change how well moms or babies take HIV drugs. Messages may lead to a small rise in pregnancy care visits. We are not sure if messages raise births in a health facility. We also do not know if messages change stillbirth, newborn death, or baby HIV. No trials looked at mom death or illness here.

Pregnant women and new mothers with HIV, phone messages versus non‑targeted digital messages: Phone messages may help babies get and take drugs to block HIV from mom. We do not know about other results in this match.

Parents of children under five, phone messages versus usual care: Phone messages may raise use of services. This includes shots and HIV care. The size of the effect varied a lot across trials.

Parents of children under five, phone messages versus paper handouts: Phone messages may raise shot visits. Messages may not change tooth care habits.

Parents of children under five, phone messages versus non‑targeted digital messages: Phone messages may lower shot visits. But we are not sure.

No trials in any group looked at harm. For example, no trial checked for partner abuse or loss of privacy due to messages.

What do these results mean? Phone messages may help with some actions, in some places. For example, they may help with breast milk only feeding in places where this is rare. They may help with shot visits for young children. They may help babies of moms with HIV get HIV drugs.

But many results are not clear. Most findings had low or very low certainty. This means we need better trials to know what is true. We also need trials big enough to detect real change. We need to learn if the gains are worth the cost. Future trials should also check for harms, like abuse or loss of privacy.

Bottom line: Targeted phone messages show some promise. But we are not yet sure how well they work, or for whom. More high‑quality research is needed.","Communicating to pregnant woman and parents through their mobile devices to improve maternal, neonatal, and child health 
Aim of this review 
We assessed the effect of sending targeted messages by mobile devices to pregnant women and parents of young children about health and healthcare services. 
Key messages 
There are gaps in the evidence regarding the effects of targeted messages by mobile devices to pregnant women and parents of young children about health and healthcare services. Some of these messages may improve some people's health and their use of health services, but others may make little or no difference. The existing evidence is mostly of low or very low certainty. 
What was studied in the review? 
Targeted client communication (TCC) is an intervention in which the health system sends information to particular people, based on their health status or other factors specific to that population group. Common types of TCC are text messages reminding people to attend appointments or that offer healthcare information and support. Our review assessed whether TCC can change pregnant women's and parents' behaviour, health service use, health, and well‐being. 
What happens when pregnant women receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to women who get no messages 
Women may breastfeed more in settings where exclusive breastfeeding is not common. They may also go to more antenatal care appointments. They may use skilled birth attendants more where this is less common. We do not know if the messages affect women's or babies' health because the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
Compared to women who get messages sent in other ways 
Women and newborns may have fewer health problems during the first 10 days after birth. The messages may make little or no difference to the number of women who breastfeed. We do not know if they make women use more health services. 
Compared to women who get untargeted messages 
The messages may make little or no difference to whether women get influenza vaccines during pregnancy. We do not know if the messages affect women's or babies' health or lead women to use skilled birth attendants more because the evidence is lacking or of very low certainty. 
What happens when pregnant women living with HIV receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to women who get no messages 
Women may go to slightly more antenatal care appointments. We do not know whether the messages lead more women to give birth in a health facility or improve babies' health because the evidence is of very low certainty. The messages may make little or no difference to whether pregnant women and babies follow antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (used to treat HIV) according to plan. We do not know if the messages affect women's health because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to women who get messages sent in other ways 
We do not know what the effect of these messages is because we lack evidence.
Compared to women who get untargeted messages 
More parents may follow their babies' ARV treatment according to plan. We do not know if the messages improve women's or babies' health or their use of services because the evidence is missing. 
What happens when parents of young children receive targeted messages by mobile device? 
Compared to parents who get no messages 
More parents may take their children to healthcare services such as vaccination appointments. But we do not know if the messages improve children's health or their health behaviour because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to parents who get messages sent in other ways 
Slightly more parents may take their children to vaccination appointments. The messages may make little or no difference to children's toothbrushing habits. We do not know if the messages affect children's health because the evidence is missing. 
Compared to parents who get untargeted messages 
Fewer parents may take their children to vaccination appointments, but this evidence is mixed. We do not know if the messages affect children's health due to lack of evidence. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies published up to August 2017. We carried out a search update in July 2019 and relevant studies are reported in the 'Characteristics of studies awaiting classification' section.

10.1002-14651858.CD007263.pub3,"Dilute versus full‐strength formula in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants 
Review questionIs dilute formula milk (e.g. half the strength at double the volume) better tolerated than full‐strength formula milk in the initial feeding of preterm babies for whom breast milk is not available?  
BackgroundBabies born preterm (at less than 37 weeks' gestation) or with a low birth weight (less than 2500 grams) have special feeding requirements. Expressed breast milk is preferred, but preterm babies are often fed with formula milk because breast milk is not always available. The provision of artificial feeds varies considerably in preterm babies and there is concern that introducing full‐strength formulas too early may lead to the retention of feed in the stomach, which is associated with feeding intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis, a severe bowel disorder. 
Study characteristicsThe evidence for this review is current as of 1 October 2018. We included three trials that compared dilute formula milk (half‐strength, double‐volume) with full‐strength formula milk. The trials involved 102 preterm or low birth weight infants; two were conducted in the USA and one in India. The trials were small (14, 38 and 50 infants, respectively) and conducted between 25 and 30 years ago. The quality of two trials was judged to be poor due to insufficient information being provided in the trial publications, but judged to be moderate in the third trial (of 38 infants). None of the trials assessed necrotising enterocolitis as an outcome. 
Key resultsInfants receiving dilute formula (half‐strength, double‐volume) experienced fewer episodes of feeding intolerance and achieved full energy intake earlier than infants receiving full‐strength formula (20 kcal/oz (~ 68 to 70 kcal/100 mL)). 
Feeding intoleranceTwo measures of feeding intolerance (abdominal distension and episodes of gastric residuals) were reported across the trials. Two trials (88 infants) provided data for abdominal distension and gastric residuals. Infants fed dilute formula experienced 19% (CI 16% to 23%) fewer episodes of abdominal distension (> 2 cm), equivalent to 0.67 episodes per infant in the half‐strength group compared to 0.83 episodes in the full‐strength group. It was not possible to combine data on gastric residuals but both trials reported fewer episodes of gastric residuals in the dilute formula group. The third trial (14 infants) only reported that there was no difference between the groups with respect to these two outcomes. 
Time to establish full enteral feedingIn two trials (88 infants) infants receiving dilute formula experienced a 22% (CI 16% to 28%) reduction in the number of days required to reach an adequate energy intake (420 joules/kilogram), equivalent to 8 days in the half‐strength group compared to 10.3 days in the full‐strength group. 
Certainty of evidenceIn exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants, low‐certainty evidence shows that diluted formula may lead to an important reduction in the time taken to attain adequate enteral fluid and energy requirements, without increasing indicators of feeding intolerance. The clinical importance of the reduction in episodes of feeding intolerance is unclear. These findings are based on three small, old trials that may be of less relevance to current practice. A lack of data on other important outcomes, such as the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and weight gain, limits the usefulness of the studies.

Is dilute formula easier for tiny newborns?

Rationale
Some babies are born early. Doctors call this preterm. Some babies are born very small. Doctors call this low birth weight.

These babies need special care and feeds. Breast milk is best. But it is not always on hand.

When breast milk is not there, babies get formula. Thick or “full strength” formula may sit in the belly. It may not move well into the gut.

This can cause feeding trouble. The belly may swell. Milk may stay in the stomach after a feed.

A very rare but severe gut illness can also occur. It is called necrotizing enterocolitis. We call it NEC. NEC harms the bowel. It can make babies very sick.

Some doctors fear that full strength formula, too soon, may raise these risks. A soft start may help. Dilute formula is half as strong. Care teams give more of it to meet needs.

The main idea is simple. A gentle start may be easier to digest. It may help tiny babies learn to feed.

This review looked at a key question. Is dilute formula better than full strength for the first feeds? Does it help babies reach full feeds sooner? Is it safe?

This work matters to families. Early feeds can set the path for growth. A clear plan may lower stress and risk.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The review used all the proof up to October 1, 2018. The team found three trials.

The trials took place 25 to 30 years ago. Two were in the United States. One was in India. In total, 102 babies took part.

All babies were newborns. They were preterm or had low birth weight. All babies got only formula, not breast milk.

The trials did not report gender details. They did not share much on other traits. So we cannot say more on that.

The trials compared two ways to start feeds. One group got dilute formula. It was half strength and given in more volume. The other group got full strength formula.

The teams tracked signs of feeding trouble. They watched for belly swell. Doctors call this abdominal distension. They also checked for milk left in the stomach. Doctors call this gastric residuals. We call it leftover milk.

They also tracked how long it took to reach enough feeds. This means enough food for the baby’s needs. Doctors call this full energy intake.

The trials looked at the first days after birth. Two trials found the time to reach full feeds. It was about eight to ten days.

The proof on trial quality was mixed. Two trials gave little detail, so quality was poor. One trial had moderate quality.

None of the trials tracked NEC. They did not report weight gain. This limits what we can learn.

Results
Babies on dilute formula had fewer swollen belly episodes. This was true in two trials with 88 babies. The counts were small in both groups.

On average, babies on dilute formula had 0.67 belly swell episodes each. Babies on full strength had 0.83 episodes each. This is a small drop per baby.

Both trials that tracked leftover milk saw a trend. Babies on dilute formula had fewer leftover milk episodes. One very small trial did not see a clear gap.

Babies on dilute formula reached full feeds sooner. In two trials, this took about eight days. Babies on full strength reached this in about ten days.

So, dilute formula cut the time by about two days. This can help babies move to a steady plan. It may also cut tube feeds and stress.

No trial found more signs of feed trouble with dilute formula. The review did not find more belly swell. It did not find more leftover milk.

But we must note key limits. The trials were small and old. Care today may not match care then. This can change what the results mean now.

The trials did not track NEC. They did not track weight gain. So we cannot judge those outcomes.

The proof is low in strength. It suggests a possible gain with dilute formula. It does not prove a clear, large benefit.

What does this mean for families? If breast milk is not there, care teams must choose how to start feeds. A gentle start with dilute formula may help some babies.

It may lower early feed trouble. It may help babies reach full feeds sooner. But we still need new, larger, and modern trials.

Ask your care team what they plan and why. Each baby is unique. The team will weigh the risks and gains for your child.

In short, dilute formula may help tiny babies at first. It may be easier on the gut. But the proof is not strong yet.

Doctors and parents should use care. They should watch for belly swell and leftover milk. They should aim for steady, safe feeds.","Dilute versus full‐strength formula in exclusively formula‐fed preterm or low birth weight infants 
Review questionIs dilute formula milk (e.g. half the strength at double the volume) better tolerated than full‐strength formula milk in the initial feeding of preterm babies for whom breast milk is not available?  
BackgroundBabies born preterm (at less than 37 weeks' gestation) or with a low birth weight (less than 2500 grams) have special feeding requirements. Expressed breast milk is preferred, but preterm babies are often fed with formula milk because breast milk is not always available. The provision of artificial feeds varies considerably in preterm babies and there is concern that introducing full‐strength formulas too early may lead to the retention of feed in the stomach, which is associated with feeding intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis, a severe bowel disorder. 
Study characteristicsThe evidence for this review is current as of 1 October 2018. We included three trials that compared dilute formula milk (half‐strength, double‐volume) with full‐strength formula milk. The trials involved 102 preterm or low birth weight infants; two were conducted in the USA and one in India. The trials were small (14, 38 and 50 infants, respectively) and conducted between 25 and 30 years ago. The quality of two trials was judged to be poor due to insufficient information being provided in the trial publications, but judged to be moderate in the third trial (of 38 infants). None of the trials assessed necrotising enterocolitis as an outcome.

10.1002-14651858.CD013829.pub2,"Background
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer‐related death in the world, however lung cancer screening has not been implemented in most countries at a population level. A previous Cochrane Review found limited evidence for the effectiveness of lung cancer screening with chest radiography (CXR) or sputum cytology in reducing lung cancer‐related mortality, however there has been increasing evidence supporting screening with low‐dose computed tomography (LDCT).  
Objectives
To determine whether screening for lung cancer using LDCT of the chest reduces lung cancer‐related mortality and to evaluate the possible harms of LDCT screening. 
Search methods
We performed the search in collaboration with the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group and included the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library, current issue), MEDLINE (accessed via PubMed) and Embase in our search. We also searched the clinical trial registries to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We did not impose any restriction on language of publication. The search was performed up to 31 July 2021.  
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lung cancer screening using LDCT and reporting mortality or harm outcomes.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors were involved in independently assessing trials for eligibility, extraction of trial data and characteristics, and assessing risk of bias of the included trials using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Primary outcomes were lung cancer‐related mortality and harms of screening. We performed a meta‐analysis, where appropriate, for all outcomes using a random‐effects model. We only included trials in the analysis of mortality outcomes if they had at least 5 years of follow‐up. We reported risk ratios (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used the I2 statistic to investigate heterogeneity.  
Main results
We included 11 trials in this review with a total of 94,445 participants. Trials were conducted in Europe and the USA in people aged 40 years or older, with most trials having an entry requirement of ≥ 20 pack‐year smoking history (e.g. 1 pack of cigarettes/day for 20 years or 2 packs/day for 10 years etc.). One trial included male participants only. Eight trials were phase three RCTs, with two feasibility RCTs and one pilot RCT. Seven of the included trials had no screening as a comparison, and four trials had CXR screening as a comparator. Screening frequency included annual, biennial and incrementing intervals. The duration of screening ranged from 1 year to 10 years. Mortality follow‐up was from 5 years to approximately 12 years.  
None of the included trials were at low risk of bias across all domains. The certainty of evidence was moderate to low across different outcomes, as assessed by GRADE. 
In the meta‐analysis of trials assessing lung cancer‐related mortality, we included eight trials (91,122 participants), and there was a reduction in mortality of 21% with LDCT screening compared to control groups of no screening or CXR screening (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87; 8 trials, 91,122 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were probably no differences in subgroups for analyses by control type, sex, geographical region, and nodule management algorithm. Females appeared to have a larger lung cancer‐related mortality benefit compared to males with LDCT screening. There was also a reduction in all‐cause mortality (including lung cancer‐related) of 5% (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.99; 8 trials, 91,107 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Invasive tests occurred more frequently in the LDCT group (RR 2.60, 95% CI 2.41 to 2.80; 3 trials, 60,003 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, analysis of 60‐day postoperative mortality was not significant between groups (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.94; 2 trials, 409 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
False‐positive results and recall rates were higher with LDCT screening compared to screening with CXR, however there was low‐certainty evidence in the meta‐analyses due to heterogeneity and risk of bias concerns. Estimated overdiagnosis with LDCT screening was 18%, however the 95% CI was 0 to 36% (risk difference (RD) 0.18, 95% CI ‐0.00 to 0.36; 5 trials, 28,656 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Four trials compared different aspects of health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) using various measures. Anxiety was pooled from three trials, with participants in LDCT screening reporting lower anxiety scores than in the control group (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.43, 95% CI ‐0.59 to ‐0.27; 3 trials, 8153 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
There were insufficient data to comment on the impact of LDCT screening on smoking behaviour.  
Authors' conclusions
The current evidence supports a reduction in lung cancer‐related mortality with the use of LDCT for lung cancer screening in high‐risk populations (those over the age of 40 with a significant smoking exposure). However, there are limited data on harms and further trials are required to determine participant selection and optimal frequency and duration of screening, with potential for significant overdiagnosis of lung cancer. Trials are ongoing for lung cancer screening in non‐smokers.

Low-dose CT scans to find lung cancer early: what this review shows

2. Rationale
Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Many people only learn they have it late. Late care is hard and often does not work well.

Screening means looking for cancer before it causes signs. Chest X-rays and sputum tests did not help much in past work. A low-dose CT scan (LDCT) is a special kind of X-ray. It uses little radiation and makes clear lung images. It can find small spots before they grow.

The main question was simple. Can LDCT lower deaths from lung cancer in people at high risk? The team also looked for harms from LDCT. This work was needed to guide care in real life. It helps doctors choose who to screen and how often.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. In these trials, people were put by chance into groups. Some had LDCT scans. Others had no scans or had chest X-rays. This helps make fair tests.

The team looked for trials up to July 31, 2021. They found 11 trials from Europe and the United States. In total, 94,445 people joined. All were age 40 or older. Most had a long smoking history. Many had at least 20 “pack-years.” That means one pack a day for 20 years, or two packs a day for 10 years. One trial had men only.

Screening plans varied. Some people had scans each year. Some had them every two years. Some had them less often over time. People stayed in the screening part for 1 to 10 years. The follow-up time for deaths was 5 to about 12 years.

The team looked at both help and harm. They studied deaths from lung cancer and from any cause. They also studied false alarms, extra tests, worry, and extra cancers found that would not have caused harm.

4. Results
Main benefits
Across eight key trials, LDCT cut deaths from lung cancer. The drop was about 1 in 5. In plain words, for every five lung cancer deaths without screening, LDCT cut about one. This benefit was seen when LDCT was compared to no screening or to chest X-ray.

LDCT also cut deaths from any cause by a small amount. The drop was about 1 in 20. This means that for every twenty deaths from any cause, LDCT cut about one.

These results apply to people at high risk. This means adults age 40 or older with a heavy smoking history. The data suggest women may gain more than men. But the size of this extra gain was not clear.

Harms and trade-offs
LDCT led to more follow-up tests that go inside the body. These tests include needle biopsies and surgery. People in the LDCT group had these about two to three times more often. This is expected when more small spots are found. Death in the first 60 days after surgery was rare. It was similar between LDCT and control groups.

LDCT had more false alarms than chest X-rays. A false alarm means a scan looks bad but no cancer is there. This led to more call-backs for repeat scans or tests. The strength of this finding varied across trials.

Overdiagnosis is another harm. It means the scan finds a cancer that would not have caused harm in a lifetime. The best estimate was about 1 in 6 of the cancers found by LDCT. But this was not exact. The real number could be close to none, or up to about 1 in 3.

Effects on feelings and life quality
Four trials looked at life quality and mood. In three trials, people in LDCT groups had less worry. This suggests that a clear scan can ease the mind. The tools used to measure this were not the same across trials.

Effects on smoking
There was not enough data to say if LDCT changes smoking habits. We do not know if people quit more, quit less, or stay the same.

How sure are these results?
No trial was perfect in all ways. For the main death results, we are fairly sure. For harms like false alarms and overdiagnosis, we are less sure. Results across trials were not always the same. How “sure” the team felt ranged from moderate to low. This means the main benefit is likely real. But the exact size of harms needs more study.

What this means for patients and care
For people at high risk, LDCT screening can save lives. It lowers lung cancer deaths, and it may slightly lower deaths from any cause. But LDCT also brings more extra tests. Some of these tests are invasive. Some “cancers” found may never cause harm. People should weigh these facts with their doctor.

Who should get screened, and how often, still needs fine tuning. Trials used different ages, smoking levels, and scan timing. More trials are running now. Some explore screening for people who do not smoke.

Bottom line
LDCT screening helps high-risk adults find lung cancer early. It lowers deaths from lung cancer by about 1 in 5. It also leads to more extra tests and some overdiagnosis. Talk with your care team. Ask about your risk, your values, and your choices. This can help you decide if LDCT screening is right for you.","Impact of computed tomography (CT) on lung cancer screening
Background 
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer‐related death worldwide. Lung cancer survival is significantly dependent on when a person is diagnosed with the disease. It is essential to detect the disease as early as possible by radiography (chest x‐ray) or by computed tomography (CT) scan, which is a more detailed type of radiography where multiple images of the lung are taken. The aim of this review was to gather information on the use of CT scan to detect lung cancer earlier and to find out if early detection of lung cancer reduces death from lung cancer. We also evaluated potential harms that can occur from using CT to screen for lung cancer, such as additional investigations and their related complications. 
Description of included trials 
The evidence is current to 31 July 2021. We included 11 trials, with a total of 94,445 participants. The trials came from the USA and Europe. The earliest trial started in 1991, and the most recent started in 2011. The participants were adults over the age of 40. The frequency of screening with CT ranged from yearly to more than 2.5 years. 
Key findings 
Eight of the trials (91,122 participants) were included in the main outcome analysis of lung cancer‐related mortality. In people over 40 years with significant smoking exposure, CT screening reduced deaths from lung cancer by 21%, with 226 people needing to undergo screening to prevent one death from lung cancer. We also found that deaths from any cause (including lung cancer) were less with CT screening. However, the effect was much lower (only 5% reduction in risk). Lung cancer was detected more frequently in the group of people who had CT screening compared with no screening. However, CT scans can induce false‐positive scans (a test that is positive or indeterminate for lung cancer, when the person does not actually have lung cancer). We found that false‐positive results were more common among people who were screened with CT than chest x‐ray. Because of that, those that underwent CT screening had more tests to investigate both cancer and non‐cancer‐related diseases. Screening also implies a risk of detecting lung cancers that may have never progressed to cause harm to the person (this is referred to as overdiagnosis). The risk of lung cancer overdiagnosis with CT screening was estimated to be 18%. 
The trials were too different or did not provide enough information to look at the impact of screening on stopping smoking or quality of life. There was some evidence to suggest there were no long‐term psychological harms from screening, with some people in the CT screening group feeling less anxious compared to the control groups who were not offered screening. 
Certainty of evidence 
The overall certainty of evidence was moderate when it came to outcomes regarding death, with moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence for other outcomes. The certainty rating for outcomes reflects the authors' confidence and certainty in the outcome being correct.

10.1002-14651858.CD013512.pub2,"Background
Keratoconus is the most common corneal dystrophy. It can cause loss of uncorrected and best‐corrected visual acuity through ectasia (thinning) of the central or paracentral cornea, irregular corneal scarring, or corneal perforation. Disease onset usually occurs in the second to fourth decade of life, periods of peak educational attainment or career development. The condition is lifelong and sight‐threatening. 
Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) using ultraviolet A (UVA) light applied to the cornea is the only treatment that has been shown to slow progression of disease. The original, more widely known technique involves application of UVA light to de‐epithelialized cornea, to which a photosensitizer (riboflavin) is added topically throughout the irradiation process. 
Transepithelial CXL is a recently advocated alternative to the standard CXL procedure, in that the epithelium is kept intact during CXL. Retention of the epithelium offers the putative advantages of faster healing, less patient discomfort, faster visual rehabilitation, and less risk of corneal haze. 
Objectives
To assess the short‐ and long‐term effectiveness and safety of transepithelial CXL compared with epithelium‐off CXL for progressive keratoconus. 
Search methods
To identify potentially eligible studies, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not impose any date or language restrictions. We last searched the electronic databases on 15 January 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which transepithelial CXL had been compared with epithelium‐off CXL in participants with progressive keratoconus. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology.
Main results
We included 13 studies with 661 eyes of 567 participants enrolled; 13 to 119 participants were enrolled per study. Seven studies were conducted in Europe, three in the Middle East, and one each in India, Russia, and Turkey. Seven studies were parallel‐group RCTs, one study was an RCT with a paired‐eyes design, and five studies were RCTs in which both eyes of some or all participants were assigned to the same intervention. 
Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL with epithelium‐off CXL in participants with progressive keratoconus. There was no evidence of an important difference between intervention groups in maximum keratometry (denoted 'maximum K' or 'Kmax'; also known as steepest keratometry measurement) at 12 months or later (mean difference (MD) 0.99 diopters (D), 95% CI −0.11 to 2.09; 5 studies; 177 eyes; I2 = 41%; very low certainty evidence). Few studies described other outcomes of interest. The evidence is very uncertain that epithelium‐off CXL may have a small (data from two studies were not pooled due to considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 92%)) or no effect on stabilization of progressive keratoconus compared with transepithelial CXL; comparison of the estimated proportions of eyes with decreases or increases of 2 or more diopters in maximum K at 12 months from one study with 61 eyes was RR 0.32 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.12) and RR (non‐event) 0.86 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.00), respectively (very low certainty). We did not estimate an overall effect on corrected‐distance visual acuity (CDVA) because substantial heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 70%). No study evaluated CDVA gain or loss of 10 or more letters on a logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) chart. Transepithelial CXL may result in little to no difference in CDVA at 12 months or beyond. Four studies reported that either no adverse events or no serious adverse events had been observed. Another study noted no change in endothelial cell count after either procedure. Moderate certainty evidence from 4 studies (221 eyes) found that epithelium‐off CXL resulted in a slight increase in corneal haze or scarring when compared to transepithelial CXL (RR (non‐event) 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14). 
Three studies, one of which had three arms, compared outcomes among participants assigned to transepithelial CXL using iontophoresis versus those assigned to epithelium‐off CXL. No conclusive evidence was found for either keratometry or visual acuity outcomes at 12 months or later after surgery. Low certainty evidence suggests that transepithelial CXL using iontophoresis results in no difference in logMAR CDVA (MD 0.00 letter, 95% CI −0.04 to 0.04; 2 studies; 51 eyes). Only one study examined gain or loss of 10 or more logMAR letters. In terms of adverse events, one case of subepithelial infiltrate was reported after transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis, whereas two cases of faint corneal scars and four cases of permanent haze were observed after epithelium‐off CXL. Vogt's striae were found in one eye after each intervention. The certainty of the evidence was low or very low for the outcomes in this comparison due to imprecision of estimates for all outcomes and risk of bias in the studies from which data have been reported. 
Authors' conclusions
Because of lack of precision, frequent indeterminate risk of bias due to inadequate reporting, and inconsistency in outcomes measured and reported among studies in this systematic review, it remains unknown whether transepithelial CXL, or any other approach, may confer an advantage over epithelium‐off CXL for patients with progressive keratoconus with respect to further progression of keratoconus, visual acuity outcomes, and patient‐reported outcomes (PROs). Arrest of the progression of keratoconus should be the primary outcome of interest in future trials of CXL, particularly when comparing the effectiveness of different approaches to CXL. Furthermore, methods of assessing and defining progressive keratoconus should be standardized. Trials with longer follow‐up are required in order to assure that outcomes are measured after corneal wound‐healing and stabilization of keratoconus. In addition, perioperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care should be standardized to permit meaningful comparisons of CXL methods. Methods to increase penetration of riboflavin through intact epithelium as well as delivery of increased dose of UVA may be needed to improve outcomes. PROs should be measured and reported. The visual significance of adverse outcomes, such as corneal haze, should be assessed and correlated with other outcomes, including PROs.

Two ways to do cornea cross-linking for keratoconus: what we know

Rationale
Keratoconus is a disease of the cornea. The cornea is the clear front window of the eye. In this disease, the cornea gets thin and bulges out like a cone. This can blur sight and make lights streak or glare.

Keratoconus can start in young adult years. It can harm school and work. It is a life long disease. It can lead to scars or, in rare cases, a hole in the cornea.

Cross-linking is a treatment that can slow this disease. Doctors put vitamin B2 drops on the cornea. Then they shine a safe type of light on the eye. The light and drops form new bonds in the cornea. This can make the cornea stiffer and stronger.

There are two ways to do cross-linking. In the “epithelium-off” way, the doctor takes off the top skin of the cornea. In the “transepithelial” way, the doctor keeps that top skin on. Keeping the skin on may lead to less pain, faster heal time, and less haze. This review asked if the “skin-on” way works as well and is as safe.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. The team looked for the best kind of trials. These trials put people into groups by chance. They compared the two ways to do cross-linking.

The team searched many medical lists. The last search date was mid January of 2020. They did not limit by date or by language.

They found 13 trials. These trials took place in Europe, the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The trials had 567 people and 661 eyes in all. Each trial had from 13 to 119 people.

All people had keratoconus that was getting worse. Some trials treated one eye in each person. Some treated both eyes the same way. One trial used a plan where each eye got a different way.

Most trials looked at results at one year or more. The abstract did not list the ages or the sex of the people. Some trials also tested a “skin-on” method called iontophoresis. Iontophoresis uses a very low, mild current to help the drops go in.

Results
First, the team looked at the shape of the cornea. They used a common eye test of the cornea’s steepest curve. At one year or more, there was no clear gap between the two ways. In short, the “skin-on” way did not seem better or worse than “skin-off” for cornea shape.

Next, they looked at how well people could see on an eye chart. At one year or more, there was little to no change between the two ways. Some trials did not report this result. No trial in this group looked at big gains or big drops on the chart.

Side effects were also checked. Four trials said there were no side effects, or no serious ones. One trial found no change in the count of deep cornea cells in either group. This suggests the treatment did not harm that cell layer.

Some people had haze or faint scars in the cornea. Haze can make sight less clear. In four trials, the “skin-off” way had a small rise in haze or scars. The “skin-on” way had a bit less haze in those trials. The review did not state if this haze changed how people saw in daily life.

Some trials looked at the “skin-on” way with iontophoresis. At one year or more, sight on the chart was about the same as with “skin-off.” The shape of the cornea also had no clear gap. There was one case of a small white spot under the top layer after iontophoresis. There were two faint scars and four cases of lasting haze after “skin-off.” Fine lines in the cornea, called Vogt’s striae, showed once in each group.

So what do these results mean? Taken as a whole, the trials were small and not alike. Some did not report key results. The reports did not all use the same tests. Because of this, we cannot say for sure which way is best.

The review team had key advice for future work. First, the main goal should be to see if the cornea keeps getting worse or if it stops. Trials should use the same clear rules to define “getting worse.” Trials should last long enough to see full heal time and stable eyes. Care before, during, and after the procedure should be the same across groups.

It may also help to improve how the drops get through the top skin. This could mean new ways to get vitamin B2 into the cornea when the skin stays on. It could also mean a higher light dose that is still safe.

Trials should ask people how they feel and how they see day to day. These are called patient reported outcomes. Trials should also test if haze or scars truly change sight in real life. This will help doctors and patients pick the best way for each person.

In short, both ways aim to slow keratoconus. Based on the trials so far, we do not know if the “skin-on” way works better, the same, or worse than the “skin-off” way. The “skin-on” way may have less haze. But we still need larger, longer, and clearer trials. Until then, you and your eye doctor can weigh heal time, comfort, and risk as you choose the way that fits you.","What surgical procedure works best to slow the progression of keratoconus (an eye disease)? 
Why is this question important?Keratoconus is a disease that affects the thin, clear outer layer of the eye, known as the cornea. Normally, the cornea is dome‐shaped. In people with keratoconus, the cornea slowly thins, and a cone‐shaped bulge develops in the center of the cornea. The disease usually begins between the ages of teens and 40, and persists throughout life. It causes blurry or distorted vision that may not be improved by wearing glasses and may result in perforation of the cornea and other visual problems. 
Treatments such as glasses and contact lenses can be used to improve the vision of people with keratoconus. However, these do not slow the progression of the disease. The only treatment known to slow disease progression is ‘corneal collagen crosslinking’ (CXL). 
CXL is a surgical procedure that aims to strengthen the cornea and prevent further thinning. It involves shining ultraviolet A (invisible) light rays onto eyes that have been treated with eye drops containing riboflavin (a vitamin). When the light rays meet the riboflavin, new links form between the fibers that make up the cornea. 
There are two types of CXL. One type requires the removal of the cells on surface of the cornea, to make it easier for the riboflavin to reach the cornea. This procedure is called ‘epithelium‐off CXL’. The other type does not require the removal of these cells. This procedure is called ‘transepithelial CXL’. Surgeons who carry out this procedure can use chemicals to help riboflavin penetrate the cells on the surface of the cornea. They can also deliver riboflavin to the cornea using a small electrical current (iontophoresis). 
Epithelium‐off CXL is the more commonly used procedure. However, transepithelial CXL could have advantages, such as faster healing and less patient discomfort. We reviewed the evidence to find out which of these two procedures is more beneficial and less risky for people with keratoconus. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched the medical literature for studies that compared epithelium‐off CXL against transepithelial CXL. Then we compared the results and summarized the evidence from all the studies. We rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find?We found 13 studies with a total of 567 people. The studies took place in Europe, the Middle East, India, Russia, and Turkey. The shortest studies lasted six months, and the longest study lasted more than three years. Eleven studies compared transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis against epithelium‐off CXL. Three studies compared transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis against epithelium‐off CXL. 
Transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis compared to epithelium‐off CXL 
We do not know if one procedure is better than the other for preventing progression of keratoconus or visual loss because too few robust studies have compared the effects of these two CXL methods. 
Evidence from four studies suggests that corneal hazing (clouding of the cornea) or scarring are probably more common with epithelium‐off CXL. 
Transepithelial CXL with iontophoresis compared to epithelium‐off CXL 
Evidence from two studies suggests that there may be little to no difference between the two procedures in changes to vision clarity. We do not know if one procedure is better than the other to prevent progression of keratoconus because two few robust studies have compared the two methods. 
The evidence does not suggest that one procedure leads to more unwanted events than the other. However, our confidence in this evidence is low, because it is based on three studies that did not use robust methods. 
What does this mean?Due to a lack of robust evidence, we do not know if epithelium‐off CXL or transepithelial CXL is better for slowing keratoconus progression. 
Adverse events such as corneal hazing or scarring are probably more common with epithelium‐off CXL than with transepithelial CXL without iontophoresis. 
We need more and larger studies to strengthen the evidence. These should compare the benefits and the risks of different CXL procedures. Studies should aim to follow patients for more than 12 months, so that long‐term effects can be compared as it can take at least that much time for corneal tissue to heal from any procedure. 
How‐up‐to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to January 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013487,"Background
Multiple myeloma is a bone marrow‐based hematological malignancy accounting for approximately two per cent of cancers. First‐line treatment for transplant‐ineligible individuals consists of multiple drug combinations of bortezomib (V), lenalidomide (R), or thalidomide (T). However, access to these medicines is restricted in many countries worldwide. 
Objectives
To assess and compare the effectiveness and safety of multiple drug combinations of V, R, and T for adults with newly diagnosed transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma and to inform an application for the inclusion of these medicines into the World Health Organization's (WHO) list of essential medicines. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL and MEDLINE, conference proceedings and study registries on 14 February 2019 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing multiple drug combinations of V, R and T for adults with newly diagnosed transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing combination therapies of V, R, and T, plus melphalan and prednisone (MP) or dexamethasone (D) for first‐line treatment of adults with transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma. We excluded trials including adults with relapsed or refractory disease, trials comparing drug therapies to other types of therapy and trials including second‐generation novel agents. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included trials. As effect measures we used hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) and risk ratios (RRs) for adverse events. An HR or RR < 1 indicates an advantage for the intervention compared to the main comparator MP. Where available, we extracted quality of life (QoL) data (scores of standardised questionnaires). Results quoted are from network meta‐analysis (NMA) unless stated. 
Main results
We included 25 studies (148 references) comprising 11,403 participants and 21 treatment regimens. Treatments were differentiated between restricted treatment duration (treatment with a pre‐specified amount of cycles) and continuous therapy (treatment administered until disease progression, the person becomes intolerant to the drug, or treatment given for a prolonged period). Continuous therapies are indicated with a ""c"". Risk of bias was generally high across studies due to the open‐label study design. 
Overall survival (OS) 
Evidence suggests that treatment with RD (HR 0.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.99), median OS 55.2 months (35.2 to 87.0)); TMP (HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.97), median OS: 46.4 months (35.9 to 60.0)); and VRDc (HR 0.49 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.92), median OS 71.0 months (37.8 to 133.8)) probably increases survival compared to median reported OS of 34.8 months with MP (moderate certainty). Treatment with VMP may result in a large increase in OS, compared to MP (HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.45 to 1.07), median OS 49.7 months (32.5 to 77.3)), low certainty). 
Progression‐free survival (PFS) 
Treatment withRD (HR 0.65 (95% CI0.44 to 0.96), median PFS: 24.9 months (16.9 to 36.8)); TMP (HR 0.63 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.78), median PFS:25.7 months (20.8 to 32.4)); VMP (HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.90), median PFS: 28.9 months (18.0 to 46.3)); and VRDc (HR 0.34 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.58), median PFS: 47.6 months (27.9 to 81.0)) may result in a large increase in PFS (low certainty) compared to MP (median reported PFS: 16.2 months). 
Adverse events 
The risk of polyneuropathies may be lower with RD compared to treatment with MP (RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.99), risk for RD: 0.5% (0.1 to 1.8), mean reported risk for MP: 0.9% (10 of 1074 patients affected), low certainty). However, the CIs are also compatible with no difference or an increase in neuropathies. Treatment with TMP (RR 4.44 (95% CI1.77 to 11.11), risk: 4.0% (1.6 to 10.0)) and VMP (RR 88.22 (95% CI 5.36 to 1451.11), risk: 79.4% (4.8 to 1306.0)) probably results in a large increase in polyneuropathies compared to MP (moderate certainty). No study reported the amount of participants with grade ≥ 3 polyneuropathies for treatment with VRDc. 
VMP probably increases the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) compared to MP (RR 1.28 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.54), risk for VMP: 46.2% (38.3 to 55.6), mean risk for MP: 36.1% (177 of 490 patients affected), moderate certainty). RD, TMP, and VRDc were not connected to MP in the network and the risk of SAEs could not be compared. 
Treatment with RD (RR 4.18 (95% CI 2.13 to 8.20), NMA‐risk: 38.5% (19.6 to 75.4)); and TMP (RR 4.10 (95% CI 2.40 to 7.01), risk: 37.7% (22.1 to 64.5)) results in a large increase of withdrawals from the trial due to adverse events (high certainty) compared to MP (mean reported risk: 9.2% (77 of 837 patients withdrew)). The risk is probably slightly increased with VMP (RR 1.06 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.81), risk: 9.75% (5.8 to 16.7), moderate certainty), while it is much increased with VRDc (RR 8.92 (95% CI 3.82 to 20.84), risk: 82.1% (35.1 to 191.7), high certainty) compared to MP. 
Quality of life 
QoL was reported in four studies for seven different treatment regimens (MP, MPc, RD, RMP, RMPc, TMP, TMPc) and was measured with four different tools. Assessment and reporting differed between studies and could not be meta‐analysed. However, all studies reported an improvement of QoL after initiation of anti‐myeloma treatment for all assessed treatment regimens. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on our four pre‐selected comparisons of interest, continuous treatment with VRD had the largest survival benefit compared with MP, while RD and TMP also probably considerably increase survival. However, treatment combinations of V, R, and T also substantially increase the incidence of AEs, and lead to a higher risk of treatment discontinuation. Their effectiveness and safety profiles may best be analysed in further randomised head‐to‐head trials. Further trials should focus on consistent reporting of safety outcomes and should use a standardised instrument to evaluate QoL to ensure comparability of treatment‐combinations. 
","Plain Title
Which first treatment helps adults with multiple myeloma live longer and feel better?

Rationale
Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the bone marrow. It can cause bone pain, weak bones, and tiredness. It can harm the kidneys and the blood. Life can be hard with this disease.

Many adults cannot get a stem cell transplant. They need drug treatment as the first step. Doctors often use three key drugs: bortezomib, lenalidomide, or thalidomide. These drugs can slow the cancer and ease symptoms.

But not all people can get these drugs. In many places, access is hard. We need clear proof to guide use. The World Health Organization keeps a list of key drugs. This study aims to support that list. It looks at how well these drugs work and how safe they are.

The team asked two main questions. Which drug plans help people live longer? Which drug plans keep the cancer from getting worse for longer? They also looked at side effects and life quality. The goal was to inform care in all parts of the world.

Trial Design
This was one big review of many trials. The team looked for the best type of trials. In these trials, people got a treatment by chance. This helps make fair groups.

The search ended on 14 February 2019. The review included 25 trials. In total, 11,403 adults took part. All had new myeloma. All could not get a transplant. The trials tested 21 drug plans.

The main drugs were bortezomib (called V), lenalidomide (R), and thalidomide (T). These were used with other drugs. Those other drugs were melphalan with prednisone (called MP) or dexamethasone (D). MP and D are older, wide use drugs. They help fight cancer and reduce swelling.

Some plans had a set time length. People took them for a set number of cycles. Other plans went on and on. People took them until the cancer grew again. Or until side effects were too hard.

The trials looked at key measures. One was overall survival. That means how long people lived. One was time without growth of the cancer. One was life quality. They also tracked bad side effects. In most trials, people and doctors knew the plan. That can affect results.

Results
The review found clear wins for some plans. The basic plan, MP, had a middle survival of about 35 months. Lenalidomide with dexamethasone (RD) had about 55 months. Thalidomide with MP (TMP) had about 46 months. A plan with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone taken without a set stop (VRD, continuous) had about 71 months. These numbers mean many people lived longer with RD, TMP, or continuous VRD than with MP.

Time without growth also got longer. MP had a middle time of about 16 months. RD had about 25 months. TMP had about 26 months. VMP (bortezomib with MP) had about 29 months. Continuous VRD had about 48 months. These plans held the cancer in check longer than MP.

Side effects mattered. Nerve pain and numbness (called neuropathy) was a key concern. RD may have had fewer nerve problems than MP. But we are not sure. TMP and VMP had more nerve problems than MP. For VRD, the trials did not report severe nerve cases.

Some side effects were serious. More people on VMP had serious side effects than on MP. The counts for MP were 177 out of 490 people. The review could not compare serious side effects for RD, TMP, or VRD directly with MP.

Stopping treatment due to side effects also rose with some plans. More people stopped RD and TMP than MP. Many more people stopped continuous VRD than MP. A few more people stopped VMP than MP. This shows a trade‑off. Some plans helped people live longer. But side effects led more people to stop.

Life quality was also key. Four trials checked this. They used several tools. All showed that life quality got better after treatment began. This was true across the plans they checked.

How sure are these results? The team felt fairly sure about some points. They felt fairly sure that RD and TMP help people live longer than MP. They felt less sure about VMP for survival, but the trend was good. They felt the strongest gain in survival came from continuous VRD. They also felt sure that RD, TMP, and continuous VRD led to more people stopping due to side effects. They felt fairly sure that VMP caused more serious side effects than MP.

What does this mean for patients? If you cannot get a transplant, more than one first plan can help. RD, TMP, VMP, and continuous VRD all kept cancer in check longer than MP. RD, TMP, and continuous VRD also helped people live longer than MP. Continuous VRD showed the largest gain in life span. But it also linked to more people stopping due to side effects. TMP and VMP raised the chance of nerve harm. These points can guide you and your doctor.

What does this mean for the field? This review brings many trials into one view. It aims to guide the WHO list of key drugs. It also shows gaps. Many trials did not use the same side effect terms. Few trials measured life quality in the same way. Future trials should fix this. Head‑to‑head tests of these plans would help a lot.

In short, several drug plans work well. Some work very well. But the best plan for one person may not be best for all. Talk with your care team. Balance longer life, side effects, and your goals. This review gives facts to help you choose.","Multiple drug combinations of bortezomib, lenalidomide and thalidomide for initial treatment of adults with transplant‐ineligible multiple myeloma 
Background 
Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer. It accounts for approximately 2% of all cancers and is still considered incurable. For people with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), who are unsuitable for a procedure where damaged blood cells are replaced with healthy ones (stem‐cell transplant), treatment is usually a multiple drug combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide, or thalidomide, plus melphalan and prednisolone (MP) or dexamethasone (D). Multiple drug combinations are approved for initial anti‐myeloma therapy, however, access to these medicines is restricted in many countries worldwide. 
Aim of the review 
To compare the benefits and harms of selected anti‐myeloma drugs (bortezomib (V), lenalidomide (R), thalidomide (T)) for transplant‐unsuitable NDMM. 
Study characteristics 
We searched selected medical databases and trial registries until 14th February 2019. We included studies comparing multiple drug combinations of V, R, and T for the treatment of people with NDMM who were unsuitable for a stem‐cell transplant. We differentiated between fixed treatment duration and continuous therapy. Fixed therapy is a pre‐specified number of cycles, while a continuous therapy is given until the disease gets worse, the person finds the drug hard to tolerate, or when the treatment is given for a prolonged period. Continuous therapies are indicated with a ""c"". 
Key results 
We identified 25 studies involving 11,403 transplant‐unsuitable adults with NDMM, and comparing 21 different treatment regimens. 
Survival 
People who had the standard treatment, MP, lived for an average of 35 months. People treated with RD, TMP, and VRDc probably live for much longer (moderate certainty). Treatment with VMP may also lead to much longer survival, compared to MP (low certainty). People treated with RD lived for an additional 20.4 months; with TMP an additional 11.6 months; with VRDc an additional 36.2 months, and with VMP an additional 14.9 months. 
Harms 
On average, 0.9% (9 out of 1000) of people treated with MP experienced peripheral nerve damage (polyneuropathies).The evidence was inconclusive whether treatment with RD decreases the risk of developing a polyneuropathy, compared to MP. The estimated risk of polyneuropathies with RD was 0.5%. Treatment with TMP and VMP probably increases the risk of experiencing polyneuropathies compared to MP (moderate certainty). The estimated risk with TMP was 4.0%, and with VMP 79.4%. No VRDc treatment study reported the number of participants with severe polyneuropathies. 
On average, 36.1% (361 out of 1000) of people on MP‐treatment experienced at least one serious adverse event (SAE). VMP probably increases the proportion of participants with SAEs compared to MP to 46.2% (moderate certainty). 
On average, 9.2% (92 out of 1000) of people treated with MP stop the treatment because of adverse events (AEs). Treatment with RD, TMP, and VRDc leads to a much higher proportion of people stopping treatment because of AEs than MP (high certainty). The risk of stopping treatment with RD is 38.5%; with TMP 37.7%, with VRDc 82.1%. Treatment with VMP probably increases the risk of stopping treatment because of AEs compared to MP (9.75%, moderate certainty). 
Quality of life 
Quality of life (QoL) was reported in four studies for seven different treatments and was measured with four different tools. Assessment and reporting differed between studies and could not be meta‐analysed. However, all studies reported an improvement in QoL after anti‐myeloma treatment was started for all assessed treatments. 
Conclusions 
VRDc showed the highest overall survival benefits, compared to MP. RD and TMP also improved OS compared to MP. However, these combinations of drugs also led to more adverse events compared to MP, and led to more people stopping treatment. More trials are needed that look carefully at both harms and QoL.

Diagnosis of endometrial (womb) cancer is normally made at an early stage, as most women with the disease experience abnormal vaginal bleeding, which prompts them to seek medical advice. However, delays in presentation and referral can result in delay in diagnosis and management, which can lead to unfavourable treatment outcomes. This is particularly a problem for pre‐ and peri‐menopausal women. Providing educational information to women and healthcare providers regarding symptoms relating to endometrial cancer may raise awareness of the disease and reduce delayed treatment. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of health education interventions targeting healthcare providers, or individuals, or both, to promote early presentation and referral for women with endometrial cancer symptoms. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of review articles. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both individually randomised and cluster‐RCTs. In the absence of RCTs we planned to include well‐designed non‐randomised studies (NRS) with a parallel comparison assessing the benefits of any type of health education interventions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently evaluated whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria for the review, but none were found. 
Main results
A comprehensive search of the literature yielded the following results: CENTRAL (1022 references), MEDLINE (2874 references), and Embase (2820 references). After de‐duplication, we screened titles and abstracts of 4880 references and excluded 4864 that did not meet the review inclusion criteria. Of the 16 references that potentially met the review inclusion, we excluded all 16 reports after reviewing the full texts. We did not identify any ongoing trials. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently an absence of evidence to indicate the effectiveness of health education interventions involving healthcare providers or individuals or both to promote early presentation and referral for women with endometrial cancer symptoms. High‐quality RCTs are needed to assess whether health education interventions enhance early presentation and referral. If health education interventions can be shown to reduce treatment delays in endometrial cancer, further studies would be required to determine which interventions are most effective.

Do education programs help women spot womb cancer sooner?

2. Rationale
Womb cancer starts in the lining of the womb. Many women get odd vaginal bleeding. This sign often leads them to seek care. Doctors can then find the cancer early.

But some women wait to seek help. Some may not know this bleeding is a key sign. Some may not get sent to the right clinic in time. Delay can lead to worse care and outcomes.

This delay is a big problem for women near menopause. This means before, or around, the end of monthly periods. These years can bring many bleed changes. That can make signs hard to spot.

The study team asked a clear question. Can health education help women seek care fast? Can it help doctors send women to the right clinic fast? They hoped education could cut delay.

By “health education,” they mean clear facts on signs. Facts for women and for health staff. This may raise awareness. It may help women and staff act fast.

If this works, women may get care sooner. They may have better outcomes. So, this review is needed. It tests if education can help in this way.

3. Trial Design
This study is a review of research. A review brings many studies together. It sums up what we know. It shows what we still need to learn.

The team set clear rules for studies to include. They looked for fair tests. In these tests, people go into groups by chance. This type of test can show what works best.

They also planned to include good non‑random tests. These are side‑by‑side group studies. The goal was to judge any type of education program. The key aim: speed up help for womb cancer signs.

The team searched many data lists. They looked in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. They also checked trial lists and meeting books. They checked the lists at the end of reviews.

Two team members screened the studies. They worked on their own at first. Then they compared notes. This helps keep the process fair.

Who was the focus? Women with womb cancer signs. The main sign was odd vaginal bleeding. Women before and near menopause were of special concern.

What would a person in a test have done? The plan was to test education. It could target women, health staff, or both. But the review found no tests to report.

How long would someone be in a test? The review did not find tests. So time in a test is unknown. The review does not report any time plan.

4. Results
The search found many papers. CENTRAL had 1,022. MEDLINE had 2,874. Embase had 2,820.

They removed repeats and screened 4,880 records. They set aside 4,864 right away. Sixteen looked like they might fit. They read all sixteen in full.

They then ruled out all sixteen. None met the strict rules. The team also found no trials in progress. So, there were no studies to include.

What does this mean for women? Right now, we do not have proof. We do not know if education helps women seek care fast. We also do not know if it helps staff refer fast.

This does not mean education does not work. It means we have no fair tests yet. We need high‑quality tests. They must put people into groups by chance.

Those tests should ask clear questions. Do women act fast after they learn the signs? Do staff send women to the right clinic fast? Do delays get shorter?

If good tests show a clear gain, we need the next step. We then must learn which program works best. We must learn how to share facts in the best way.

What is the main take‑home point? There is a gap in the evidence. We need strong trials to guide care. This is key for women with womb cancer signs.

Why does this matter? Womb cancer is often found early. Odd bleeding helps many women seek help. But delay can still occur and can harm care.

Education may help close that gap. It may help women and staff act fast. But we must test it well. Then we can know, not guess.

In short, the review found no trials to include. So, there is no proof yet on this topic. We need fair, well‑run trials. Women’s health could gain from that work.","Do health education interventions lead to early treatment for women with symptoms of endometrial (womb) cancer 
Background Endometrial (womb) cancer arises from the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the lining of the womb. Diagnosis when the disease is still at an early stage (cancer is still within the womb, without spread into nearby tissues) is common, as most women with the disease experience abnormal vaginal bleeding and go to their doctors. However, delayed management of endometrial cancer still occurs. This is particularly a problem for women who are about to go through or are in the menopause. Providing educational information to women and healthcare providers regarding symptoms relating to endometrial cancer may raise awareness of the disease and reduce delayed treatment. We undertook this review to assess whether endometrial cancer education led to women with endometrial cancer symptoms visiting their doctors and being referred for treatment earlier than when there was no education. 
The aim of the review We undertook this review to assess whether endometrial cancer education led to women with endometrial cancer symptoms visiting their doctors and being referred for treatment earlier than when there was no educational information available. 
Main findings We planned to include randomised controlled trials (studies in which people or groups of people are allocated by chance to two or more groups, treating them differently). In the absence of randomised controlled trials, we planned to include studies where participants were not randomised but that included an assessment of the benefits of health education compared to no health education. We searched scientific databases and checked the titles and abstracts of 4880 possibly relevant articles and assessed the full text of 16 of these references. However, we found no studies that met our inclusion criteria.

10.1002-14651858.CD013276.pub2,"Background
A considerable challenge for maternity care providers is recognising clinical deterioration early in pregnant women. Professional bodies recommend the use of clinical assessment protocols or evaluation tools, commonly referred to as physiological track‐and‐trigger systems (TTS) or early warning systems (EWS), as a means of helping maternity care providers recognise actual or potential clinical deterioration early. TTS/EWS are clinician‐administered (midwife, obstetrician), bedside physiological assessment protocols, charts or tools designed to record routinely assessed clinical parameters; that is, blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, urine output and mental/neurological alertness. In general, these systems involve the application of scores or alert indicators to the observed physiological parameters based on their prespecified limits of normality. The overall system score or alert limit is then used to assist the maternity care provider identify a need to escalate care. This, in turn, may allow for earlier intervention(s) to alter the course of the emerging critical illness and ultimately reduce or avoid mortality and morbidity sequelae. 
Objectives
To evaluate the clinical‐ and cost‐effectiveness of maternal physiological TTS/EWS on pregnancy, labour and birth, postpartum (up to 42 days) and neonatal outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (28 May 2021), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (7 June 2021), OpenGrey, the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database (7 June 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐RCTs, comparing physiological TTS/EWS with no system or another system. Participants were women who were pregnant or had given birth within the previous 42 days, at high risk and low risk for pregnancy, labour and birth, and postpartum complications. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (VS and MN) independently assessed all identified papers for inclusion and performed risk of bias assessments. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Data extraction was also conducted independently by two review authors (VS and MN) and checked for accuracy. We used the summary odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to present the results for dichotomous data and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI to present the results for continuous data. 
Main results
We included two studies, a parallel RCT involving 700 women and a stepped‐wedge cluster trial involving 536,233 women. Both studies were published in 2019, and both were conducted in low‐resource settings. The interventions were the 'Saving Mothers Score' (SMS) and the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device, and both interventions were compared with standard care. Both studies had low or unclear risk of bias on all seven risk of bias criteria. Evidence certainty, assessed using GRADE, ranged from very low to moderate certainty, mainly due to other bias as well as inconsistency and imprecision. 
For women randomised to TTS/EWS compared to standard care there is probably little to no difference in maternal death (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.11; 1 study, 536,233 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care may reduce total haemorrhage (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.69; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For women randomised to TTS/EWS compared to standard care there may be little to no difference in sepsis (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.80; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence), eclampsia (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.03; 2 studies, 536,933 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and HELLP (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.40; 1 study, 700 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and probably little to no difference in maternal admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (OR 0.78, 95% CI  0.53 to 1.15; 2 studies, 536,933 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care may reduce a woman's length of hospital stay (MD ‐1.21, 95% CI ‐1.78 to ‐0.64; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence) but may result in little to no difference in neonatal death (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.84; 1 study, 700 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Cost‐effectiveness measures were not measured in either of the two studies.  
Authors' conclusions
Use of TTS/EWS in maternity care may be helpful in reducing some maternal outcomes such as haemorrhage and maternal length of hospital stay, possibly through early identification of clinical deterioration and escalation of care. The evidence suggests that the use of TTS/EWS compared to standard care probably results in little to no difference in maternal death and may result in little to no difference in neonatal death. Both of the included studies were conducted in low‐resource settings where the use of TTS/EWS might potentially confer a different effect to TTS/EWS use in high‐resource settings. Further high‐quality trials in high‐ and middle‐resource settings, as well as in discrete populations of high‐ and low‐risk women, are required.

Do early warning checks help keep pregnant women and new mothers safe?

Rationale
Pregnancy puts stress on the body. Big changes can happen fast. It can be hard to spot a bad turn early. When care is late, harm can grow.

Early warning checks may help. Staff take simple signs like blood pressure, pulse, and heat. They also check urine and how alert you are. A set score or color flag can show when help is needed.

These tools have two names. One is a track-and-trigger system. The other is an early warning system. We use the short names TTS and EWS.

The idea is simple. Check key signs often. Flag a change. Act fast. Fast care may stop a crisis, like heavy bleed or infection.

This study asked a clear question. Do TTS or EWS help moms and babies do better? Can they lower death or harm? Can they save time in the hospital?

Trial Design
This was a review of trials. The team looked for the best tests. They used many study lists up to June 2021. They checked and picked trials by clear rules.

They looked for trials that used TTS or EWS. They had to compare them to usual care. The women were pregnant or had given birth in the last 42 days. They could be low risk or high risk.

Two trials fit the rules. One was a standard trial with 700 women. One was a large trial done by steps in many sites. It had 536,233 women. Both trials took place in low resource places.

Each trial used a tool. One used the Saving Mothers Score, or SMS. The other used the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert, or VSA. Staff used these tools at the bedside.

The review looked at key health results. It looked for death of the mother. It also looked at heavy bleed, blood infection, and bad blood pressure. It looked at seizures due to very high blood pressure, called eclampsia. It looked at a severe liver and blood problem, called HELLP. It looked at time in the hospital and the need for the ICU. The ICU is a special care ward. It also looked at death of the baby.

The review covered care in three times. These were pregnancy, labor and birth, and the first 42 days after birth. That is the time when most bad events can happen.

Results
The big trial found this. TTS or EWS likely made little to no change in deaths of mothers. The number did not look much different from usual care. We feel fairly sure of this point.

The small trial gave a bright note. TTS or EWS may cut heavy bleed. Staff may see trouble sooner and act fast. This can save blood and help moms heal.

For other bad events, the news is mixed. The tools may make little to no change in blood infection. They may make little to no change in eclampsia. They may make little to no change in HELLP. For ICU use, a change is not clear. The tools probably made little to no change.

The time in the hospital is key to moms and families. One trial found a shorter stay with the tools. Moms went home sooner. This can help well-being and save time.

For babies, the tools did not show clear gains. The small trial found little to no change in deaths of babies. This point is not certain. We may need more data to be sure.

No trial looked at cost. We do not know if the tools save money. We do not know if the tools cost more in the end. This is a gap we note.

How sure are we? For some points, we feel somewhat sure. For others, we feel less sure. This is due to the number of trials, and how the trials were set up. Some results came from one small group. Some results had wide wiggle room.

These two trials were in low resource places. That can change how a tool works. Results could differ in high resource places. Staff, gear, and systems are not the same.

What does this mean for care now? TTS and EWS may help staff spot change early. They may lower heavy bleed. They may help moms go home sooner. They likely do not change how many mothers die. They may not change baby deaths.

The tools seem safe and easy to use. They fit at the bedside. They guide when to call for more help. They can support, but not replace, good clinical care.

More good trials are needed. We need tests in high and mid resource places. We need tests in low and high risk groups. We need to learn about costs too.

In short, early warning checks can help the care team act fast. They may cut some harms for moms. But they may not change all main outcomes. More strong research will help us know more.","Physiological track‐and‐trigger/early warning systems for use in maternity care
What is the question? 
The aim of this review is to find out from randomised controlled trials if using simple monitoring tools are helpful in alerting to clinical problems and in reducing serious illness or death in pregnant women and in their first six weeks after birth. Examples of such tools are track and trigger systems or early warning systems kept by the bedside in maternity care. 
Why is this important? 
Many natural functional changes occur in a woman's body during pregnancy. As a result, a pregnant woman, who may appear healthy and well, can become rapidly very sick. This is called clinical deterioration. If not detected sufficiently early and treated successfully, the pregnant woman can become seriously ill or even die. Examples are serious bleeding, development of convulsions when a woman has high blood pressure, blood clots and serious infection. Simple bedside tools or charts can be used by maternity care providers (midwives and doctors) to record information on a woman's health. The recorded health measures include her blood pressure, pulse rate, breathing rate, body temperature, and other health measures such as urine output and mental alertness. The tools have been introduced so that the measures are observed, recorded and interpreted together, rather than as single measures. The intention is to detect when serious illness is, or might be developing. Medical staff can then step in to prevent serious harm.  
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 28 May 2021 and identified two studies that compared an early warning system with standard care. One study was a single‐centre study involving 700 women and the second was a stepped‐wedge cluster trial (multiple centres grouped into 'clusters') involving 536,233 women. Different clusters of centres introduced the tool over time until all centres were using the tool. Both studies were carried out in low‐resource healthcare settings. The tools were called the 'Saving Mothers Score' (SMS) and the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device. Risk of bias in the two studies was low or unclear.  
We found that the tools probably do not reduce maternal death. Women may have less serious bleeding (or haemorrhage) when an early warning tool is used. This finding was supported by low‐certainty evidence. We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to a potentially life‐threatening body response to infection (sepsis), to blood pressure with swelling, protein in the urine and convulsions (eclampsia), to a serious illness in pregnancy that affects the blood and the way the liver works (HELLP), or being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Use of the tools probably reduces the time a woman stays in hospital (moderate‐certainty evidence). We also found that the tools may make little or no difference to the death of the baby in the first month after birth (neonatal death). This finding was supported by low‐certainty evidence. Neither of the two included studies reported cost outcomes. 
What does this mean? 
Use of early warning tools for women in maternity care in low‐resource settings may reduce serious bleeding and probably reduces the number of days a woman stays in the hospital but may not reduce maternal or infant deaths. More studies are required on the different early warning systems in low‐resource settings. Studies are also needed in middle‐ and high‐resource settings, and in high‐ and low‐risk pregnant women.

Uterine leiomyomas, also referred to as myomas or fibroids, are benign tumours arising from the smooth muscle cells of the myometrium. They are the most common pelvic tumour in women. The estimated rate of leiomyosarcoma, found during surgery for presumed benign leiomyomas, is about 0.51 per 1000 procedures, or approximately 1 in 2000. 
Treatment options for symptomatic uterine leiomyomas include medical, surgical, and radiologically‐guided interventions. Laparoscopic myomectomy is the gold standard surgical approach for women who want offspring, or otherwise wish to retain their uterus. A limitation of laparoscopy is the inability to remove large specimens from the abdominal cavity through the laparoscope. To overcome this challenge, the morcellation approach was developed, during which larger specimens are broken into smaller pieces in order to remove them from the abdominal cavity via the port site. However, intracorporeal power morcellation may lead to scattering of benign tissues, with the risk of spreading leiomyoma or endometriosis. In cases of unsuspected malignancy, power morcellation can cause unintentional dissemination of malignant cells, and lead to a poorer prognosis by upstaging the occult cancer. 
A strategy to optimise women's safety is to morcellate the specimens inside a bag. In‐bag morcellation may avoid the dissemination of tissue fragments. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of protected in‐bag extracorporeal manual morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy compared to intra‐abdominal uncontained power morcellation. 
Search methods
On 1 July 2019, we searched; the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialized Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, PubMed, Google Scholar, and two trials registers. 
We reviewed the reference lists of all retrieved full‐text articles, and contacted experts in the field for additional and ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing in‐bag extracorporeal manual morcellation versus intracorporeal uncontained power morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy in premenopausal women. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods.
Two review authors independently reviewed the eligibility of trials, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. Data were checked for accuracy. 
The summary measures were reported as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). 
The outcomes of interest were a composite of intraoperative and postoperative complications, operative times, ease of morcellation, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, conversion to laparotomy, and postoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. Results for the five main outcomes follow. 
Main results
We included two trials, enrolling 176 premenopausal women with fibroids, who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy. 
The experimental group received in‐bag manual morcellation, during which each enucleated myoma was placed into a specimen retrieval bag, and manually morcellated with scalpel or scissors. In the control group, intracorporeal uncontained power morcellation was used to reduce the size of the myomas. 
No intraoperative complications, including accidental morcellation of the liver, conversion to laparotomy, endoscopic bag disruption, bowel injury, bleeding, accidental injury to any viscus or vessel, were reported in either group in either trial. 
We found very low‐quality evidence of inconclusive results for total operative time (MD 9.93 minutes, 95% CI ‐1.35 to 21.20; 2 studies, 176 participants; I² = 35%), and ease of morcellation (MD ‐0.73 points, 95% CI ‐1.64 to 0.18; 1 study, 104 participants). The morcellation operative time was a little longer for the in‐bag manual morcellation group, however the quality of the evidence was very low (MD 2.59 minutes, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.72; 2 studies, 176 participants; I² = 0%). There were no postoperative diagnoses of leiomyosarcoma made in either group in either trial. 
We are very uncertain of any of these results. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to indirectness and imprecision, because of limited sites in high‐income settings and countries, small sample sizes, wide confidence intervals, and few events. 
Authors' conclusions
There are limited data on the effectiveness and safety of in‐bag morcellation at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy compared to uncontained power morcellation. We were unable to determine the effects of in‐bag morcellation on intraoperative complications as no events were reported in either group. We are uncertain if in‐bag morcellation improves total operative time or ease of morcellation compared to control. Regarding morcellation operative time, the quality of the evidence was also very low and we cannot be certain of the effect of in‐bag morcellation compared to uncontained morcellation. No cases of postoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma occurred in either group. We found only two trials comparing in‐bag extracorporeal manual morcellation to intracorporeal uncontained power morcellation at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy. Both trials had morcellation operative time as primary outcome and were not powered for uncommon outcomes such as intraoperative complications, and postoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. 
Large, well‐planned and executed trials are needed.

Cutting up fibroids in a bag during keyhole surgery: what we know

2. Rationale
Fibroids are non‑cancer growths in the muscle of the womb. They are common. They can cause heavy flow, pain, and pressure. They can also affect plans to have a baby.

Some women need surgery to remove fibroids. One option uses small cuts and a camera. This is called keyhole surgery. Doctors call it laparoscopic myomectomy. In this surgery, the womb stays in place.

Large fibroids are hard to take out through small cuts. So doctors cut big tissue into small bits. This is called morcellation. If done in the belly with a power tool, tiny bits may spread. That can seed new fibroid growth or endometriosis. If a hidden cancer is there, it could spread too. This cancer is rare. About 1 in 2000 surgeries for “fibroids” finds it.

A simple idea may lower spread. Put the fibroid in a strong bag first. Then cut it up by hand so all bits stay inside the bag. This study asked if bag use is safe and works as well.

3. Trial Design
How is this study designed?
This was a review of two trials. The trials put women by chance into one of two groups. All women had fibroids. All had keyhole surgery to remove them. All were pre‑menopause. The trials only looked at women who wanted to keep the womb.

One group had in‑bag manual cutting. The doctor put each fibroid in a bag. The doctor then cut it by hand with a knife or scissors. The bag held the tissue.

The other group had power cutting in the belly. The doctor used a device to cut the tissue into small parts. No bag held the tissue.

In all, 176 women took part across the two trials. The trials were done in a few sites in richer countries. The trials were small.

The trials planned to track harm during and after surgery. They planned to track total time in the operating room. They planned to rate how easy the cutting was. They planned to look at hospital stay, pain, and if anyone needed to switch to open surgery. They also watched for any later finding of a rare womb muscle cancer.

The abstract did not state how long each person was in the study.

4. Results
What were the main results of the study?
No harm events happened during surgery in either group in either trial. That means no bowel injury, no large bleeds, no bag tears, and no switch to open surgery were seen. But the trials were small. This makes it hard to be sure about rare harms.

The total time in the operating room looked about the same. But the proof is not clear. The trials were small and took place in a few sites. So we cannot be sure.

Cutting time itself was a bit longer with the bag and hand tools. It took about three more minutes on average. The difference was small. But again, the proof is weak. The number of women was small.

One trial asked about how easy the cutting felt. It found little to no difference. But this was also based on a small number. So we cannot be sure.

No case of the rare womb muscle cancer was found after surgery in either group. This is what we expect. That cancer is rare, about 1 in 2000. These trials were too small to test this risk with confidence.

The abstract did not give clear results on pain, time in the hospital, or switch to open surgery. It only said what the trials planned to look at. We cannot draw firm ideas on those points from this summary.

What does this mean for patients?
Both ways to cut up fibroids worked to let doctors remove them. In these small trials, no harms during surgery were seen in either group. Cutting in a bag by hand took a bit more time for that step. The overall time in the operating room looked close, but we are not sure.

Why is more research needed?
These trials were small and from a few places. They cannot prove which way is safer. They also cannot prove which way is faster or easier. They were not large enough to test rare risks. This includes the risk of spreading a hidden cancer or other tissue.

What do the investigators conclude?
We still do not know if using a bag cuts risk during fibroid surgery. We also do not know if it changes total time in the operating room. No cancers were found in these trials, but the number of women was small. Larger, well‑planned trials are needed. These trials should include many sites. They should track harms and recovery over time.

How is this study relevant to care?
Many women seek to keep the womb. Keyhole surgery can help do that. When fibroids are large, doctors must cut them into smaller parts. Putting tissue in a bag may lower spread of bits. This review suggests bag use is possible. It may add a few minutes to the cutting step. But we need stronger proof to say it lowers risk. Until then, women can ask their surgeon which method they use and why. They can ask about use of a bag. They can also ask how the team keeps them safe during and after surgery.","In‐bag manual versus uncontained power morcellation for laparoscopic myomectomy
Review question 
Cochrane authors reviewed the effectiveness and safety of in‐bag manual morcellation compared to uncontained power morcellation during laparoscopic myomectomy. The primary outcome of the review was a composite of intraoperative (during surgery) complications. 
Background 
Myomectomy is a surgical procedure to remove uterine fibroids — also called leiomyomas. These common, non‐cancerous growths usually develop in the uterus during childbearing years, but they can occur at any age. In laparoscopic myomectomy, which is a minimally invasive procedure, the surgeon accesses and removes the fibroids through several small abdominal incisions. 
Laparoscopic myomectomy is the gold standard for women with uterine leiomyomas, but it is difficult to remove large fibroids through the small incisions and tubes (laparoscopes). To overcome this challenge, surgeons developed a technique to break the large fibroids into smaller pieces (morcellation). 
However, power morcellation (using a drill‐like instrument to cut up the fibroids) inside the abdomen may lead to the scattering of the tissues. These tissues may be benign (such as fibroids or endometriosis), but they may also be tissues from an undiagnosed cancer. A strategy to optimise women's safety is to cut up larger fibroids with a scalpel or scissors, inside a bag. 
Study Characteristics 
We included two randomised controlled trials, which enrolled 176 premenopausal women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy; they were randomised to receive either in‐bag manual morcellation (87 women) or uncontained power morcellation (89 women). The literature was searched to 1 July 2019. 
Key results 
Neither study reported complications during or after surgery, including no diagnoses of leiomyosarcoma, for women in either group. 
We are very uncertain whether in‐bag morcellation reduces the total time of the operation, or improves the ease of morcellation. The evidence suggests that the morcellation operative time was slightly longer when the surgeon used in‐bag morcellation. However, the quality of the evidence is very low and we cannot be certain of any of these results. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low quality. The main limitations were indirectness (both trials took place in high‐income settings and countries, therefore, our findings are limited to this type of setting), and imprecision (both trials had small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals).

10.1002-14651858.CD013256.pub2,"Background
Medications used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have significantly improved patient outcomes and delayed time to surgery. However, some of these therapies are recognized to increase the general risk of infection and have an unclear impact on postoperative infection risk. 
Objectives
To assess the impact of IBD medications on postoperative infection risk within 30 days of surgery. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane IBD Groups Specialized Register (29 October 2019), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2019), EMBASE (January 1985 to October 2019), the Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception up to October 2019 and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials, quasi‐randomized controlled trials, non‐randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies, case‐control studies and cross‐sectional studies comparing patients treated with an IBD medication preoperatively or within 30 days postoperatively to patients who were not taking that medication. Manuscripts and abstracts were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts and extracted data. The primary outcome was postoperative infection within 30 days of surgery. Secondary outcomes included incisional infections and wound dehiscence, intra‐abdominal infectious complications and extra‐abdominal infections. Three authors assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle‐Ottawa scale. We contacted authors for additional information when data were missing. For the primary and secondary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using the generic inverse variance method. When applicable, we analyzed adjusted and unadjusted data separately. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. 
Main results
Sixty‐eight non‐randomized studies were included. Twenty‐four studies had low risk of bias while the remaining had very high risk. Based on pooling of adjusted data, overall infectious complications were increased in patients who received anti‐TNF agents (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.13; very low certainty evidence) and corticosteroids (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.38 to 2.09; low certainty evidence). Use of 5‐ASA (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.14; very low certainty evidence), immunomodulators (OR 1.29; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.76; low certainty evidence) and anti‐integrin agents (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.36; low certainty evidence) had no impact on overall infectious complications. No difference in the odds of wound‐related complications was seen in patients using corticosteroids, 5‐ASA, immunomodulators, anti‐TNF or anti‐integrin agents when compared to controls. Both corticosteroids and anti‐TNF agents increased odds of intra‐abdominal infection (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.28 to 1.84; very low certainty evidence and OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.82; very low certainty evidence, respectively) whereas no impact was observed with 5‐ASA, immunomodulators or anti‐integrin agents. The rate of extra‐abdominal infections was not affected by corticosteroids, immunomodulators, anti‐TNF or anti‐integrin agents. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence regarding corticosteroids, 5ASA, immunomodulators, anti‐TNF mediations and anti‐integrin medications was low or very low in certainty. Thus, the impact of these medications on postoperative infectious complications is uncertain and no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding their safety in the perioperative period. Decisions regarding preoperative IBD medications should be tailored to each patient’s unique circumstances. Future studies should focus on controlling for potential confounding factors to generate higher quality evidence.

Do some IBD drugs raise the chance of infection after surgery?

Rationale
Inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, is long term swelling in the gut. It includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD can cause pain, weight loss, and tiredness. Many people need surgery at some point.

IBD drugs help calm gut swelling. They can cut flares and may delay surgery. But some of these drugs can also weaken the body’s fight against germs.

Doctors and patients want to know if these drugs are safe around surgery. The big question is this: do these drugs raise the chance of an infection after surgery? This study set out to check that.

The team looked at five kinds of IBD drugs. These were steroids, 5‑ASA drugs, immunomodulators, anti‑TNF drugs, and anti‑integrin drugs. The idea was to see which, if any, raise the risk of infection after an operation.

Trial Design
This was not one trial. It was a careful review of many studies. The team searched large study lists and trial sites. They looked for all studies up to late 2019.

The team included many study types. Some were trials. Many were reviews of health records. In these studies, people did or did not take an IBD drug before or soon after surgery.

The people in the studies had IBD and surgery. The studies looked for infections that took place within 30 days after surgery. The main focus was any infection in that time.

The team also looked at where the infection took place. They checked wound site infections and problems with the cut. They checked infections inside the belly. They also checked infections outside the belly, like lung or urine.

The team graded how strong the proof was. Many studies had limits. That means we should be careful when we read the results.

In total, the review found 68 studies. Twenty four studies were stronger in design. The rest had big limits that can affect the results.

Results
Here is what the review found. First, about steroids. Steroids lower the body’s defense against germs. People who took steroids had a higher chance of any infection within 30 days. They also had a higher chance of an infection inside the belly.

Next, anti‑TNF drugs. These drugs block a body protein that drives gut swelling. People who took an anti‑TNF drug also had a higher chance of any infection. They also had a higher chance of an infection inside the belly.

Now 5‑ASA drugs. These drugs calm the gut lining. People who took 5‑ASA did not have a higher chance of infection. Their risk looked about the same as people who did not take them.

What about immunomodulators? These drugs also calm the immune system. People who took these drugs did not show a clear rise in infections. The results looked close to no change.

Lastly, anti‑integrin drugs. These drugs stop white blood cells from moving into the gut wall. People who took these drugs did not have a higher chance of infection. Their risk looked like people who did not take them.

The team also looked at wound site problems. They did not see a clear link between any of the drug types and wound site infections. That includes steroids, 5‑ASA, immunomodulators, anti‑TNF, and anti‑integrin drugs.

They also looked at infections outside the belly. These include lung, urine, or blood. They did not find a clear rise in those infections with the drug types they checked.

These findings may help patients and doctors plan care before surgery. But we must stress an important point. The strength of the proof was low or very low. Many studies had limits. This means the results could change with better studies.

So, what does this mean for you? If you take steroids or an anti‑TNF drug, there may be a higher chance of infection after surgery. This seems most true for infections inside the belly. If you take 5‑ASA, an immunomodulator, or an anti‑integrin drug, your risk did not seem higher in these studies.

But there is no one rule for all. Choices on IBD drugs before surgery should fit you and your case. Your health team will weigh the risks and the gains. They will look at your flare risk, your surgery type, and your past infections.

The study team called for better research. Future work should control for things that can confuse results. That will help us know more for sure.

In short, some IBD drugs may raise the chance of infection after surgery. This may be most true for steroids and anti‑TNF drugs. Other drug types did not show a clear rise in risk. But the proof is weak, so we need better data. Talk with your care team to plan the safest path for you.","Infection risk after surgery in patients using medications for inflammatory bowel disease 
Background  
More than 1.2 million individuals in North America are affected by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is a condition that involves inflammation in the large and/or small intestine(s), resulting in symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Many of the medications used to treat IBD suppress the immune system. As a result, use of these medications increases the risk of infection. This increased risk of infection is particularly concerning in patients undergoing surgery. 
Review Question  
This systematic review examined the combined data from 68 previously published studies to determine whether patients using IBD medications around the time of surgery had more infections compared to those not using the same medications. 
Study Characteristics  
This systematic review is current up to 29 October 2019. It included 68 studies in patients with IBD who underwent surgery. Most participants were 18 years or older and both men and women were included. Five IBD medication groups were examined within our study. Infections were tracked up to 30 days after surgery. 
Key Results  
Analyses of this large set of data revealed that infection risk around the time of surgery varied depending on which type of IBD medication the patients were on. Patients being treated with corticosteroids or anti‐TNF agents seemed to have more infections after surgery, while those on 5‐ASA, immunomodulators or anti‐integrin agents did not seem to have more infections after surgery. These findings should be taken with caution as our review included studies which were of limited quality, and therefore we were not able to draw any firm conclusions.These findings could help doctors choose which medications to treat IBD patients with before surgery. Decisions should be tailored to each patient's unique health needs. In addition, this study suggests the need to carefully monitor for infections after surgery in patients who are on certain types of IBD medications.  
Limitations  
One limitation of this systematic review was its dependence on data from a wide range of previously published studies, with various approaches and quality control standards. Most studies examined had very low certainty regarding its conclusions. This review illustrates the need for future high‐quality research examining the impact of medications used to treat IBD on infection risk after surgery.

Due to the very low‐quality evidence, we are uncertain whether the following effects are due to supplementation or not. One 12‐month study reported a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations and antibiotic use when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo and one three‐month study reported no change in antibiotic use during the study period. Few side effects were reported in any of the studies. One six‐week study reported that lung function and clinical status improved when taking omega‐3 supplements. Sputum levels were also noted to be reduced in this six‐week study. Three studies reported no difference in lung function when taking omega‐3 supplementation compared to placebo. Two longer studies found that people taking omega‐3 supplements showed definite increases in levels of essential fatty acids in their white blood cell membranes and also in levels of phospholipids (molecules that provide structure and protection to cells) measured in blood samples. 
We are uncertain whether regular omega‐3 supplements benefit people with cystic fibrosis and whether they cause side effects, or not. We are not able to draw firm conclusions or recommend the routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. Larger and longer studies are needed to assess the clinical benefit of omega‐3 supplementation and to determine the appropriate dosage. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to very low participant numbers, low event rates, limited reporting and poor study design. There was no consistency with regards to the time points when results were reported or the measurements used for the same outcome in different studies.

Do omega-3 (fish oil) pills help people with cystic fibrosis?

Rationale
Cystic fibrosis is a life long disease. It makes thick, sticky mucus in the lungs. This can lead to lung bugs and lung flare ups. These flare ups can harm breathing over time.

The body fights lung bugs with swelling, which we call inflammation. Too much swelling can also harm the lungs. Omega-3 are fats found in fish oil. Omega-3 may help calm this swelling.

Past lab work hints that omega-3 can help with long term swelling. Some people with cystic fibrosis hope it may also help them breathe better. We need good studies to see if it helps and if it is safe. This review looked for proof to guide care.

Trial Design
This was a review of prior studies. The team looked for all tests of omega-3 pills in people with cystic fibrosis. The proof in this review is up to date as of April 1, 2020.

The review found five small studies. They compared omega-3 pills to another pill with no omega-3. This kind of pill is often called a dummy pill. The studies had 106 people in total. They had both kids and adults.

People took the pills from six weeks to 12 months. Not all studies used the same tests or time points. That made it hard to match results. The review added up what we can learn from them.

Results
The results were mixed. One study that ran for 12 months found fewer lung flare ups. People in that study also used fewer antibiotic drugs. A shorter study, which ran for three months, found no change in antibiotic use.

One six week study found better lung test scores. People in that study also felt and did better day to day. Thick mucus, also called sputum, went down in that group. But three other studies found no change in lung tests.

Two longer studies looked at fats in the blood and in cells. They found higher levels of healthy fats in white blood cells. White blood cells are the cells that fight germs. They also found rises in cell parts that help build and guard cells. These are called phospholipids. This shows that the body took in the omega-3. But we do not know if this led to better health.

Few side effects were noted in the studies. This may mean the pills are well tolderated. But the studies were small. That means rare harms could be missed. We cannot be sure about safety yet.

What does this mean for people with cystic fibrosis? We do not yet know if omega-3 pills help most people. We also do not know the best dose or how long to take them. The studies were small and quite short. They did not all test the same things. This lowers our trust in the results.

The proof in this review is very weak. There were few people in each study. There were few events, like flare ups, to count. Study reports left out key facts at times. The study plans also had limits. Many studies did not test at the same times. They also used different tests. All this makes it hard to draw clear lines from the data.

These early signs are not enough to guide care. We cannot say that omega-3 pills help with lung flare ups. We also cannot say that they help with lung tests or with day to day life. We do not have proof that they cut the need for antibiotics. We do not have proof that they lower harm.

What should come next? We need larger and longer studies. They should use the same tests and time points. They should test kids and adults. They should track flare ups, lung tests, daily life, and side effects. They should also test dose and form of omega-3.

In short, this review does not support the routine use of omega-3 pills in cystic fibrosis at this time. Some signs look hopeful. But the proof is not strong enough. Talk with your care team before you start any new pill or oil. They can help you weigh the known facts and your goals.","The use of omega‐3 supplements in people with cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving omega‐3 supplements to people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
In people with cystic fibrosis recurring cycles of infection and inflammation are thought to worsen lung function. Studies suggest that omega‐3 fatty acids, such as those derived from fish oils, may work to counter the inflammation and may be of benefit in chronic inflammatory diseases including cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review.

10.1002-14651858.CD009481.pub2,"Narrow‐band ultraviolet B phototherapy versus broad‐band ultraviolet B or psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy for treating psoriasis 
Psoriasis is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease, with an estimated global prevalence ranging from 0.5% to 4.6%. Based on clinical features, psoriasis is generally divided into the following: chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP); psoriasis associated with psoriatic arthritis; and pustular, erythrodermic, or guttate psoriasis. We also considered psoriasis affecting the palms and soles (palmoplantar psoriasis, or PPP). Although psoriasis is rarely life‐threatening, it can affect a person's quality of life significantly. 
Phototherapy is an essential treatment option for people with psoriasis. The most commonly used types of phototherapy are narrow‐band ultraviolet B (NB‐UVB), broad‐band ultraviolet B (BB‐UVB), and psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy (PUVA). PUVA can be further divided into oral, bath, and topical PUVA according to the administrative route of psoralen. NB‐UVB delivers almost exclusively 311 nm radiation, whereas BB‐UVB can be divided into two types: selective BB‐UVB (305 to 325 nm radiation) and conventional BB‐UVB (280 to 320 nm radiation). 
This review included 13 small randomised controlled trials (RCT), with a total of 662 participants. Most of these were of poor methodological quality. 
For treating CPP, the clearance rate between the NB‐UVB and oral PUVA groups were inconsistent in three RCTs. In one, there was no difference between the groups, and in the other two, the clearance rate was in favour of oral PUVA. The evidence from the comparison of NB‐UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left‐right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the two groups, while another RCT favoured bath PUVA. 
Two RCTs found NB‐UVB plus retinoid (re‐NB‐UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re‐PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or guttate psoriasis. One RCT found no significant differences between NB‐UVB and selective BB‐UVB for clearing CPP or in the number of withdrawals due to side‐effects. 
In participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no statistically significant differences between NB‐UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate. 
In summary, NB‐UVB may be preferred to oral or bath PUVA because it is more convenient to use. NB‐UVB seemed to be equal to selective BB‐UVB for clearing CPP. Evidence regarding NB‐UVB and conventional BB‐UVB is limited. The long‐term safety of NB‐UVB needs to be confirmed. The efficacy of NB‐UVB for clearing PPP needs to be confirmed in future studies.

Light therapy for psoriasis: how three common types compare

2. Rationale
Psoriasis is a long‑term skin problem. It can cause red, scaly, and sore skin. It can flare, then calm, then flare again. It can make daily life hard.

Light can calm skin cells. It can slow fast skin growth. So, many people get light therapy for psoriasis. Doctors use three main kinds. They are narrow‑band UVB, broad‑band UVB, and PUVA. UVB and UVA are types of light from the sun. PUVA uses UVA light plus a drug called psoralen. Psoralen makes the skin more open to light.

We need to know which light works best. We also need to know which is safer and easier. This study looked at many trials. It asked, which light clears skin best? It also asked, which light helps more types of psoriasis?

Narrow‑band UVB uses a very small slice of UVB light. Broad‑band UVB uses a wider set of UVB light. PUVA can be given as a pill, a bath, or a cream. Many clinics use these care paths now. But we still must compare them in a fair way.

3. Trial Design
This study was a review of many trials. In each trial, people got care by chance. This is called a “random” trial. That way, the groups can be fair to compare. The review found 13 small trials. In all, 662 people took part.

Most trials looked at chronic plaque psoriasis. Some trials also looked at guttate psoriasis. One trial looked at psoriasis on the palms and soles. This is palmoplantar psoriasis. The trials did not say clear details on age or sex. They did not use the same plan or rules.

Some trials used a “left‑right” plan. One side of the body got one light. The other side got a different light. Some trials added a drug called a retinoid. A retinoid is a vitamin A‑type drug. It may help light work better.

How long did each person stay in a trial? The review did not say. The trials were small. The review found that the trial plans had weak points.

4. Results
Main question: Which light cleared the skin best?

Narrow‑band UVB versus oral PUVA in chronic plaque psoriasis:
Three trials looked at this. The results did not match. One trial found no real difference. Two trials found oral PUVA cleared more skin. So, oral PUVA may help some people more. But it is not a sure win.

Narrow‑band UVB versus bath PUVA in chronic plaque psoriasis:
The results were mixed. Two left‑right trials found no clear difference. One other trial found bath PUVA worked better. So, bath PUVA may help more in some cases. But this was not true in all trials.

Narrow‑band UVB plus a retinoid versus PUVA plus a retinoid:
Two trials looked at this. They found both plans worked about the same. This was true for chronic plaque psoriasis. It was also true for guttate psoriasis. Adding a retinoid did not make one plan much better.

Narrow‑band UVB versus selective broad‑band UVB:
One trial looked at this. It found no clear difference in clearing skin. It also found no clear difference in people who had to stop due to side effects.

Narrow‑band UVB versus topical PUVA for palmoplantar psoriasis:
One trial looked at this. It found no clear difference. This means we still do not know which is best for palms and soles.

Side effects and safety:
The trials did not give full and strong safety data. The review said long‑term safety of narrow‑band UVB still needs proof. PUVA adds a drug that can raise light side effects. Oral PUVA often needs eye care and sun care after each visit. Bath or cream PUVA may have fewer whole‑body effects. But we still need more strong tests to be sure.

Ease of use:
Narrow‑band UVB may be easier to use. It does not need a drug like psoralen. People do not need eye shields for many hours after. This can help with work and home life. The review said this ease may make narrow‑band UVB a good first choice.

What this means for patients:
Many people can clear skin with light therapy. Narrow‑band UVB often works as well as broad‑band UVB. It may work like PUVA in some cases. In other cases, PUVA may clear more skin. The mix of results means your best choice may depend on your case. Your clinic, your skin type, and your past care can guide the plan.

What this means for the field:
We need bigger and better trials. We need the same rules and clear goals across trials. We need long‑term safety data, most of all for narrow‑band UVB. We also need more data on palm and sole disease.

Investigator conclusions:
Narrow‑band UVB may be a good first pick. It is easy to use. It seems to work as well as selective broad‑band UVB. It may work as well as PUVA in some cases. But PUVA can beat it in other cases. We need more strong tests to know for sure. We also need to confirm safety over a long time. More work is needed for palm and sole psoriasis.

How to use this:
Talk with your skin doctor. Ask about each light plan. Ask about need for a drug like psoralen. Ask how often you need visits. Ask about eye care and sun care needs. The best plan is the one that fits your life and your skin.","Narrow‐band ultraviolet B phototherapy versus broad‐band ultraviolet B or psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy for treating psoriasis

10.1002-14651858.CD013208.pub2,"Background
Viral load (VL) testing in people living with HIV (PLHIV) helps to monitor antiretroviral therapy (ART). VL is still largely tested using central laboratory‐based platforms, which have long test turnaround times and involve sophisticated equipment. VL tests with point‐of‐care (POC) platforms capable of being used near the patient are potentially easy to use, give quick results, are cost‐effective, and could replace central or reference VL testing platforms. 
Objectives
To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of POC tests to detect high viral load levels in PLHIV attending healthcare facilities. 
Search methods
We searched eight electronic databases using standard, extensive Cochrane search methods, and did not use any language, document type, or publication status limitations. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and consulted an expert in the field from the World Health Organization (WHO) HIV Department for potentially relevant studies. The latest search was 23 November 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included any primary study that compared the results of a VL test with a POC platform to that of a central laboratory‐based reference test to detect high viral load in PLHIV on HIV/AIDS care or follow‐up. We included all forms of POC tests for VL as defined by study authors, regardless of the healthcare facility in which the test was conducted. We excluded diagnostic case‐control studies with healthy controls and studies that did not provide sufficient data to create the 2 × 2 tables to calculate sensitivity and specificity. We did not limit our study inclusion to age, gender, or geographical setting. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the search results to identify eligible articles. They also independently extracted data using a standardized data extraction form and conducted risk of bias assessment using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool. Using participants as the unit of analysis, we fitted simplified univariable models for sensitivity and specificity separately, employing a random‐effects model to estimate the summary sensitivity and specificity at the current and commonly reported World Health Organization (WHO) threshold (≥ 1000 copies/mL). The bivariate models did not converge to give a model estimate. 
Main results
We identified 18 studies (24 evaluations, 10,034 participants) defining high viral loads at main thresholds ≥ 1000 copies/mL (n = 20), ≥ 5000 copies/mL (n = 1), and ≥ 40 copies/mL (n = 3). All evaluations were done on samples from PLHIV retrieved from routine HIV/AIDS care centres or health facilities. For clinical applicability, we included 14 studies (20 evaluations, 8659 participants) assessing high viral load at the clinical threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL in the meta‐analyses. Of these, sub‐Saharan Africa, Europe, and Asia contributed 16, three, and one evaluation respectively. All included participants were on ART in only nine evaluations; in the other 11 evaluations the proportion of participants on ART was either partial or not clearly stated. Thirteen evaluations included adults only (n = 13), five mixed populations of adults and children, whilst in the remaining two the age of included populations was not clearly stated. The majority of evaluations included commercially available tests (n = 18). Ten evaluations were POC VL tests conducted near the patient in a peripheral or onsite laboratory, whilst the other 10 were evaluations of POC VL tests in a central or reference laboratory setting. The test types evaluated as POC VL tests included Xpert HIV‐1 Viral Load test (n = 8), SAMBA HIV‐1 Semi‐Q Test (n = 9), Alere Q NAT prototype assay for HIV‐1 (n = 2) and m‐PIMA HIV‐1/2 Viral Load test (n = 1). The majority of evaluations (n = 17) used plasma samples, whilst the rest (n = 3) utilized whole blood samples. 
Pooled sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI)) of POC VL at a threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL was 96.6% (94.8 to 97.8) (20 evaluations, 2522 participants), and pooled specificity (95% CI) was 95.7% (90.8 to 98.0) (20 evaluations, 6137 participants). Median prevalence for high viral load (≥ 1000 copies/mL) (n = 20) was 33.4% (range 6.9% to 88.5%). 
Limitations 
The risk of bias was mostly assessed as unclear across the four domains due to incomplete reporting. 
Authors' conclusions
We found POC VL to have high sensitivity and high specificity for the diagnosis of high HIV viral load in PLHIV attending healthcare facilities at a clinical threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL.

Quick HIV viral load tests near the patient work well

Rationale
HIV is a virus that harms the immune system. It can make many new virus bits in the blood. This amount is called the viral load. HIV drugs, called ART, aim to lower this number.
When the viral load stays high, the drugs may not work well. Many clinics send blood to far labs to check viral load. People then wait a long time for results. This can slow care and is hard for many.
New tests can run near the patient. These are point‑of‑care tests, or POC tests. They can be easy to use and give quick results. They may also cost less.
This study asked a key question. Do these quick tests find people with a high viral load? The team looked at a common cut‑off: one thousand copies in a small unit of blood. “Copies” is a lab word for how much virus is there. The goal was to see if these tests can help guide fast care.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team searched eight online study lists. There were no limits on language or type of report. The last search was on 23 November 2020.
They chose studies that tested people with HIV in care. Each study did two viral load tests on people. One was a quick, near‑patient test. The other was the usual lab test. The team then compared the results.
They did not limit the studies by age, sex, or place. The review found 18 studies. These had 24 test checks and 10,034 people in total. Most checks took place in sub‑Saharan Africa. Some were in Europe and Asia.
For the main cut‑off of one thousand copies, they used 14 studies. These had 20 checks and 8,659 people. In some checks, all people took HIV drugs. In others, some did, or the reports were not clear.
Most studies looked at adults. A few had both adults and kids. Most tests used plasma, which is the liquid part of blood. A few used whole blood.
Some quick tests ran near the patient or in a small on‑site lab. Some ran in large labs but used near‑patient machines. These studies looked at test results, not long‑term follow‑up time.

Results
The main point is how well the quick tests worked. The team looked at who had a high viral load and who did not. They used the one thousand copies cut‑off.
Out of 100 people who did have a high viral load, the quick test found about 97. It missed about 3. Out of 100 people who did not have a high viral load, the quick test said “no high level” in about 96. It gave a false alarm in about 4.
In the set of studies, about one in three people had a high viral load. This means many people in care need fast, clear results. Quick tests that work well can help.
These results matter for care. Many clinics now depend on far labs and long wait times. A near‑patient test can give a result the same day or soon after. This can help plan care fast. In some cases, it may help avoid an extra trip.
The review also shows where the studies took place and who took part. Most checks were in Africa, where quick tests can help many clinics. Most reports were in adults. A few had both adults and kids. Many people took HIV drugs, but not all reports were clear on this point.
There were some limits. Many reports left out some key details. This made it hard to judge the risk of bias in full. Also, some quick tests were run in big labs, not at the bedside. Real‑world use at the point of care may differ in small ways. Not all groups were the same across studies, which can affect results.
What does this mean for people with HIV? Quick viral load tests can spot who has a high level of virus in the blood. They also do well at saying who does not. This can guide care in a clinic visit. It can help teams act fast when drugs may not work well.
What does this mean for clinics and health plans? Near‑patient tests are easy to use. They can give rapid results. They may cost less and ease the load on big labs. They can help clinics in busy or rural sites.
The study team came to a clear view. At the one thousand copies cut‑off, near‑patient viral load tests work well. They can help find people with high viral load in routine care. These tests can support timely, better HIV care.","Point‐of‐care tests for detecting high viral load in people living with HIV attending healthcare facilities 
Why is improving the diagnosis of high HIV viral load infection important? 
It helps to monitor the HIV virus levels in people living with HIV (PLHIV) who are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). High virus levels indicate that the medications are failing to suppress the virus, a condition known as ART treatment failure, which has a risk of severe illness and death. Rapid diagnostic tests that detect high HIV virus levels quickly near the patient (point‐of‐care) can increase access to early changes in ART. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of point‐of‐care (POC) tests for diagnosing high HIV virus levels in PLHIV attending healthcare facilities. 
What was studied in this review? 
Point‐of‐care tests for viral load detection with results measured against central laboratory tests (reference test). We included all forms of tests with POC platforms for VL regardless of the healthcare facility in which the test was conducted. 
What are the main results in this review? 
Fourteen studies that completed 20 evaluations involving 8659 participants compared molecular POC tests for diagnosing high virus levels at the clinically recommended positivity threshold of ≥ 1000 copies/mL. 
What are the strengths and limitations of this review? 
The review included sufficient studies done on samples from PLHIV retrieved from routine HIV/AIDS care centres or health facilities, but it was unclear if all included participants were on ART. Also, none of the included tests was a true POC test conducted at the patient's side: half of the included studies (n = 10) evaluated POC tests in onsite laboratories near the patient, and the other half were tests with POC platforms evaluated in a central or reference laboratory (n = 10). 
To whom do the results of this review apply? 
PLHIV with suspected high viral loads attending healthcare facilities.
What are the implications of this review? 
In theory, for a population of 1000 PLHIV where 100 have high virus levels, 136 people would receive a positive result with the molecular POC test; of these, 39 will not have high viral levels (false‐positive result) and would be incorrectly identified as not responding to ART treatment, possibly leading to unnecessary testing or further treatment; and 864 would receive a negative test result with the molecular POC test; of these, three will actually have high virus levels (false‐negative result) and would be missed whilst failing ART treatment. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 23 November 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD011681,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for preventing tension‐type headache 
Tension‐type headache is a common type of headache that can significantly impair people's quality of life. Individuals who experience frequent or severe headaches may benefit from medications taken before the pain starts. Two classes of medication, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), typically used to treat depression, are evaluated in this review. 
This is an update of a previous review that included studies on migraine and tension‐type headache. The original review has been split into two separate reviews: this update addresses only studies on tension‐type headache, while a second focuses on migraine. When we updated this review (November 2014), we identified two new studies. Six studies were already included in the previous version of the review. Overall, we analysed a total of 412 adults participants. All the studies had a small number of participants and were conducted over a period of two to four months. Only a few were of high quality. 
Results suggest that SSRIs or SNRIs are no better than placebo (sugar pill) in reducing the number of days with tension‐type headache. There were no differences in minor side effects between participants treated with SSRIs or SNRIs versus those treated with placebo. SSRIs and SNRIs do not seem to offer advantages when compared to other active treatments, specifically the tricyclic antidepressant, amitriptyline. The participants treated with SSRIs or SNRIs suffered fewer minor side effects than those who took amitriptyline, however the number of people who stopped taking one drug or the other due to side effects was approximately equal. These results are based on poor quality, small, short‐term trials (no more than four months). We did not find a study comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with other medications (e.g. botulinum toxin) or non‐drug therapies (e.g. psycho‐behavioural treatments, manual therapy, acupuncture).

Do mood drugs help stop tension head pain before it starts?

Rationale
Tension head pain is very common. It can hurt work, school, and home life. Some people have many days of pain. This can be hard to live with.

Some drugs aim to stop the pain before it starts. This is called “prevention.” Two such drugs are SSRI and SNRI drugs. These are mood drugs used to treat low mood. They act on brain chemicals that affect pain and mood.

Doctors want to know if these drugs can cut head pain days. They also want to know if the drugs are safe. This study looked at past trials to see what we know now.

Trial Design
This report is a review of trials. It is an update to an older review. The older review mixed migraine and tension head pain. This new review looked only at tension head pain. A second review looked at migraine.

The team last searched for trials in November 2014. They found two new trials. They added those to six older trials. In all, the review looked at eight trials.

The trials had 412 adults with tension head pain. The reports did not state gender. Each trial ran for two to four months. Only a few trials were strong. Many had small groups.

The trials tested SSRI or SNRI drugs. Some trials matched them to a sugar pill, also called a placebo. A sugar pill looks like a drug but has no active drug in it. Some trials matched them to amitriptyline. Amitriptyline is an older type of mood drug.

No trial matched SSRI or SNRI drugs to other drugs. No trial matched them to care with no drugs, like talk care or hands-on care. So we cannot say how they compare to those options.

If you took part in one of these trials, you would be in it two to four months. You would be an adult with this kind of head pain. You might take a study drug or a sugar pill.

Results
The main question was: Do SSRI or SNRI drugs lower how many days you have head pain? The answer from these trials was no. These drugs did not beat a sugar pill. They did not cut the number of head pain days more than the sugar pill.

The team also looked at side effects. Minor side effects were about the same as the sugar pill. This means most people had no more small harms on these drugs than on a sugar pill. Minor side effects can be things that are not life‑threatening. The trials did not list the exact kinds in this review.

Some trials matched these drugs to amitriptyline. On head pain relief, the drugs worked about the same. SSRI or SNRI drugs did not show an edge over amitriptyline. But there was one key point. People on SSRI or SNRI drugs had fewer minor side effects than people on amitriptyline.

Even so, about the same number of people stopped the drugs. They stopped due to side effects in both groups. So the chance that you might stop the drug was about the same.

What do these results mean for you? For most adults with this kind of head pain, SSRI or SNRI drugs may not help prevent it. They do not seem to cut head pain days better than a sugar pill. They also do not work better than amitriptyline. They may have fewer small side effects than amitriptyline. But people in both groups stopped drugs at about the same rate.

These results matter for care. Many people hope for a drug that can stop head pain days. This review does not find that SSRI or SNRI drugs help with that goal. It also shows they may be a bit easier to take than amitriptyline in terms of small harms. But they do not give better pain results.

There are limits to these results. The trials were small and short. They ran no more than four months. Only a few trials were strong in how they were done. This limits how sure we can be. We also do not know how these drugs match up to other drugs. We do not know how they match up to care with no drugs.

In short, here is what the review found. SSRI and SNRI drugs did not beat a sugar pill to cut head pain days. Minor side effects were like a sugar pill. They did not beat amitriptyline for pain. They had fewer minor side effects than amitriptyline. The number who quit due to side effects was about the same. The trials were small, short, and not all strong.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for preventing tension‐type headache 
Tension‐type headache is a common type of headache that can significantly impair people's quality of life. Individuals who experience frequent or severe headaches may benefit from medications taken before the pain starts. Two classes of medication, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), typically used to treat depression, are evaluated in this review. 
This is an update of a previous review that included studies on migraine and tension‐type headache. The original review has been split into two separate reviews: this update addresses only studies on tension‐type headache, while a second focuses on migraine. When we updated this review (November 2014), we identified two new studies. Six studies were already included in the previous version of the review. Overall, we analysed a total of 412 adults participants. All the studies had a small number of participants and were conducted over a period of two to four months. Only a few were of high quality. 
Results suggest that SSRIs or SNRIs are no better than placebo (sugar pill) in reducing the number of days with tension‐type headache. There were no differences in minor side effects between participants treated with SSRIs or SNRIs versus those treated with placebo. SSRIs and SNRIs do not seem to offer advantages when compared to other active treatments, specifically the tricyclic antidepressant, amitriptyline. The participants treated with SSRIs or SNRIs suffered fewer minor side effects than those who took amitriptyline, however the number of people who stopped taking one drug or the other due to side effects was approximately equal. These results are based on poor quality, small, short‐term trials (no more than four months). We did not find a study comparing SSRIs or SNRIs with other medications (e.g. botulinum toxin) or non‐drug therapies (e.g. psycho‐behavioural treatments, manual therapy, acupuncture).

10.1002-14651858.CD013385.pub2,"Background
Decision coaching is non‐directive support delivered by a healthcare provider to help patients prepare to actively participate in making a health decision. ‘Healthcare providers’ are considered to be all people who are engaged in actions whose primary intent is to protect and improve health (e.g. nurses, doctors, pharmacists, social workers, health support workers such as peer health workers). 
Little is known about the effectiveness of decision coaching.
Objectives
To determine the effects of decision coaching (I) for people facing healthcare decisions for themselves or a family member (P) compared to (C) usual care or evidence‐based intervention only, on outcomes (O) related to preparation for decision making, decisional needs and potential adverse effects. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (Wiley), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (Ebsco), Nursing and Allied Health Source (ProQuest), and Web of Science from database inception to June 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where the intervention was provided to adults or children preparing to make a treatment or screening healthcare decision for themselves or a family member. Decision coaching was defined as: a) delivered individually by a healthcare provider who is trained or using a protocol; and b) providing non‐directive support and preparing an adult or child to participate in a healthcare decision. Comparisons included usual care or an alternate intervention. There were no language restrictions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened citations, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data on characteristics of the intervention(s) and outcomes. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion to reach consensus. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measures of treatment effect and, where possible, synthesised results using a random‐effects model. If more than one study measured the same outcome using different tools, we used a random‐effects model to calculate the standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI. We presented outcomes in summary of findings tables and applied GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
Out of 12,984 citations screened, we included 28 studies of decision coaching interventions alone or in combination with evidence‐based information, involving 5509 adult participants (aged 18 to 85 years; 64% female, 52% white, 33% African‐American/Black; 68% post‐secondary education). The studies evaluated decision coaching used for a range of healthcare decisions (e.g. treatment decisions for cancer, menopause, mental illness, advancing kidney disease; screening decisions for cancer, genetic testing). Four of the 28 studies included three comparator arms.  
For decision coaching compared with usual care (n = 4 studies), we are uncertain if decision coaching compared with usual care improves any outcomes (i.e. preparation for decision making, decision self‐confidence, knowledge, decision regret, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low.  
For decision coaching compared with evidence‐based information only (n = 4 studies), there is low certainty‐evidence that participants exposed to decision coaching may have little or no change in knowledge (SMD ‐0.23, 95% CI: ‐0.50 to 0.04; 3 studies, 406 participants). There is low certainty‐evidence that participants exposed to decision coaching may have little or no change in anxiety, compared with evidence‐based information. We are uncertain if decision coaching compared with evidence‐based information improves other outcomes (i.e. decision self‐confidence, feeling uninformed) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
For decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with usual care (n = 17 studies), there is low certainty‐evidence that participants may have improved knowledge (SMD 9.3, 95% CI: 6.6 to 12.1; 5 studies, 1073 participants). We are uncertain if decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with usual care improves other outcomes (i.e. preparation for decision making, decision self‐confidence, feeling uninformed, unclear values, feeling unsupported, decision regret, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
For decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with evidence‐based information only (n = 7 studies), we are uncertain if decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with evidence‐based information only improves any outcomes (i.e. feeling uninformed, unclear values, feeling unsupported, knowledge, anxiety) as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Decision coaching may improve participants’ knowledge when used with evidence‐based information. Our findings do not indicate any significant adverse effects (e.g. decision regret, anxiety) with the use of decision coaching. It is not possible to establish strong conclusions for other outcomes. It is unclear if decision coaching always needs to be paired with evidence‐informed information. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of decision coaching for a broader range of outcomes.

Does decision coaching help people make health choices?

Rationale
Many people face hard health choices. These choices can cause stress and doubt. People may fear harm, feel alone, or lack clear facts. They may not know how to weigh what matters to them.

Decision coaching is one-on-one help from a trained health worker. The coach does not tell you what to choose. The coach helps you get ready to take part in the choice. The coach checks what you know and what you value.

This study asked if coaching helps people feel ready and informed. It also asked if coaching lowers worry or later regret. The team wanted to see if coaching is safe and useful.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. A trial is a study where people join on purpose. In these trials, people got put by chance into groups. This helps make a fair test.

The team looked for trials from the start of each research library to June 2021. They looked at health choices on treatment and tests. Examples include cancer care, genes tests, menopause, mental health, and kidney disease. They planned to include adults and children. But the trials they found had adults only.

The review included 28 trials. In all, 5,509 adults took part. They were age 18 to 85. People got coaching alone, coaching plus facts, facts alone, or usual care. “Facts” means clear information based on good research. “Usual care” means what people normally get.

In these trials, a trained health worker met with each person. The coach used a plan or set steps. The coach gave support in a neutral way. The coach helped the person take part in the choice. Each trial had its own time frame. The review did not give one set time for all.

Results
The team looked at how ready people felt to decide. They looked at knowledge, confidence, values, and support. They also looked at worry and later regret. They checked for signs of harm.

Coaching versus usual care: We do not know if coaching helps more than usual care. The evidence was very uncertain. This includes being ready, feeling confident, knowing the facts, regret, and worry. More good trials are needed.

Coaching versus facts alone: People who had coaching did about the same as those with facts alone. There may be little or no change in knowledge. There may be little or no change in worry. For confidence and feeling informed, we are not sure. The evidence was low or very uncertain.

Coaching plus facts versus usual care: Coaching with facts may help people know more. This means people may better grasp their options. For being ready, confidence, values, support, regret, and worry, we are not sure. The evidence was very uncertain.

Coaching plus facts versus facts alone: We do not know if adding coaching to facts helps. This includes feeling informed, clear on values, or feeling supported. It also includes knowledge and worry. The evidence was very uncertain.

Across all the trials, no clear harm was found. Coaching did not seem to raise regret. It did not seem to raise worry. Still, many results were not clear.

What does this mean for you? Coaching may help when paired with good facts. A coach can help you think through what matters to you. A coach can help you join in the choice. But we still need better proof of most benefits.

What does this mean for health care? Teams should give clear, research-based facts. Adding coaching may boost how well people learn. We do not yet know if coaching helps with all other needs. We also do not know if coaching must always be paired with facts.

What do we still need to learn? We need more strong trials. Trials should test how coaching affects being ready, confidence, and values. Trials should test if people feel more supported. Trials should also test later regret and worry. Trials should include more types of people and choices.

Bottom line: Coaching with good facts may help people know more. We did not see signs of harm. We cannot make strong claims for other results yet. More research is needed to be sure.","Decision coaching for people making healthcare decisions
Background 
There is a need to better involve people who are making healthcare decisions about treatments (e.g. surgery) or screening (e.g. tests to tell if there is a health problem). Quality decisions are made when people know the best available evidence on options and can share what matters with their healthcare provider(s). 
Decision coaching supports people to prepare for making a health decision. It is provided by healthcare providers who are trained or use a protocol for decision coaching (e.g. nurses, doctors, pharmacists, social workers, health support workers such as peer health workers).  
We wanted to find out if decision coaching helps people to prepare for making healthcare decisions. 
 
What did we do? 
We are a team of patient partners, healthcare providers, teachers and researchers from seven countries. 
We looked for studies that tested decision coaching with people (adults and children) to prepare them for making a healthcare decision about treatment or screening for themselves or a family member. 
We included studies if people who received decision coaching were randomly put into study groups (e.g. using a computer to decide who goes in which group). Studies where people are randomly put into groups are the best way to compare findings between groups and give results we can rely on when we look at the effects of an intervention like decision coaching.  
 
Search strategy  
To find studies, we searched eight online data banks. We asked experts and authors of studies about decision coaching. We included studies published up to June 2021.  
 
What we found  
We found 28 studies about decision coaching used alone or with high‐quality patient information based on research (called ‘evidence‐based information’). There was a total of 5509 adults in the 28 studies. None of the studies included children, and only one study included people (parents) making decisions for someone else. The studies tested decision coaching with a range of healthcare decisions such as treatment decisions related to cancer, menopause, or mental illness; cancer screening decisions, and genetic testing.  
Some of the studies looked at decision coaching with, or compared to, disease‐specific information or evidence‐based information such as patient decision aids (booklets, videos, online tools that: make the decision clear, provide options and the pros and cons, and help people be clear on what matters to them). 
 
What does the evidence show? 
People who received decision coaching compared with evidence‐based information only: 
‐ may have little or no change in knowledge (406 patients, 3 studies);
‐ may have little of no change in anxiety (242 patients, 1 study).
 
People who received decision coaching plus evidence‐based information compared with usual care:  
‐may have improved knowledge (1073 patients, 5 studies)
 
Our confidence in the results 
We have low confidence that decision coaching plus evidence‐based information improves people’s knowledge compared to usual care. We have low confidence that decision coaching may have little or no effect on knowledge and anxiety compared to evidence‐based information. We are less confident about our other findings, as the certainty of the evidence is very low and there were important outcomes that were not reported by the included studies. Many studies had a small number of people taking part and this means that the results of this review might change with more studies.   
 
What this means 
Decision coaching may improve peoples’ knowledge to help them prepare to make healthcare decisions when used with evidence‐based information. The review did not detect any adverse effects with the use of decision coaching.

10.1002-14651858.CD012948,"Planned birth at or near term for improving health outcomes for pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes and their infants 
What is the issue? 
The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out if planning an elective birth at or near the term of pregnancy, compared to waiting for labour to start spontaneously, has an impact on the health of women with diabetes and the health of their babies. This review focuses on women who have diabetes before becoming pregnant (pre‐existing diabetes). Elective birth is carried out either by induction of labour or caesarean section, and 'at or near term' means 37 to 40 weeks' gestation. 
To answer this question, we searched for all relevant studies (date of search: 15 August 2017), with the aim of collecting and analysing them together. 
Why is this important? 
When women with diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) become pregnant they are at higher risk of complications than women who do not have diabetes. For example, their babies may be larger and have a higher risk of death in the later weeks of pregnancy. Because of these risks, many clinicians have recommended that women with diabetes have an elective birth (usually by induction) at or near term (37 to 40 weeks' gestation), rather than waiting for labour to start spontaneously or until 41 weeks' gestation if all is well. Induction has the disadvantage of increasing the incidence of forceps or ventouse births, and women often find it difficult to cope with an induced labour. Caesarean section is a major operation which can lead to blood loss, infections and increased chance of problems with subsequence births. Early birth can increase the chance of breathing problems for babies. It is important to know which approach to birth has a better impact on the health outcomes of women with pre‐existing diabetes and their babies. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found no studies that addressed our specific question.
What does this mean? 
In the absence of randomised studies, we are unable to say if women with pre‐existing diabetes and their babies experience better health outcomes if they have a planned birth (by induction of labour or caesarean section at 37 to 40 weeks' gestation) compared to waiting for labour to begin spontaneously or until 41 weeks' gestation if all is well. More research is needed to answer this question.

Planned birth near the due date for women with diabetes: what we know

Rationale
Some women have diabetes before they get pregnant. This is called pre‑existing diabetes. It can be Type 1 or Type 2. These women face higher risks in late pregnancy.

Their babies may grow very large. There is also a higher risk of death late in pregnancy. Because of this, some doctors plan birth before the due date. This plan may happen at week 37 to week 40.

A planned birth can happen in two ways. One is to start labor with drugs or other help. This is called induction. The other is to have birth by surgery. This is a caesarean section, or C‑section.

Each choice has pros and cons. Induction can make birth longer and harder. It can also lead to use of tools, like forceps. A C‑section is major surgery. It can cause blood loss, infection, and pain. Early birth may cause breathing trouble for the baby.

We need to know which plan is safer. We need to know if a planned birth near term helps moms and babies. We also need to know if it is better to wait for labor to start on its own. Some women wait until week 41 if all is well.

Trial Design
This was a careful review of past research. The team looked for all studies on this topic. They searched up to August 15, 2017. They looked at many sources.

The plan was to compare two birth plans. One plan was a set birth at week 37 to week 40. This could be by induction or by C‑section. The other plan was to wait for labor to start on its own.

The review focused on a clear group. It was for pregnant women with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. These women had diabetes before they got pregnant. The review did not limit their age.

The review looked for the best kind of studies. These are studies where people go into groups by chance. This helps make fair and clear results. The goal was to see which birth plan leads to better health.

No patients took part in this review. It used reports from past studies. So, there was no set time in the study for each person. The team only read and judged the past work.

Results
The team did not find any studies that fit the plan. There were no fair trials that tested these two birth plans. So, we do not know which plan is better.

We cannot say if a planned birth near term helps moms more. We cannot say if waiting is safer for babies. We also cannot say if one plan has fewer harms. There is not enough proof.

What we do know is the choice is complex. Women with diabetes face real risks near the due date. Babies can be large. Death late in pregnancy is a real fear. Early birth can cause breathing issues for the baby.

Induction can lead to hard labor and use of tools. A C‑section is major surgery with its own risks. These facts matter when you choose a plan. But this review found no strong trials to guide that choice.

What does this mean for you? We still do not have clear proof to pick one plan. Your care team may still suggest a plan based on your case. They may look at your blood sugar, your baby’s size, and your health. They may also look at your past births and your wishes.

This review shows a gap in research. We need fair trials that test these plans. We need to see health results for moms and babies. We need to track harms and benefits for both.

Until we have that, we cannot say which plan is best. The review team calls for more research. Good trials can help women and doctors make better choices. They can lower fear and guesswork near the due date.

If you have diabetes and are pregnant, ask questions. Ask about the risks and the pros and cons. Ask how each plan fits your health and your baby’s needs. Make a birth plan with your team that feels safe for you.

In short, here is the key point. A planned birth near the due date may help. Waiting for labor may also be fine when all is well. But we do not have strong proof yet. More high‑quality research must be done.","Planned birth at or near term for improving health outcomes for pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes and their infants

10.1002-14651858.CD013498.pub2,"Background
People with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) need treatment with insulin for survival. Whether any particular type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin provides benefit especially regarding risk of diabetes complications and hypoglycaemia is unknown. 
Objectives
To compare the effects of long‐term treatment with (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogues to NPH insulin (neutral protamine Hagedorn) or another (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogue in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We explored the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medical Agency (EMA) web pages. We asked pharmaceutical companies, EMA and investigators for additional data and clinical study reports (CSRs). The date of the last search of all databases was 24 August 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of 24 weeks or more comparing one (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin to NPH insulin or another (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin in people with T1DM. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed risk of bias using the new Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 (RoB 2) tool and extracted data. Our main outcomes were all‐cause mortality, health‐related quality of life (QoL), severe hypoglycaemia, non‐fatal myocardial infarction/stroke (NFMI/NFS), severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia, serious adverse events (SAEs) and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). We used a random‐effects model to perform meta‐analyses and calculated risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and 95% prediction intervals for effect estimates. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence applying the GRADE instrument. 
Main results
We included 26 RCTs. Two studies were unpublished. We obtained CSRs, clinical study synopses or both as well as medical reviews from regulatory agencies on 23 studies which contributed to better analysis of risk of bias and improved data extraction. A total of 8784 participants were randomised: 2428 participants were allocated to NPH insulin, 2889 participants to insulin detemir, 2095 participants to insulin glargine and 1372 participants to insulin degludec. Eight studies contributing 21% of all participants comprised children. The duration of the intervention varied from 24 weeks to 104 weeks. 
Insulin degludec versus NPH insulin: we identified no studies comparing insulin degludec with NPH insulin. 
Insulin detemir versus NPH insulin (9 RCTs): five deaths reported in two studies including adults occurred in the insulin detemir group (Peto OR 4.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 31.38; 9 studies, 3334 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Three studies with 870 participants reported QoL showing no true beneficial or harmful effect for either intervention (low‐certainty evidence). There was a reduction in severe hypoglycaemia in favour of insulin detemir: 171/2019 participants (8.5%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 138/1200 participants (11.5%) in the NPH insulin group experienced severe hypoglycaemia (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.92; 8 studies, 3219 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between 0.34 and 1.39. Only 1/331 participants in the insulin detemir group compared with 0/164 participants in the NPH insulin group experienced a NFMI (1 study, 495 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No study reported NFS. A total of 165/2094 participants (7.9%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 102/1238 participants (8.2%) in the NPH insulin group experienced SAEs (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.21; 9 studies, 3332 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia was observed in 70/1823 participants (3.8%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 60/1102 participants (5.4%) in the NPH insulin group (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.17; 7 studies, 2925 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The MD in HbA1c comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin was 0.01%, 95% CI ‐0.1 to 0.1; 8 studies, 3122 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence. 
Insulin glargine versus NPH insulin (9 RCTs): one adult died in the NPH insulin group (Peto OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.00 to 6.98; 8 studies, 2175 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Four studies with 1013 participants reported QoL showing no true beneficial effect or harmful effect for either intervention (low‐certainty evidence). Severe hypoglycaemia was observed in 122/1191 participants (10.2%) in the insulin glargine group compared with 145/1159 participants (12.5%) in the NPH insulin group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.04; 9 studies, 2350 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). No participant experienced a NFMI and one participant in the NPH insulin group experienced a NFS in the single study reporting this outcome (585 participants; low‐certainty evidence). A total of 109/1131 participants (9.6%) in the insulin glargine group compared with 110/1098 participants (10.0%) in the NPH insulin group experienced SAEs (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.84; 8 studies, 2229 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia was observed in 69/938 participants (7.4%) in the insulin glargine group compared with 83/955 participants (8.7%) in the NPH insulin group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.12; 6 studies, 1893 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The MD in HbA1c comparing insulin glargine with NPH insulin was 0.02%, 95% CI ‐0.1 to 0.1; 9 studies, 2285 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence. 
Insulin detemir versus insulin glargine (2 RCTs),insulin degludec versus insulin detemir (2 RCTs), insulin degludec versus insulin glargine (4 RCTs): there was no evidence of a clinically relevant difference for all main outcomes comparing (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogues with each other. 
For all outcomes none of the comparisons indicated differences in tests of interaction for children versus adults. 
Authors' conclusions
Comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin for T1DM showed lower risk of severe hypoglycaemia in favour of insulin detemir (moderate‐certainty evidence). However, the 95% prediction interval indicated inconsistency in this finding. Both insulin detemir and insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin did not show benefits or harms for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia. For all other main outcomes with overall low risk of bias and comparing insulin analogues with each other, there was no true beneficial or harmful effect for any intervention. Data on patient‐important outcomes such as QoL, macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications were sparse or missing. No clinically relevant differences were found between children and adults. 
","1. Plain Title
Which long-acting insulin works best for people with type 1 diabetes?

2. Rationale
Type 1 diabetes means the body stops making insulin. Insulin lets sugar move from the blood into cells for energy. People with type 1 diabetes need insulin for life.

Some insulin types last longer in the body. These are “long-acting” insulin. NPH is an older long-acting insulin. Newer types are insulin detemir, insulin glargine, and insulin degludec. These may give a steadier level of insulin over the day and night.

Low blood sugar is the most common danger of insulin. A very low blood sugar can cause harm. It can lead to confusion, fainting, and injury. It can also happen at night, while you sleep. The big questions were: Do newer long-acting insulins lower the risk of very low blood sugar? Do they help with long-term blood sugar? Do they change the chance of serious health problems? This study looked for answers to help patients and doctors choose.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. The team searched medical databases and trial lists. They looked on drug agency sites in the U.S. and Europe. They asked drug makers and study teams for more data. The last search was on August 24, 2020.

They included only randomized trials. In these trials, people got one insulin or another by chance. Trials had to last at least 24 weeks. That is about 6 months. Some lasted up to 104 weeks. That is about 2 years.

The trials compared:
- NPH insulin with insulin detemir.
- NPH insulin with insulin glargine.
- Insulin detemir with insulin glargine.
- Insulin degludec with insulin detemir.
- Insulin degludec with insulin glargine.
There were no trials that compared insulin degludec with NPH insulin.

In total, 26 trials enrolled 8784 people with type 1 diabetes. This number included adults and children. Eight trials enrolled children. People used the study insulin for 24 to 104 weeks.

The main results the team looked at were:
- Death from any cause.
- Quality of life, which is how people feel and function day to day.
- Severe low blood sugar. This means you need help from another person.
- Severe low blood sugar at night.
- Heart attack or stroke that did not cause death.
- Serious health problems.
- A1c. This is the average blood sugar over about three months.

4. Results
First, the big picture. Average blood sugar control was about the same with all long-acting insulins. A1c did not change in a meaningful way across groups. Quality of life also looked the same. Only a few trials measured it.

Next, severe low blood sugar. This is where one insulin type might help. When insulin detemir was compared with NPH:
- 171 out of 2019 people on insulin detemir had a severe low blood sugar.
- 138 out of 1200 people on NPH had a severe low blood sugar.
When the trial data were pooled, insulin detemir lowered the chance of a severe low blood sugar. But the size of this drop was not the same in every trial. Results varied across studies.

At night, the difference was not clear. In trials that looked at severe low blood sugar during sleep:
- 70 out of 1823 people on insulin detemir had a severe low while asleep.
- 60 out of 1102 people on NPH had a severe low while asleep.
These numbers do not show a clear win for either insulin.

When insulin glargine was compared with NPH:
- 122 out of 1191 people on insulin glargine had a severe low blood sugar.
- 145 out of 1159 people on NPH had a severe low blood sugar.
This trend favored insulin glargine. But the drop was small and not clear enough to be sure. For severe lows at night, there was again no clear difference.

Heart attacks and strokes were very rare. In the trials that reported them:
- One person on insulin detemir had a heart attack.
- One person on NPH had a stroke in a separate trial.
There were no strong signals that one insulin changed the chance of these events.

Serious health problems were about the same across groups. With insulin detemir versus NPH:
- 165 out of 2094 people on insulin detemir had a serious health problem.
- 102 out of 1238 people on NPH had a serious health problem.
With insulin glargine versus NPH:
- 109 out of 1131 people on insulin glargine had a serious health problem.
- 110 out of 1098 people on NPH had a serious health problem.
These results suggest no clear difference.

Deaths were rare in all trials. In insulin detemir versus NPH trials, five people died in the insulin detemir group. In insulin glargine versus NPH trials, one person died in the NPH group. These numbers are small. We cannot tell if one insulin changes the chance of death.

The newer insulin degludec was compared only with other newer insulins. It was not compared with NPH insulin. When degludec was compared with insulin detemir or insulin glargine, results looked similar for the main outcomes. There was no clear win for one insulin.

Results for children and adults were alike. The team did not find big differences by age.

What does this mean for patients? For people with type 1 diabetes, all long-acting insulins studied gave similar average blood sugar. Insulin detemir lowered severe low blood sugar more than NPH in the pooled data, but results were not the same in every trial. Insulin glargine showed no clear drop in severe lows versus NPH. Severe lows during sleep were similar across groups. Serious health problems, heart events, and deaths were rare and similar. Few trials looked at long-term problems like eye, kidney, or nerve disease. We still need more data on these.

In short, newer long-acting insulins and NPH worked about the same for most goals. Insulin detemir may lower severe low blood sugar compared with NPH. Between the newer insulins, there was no clear best choice based on these trials. More and longer studies are needed, especially for long-term health outcomes that matter to patients.","Do people with type 1 diabetes mellitus benefit from using a different type of insulin as their basal insulin? 
Background 
Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar (glucose) level to become too high. Insulin is a hormone that is released by the pancreas (a small organ behind the stomach) which controls the blood levels of glucose. In people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) the pancreas does not produce any insulin, so the person has to inject insulin to control the glucose levels and keep well. The goal of insulin therapy is to provide insulin that mimics physiologic insulin secretion. Insulin is given by an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) by means of insulin syringes, insulin pens or insulin pumps. In order to control blood glucose levels in periods of fasting, basal or background insulin is needed. Basal insulin can be given by means of daily or twice‐daily injections of an intermediate‐acting or (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin. Basal insulin can be given as intermediate‐acting human neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or as (ultra‐)long‐acting analogue insulin (synthetic insulin). Bolus insulin is taken at mealtime (prandial insulin) to control blood glucose levels following a meal and is given by means of short‐acting or rapid‐acting insulin. The aim for most people with T1DM is to achieve near‐normal blood glucose levels to avoid long‐term complications such as kidney and eye disease and to allow flexibility regarding time, type and amount of food intake. The major unwanted effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) which can be severe. 
We wanted to find out whether one type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin compared with NPH insulin or another type of (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin is better for people with T1DM. The outcomes we were specifically interested in were death, health‐related quality of life, severe (night‐time) hypoglycaemia, serious unwanted events, non‐fatal complications of diabetes (heart attacks, strokes) and levels of glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) which is an indicator of long‐term glucose control. 
What did we look for? 
We searched medical databases and contacted pharmaceutical manufacturers and drug regulatory agencies for studies that:— were randomised controlled trials (medical studies where participants are put randomly into one of the treatment groups);— included people with T1DM;— compared one (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin with another (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin or NPH insulin;— lasted at least 24 weeks. 
What did we find?We found 26 studies including a total of 8780 participants (21% were children). The studies lasted between 24 weeks and two years. They compared:— NPH insulin with insulin detemir (nine studies);— NPH insulin with insulin glargine (nine studies);— Insulin detemir with insulin glargine (two studies);— Insulin degludec with insulin detemir (two studies);— Insulin degludec with insulin glargine (four studies). 
No study compared NPH insulin with insulin degludec.
Key results 
There were no clear differences for all main outcomes comparing (ultra‐)long‐acting insulin analogues with each other. 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reduced with insulin detemir: among 1000 participants using NPH insulin, 115 would experience severe hypoglycaemia; using insulin detemir there would be 36 participants fewer (9 to 55 participants fewer) experiencing severe hypoglycaemia. However, the results were inconsistent, meaning if another study was performed there may not be a clear difference between insulin detemir and NPH insulin. There was no clear difference regarding the risk of severe night‐time hypoglycaemia. There were no clear differences for health‐related quality of life, serious unwanted effects or HbA1c levels. Very few people experienced a heart attack or died, and stroke was not reported. 
There were no clear differences comparing insulin glargine with NPH insulin for all main outcomes. Very few people experienced a heart attack, stroke or died. 
There were also no clear differences for all comparisons between children and adults.
Certainty of the evidence In the comparison of the insulin analogues detemir and glargine with NPH insulin, we are moderately confident about the results for death, severe (night‐time) hypoglycaemia, serious unwanted effects and HbA1c levels. We are uncertain about the effects on heart attacks, stroke and health‐related quality of life, mainly because there were only a few studies which did not last long enough to reliably investigate these outcomes.

10.1002-14651858.CD012080.pub2,"Accuracy of different non‐invasive methods for identifying Helicobacter pylori 
Why is it important to know whether someone has Helicobacter pylori? 
Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) is a type of bacteria which may be present in the stomach of some people. H pylori is believed to cause a number of cancers, including stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, and throat cancer. H pylori is also linked with other diseases including stomach ulcers, heart burn, and a bloated feeling. If H pylori is found in an individual, appropriate treatment can be started. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To compare the accuracy of three different types of test for H pylori. These are: urea breath tests, blood tests (the specific blood test is called serology), and stool tests (in faeces). 
What was studied in this review? 
There are two types of urea breath test which use two different forms of carbon known as 13C and 14C, as well as multiple versions of serology and stool tests. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 101 studies which included 11,003 people who were tested for H pylori. Of these 11,003 participants, 5839 (53.1%) had H pylori infection. All the studies used one of the three tests listed above and compared these test results with the diagnosis given by endoscopic biopsy. Endoscopic biopsy involves obtaining tissue from the stomach using a thin flexible tube introduced through the mouth and testing for the presence of H pylori under the microscope. It is currently the most accurate available test, however it causes physical discomfort to the patient, with associated risks for harm. This is in contrast to the alternative non‐invasive tests in this review which are significantly less uncomfortable and have minimal or no risk of harm, making them desirable alternatives if they can be shown to be as accurate at diagnosing H pylori as endoscopic biopsy. Most of the studies included participants with heart burn or similar problems in the stomach and excluded participants who had previously undergone partial removal of the stomach and those having treatment for H pylori. 
Thirty‐four studies (4242 participants) used serology; 29 studies (2988 participants) used stool antigen test; 34 studies (3139 participants) used urea breath test‐13C; 21 studies (1810 participants) used urea breath test‐14C; and two studies (127 participants) used urea breath test but did not report the type of carbon used. Studies varied in the limit they used before saying a test was positive for H pylori infection and the type of stains used to examine the biopsy material. When we looked at all the data we found that urea breath tests were more accurate than blood and stool tests. The results mean that, on average, if 1000 people are tested, there will be 46 people without H pylori who will be misdiagnosed as having H pylori. Also, there will be 30, 42, 86, and 89 people with H pylori infection for whom the diagnosis of H pylori infection will be missed by urea breath test‐13C, urea breath test‐14C, serology, and stool antigen test, respectively. When we looked at the seven studies which compared urea breath test‐13C and serology, or urea breath test‐13C and stool antigen tests in the same participants, the results were uncertain and we cannot tell which test is more accurate. 
How reliable are the results of the studies? 
Except for one study, all the studies were of poor methodological quality, which makes their results unreliable. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
These results apply to children and adults with suspected H pylori infection, but only in those who have not previously undergone stomach operations and those who have not recently had antibiotics or treatment for H pylori infection. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Urea breath tests, blood tests, and stool tests may be suitable for identifying whether someone has H pylori infection. However, the level of the result of urea breath test, blood test, or stool test which should be used to make a diagnosis of H pylori infection remains unclear. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
We performed a thorough literature search for studies reporting the accuracy of these different tests until 4 March 2016.

Simple tests to find H. pylori germs in the stomach

Rationale
H. pylori is a germ that can live in the stomach. It can lead to sores in the stomach called ulcers. It can also raise the risk of some cancers. Many people with H. pylori have belly pain, heart burn, or feel bloated.

Doctors need to know who has this germ. Then they can treat it with the right drugs. The best way to check is a “scope” test with a tiny sample from the stomach. This test is very good, but it can hurt and has some risk.

There are also simple tests that do not need a scope. These include a breath test, a blood test, and a poop test. This study asked: Which of these simple tests gets the right answer most often? If a simple test works well, more people can get checked and treated.

Trial Design
This was a review of many past studies. The team searched for all the studies on this topic up to March 4, 2016. They found 101 studies. These studies had 11,003 people in total. Of these, 5,839 people had H. pylori.

Each study used one of three types of simple tests. The breath test is called a urea breath test. There are two kinds of this breath test. They use a special form of carbon called 13C or 14C. The blood test is called serology. It looks for signs that the body has seen the germ. The poop test is called a stool antigen test. It looks for parts of the germ in a stool sample.

Each simple test was checked against the scope test with a tissue sample. Doctors call this an endoscopic biopsy. A thin, bendy tube goes through the mouth into the stomach. A small piece of tissue is taken and checked for the germ under a microscope.

Most people in the studies had belly pain, heart burn, or similar stomach issues. The studies did not include people who had part of their stomach removed. They also did not include people on H. pylori treatment. The results apply to both kids and adults with signs of H. pylori. The review did not say how long people stayed in each study.

Results
The review found that breath tests gave the most correct answers overall. Blood and poop tests missed more cases. But the cut-off points used to call a test “positive” were not the same in all studies. The stains used on the tissue sample also differed. These differences can change how well a test seems to work.

To make the results easy to grasp, the team gave a picture based on 1,000 people tested. Here is what they found on average:
- About 46 people who do not have the germ would be told they do have it. This is a false alarm.
- About 30 people who do have the germ would be missed by the 13C breath test.
- About 42 people who do have the germ would be missed by the 14C breath test.
- About 86 people who do have the germ would be missed by the blood test.
- About 89 people who do have the germ would be missed by the stool test.

What does this mean for patients? Breath tests had fewer misses than blood or stool tests. That means more people with the germ would get the right answer. A breath test is also simple and does not need a scope. This can help people avoid pain and risk from a scope test. If a breath test is not easy to get, a blood or stool test may still help some people.

But there are limits. Only seven studies tested the breath test and either the blood test or the stool test in the same people. In those head-to-head checks, the results were not clear. So, we cannot say for sure which simple test is best in every case. Also, almost all studies had weak methods. This lowers how much we can trust the numbers.

The results mainly fit people who have stomach issues and have not had stomach surgery. They also fit people who have not had recent antibiotics or H. pylori treatment. If you had those, these results may not apply to you in the same way.

In short, all three simple tests can help find H. pylori. Of these, the breath test seems the most right overall. Still, the best cut-off level to call a test “positive” is not clear. More good studies are needed to set the right cut-off points. Better studies can also show which test to choose first in clinic care.

This review searched studies up to March 4, 2016. Newer studies may add more facts. Talk with your doctor about which test fits you best. Your symptoms, past care, and local test access all matter. The goal is simple: find the germ fast, treat it well, and help your stomach heal.","Accuracy of different non‐invasive methods for identifying Helicobacter pylori

10.1002-14651858.CD005457.pub4,"Carbetocin for preventing postpartum haemorrhage
In low‐ and middle‐income countries, postpartum haemorrhage is a major cause of maternal deaths and ill health. In high‐income countries, the problems are much less but there is still a small risk of major bleeding problems for women after giving birth. Active management of the third stage of labour, which is generally used to reduce blood loss at birth, consists of giving the mother a drug that helps the uterus to contract, early cord clamping and controlled cord traction to deliver the placenta. Different drugs have been tried and generally either intramuscular oxytocin or intramuscular syntometrine is given. Carbetocin is an oxytocin agonist. Oxytocin agonists are a group of drugs that mimic the oxytocin action, oxytocin being the natural hormone that helps to reduce blood loss at birth. This review includes 11 randomised controlled trials involving 2635 women. The trials compared carbetocin against either oxytocin or syntometrine given after delivery, vaginally or by caesarean section. The comparison between intramuscular carbetocin and oxytocin showed that there was no difference in the risk of heavy bleeding, but that women who received carbetocin were less likely to require other medications to produce uterine contractions following caesarean sections. Comparisons between carbetocin and syntometrine showed that women who received carbetocin had less blood loss compared to women who received syntometrine after vaginal delivery, and were much less likely to experience side effects such as nausea and vomiting. The incidence of hypertension at 30 and 60 minutes post delivery was also significantly lower in women who received carbetocin compared to those who received syntometrine. Five of the 11 studies were known to be supported by a pharmaceutical company.

Carbetocin to help prevent heavy bleeding after birth

2. Rationale
Heavy bleeding after birth is a big health risk. Doctors call it postpartum haemorrhage. It can cause illness and even death. This is a large problem in low and middle income nations. It still happens in rich nations, but less often.

Right after birth, care teams act to cut blood loss. They do three key steps. They give a drug to make the womb squeeze. They clamp the cord. They then use a gentle pull to help the placenta come out.

Two common drugs are oxytocin and syntometrine. These help the womb squeeze. The womb is the uterus, where the baby grew. Carbetocin is a drug like oxytocin. It acts like the body’s own hormone. This squeeze helps stop bleeding.

Why study carbetocin? The goal is to find a drug that works well and is safe. The team asked: Does carbetocin prevent heavy bleeding as well as the other drugs? Does it cause fewer side effects? These side effects can include sick stomach, throwing up, or high blood pressure. A drug with fewer side effects can help new mothers feel better and safer. It can also help care teams give the right care fast.

3. Trial Design
This report is a review of trials. A review looks at many trials to see the full picture. It included 11 trials. In total, 2635 women took part. All of these women had just given birth.

The trials were randomised. That means each woman got her drug by chance. This helps keep the groups fair. The trials compared carbetocin to oxytocin or syntometrine. The drug was given after the baby was born. Births were vaginal or by caesarean section. A caesarean section is also called a C-section.

Some trials gave a shot into a muscle. This is called an intramuscular shot. In some trials, the team checked blood pressure soon after birth. In some, they checked at 30 minutes and 60 minutes. The main thing they watched for was heavy bleeding. They also watched for side effects. These include sick stomach, throwing up, and high blood pressure.

The women in the trials were adults who had just given birth. The trials did not list exact ages. The trials did not give a set time in the study for each woman. The checks took place right after birth, in the short term.

Five of the 11 trials had support from a drug company. It is important to know who pays for research. This can affect how we read the results.

4. Results
What did the trials find? The review found clear points.

First, carbetocin versus oxytocin. Carbetocin did not change the chance of a large bleed. So, for heavy bleeding, both drugs worked about the same. But there was one area where carbetocin helped. After a C-section, women who got carbetocin needed fewer extra drugs. These extra drugs help make the womb squeeze more. Needing fewer drugs can mean less risk and less stress.

Next, carbetocin versus syntometrine. After a vaginal birth, women who got carbetocin lost less blood. They also had fewer side effects. Sick stomach and throwing up were less common. Blood pressure problems were also less common. High blood pressure is also called hypertension. In some trials, the team checked blood pressure at 30 and 60 minutes. At those times, high blood pressure happened less often with carbetocin.

What does this mean for care? Carbetocin worked as well as oxytocin for heavy bleeds. It also cut the need for extra drugs after a C-section. This can help doctors and midwives make quick choices in the birth room.

Carbetocin also had benefits over syntometrine. It led to less blood loss after a vaginal birth. It also led to fewer side effects. Fewer side effects can help new mothers feel better. It can also help them start to bond with their baby. Less nausea and less vomiting can ease that first hour. Lower blood pressure risk adds to safety.

This review also noted who funded the trials. Five of the 11 trials had support from a drug firm. Readers should keep this in mind. Still, the trials were randomised. Randomised trials are a strong way to test drugs.

In short, carbetocin is a useful choice. It acts like the body’s oxytocin. It helps the womb squeeze and can cut blood loss. Versus oxytocin, it was similar for heavy bleeding. After a C-section, it cut the need for extra squeeze drugs. Versus syntometrine, it cut blood loss after a vaginal birth. It also caused less sick stomach, less throwing up, and less high blood pressure soon after birth.

These results can guide birth care teams. They can help set drug choice after birth. This is key in places with high risk of heavy bleed. It also matters in places with fewer staff or supplies. A drug that works well and has fewer side effects can help save lives. It can help new mothers heal and care for their baby.","Carbetocin for preventing postpartum haemorrhage

10.1002-14651858.CD015196.pub2,"The impact of cumulative medications with anticholinergic effects on future adverse clinical outcomes in people with dementia 
Key messages 
Anticholinergic medicines may increase the risk of death in older adults who have dementia.  However, the evidence is low certainty, and we cannot say for certain if the anticholinergic medicines cause death, or if they are simply more likely to be used by people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.  
We cannot draw firm conclusions for the risk that anticholinergic medicines pose to the development of other undesirable clinical outcomes, such as further deterioration of memory and thinking, or behavioural and psychological issues.  More research is needed to establish whether anticholinergic medicines cause unintended problems for older adults who have dementia. 
What are anticholinergic medicines? 
Medicines can be classified by their ability to block the action of a chemical signalling system in the body, called the cholinergic system. Medicines that do this are said to have anticholinergic effects, and therefore, are referred to as anticholinergic medicines. 
What did we want to find out?  
Anticholinergic medicines are commonly used to treat a number of medical conditions that people with dementia frequently experience. Typical examples are medicines used to treat urinary tract infections or episodes of agitation. However, because the cholinergic system in the brain plays an important role in learning, memory, and emotional regulation, there are theoretical reasons to believe that the use of anticholinergic medicines may unintentionally exacerbate psychological problems in this population. In this review, we investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and future occurrence of undesirable clinical outcomes in people with dementia.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the link between anticholinergic medicines and a range of clinical outcomes in people with dementia. We compared and summarised the results of identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes.  
What did we find? 
We found a total of 18 studies, involving 102,684 adults aged 50 years or more, who had issues with memory and thinking. We found that the evidence was highly inconsistent regarding the link between anticholinergic medicines and increased issues with memory and thinking in people with dementia. There were no studies that investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and frequency of behavioural disturbances. Therefore, we could not draw any conclusions about whether anticholinergic medicines cause issues with memory and thinking, or behavioural disturbances in this population. However, we did find there was a more consistent link between anticholinergic medicines and the risk of death. Those who were taking anticholinergic medicines had a 15% higher risk of dying than those who were not taking anticholinergic medicines.   
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The available evidence is very low certainty because of the inconsistency of study results, and the lack of control for health conditions that could be linked with both the clinical outcomes and the prescribing of anticholinergic medicines themselves. It is possible that anticholinergic medicines may not actually cause death, but are simply more likely to be given to people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.   
How up to date is this evidence? 
We searched for studies published up to 29 November 2021.

Do some common drugs raise harm in people with dementia?

Rationale
Dementia harms memory and thinking. It can change mood and behavior. It makes daily life hard. Many older adults live with this disease.

Some drugs can block a body signal that helps the brain. This signal helps with memory, learning, and mood. Doctors call these drugs anticholinergic drugs. People may take them for bladder problems, sleep, stomach issues, or for severe restlessness.

These drugs may help some symptoms. But they may also cloud thinking. They may also affect mood. Some experts worry they may raise the risk of harm.

This study asked a clear question. Do these drugs link with later harm in people with dementia? The team looked for links with worse memory, more behavior issues, and death. They wanted to see if these drugs might raise risk. They also wanted to see how strong the proof is.

This work is needed. Many people with dementia take these drugs. We need to know the risks and the size of those risks. Clear facts can guide safe care.

This was not a new trial. It was a review of past studies. The team looked for studies on these drugs and later health results. They searched for studies up to 29 November 2021.

The review found 18 studies. These studies included 102,684 adults. All were age 50 or older. All had dementia or big problems with memory and thinking. The mix of men and women was not clear in this summary.

The studies looked at people who took these drugs. They then checked what happened later. They looked at memory and thinking. They looked at behavior problems. They looked at death. They compared people who used these drugs to people who did not.

People were in each study for different lengths of time. This review did not add new visits or tests. It did not assign drugs. It only summed up what past studies found.

The team rated how sure they felt about the proof. They looked at how the studies were done. They looked at the size of each study. They also looked at how alike or not alike the results were.

Results
What did this review find? First, the link with memory and thinking was not clear. Some studies showed more decline. Others did not. The results did not match well. So we cannot say if these drugs make memory and thinking worse.

Next, the review found no studies on how often behavior problems occurred. So there is no clear answer for behavior. We cannot say if these drugs raise or lower behavior issues.

Last, there was a more steady link with death. People on these drugs had a higher risk of dying. Think of it like this. For every 100 people not on these drugs who died, about 115 people on these drugs died. This is a small rise, but it was seen more than once. Still, this does not prove the drugs caused death.

Why can we not be sure? The proof was very weak. The studies had mixed results. Many did not fully adjust for other health problems. People who were sicker may have been more likely to get these drugs. Those same people may also be more likely to die. That can make the drugs look risky, even if the drugs were not the cause.

What does this mean for patients and care? The review raises a flag of concern. It suggests a link between these drugs and a higher chance of death. It does not show clear harm for memory or behavior. It does not prove cause. The proof is weak. We are not very sure.

How is this useful now? It helps patients and care teams weigh choices. It shows where the facts are thin. It shows that more and better studies are needed. Future work should track memory, behavior, and death in a clear and fair way. It should also account for other health problems. That will help us tell cause from simple links.

In sum, here is what we know. This review covered 18 studies with over one hundred thousand older adults with dementia. The link with worse memory and thinking is not clear. No studies looked at how often behavior problems occurred. The link with death looked more steady. People on these drugs had a slightly higher chance of dying. But the proof is weak, and we cannot say the drugs were the cause.

Here is what we need next. We need strong, well done studies. These should test if these drugs cause harm in this group. They should also look at which drugs, doses, and times of use matter most. Until then, the main lesson is caution and awareness. This review adds to our knowledge, but it does not close the case.","The impact of cumulative medications with anticholinergic effects on future adverse clinical outcomes in people with dementia 
Key messages 
Anticholinergic medicines may increase the risk of death in older adults who have dementia.  However, the evidence is low certainty, and we cannot say for certain if the anticholinergic medicines cause death, or if they are simply more likely to be used by people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.  
We cannot draw firm conclusions for the risk that anticholinergic medicines pose to the development of other undesirable clinical outcomes, such as further deterioration of memory and thinking, or behavioural and psychological issues.  More research is needed to establish whether anticholinergic medicines cause unintended problems for older adults who have dementia. 
What are anticholinergic medicines? 
Medicines can be classified by their ability to block the action of a chemical signalling system in the body, called the cholinergic system. Medicines that do this are said to have anticholinergic effects, and therefore, are referred to as anticholinergic medicines. 
What did we want to find out?  
Anticholinergic medicines are commonly used to treat a number of medical conditions that people with dementia frequently experience. Typical examples are medicines used to treat urinary tract infections or episodes of agitation. However, because the cholinergic system in the brain plays an important role in learning, memory, and emotional regulation, there are theoretical reasons to believe that the use of anticholinergic medicines may unintentionally exacerbate psychological problems in this population. In this review, we investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and future occurrence of undesirable clinical outcomes in people with dementia.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the link between anticholinergic medicines and a range of clinical outcomes in people with dementia. We compared and summarised the results of identified studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors, such as study methods and sizes.  
What did we find? 
We found a total of 18 studies, involving 102,684 adults aged 50 years or more, who had issues with memory and thinking. We found that the evidence was highly inconsistent regarding the link between anticholinergic medicines and increased issues with memory and thinking in people with dementia. There were no studies that investigated the link between anticholinergic medicines and frequency of behavioural disturbances. Therefore, we could not draw any conclusions about whether anticholinergic medicines cause issues with memory and thinking, or behavioural disturbances in this population. However, we did find there was a more consistent link between anticholinergic medicines and the risk of death. Those who were taking anticholinergic medicines had a 15% higher risk of dying than those who were not taking anticholinergic medicines.   
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The available evidence is very low certainty because of the inconsistency of study results, and the lack of control for health conditions that could be linked with both the clinical outcomes and the prescribing of anticholinergic medicines themselves. It is possible that anticholinergic medicines may not actually cause death, but are simply more likely to be given to people who are already at an increased risk of dying due to ongoing health problems.   
How up to date is this evidence? 
We searched for studies published up to 29 November 2021.

Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are high‐risk skin cancers, which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised, with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a microscopic imaging technique, which magnifies the surface of a skin lesion using near‐infrared light. Used in conjunction with clinical or dermoscopic examination of suspected skin cancer, or both, OCT may offer additional diagnostic information compared to other technologies. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of OCT for the detection of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in adults. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
We included studies of any design evaluating OCT in adults with lesions suspicious for invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, BCC or cSCC, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). Our unit of analysis was lesions. Where possible, we estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. 
Main results
We included five studies with 529 cutaneous lesions (282 malignant lesions) providing nine datasets for OCT, two for visual inspection alone, and two for visual inspection plus dermoscopy. Studies were of moderate to unclear quality, using data‐driven thresholds for test positivity and giving poor accounts of reference standard interpretation and blinding. Studies may not have been representative of populations eligible for OCT in practice, for example due to high disease prevalence in study populations, and may not have reflected how OCT is used in practice, for example by using previously acquired OCT images. 
It was not possible to make summary statements regarding accuracy of detection of melanoma or of cSCC because of the paucity of studies, small sample sizes, and for melanoma differences in the OCT technologies used (high‐definition versus conventional resolution OCT), and differences in the degree of testing performed prior to OCT (i.e. visual inspection alone or visual inspection plus dermoscopy). 
Pooled data from two studies using conventional swept‐source OCT alongside visual inspection and dermoscopy for the detection of BCC estimated the sensitivity of OCT as 95% (95% confidence interval (CI) 91% to 97%) and specificity of 77% (95% CI 69% to 83%). 
When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the mean observed BCC prevalence of 60%, OCT would miss 31 BCCs (91 fewer than would be missed by visual inspection alone and 53 fewer than would be missed by visual inspection plus dermoscopy), and OCT would lead to 93 false‐positive results for BCC (a reduction in unnecessary excisions of 159 compared to using visual inspection alone and of 87 compared to visual inspection plus dermoscopy). 
Authors' conclusions
Insufficient data are available on the use of OCT for the detection of melanoma or cSCC. Initial data suggest conventional OCT may have a role for the diagnosis of BCC in clinically challenging lesions, with our meta‐analysis showing a higher sensitivity and higher specificity when compared to visual inspection plus dermoscopy. However, the small number of studies and varying methodological quality means implications to guide practice cannot currently be drawn. 
Appropriately designed prospective comparative studies are required, given the paucity of data comparing OCT with dermoscopy and other similar diagnostic aids such as reflectance confocal microscopy.

Can a quick light scan help doctors tell which skin spots are cancer?

Rationale
Skin cancer is common. Some types can spread and can cause death. These include melanoma and squamous cell skin cancer. Basal cell skin cancer tends to stay in one place. But it can still harm the skin around it.

Spotting skin cancer early can save lives. But this is hard to do by eye. If doctors miss cancer, care is late. If they remove too many harmless spots, people have pain and scars.

A tool called optical coherence tomography, or OCT, may help. OCT is a fast, safe skin scan. It uses near‑infrared light to make a tiny picture under the skin surface. It does not cut the skin. Doctors can use OCT with a look exam or a hand skin scope called dermoscopy. The hope is that OCT will help doctors tell cancer from harmless spots.

This study asked a simple question. How well does OCT help find skin cancers in adults? The team looked at three kinds of skin cancer: melanoma, basal cell, and squamous cell.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team searched many research lists up to August 2016. They looked for studies that used OCT on adults with a skin spot that might be cancer. They only used studies that checked the final answer with a lab test of tissue (a biopsy), or with follow‑up over time.

Five studies met the rules. These studies looked at 529 skin spots. Two hundred eighty‑two of these were cancer. Some studies also looked at dermoscopy or a look exam alone. The studies took place in clinics that see skin cancer. The reports focused on adults. The reports did not always say more about age groups or gender.

The studies tested OCT tools that were not all the same. Some used a standard scan. Some used a higher detail scan. The team then pulled the data across studies when it made sense to do so.

How long did each person stay in a study? The reports did not say. In most skin scan studies, people take part for the scan and biopsy visit. But this review did not give a clear time.

Results
There were not enough good data to judge OCT for melanoma. There were also not enough data to judge OCT for squamous cell skin cancer. The studies were small. They used different kinds of OCT. Some did a look exam first. Some also used a skin scope first. These gaps make clear answers hard.

For basal cell skin cancer, there were more data. Two studies used a standard OCT scan. In those, doctors also did a look exam and dermoscopy. The team asked a “what if” question. What would happen in a group of 1000 skin spots? In the studies, about 600 out of 1000 spots were basal cell cancers.

With OCT plus the look exam and skin scope, doctors would miss 31 basal cell cancers. That is fewer missed cancers than with a look exam alone. It is also fewer than with the look exam plus a skin scope. With OCT, the number of false alarms also went down. OCT would lead to 93 false alarms that could mean unneeded cuts. That is fewer false alarms than with the other two ways to check.

Said in another way, in this “what if” group:
- OCT would miss 91 fewer basal cell cancers than a look exam alone.
- OCT would miss 53 fewer basal cell cancers than a look exam plus skin scope.
- OCT would cause 159 fewer false alarms than a look exam alone.
- OCT would cause 87 fewer false alarms than a look exam plus skin scope.

These results suggest a benefit for OCT in tough basal cell cases. OCT may help doctors find more real cancers. It may also help avoid some unneeded cuts.

But we must use care with these early results. Only five studies were in the review. Only two fed the main numbers for basal cell cancer. The study groups were small. How the teams ran the studies was not always clear. For example, the reports did not always state who knew which test result, or when. The people in the studies may not match a typical clinic mix. Also, some studies used saved scan images, not scans done in real time in the clinic. These issues can skew results.

What does this mean for you? If you have a skin spot that is hard to judge, OCT may help your care team. It may add helpful detail to a look exam and a skin scope exam. It may reduce unneeded cuts for spots that are not cancer. It may also help find some real cancers that a look exam might miss. But we do not yet know how well it helps for melanoma or for squamous cell cancer. We also need larger, better run studies in real clinic settings.

The investigators concluded this: Early data support OCT for some basal cell cases. Yet there is not enough solid proof to set firm rules for care. We need new studies that compare OCT head‑to‑head with a skin scope and with other skin scan tools. These studies should use clear methods and real‑world clinic use. That will tell us when OCT helps most, and for whom.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging test, for the detection of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are several different types of skin cancer. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms, and it is important that it is recognised early so that it can be removed. If it is not recognised (also known as a false‐negative test result), treatment can be delayed, and this risks the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body, which may lead to eventual death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are usually localised (i.e. limited to a certain part of the body) skin cancers, although cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations and can cause stress and anxiety to the patient. Making the correct diagnosis is important, and mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate optical coherence tomography (OCT) is for diagnosing skin cancer. Researchers in Cochrane included five studies to answer this question. Two studies were concerned with the diagnosis of melanoma and three with the diagnosis of BCC. 
What was studied in the review? 
A number of tools are available to skin cancer specialists which allow a more detailed examination of the skin compared to examination by the naked eye alone. Currently, a dermoscope is used by most skin cancer specialists, which magnifies the skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) using a bright light source. OCT magnifies the surface of a skin lesion to the level of that seen using a microscope using near‐infrared light. It is quick to perform but is more expensive compared to dermoscopy and requires specialist training. Review authors examined how useful OCT is to help diagnose skin cancers when used after visual inspection or visual inspection plus dermoscopy. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included five studies: two studies with 97 participants with 133 skin lesions suspected of being melanoma, and three studies with 305 participants with 396 lesions suspected of being BCC of which one (50 lesions) also analysed cSCCs (nine lesions). 
The studies investigating the accuracy of OCT for diagnosing melanoma were small and too different from each other to allow a reliable estimate of the accuracy of OCT for melanoma to be made. Similarly, only one small, low‐quality study investigated the accuracy of OCT for diagnosing cSCC. 
For identifying BCC, two studies showed the effects of skin specialists using OCT after visual inspection alone, or visual inspection with dermoscopic examination. These two studies indicated that in theory, if OCT were to be used in a group of 1000 people with skin lesions that were particularly difficult to diagnose, of whom 600 (60%) actually had BCC, then: 
‐ an estimated 662 people would have an OCT result confirming that a BCC was present and of these 93 (14%) would not actually have had a BCC (false‐positive result); 
‐ of the 338 people with an OCT result indicating that no BCC was present, 31 (9%) would actually have a BCC (false‐negative result). 
Compared to making a diagnosis of BCC using visual inspection plus dermoscopy, the addition of OCT in this group would reduce the number of false‐positive results by 87 (thus reducing unnecessary surgical procedures) and would miss 53 fewer BCCs. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
In all included studies, the diagnosis of skin cancer was made by lesion biopsy (OCT/dermoscopy positive) (a biopsy involves taking a sample of body cells and examining them under a microscope), and the absence of skin cancer was confirmed by biopsy (OCT/dermoscopy negative)*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer. However, the small number of studies included in this review, and variability between them, reduced the reliability of findings. Included studies also had important limitations, in particular study participants were from more restricted groups than would be eligible for an OCT scan in practice (e.g. all studies included people with skin lesions that had already been selected for surgical removal), while the way in which OCT was used may not reflect real‐life situations. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in Europe and the US only. Average age (reported in only two studies) was 46 years for melanoma and 63 years for BCC. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma was 23% and 27% (in two studies), ranged from 58% to 61% for BCC (three studies), and was 18% for cSCC (one study). For the diagnosis of BCC, the results apply to people with 'pink' and non‐pigmented skin lesions that the clinician considers particularly difficult to diagnose by the naked eye alone. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Not enough research has been done on using OCT in detecting skin cancers. The results of this review suggest that OCT might help to diagnose BCC when it is difficult to distinguish it from benign skin lesions, but it is not yet clear whether it can adequately distinguish between BCC, cSCC, and melanoma skin cancers. More studies are needed comparing OCT to dermoscopy and to other microscopic techniques (such as reflectance confocal microscopy) in well‐described groups of people with suspicious skin lesions. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the standard comparisons.

10.1002-14651858.CD013720.pub3,"Background
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X‐linked recessive disorder characterised by progressive muscle weakness beginning in early childhood. Respiratory failure and weak cough develop in all patients as a consequence of muscle weakness leading to a risk of atelectasis, pneumonia, or the need for ventilatory support. There is no curative treatment for DMD. Corticosteroids are the only pharmacological intervention proven to delay the onset and progression of muscle weakness and thus respiratory decline in DMD. Antioxidant treatment has been proposed to try to reduce muscle weakness in general, and respiratory decline in particular.  
Objectives
To assess the effects of antioxidant agents on preventing respiratory decline in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy during the respiratory decline phase of the condition.  
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers to 23 March 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We included male patients with a diagnosis of DMD who had respiratory decline evidenced by a forced vital capacity (FVC%) less than 80% but greater than 30% of predicted values, receiving any antioxidant agent compared with other therapies for the management of DMD or placebo.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened studies for eligibility, assessed risk of bias of studies, and extracted data. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. The primary outcomes were FVC and hospitalisation due to respiratory infections. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, adverse events, change in muscle function, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow (PEF).  
Main results
We included one study with 66 participants who were not co‐treated with corticosteroids, which was the only study to contribute data to our main analysis. We also included a study that enrolled 255 participants treated with corticosteroids, which was only available as a press release without numerical results. The studies were parallel‐group RCTs that assessed the effect of idebenone on respiratory function compared to placebo. The trial that contributed numerical data included patients with a mean (standard deviation) age of 14.3 (2.7) years at the time of inclusion, with a documented diagnosis of DMD or severe dystrophinopathy with clinical features consistent with typical DMD. The overall risk of bias across most outcomes was similar and judged as 'low'.  
Idebenone may result in a slightly less of a decline in FVC from baseline to one year compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 3.28%, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.41 to 6.97; 64 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and probably has little or no effect on change in quality of life (MD −3.80, 95% CI −10.09 to 2.49; 63 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), range 0 to 100, 0 = worst, 100 = best quality of life). As a related but secondary outcome, idebenone may result in less of a decline from baseline in FEV1 (MD 8.28%, 95% CI 0.89 to 15.67; 53 participants) and PEF (MD 6.27%, 95% CI 0.61 to 11.93; 1 trial, 64 participants) compared to placebo. 
Idebenone was associated with fewer serious adverse events (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.04; 66 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and little to no difference in non‐serious adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; 66 participants; low‐certainty evidence) compared to placebo. Idebenone may result in little to no difference in change in arm muscle function (MD −2.45 N, 95% CI −8.60 to 3.70 for elbow flexors and MD −1.06 N, 95% CI −6.77 to 4.65 for elbow extensors; both 52 participants) compared to placebo. We found no studies evaluating the outcome hospitalisation due to respiratory infection.  
The second trial, involving 255 participants, for which data were available only as a press release without numerical data, was prematurely discontinued due to futility after an interim efficacy analysis based on FVC. There were no safety concerns. 
The certainty of the evidence was low for most outcomes due to imprecision and publication bias (the lack of a full report of the larger trial, which was prematurely terminated). 
Authors' conclusions
Idebenone is the only antioxidant agent tested in RCTs for preventing respiratory decline in people with DMD for which evidence was available for assessment. Idebenone may result in slightly less of a decline in FVC and less of a decline in FEV1 and PEF, but probably has little to no measurable effect on change in quality of life. Idebenone is associated with fewer serious adverse events than placebo. Idebenone may result in little to no difference in change in muscle function. 
Discontinuation due to the futility of the SIDEROS trial and its expanded access programmes may indicate that idebenone research in this condition is no longer needed, but we await the trial data. Further research is needed to establish the effect of different antioxidant agents on preventing respiratory decline in people with DMD during the respiratory decline phase of the condition.

Do antioxidants, like idebenone, help slow breathing decline in Duchenne muscular dystrophy?

Rationale
Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, is a muscle disease that starts in young boys. It makes muscles weak over time. As boys grow, the breathing muscles also get weak. This can lead to chest infections and trouble clearing mucus. Some boys may need help to breathe.

There is no cure for DMD. Steroid drugs can slow muscle loss for a time. But many families still face worry about breathing decline. Antioxidants are a type of medicine. They aim to protect cells from damage caused by daily wear and tear inside the body. Because breathing muscles get weaker in DMD, doctors hoped antioxidants might help protect these muscles. One antioxidant, called idebenone, has been tested in boys with DMD.

This study looked at whether antioxidants can slow breathing decline in DMD. The main idea was that antioxidants might help boys keep their lung function longer. If true, this could mean fewer infections and more time without breathing support.

Trial Design
This research was a review of clinical trials. The team searched medical databases through late March 2021. They looked for trials where boys or young men with DMD took an antioxidant or a dummy pill. They focused on boys whose breathing was already getting worse. In these boys, a standard lung test had dropped below normal but was not very low yet.

The main trials they found tested idebenone. The trials compared idebenone to a dummy pill. All patients had a clear diagnosis of DMD. Most were teens. In the trial that gave full results, boys were about 14 years old on average. Those boys were not on steroids during that trial. Another, larger trial enrolled boys who were on steroids. But that larger trial did not share numbers in a full report.

In the trial with full results, boys took the study drug for about one year. The main goal was to see if change in a lung test slowed. The review also looked at other breathing tests, side effects, and how boys felt and functioned in daily life.

Results
What did the breathing tests show?
Idebenone may have slowed the drop in a key lung test a small amount over one year. Doctors call this test FVC. It measures how much air you can blow out after a deep breath. The benefit seen was small. We cannot be sure if boys felt a clear difference from this alone.

Two other breathing tests also dropped a little less in boys who took idebenone. These tests measure how fast you can blow air out. Doctors call them FEV1 and PEF. These are also signs of breathing muscle strength. Again, the size of change was small.

What about how boys felt day to day?
The study measured quality of life using a standard survey for children. Idebenone likely made little or no difference in how boys rated their daily life after one year. Arm muscle strength also did not change in a clear way with idebenone.

What about safety?
Side effects were similar between idebenone and the dummy pill for most events. Serious side effects were less common with idebenone in the trial that gave full data. No new safety concerns were found.

What about hospital stays for chest infections?
The review found no trials that reported on this outcome. So we do not know if idebenone affects hospital stays for infections.

What about boys who take steroids?
One larger trial enrolled many boys who were on steroids. The sponsor stopped that trial early. An interim check showed idebenone did not help enough on the main breathing test at that point. The company did not share full numbers. The review reports no safety issues from that trial.

How sure are we?
The evidence is limited. Only one trial with full numbers had a modest size. The larger trial stopped early and shared no detailed data. Because of this, we are only a little sure about the results. The small changes seen in breathing tests may not lead to clear health gains that families can feel. Results could change when full data from the larger trial become public.

What does this mean for patients and families?
- Idebenone may slow breathing decline a small amount on some tests.
- The change may be too small to feel in daily life.
- We do not know if it reduces chest infections or hospital stays.
- Side effects appear similar to a dummy pill, with no new safety issues.
- In boys on steroids, a larger trial did not show enough benefit and stopped early.

What is next?
This review found idebenone is the only antioxidant with tested trials in DMD for breathing decline. Based on current data, idebenone does not show a clear, meaningful benefit. More research on other antioxidants may help. New trials should focus on outcomes that matter to families, like fewer infections, fewer hospital stays, and keeping breathing support away for longer. Until then, steroids remain the main drug that can slow muscle decline in DMD. Families should also keep up with proven breathing care, like cough support and regular lung checks, as advised by their care team.

Investigator conclusion
Idebenone may make a small difference in some breathing tests, but not in daily life scores. It seems as safe as a dummy pill. The larger stopped trial suggests idebenone may not help enough. More research on other antioxidants is needed to find out if any can better protect breathing in boys and young men with DMD.","Antioxidants to prevent respiratory decline in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Review question 
What are the effects (benefits and harms) of antioxidants for preventing breathing problems becoming worse in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)? 
Background 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited condition where boys show signs of muscle weakness in early childhood that become worse over time. The muscles used in breathing become involved, which leads to shortness of breath and the need for artificial ventilation (a machine to support breathing). Treatment with antioxidants has been proposed to slow down the loss of muscle strength and the decline in breathing. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the evidence up to 23 March 2021. We included two studies in boys with DMD whose breathing was affected. Both studies compared the antioxidant medicine idebenone with a dummy medicine. One study included 66 participants between 10 and 18 years of age. The participants in this study were not receiving corticosteroids (medicines shown to be beneficial in DMD). The other study involved 255 children with DMD who were also taking corticosteroids. This study was stopped early for lack of benefit. The full results of the study are not yet available. 
Study funding sources 
The studies were sponsored by Santhera Pharmaceuticals, the maker of idebenone.
Key results 
Idebenone may result in slightly less of a decline in forced vital capacity (a measure of lung capacity), but probably has little or no effect on quality of life in patients with worsening breathing. Idebenone may result in less of a decline in the ability to force air out of the lungs and airways (based on tests of forced expiratory volume in the first second and peak expiratory flow). Idebenone was associated with fewer serious side effects than the dummy drug and has little or no effect on non‐serious side effects. Idebenone may have little or no effect on muscle function (arm strength). We found no studies that looked at hospitalisation due to respiratory infection. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the evidence was low.

We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid Sp), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 7 January 2021. Two review authors independently screened the title and abstract of the hits, and two review authors assessed the full text of studies that got through this screening. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐arm trials comparing the effects of antipsychotics and placebo for the treatment of agitation or psychosis in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, or both, irrespective of age, severity of cognitive impairment, and setting. (The majority of) participants had to have clinically significant agitation (including aggression) or psychosis or both at baseline. We excluded studies about antipsychotics that are no longer available in the USA or EU, or that are used for emergency short‐term sedation. We also excluded head‐to‐head trials and antipsychotic withdrawal trials. 
Data collection and analysis
The primary outcomes were (1) reduction in agitation or psychosis in participants with agitation or psychosis, respectively at baseline, and (2) the number of participants with adverse events: somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, any adverse event, any serious adverse event (SAE), and death. 
Two review authors independently extracted the necessary data and assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated the pooled effect on agitation and psychosis for typical and atypical antipsychotics separately, and the pooled risk of adverse effects independent of the target symptom (agitation or psychosis). We used RevMan Web for the analyses. 
Main results
The search yielded 8233 separate hits. After assessing the full‐text of 35 studies, we included 24 trials that met the eligibility criteria. Six trials tested a typical antipsychotic, four for agitation and two for psychosis. Twenty trials tested an atypical antipsychotic, eight for agitation and 12 for psychosis. Two trials tested both drug types. Seventeen of 26 comparisons were performed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease specifically. The other nine comparisons also included patients with vascular dementia or mixed dementia. Together, the studies included 6090 participants (12 to 652 per study). The trials were performed in institutionalised, hospitalised and community‐dwelling patients, or a combination of those. 
For typical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, thiothixene), we are uncertain whether these drugs improve agitation compared with placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.57 to ‐0.15, 4 studies, n = 361); very low‐certainty evidence, but typical antipsychotics may improve psychosis slightly (SMD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.55 to ‐0.03, 2studies, n= 240; low‐certainty evidence) compared with placebo. These drugs probably increase the risk of somnolence (risk ratio (RR) 2.62, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.56, 3 studies, n = 466; moderate‐certainty evidence) and increase extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.23, 3 studies, n = 467; high‐certainty) evidence. There was no evidence regarding the risk of any adverse event. The risks of SAEs (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.66, 1 study, n = 193) and death (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.00, 6 studies, n = 578) may be increased slightly, but these estimates were very imprecise, and the certainty was low. The effect estimates for haloperidol from five trials were in line with those of the drug class. 
Atypical antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) probably reduce agitation slightly (SMD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.30 to ‐0.12, 7 studies, n = 1971; moderate‐certainty evidence), but probably have a negligible effect on psychosis (SMD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.18 to ‐0.03, 12 studies, n = 3364; moderate‐certainty evidence). These drugs increase the risk of somnolence (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.39, 13 studies, n ‐ 3878; high‐certainty evidence) and are probably also associated with slightly increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.68, 15 studies, n = 4180; moderate‐certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.61, 15 studies, n= 4316; moderate‐certainty evidence) and death (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.05, 17 studies, n= 5032; moderate‐certainty evidence), although the latter estimate was imprecise. The drugs probably have a negligible effect on the risk of any adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09, 11 studies, n = 2785; moderate‐certainty evidence). The findings from seven trials for risperidone were in line with those for the drug class. 
Authors' conclusions
There is some evidence that typical antipsychotics might decrease agitation and psychosis slightly in patients with dementia. Atypical antipsychotics reduce agitation in dementia slightly, but their effect on psychosis in dementia is negligible. The apparent effectiveness of the drugs seen in daily practice may be explained by a favourable natural course of the symptoms, as observed in the placebo groups. Both drug classes increase the risk of somnolence and other adverse events. If antipsychotics are considered for sedation in patients with severe and dangerous symptoms, this should be discussed openly with the patient and legal representative. 
","1. Plain Title
Do drugs for severe behavior in dementia help or harm?

2. Rationale
Dementia harms how the brain works. It can cause memory loss and mood change. Some people feel very upset or act out. This is called agitation. Some may see or hear things that are not there. Or they may have strong false beliefs. This is called psychosis.

Doctors often use antipsychotic drugs for these hard signs. These drugs can calm and sedate. But they may also cause harm. Harms can include heavy sleep, stiff or shaky moves, or other health problems. So we must ask if the good is worth the harm.

This study asked two clear things. Do these drugs help with agitation or psychosis in dementia? And how safe are they? The team also asked if one type of drug works or harms more than the other.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. In each trial, people got a drug or a placebo. A placebo is a look‑alike pill with no drug. People were picked by chance for each group. This is a “random” trial. The groups ran at the same time.

The trials were for people with Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. Most had bad enough agitation, psychosis, or both when they joined. People lived at home, in a care home, or in a hospital. The abstract did not list ages or sex in detail.

There were two kinds of antipsychotic drugs. Typical drugs are older, like haloperidol and thiothixene. Atypical drugs are newer, like risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, and quetiapine. The review found 24 trials with 6090 people. Some trials looked at agitation. Some looked at psychosis. The time in each trial was not clear in this abstract.

4. Results
What did the review find for typical (older) drugs? For agitation, the team is not sure if these drugs help. The data are weak. For psychosis, they may help a little. We are not very sure.

These drugs raised the chance of sleep that is too heavy. They also raised the chance of move side effects. This can mean stiff, slow, or shaky moves. We are very sure about the move harms. We are fairly sure about the sleep harms. The chance of bad health events or death may be a bit higher. But the data here were not clear.

What did the review find for atypical (newer) drugs? They seemed to calm agitation a little. We are fairly sure about this small help. For psychosis, the effect was tiny. It may not matter much. We are fairly sure about this, too.

These newer drugs raised the chance of heavy sleep. We are very sure about this harm. They also likely raised the chance of move side effects a bit. They also likely raised the chance of serious health harms. The chance of death may be a bit higher. But this last point was not clear. The data could not rule out no change.

How big was the help? In both drug types, the help was small. The change in scores was not large. Many people on placebo also got better over time. This may be due to the signs easing on their own. So the drugs may look like they work more than they do.

What does this mean for people and care teams? These drugs may calm some hard signs a little. But they also bring real harms. These include sleep that is too deep and move side effects. For newer drugs, serious health harms were also a bit more common. The chance of death may be a bit higher, but we are not sure.

The care team should weigh small help against real risks. If the signs are very hard and unsafe, drugs may be one choice. If used to sedate for danger, talk about this in a clear way. This talk should include the person and their legal proxy. It should cover the small help, the known harms, and other care options.

In short, here is the key point. Typical drugs might help psychosis a little. We are not sure they calm agitation. Newer drugs likely calm agitation a little. They likely do not help psychosis much. Both types raise the risk of harms. Some of these harms are serious. Care teams should use these drugs with great care.","Do antipsychotic medicines reduce  agitated behaviour and psychotic symptoms in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia? 
 
Key messages 
It is uncertain whether older, first‐generation or ‘typical’ antipsychotic medicines such as haloperidol have an effect on agitated behaviour (for example, restlessness and aggression); the effect is moderate at best. Typical antipsychotic medicines may decrease delusions and hallucinations slightly in people with dementia.  
Newer, second‐generation ‘atypical’ antipsychotic medicines, such as risperidone, probably reduce agitated behaviour slightly. Atypical antipsychotic medicines probably have no effect on psychotic symptoms.  
Both first‐ and second‐generation antipsychotic medicines increase the risk of drowsiness and other unwanted events. When patients’ symptoms improve after antipsychotics have been prescribed, this is probably largely due to natural improvement in symptoms over time. 
What are antipsychotic medicines? 
Antipsychotics are medicines prescribed to treat psychotic symptoms and severely disturbed behaviour in some mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and severe depression. Psychotic symptoms are delusions (very strongly held beliefs in something which is not true) and hallucinations (sensing – usually seeing or hearing ‐ things which are not really there). 
Antipsychotic medicines are often divided into two groups:
1. first‐generation (older) or ‘typical’ antipsychotics, for example haloperidol;
2. second‐generation (newer) or ‘atypical’ antipsychotics, for example risperidone.
Both types can cause unwanted effects, such as drowsiness, movement disorders (for example, involuntary or uncontrollable movements, tremors, muscle contractions) and weight gain. 
Why do people with dementia need antipsychotics? 
People with dementia quite often experience hallucinations and delusions during their illness for some time. Particularly in the later stages of the illness, they may also show agitated behaviours such as restlessness, shouting out or aggression towards others. It is important to try to understand what is driving these behaviours and there are many ways to manage them which do not involve drugs. However, antipsychotic medicines have often been prescribed to people with dementia for these problems. In many countries, they are prescribed less often than in the past but are still used when the symptoms are severe. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know how well antipsychotic medicines reduce the severity of agitation and psychotic symptoms in people with the two commonest types of dementia, namely dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. We also wanted to know how many people experienced unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated antipsychotic medicines currently available in the USA or European Union by comparing them with placebo (a ’dummy’ pill), for treatment of persistent agitation or psychotic symptoms. People in the studies had to have Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. They could be any age and reside in a care home, a hospital, or the community. Most of the people in the studies had to be experiencing agitation (including aggression) or psychotic symptoms, or both, at the start of the study. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 24 studies with a total of 6090 people:
‐ six studies tested typical antipsychotics, mostly haloperidol; 
‐ 20 studies tested atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole; and  
‐ two studies tested both typical and atypical antipsychotics.
All the studies compared antipsychotics with placebo. The people were living in institutions, hospitals, the community, or a combination of these settings. 
Main results 
Typical antipsychotics (haloperidol, thiothixene) compared with placebo:
‐ may improve symptoms of psychosis slightly (2 studies, 240 people), but we are uncertain about their effect on agitation (4 studies, 361 people);  
‐ probably increase the risk of drowsiness (3 studies, 466 people), and movement disorders (3 studies, 467 people);  
‐ may slightly increase the risk of serious unwanted effects (1 study, 193 people) and of death (6 studies, 578 people).  
There was no evidence about the risk of non‐serious and serious unwanted effects combined.
Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) compared with placebo: 
‐ probably slightly reduce agitation (7 studies, 1971 people) and may slightly reduce aggression (1 study, 301 people), but probably make no important difference to symptoms of psychosis (12 studies, 3364 people); 
‐ increase the risk of drowsiness (13 studies, 2878 people) and probably slightly increase movement disorders (15 studies, 4180 people); 
‐ probably slightly increase the risk of experiencing any non‐serious or serious unwanted effect combined, the risk of serious unwanted effects, and the risk of death (17 studies, 5032 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Overall, our confidence in the evidence about typical antipsychotics is limited and our confidence in the evidence about atypical antipsychotics moderate. Typical antipsychotics have been investigated in just a few studies. In addition, the studies about typical and atypical antipsychotics did not always use the best methods to carry out their investigations, or did not report the results. Consequently, the effects on agitation or psychosis may have been overestimated, and the effects on adverse events underestimated. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 7 January 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013826.pub2,"Background
Aerosols and spatter are generated in a dental clinic during aerosol‐generating procedures (AGPs) that use high‐speed hand pieces. Dental healthcare providers can be at increased risk of transmission of diseases such as tuberculosis, measles and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) through droplets on mucosae, inhalation of aerosols or through fomites on mucosae, which harbour micro‐organisms. There are ways to mitigate and contain spatter and aerosols that may, in turn, reduce any risk of disease transmission. In addition to personal protective equipment (PPE) and aerosol‐reducing devices such as high‐volume suction, it has been hypothesised that the use of mouth rinse by patients before dental procedures could reduce the microbial load of aerosols that are generated during dental AGPs. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of preprocedural mouth rinses used in dental clinics to minimise incidence of infection in dental healthcare providers and reduce or neutralise contamination in aerosols. 
Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 4 February 2022. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials and excluded laboratory‐based studies. Study participants were dental patients undergoing AGPs. Studies compared any preprocedural mouth rinse used to reduce contaminated aerosols versus placebo, no mouth rinse or another mouth rinse. Our primary outcome was incidence of infection of dental healthcare providers and secondary outcomes were reduction in the level of contamination of the dental operatory environment, cost, change in mouth microbiota, adverse events, and acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened search results, extracted data from included studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and judged the certainty of the available evidence. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect estimate for continuous outcomes, and random‐effects meta‐analysis to combine data  
Main results
 We included 17 studies with 830 participants aged 18 to 70 years. We judged three trials at high risk of bias, two at low risk and 12 at unclear risk of bias.  
None of the studies measured our primary outcome of the incidence of infection in dental healthcare providers.  
The primary outcome in the studies was reduction in the level of bacterial contamination measured in colony‐forming units (CFUs) at distances of less than 2 m (intended to capture larger droplets) and 2 m or more (to capture droplet nuclei from aerosols arising from the participant's oral cavity). It is unclear what size of CFU reduction represents a clinically significant amount. 
There is low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence that chlorhexidine (CHX) may reduce bacterial contamination, as measured by CFUs, compared with no rinsing or rinsing with water. There were similar results when comparing cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) with no rinsing and when comparing CPC, essential oils/herbal mouthwashes or boric acid with water. There is very low‐certainty evidence that tempered mouth rinses may provide a greater reduction in CFUs than cold mouth rinses. There is low‐certainty evidence that CHX may reduce CFUs more than essential oils/herbal mouthwashes. The evidence for other head‐to‐head comparisons was limited and inconsistent.  
The studies did not provide any information on costs, change in micro‐organisms in the patient's mouth or adverse events such as temporary discolouration, altered taste, allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. The studies did not assess acceptability of the intervention to patients or feasibility of implementation for dentists.  
Authors' conclusions
None of the included studies measured the incidence of infection among dental healthcare providers. The studies measured only reduction in level of bacterial contamination in aerosols. None of the studies evaluated viral or fungal contamination. We have only low to very low certainty for all findings. We are unable to draw conclusions regarding whether there is a role for preprocedural mouth rinses in reducing infection risk or the possible superiority of one preprocedural rinse over another. Studies are needed that measure the effect of rinses on infectious disease risk among dental healthcare providers and on contaminated aerosols at larger distances with standardised outcome measurement.

Do rinses before dental work cut germs in the air?

Rationale
Dental drills and polishers make a fine spray. This spray has tiny drops and mist. We call this spray aerosols and spatter. They can carry germs from the mouth.

These germs can land on eyes, nose, and skin. Staff can breathe them in. This can spread disease, like measles or TB. It may also spread severe lung illness, like SARS.

Dental teams use masks, face shields, and high suction. These steps help a lot. A simple rinse before care may also help. The idea is to lower mouth germs before the drill starts.

If fewer germs leave the mouth, the air may be cleaner. Less spray with germs may mean less risk to staff. Rinse is cheap and fast. Many clinics already use it.

This review asked a clear question. Do rinses before dental work cut germs in the air? Do they lower real infections in staff? Which rinse works best?

Trial Design
This was a review of trials. It used strong and clear methods. The team searched many sources. They looked for trials that used chance to place people in groups.

The trials took place in dental clinics. All people were 18 to 70 years old. They had dental care that makes spray. This is called an aerosol-generating procedure.

People rinsed just before care. They used a study rinse, water, or no rinse. Some used one rinse and others used a different one. The groups used the same dental tools after that.

The main goal was to see if staff got sick less often. Trials could also count germs in the air or nearby. They looked at costs and side effects too. They could check if patients liked the rinse.

The review found 17 trials. In all, 830 people took part. The trials came from many places. The abstract did not state how long each person was in a trial.

The trials counted germs in the spray and on nearby areas. They used plates that catch germs. Germ spots grew on the plates. Each spot shows live germs grew there.

The trials counted germ spots at two places. One was under 2 meters from the mouth. The other was 2 meters or more away. These counts do not equal real illness risk.

Results
No trial measured the main goal. None tracked real infections in dental staff. The trials only counted germs in spray and spatter. They did not test viruses or fungi.

What did the germ counts show? Some rinses may help cut germ counts. A rinse called chlorhexidine, or CHX, may help. It seemed better than water or no rinse.

A rinse called cetylpyridinium chloride, or CPC, may also help. It seemed better than no rinse. Rinses with plant oils or herbs, and boric acid, also looked better than water. Warmed rinses may work better than cold ones.

CHX may beat some plant oil or herb rinses. But the size of the drop in germ counts is not clear. We do not know how much of a drop matters in real life. We cannot link a count drop to fewer sick staff.

The proof is weak. The review rated most results as low to very low certainty. This means we have little trust in the size or truth of the effect. The real effect may be very different.

The trials had other gaps. They did not report costs. They did not report side effects. Side effects can include tooth stain, taste change, rash, or mouth burn. They did not report if patients liked the rinses.

The trials did not track changes in the normal mouth germs. They did not test for viruses or fungi in spray. They did not use the same ways to count germs. They did not agree on what distance to test.

What does this mean for care now? A quick rinse before care might lower germ counts near the mouth. CHX or CPC may help more than water or no rinse. But we do not know if this keeps staff from getting sick.

We need better trials. New trials should track staff illness over time. They should check spray at far and near spots. They should use the same test steps and clear goals.

They should also report harms, costs, and patient views. This will show if rinse is safe, liked, and worth the time. It will also show if one rinse is best. Then clinics can choose with more confidence.

In short, a rinse may help lower germ counts. But we lack proof it lowers real risk. More and better research is needed. For now, clinics should keep all core safety steps in place.","Does use of mouth rinse before a dental procedure reduce the risk of infection transmission from patient to health professional? 
Why is this question important? 
Many dental procedures generate droplets that settle on a surface quickly. If high‐speed instruments, such as a drill, are used, aerosols are generated, which consist of tiny particles that remain suspended in the air and that can be inhaled or that settle farther away on surfaces. These aerosols contain a variety of micro‐organisms and may transmit infections either through direct contact or indirectly through the contaminated surfaces. To prevent the spread of infection, it may help to reduce the number of micro‐organisms that are present in these aerosols. The use of mouth rinses before a dental procedure ('preprocedural mouth rinse') has been suggested as a possible way to reduce the amount of contamination of these aerosols. Chlorhexidine, povidone iodine and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) are some of the commonly used mouth rinses. They act by killing or inactivating the micro‐organisms in the mouth and thereby reducing the level of contamination in the aerosol that is generated. We wanted to find out whether rinsing the mouth before a dental procedure reduces the contamination of aerosols produced during dental procedures in practice and helps prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
We searched for all relevant studies that compared mouth rinses used before dental procedures against placebo (fake treatment), no intervention or another mouth rinse considered to be inactive. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed our confidence in the evidence. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find? 
We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies used chlorhexidine, CPC, essential oil/herbal mouth rinses, povidone iodine and boric acid in comparison to no rinsing, or rinsing with water, saline (salt water) or another mouth rinse. None of the studies measured the how often dental healthcare providers became infected with micro‐organisms. All the included studies measured the level of bacterial contamination in droplets or aerosols in the dental clinic. They did not examine contamination with viruses or fungi.  
Most rinses decreased bacterial contamination in aerosols to some extent, but there was considerable variation in the effects and we do not know what size of reduction is necessary to reduce infection risk.  
The studies did not provide any information on costs, change in micro‐organisms in the patient's mouth or side effects such as temporary discolouration, altered taste, allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. The studies did not assess whether patients were happy to use a mouth rinse or whether it was easy for dentists to implement.  
Overall, the results suggest that using a preprocedural mouth rinse may reduce the level of bacterial contamination in aerosols compared with no rinsing or rinsing with water, but we have only low or very low certainty that the evidence is reliable and we do not know how this reduction in contamination relates to the risk of infection. 
What does this mean? 
We have very little confidence in the evidence, and further studies may change the findings of our review. No studies measured infection risk or investigated viral or fungal contamination.

10.1002-14651858.CD009058.pub3,"Cryotherapy for liver metastases
Review question 
Is cryotherapy (cooling) beneficial or harmful for local destruction of cancer (tumours) spread to the liver? 
Background 
When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancer affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die from complications. Cryotherapy is one of methods, used to destroy metastases in the liver. This method requires placing a special probe near the cancer site. The probe is used to deliver extreme cold to the site, which is produced by liquid nitrogen or argon gas. Placement of the probe can be guided using ultrasound or computed tomography (a special x‐ray). The rapid freezing process kills the cancer cells, and the size of the cancer is reduced. However, it is not clear if this treatment prolongs life or increases quality of life of affected people. 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of cryotherapy in destroying cancer metastases in the liver. We searched for studies assessing the effect of cryotherapy in comparison with no treatment or any other treatment in people with liver metastases from cancer of any location. We aimed to assess the effect of cryotherapy on the risk of death, quality of life, and adverse events (side effects caused by the treatment). 
Study characteristics 
We last searched for evidence in June 2018. We included only one trial conducted in Ukraine, and participants' primary cancer was colorectal (bowel) cancer in 66% of instances, but there were also people with stomach, breast, skin, and other tumours. All of them had cancer spread to the liver. In this trial, 123 participants were allocated at random to receive either cryotherapy (63 people) or conventional surgery (affected parts of the liver were removed; 60 people). 
Funding 
The trial did not provide information on funding.
Key results 
The trial was at high risk of bias. The participants were followed for up to 10 years (minimum five months). The trial reported that the mortality at 10 years was 81% (51/63) in the cryotherapy group and 92% (55/60) in the conventional surgery group. We judged the evidence as low‐certainty evidence. We found no evidence of a difference in proportion of participants with recurrence of the malignancy in the liver: 86% (54/63) of the participants in the cryotherapy group and 95% (57/60) of the participants in the conventional surgery group developed a new malignancy (low‐certainty evidence). The frequency of reported complications was similar between the cryotherapy group and the conventional surgery group, except for postoperative pain. Both insignificant and pronounced pain were reported to be more common in the cryotherapy group while intense pain was reported to be more common in the conventional surgery group. However, it was not reported whether there was any evidence of a difference. The frequency of unwanted effects (adverse events or complications) was mostly similar in both groups, but pain intensity and frequency seemed to differ between the groups. There were no intervention‐related mortality or bile leakages. The trial did not provide data on quality of life; cancer mortality, and time to progression of liver metastases. 
Reliability of the evidence 
The evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy versus conventional surgery in people with liver metastases is of low certainty. We are uncertain about our estimate and cannot determine whether cryotherapy compared with conventional surgery is beneficial or harmful. We found no evidence for the benefits or harms of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, or versus systemic treatments.

Freezing tumors in the liver: what one study found

2. Rationale
Cancer can spread from one body part to the liver. Doctors call this spread “metastasis,” or simply “spread.” Many people who have cancer spread to the liver die from problems it causes. So, better ways to treat liver tumors are needed.

One way is cryotherapy. This is a “freezing” treatment. A doctor places a thin probe, like a small wand, next to the tumor. Cold gas runs through the probe. The gas is very cold. It freezes and kills cancer cells. The goal is to shrink or destroy the tumor.

Doctors also treat liver tumors with surgery. In surgery, they cut out the part of the liver with the tumor. We do not know which way helps people live longer or feel better. We also do not know which way has fewer harms.

This review looked for proof to answer a clear question. Does freezing work as well as, or better than, other care? Could it help people live longer or feel better? The authors hoped to learn if freezing helps, harms, or makes no real change.

3. Trial Design
How is this study designed?
The reviewers searched for studies up to June 2018. They found one trial that fit the question. It took place in Ukraine. It looked at people with cancer that had spread to the liver.

The trial put people into two groups by chance. This is like flipping a coin. That helps keep the groups fair and alike. One group had freezing. The other group had surgery to remove part of the liver.

Who was in the study?
The trial had 123 people. The main source of the first cancer was the bowel in 66 out of 100 cases. Some people had the first cancer in the stomach, breast, skin, or other places. All had spread to the liver. The trial did not report the age or sex of the people.

What care did people get?
Sixty-three people had freezing (cryotherapy). Sixty people had surgery to remove liver tissue. The report did not say who paid for the trial.

How long did it last?
People were followed for at least 5 months. Some were followed for as long as 10 years. That let the team look at long-term results.

4. Results
What were the main results?
The trial said how many people died by 10 years. In the freezing group, 51 out of 63 people died. In the surgery group, 55 out of 60 people died. These numbers are close. We cannot tell if freezing helped people live longer.

The trial also looked at cancer coming back in the liver. In the freezing group, 54 out of 63 people had new liver tumors. In the surgery group, 57 out of 60 people had new liver tumors. These numbers are also close. We cannot tell if one way was better.

What about side effects?
Side effects were mostly alike between the two groups. Pain was not the same, though. More people had mild or medium pain after freezing. More people had strong pain after surgery. The trial did not show if these pain differences were due to chance. There were no deaths caused by the treatment. There were no bile leaks reported.

What did the trial not measure?
The trial did not measure quality of life. That means we do not know how people felt or functioned day to day. It did not report time until the cancer grew again. It did not report deaths due to cancer itself. The trial did not compare freezing to no treatment. It did not compare freezing to drug therapy for the whole body.

How sure are we about these results?
The proof from this trial is low certainty. That means we are not sure. The way the study was done can skew the results. There was only one trial. It had a small number of people. Missing data also limit what we can learn.

What does this mean for patients?
From this one trial, freezing may work about as well as surgery for some results. But we cannot be sure. We do not know if freezing helps people live longer or feel better. We do not know which has fewer harms. We need more and better trials. These should include many people. They should measure how long people live, how they feel, and side effects.

What should patients do now?
If you have cancer spread to the liver, ask your care team about options. These may include surgery, freezing, heat treatment, drug therapy, or other care. Ask about the goals of care. Ask what is known and what is not known. Ask about risks, pain, time to heal, and follow-up care.

Bottom line
This review found one trial that compared freezing with surgery. The results were close for survival and return of liver tumors. Side effects were mostly alike, with pain patterns that differed. The proof is weak. We cannot say if freezing helps, harms, or makes no real change. More good studies are needed to guide care.","Cryotherapy for liver metastases
Review question 
Is cryotherapy (cooling) beneficial or harmful for local destruction of cancer (tumours) spread to the liver? 
Background 
When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancer affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die from complications. Cryotherapy is one of methods, used to destroy metastases in the liver. This method requires placing a special probe near the cancer site. The probe is used to deliver extreme cold to the site, which is produced by liquid nitrogen or argon gas. Placement of the probe can be guided using ultrasound or computed tomography (a special x‐ray). The rapid freezing process kills the cancer cells, and the size of the cancer is reduced. However, it is not clear if this treatment prolongs life or increases quality of life of affected people. 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of cryotherapy in destroying cancer metastases in the liver. We searched for studies assessing the effect of cryotherapy in comparison with no treatment or any other treatment in people with liver metastases from cancer of any location. We aimed to assess the effect of cryotherapy on the risk of death, quality of life, and adverse events (side effects caused by the treatment). 
Study characteristics 
We last searched for evidence in June 2018. We included only one trial conducted in Ukraine, and participants' primary cancer was colorectal (bowel) cancer in 66% of instances, but there were also people with stomach, breast, skin, and other tumours. All of them had cancer spread to the liver. In this trial, 123 participants were allocated at random to receive either cryotherapy (63 people) or conventional surgery (affected parts of the liver were removed; 60 people). 
Funding 
The trial did not provide information on funding.
Key results 
The trial was at high risk of bias. The participants were followed for up to 10 years (minimum five months). The trial reported that the mortality at 10 years was 81% (51/63) in the cryotherapy group and 92% (55/60) in the conventional surgery group. We judged the evidence as low‐certainty evidence. We found no evidence of a difference in proportion of participants with recurrence of the malignancy in the liver: 86% (54/63) of the participants in the cryotherapy group and 95% (57/60) of the participants in the conventional surgery group developed a new malignancy (low‐certainty evidence). The frequency of reported complications was similar between the cryotherapy group and the conventional surgery group, except for postoperative pain. Both insignificant and pronounced pain were reported to be more common in the cryotherapy group while intense pain was reported to be more common in the conventional surgery group. However, it was not reported whether there was any evidence of a difference. The frequency of unwanted effects (adverse events or complications) was mostly similar in both groups, but pain intensity and frequency seemed to differ between the groups. There were no intervention‐related mortality or bile leakages. The trial did not provide data on quality of life; cancer mortality, and time to progression of liver metastases. 
Reliability of the evidence 
The evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy versus conventional surgery in people with liver metastases is of low certainty. We are uncertain about our estimate and cannot determine whether cryotherapy compared with conventional surgery is beneficial or harmful. We found no evidence for the benefits or harms of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, or versus systemic treatments.

10.1002-14651858.CD011462.pub2,"Use of shorter radiation treatments for prostate cancer
Review question 
We asked if giving radiation therapy (cancer treatment with high energy x‐rays) for localized prostate cancer in fewer fractions (treatment visits for radiation) and shorter overall treatment time with a larger dose (more than 2 Gray) given each day, works as well as the usual (conventional) number of fractions (1.8 Gray per day to 2 Gray per day) for cancer control and had similar side effects. 
Background 
Using fewer fractions, with a larger dose given at each visit is possibly better for treating prostate cancer with radiation. Radiation therapy for prostate cancer can cause bladder and bowel side effects, and affect sexual function. If using larger doses for each treatment, with fewer treatments overall (called hypofractionation), works as well for cancer control, and the side effects and effects on certainty of life are about the same, then hypofractionation may benefit men with prostate cancer contained within the prostate (localized) who are treated with radiation therapy. If cancer control is as good, and the side effects about the same, then using fewer (but larger dose) radiation treatments may be more convenient for men with prostate cancer, use fewer resources and save money. 
Study characteristics 
This evidence is current to 15 March 2019. The men studied were ages 64 years and over and had prostate cancer limited to the pelvis. 
Key results 
We studied the use of fewer, but larger doses of radiation to treat 8278 men with prostate cancer. We found 10 studies. 
We found that using hypofractionation may result in similar risk of dying from prostate cancer (low‐certainty evidence) but are uncertain how it affects late bowel side effects (very low‐certainty evidence). It probably results in similar rates of late bladder side effects (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Using hypofractionation results in similar overall survival (high‐certainty evidence) and may be similar for metastasis‐free survival (low‐certainty evidence). Acute bladder side effects may be similar (moderate‐certainty evidence).

Shorter radiation plans for prostate cancer: Do they work as well?

Rationale
Prostate cancer is a common cancer in men. Many men have cancer that is still in the prostate. Doctors call this localized cancer. One way to treat it is with radiation. Radiation uses strong x-rays to kill cancer cells.

Radiation can also harm nearby healthy tissue. This can affect the bladder and the bowel. It can also affect sex function. So, doctors try to find the best dose and plan.

The usual plan uses many small doses over many visits. Doctors call each visit a “fraction.” A newer plan uses fewer visits with a larger dose each time. Doctors call this “short course” or “hypofractionation.” This means fewer trips, but bigger doses at each visit.

A short course may be easier for men. It may save time and money. But it must work as well as the usual plan. It also must not cause more harm.

This review asked two main questions. First, does the short course control the cancer as well? Second, are side effects about the same? If yes, more men could choose the short course.

Trial Design
This was a review of many studies. The team looked at research up to March 15, 2019. They found 10 studies. Each study compared the short course to the usual course.

In all, 8,278 men took part. Most men were age 64 or older. All had cancer in the prostate area. The cancer had not spread far from that area.

The short course used larger doses at each visit. It needed fewer treatment visits. The usual course used smaller doses and more visits. The studies tracked survival and side effects.

The reports did not list one time in the study for all. In general, a short course means fewer weeks of care. A usual course means more weeks. Exact times were not stated here.

Results
The short course worked as well for life span. Men lived just as long with either plan. We are very sure of this result. This means there is strong proof.

The chance of dying from prostate cancer was also similar. We are less sure of this point. More study may change this finding. But for now, the risk looks much the same.

Cancer spread was also similar between plans. Spread means the cancer moves to other parts. Doctors call this “metastasis.” Time lived without spread looked much the same. We are less sure of this point.

Side effects during treatment to the bladder were similar. We are fairly sure of this. The bladder holds urine. These side effects can include pain or burning when you pee.

Long-term bladder side effects were also likely the same. We are fairly sure of this as well. This means the short course did not seem to harm the bladder more.

Long-term bowel side effects were not clear. We cannot tell if there is a difference. The bowel helps move stool. We need more good studies on this point.

The review did not give details on sex function. Radiation can affect erections. We cannot compare the two plans on this here. We need more data to know.

What do these results mean for men? Many men can pick the short course. It seems to work as well as the usual course. It can mean fewer trips and less time in care. It may also save money and stress.

This choice still needs a talk with your care team. Each person is different. Your age, other health issues, and tumor risk can matter. The short course may not fit all men.

Here is the big picture. Shorter radiation plans look safe and effective. They seem to control the cancer just as well. They do not seem to raise bladder risks. We still need better proof about bowel harms.

This review covered 10 studies with 8,278 men. The studies were up to March 2019. The men were age 64 and older. Their cancer had not spread far from the prostate.

In sum, a short course is a sound option for many. It may match the usual course for cancer control. It likely has similar bladder side effects during and after care. Bowel effects over time are less clear. Ask your doctor which plan fits your needs and life.","Use of shorter radiation treatments for prostate cancer

10.1002-14651858.CD013453.pub2,"Background
Targeted therapies directed at specific driver oncogenes have improved outcomes for individuals with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 5% of lung adenocarcinomas, the most common histologic subtype of NSCLC, harbour rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene leading to constitutive activity of the ALK kinase. Crizotinib was the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) demonstrated to be effective in advanced NSCLC. Next‐generation ALK TKIs have since been developed including ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib, and have been compared with crizotinib or chemotherapy in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). These ALK‐targeted therapies are currently used in clinical practice and are endorsed in multiple clinical oncology guidelines. 
Objectives
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALK inhibitors given as monotherapy to treat advanced ALK‐rearranged NSCLC. 
Search methods
We conducted electronic searches in the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched conference proceedings from the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), and International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) World Conference on Lung Cancer, as well as the reference lists of retrieved articles. All searches were conducted from 2007 until 7 January 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing ALK inhibitors with cytotoxic chemotherapy or another ALK inhibitor in individuals with incurable locally advanced or metastatic pathologically confirmed ALK‐rearranged NSCLC. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, extracted study characteristics and outcome data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for each included study. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Primary outcomes were progression‐free survival (PFS) and adverse events (AE); secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), OS at one year, overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) criteria, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). We performed a meta‐analysis for all outcomes, where appropriate, using the fixed‐effect model. We reported hazard ratios (HR) for PFS, OS, and a composite HRQoL of life outcome (time to deterioration), and risk ratios (RR) for AE, ORR, and one‐year OS. We presented 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and used the I² statistic to investigate heterogeneity. We planned comparisons of 'ALK inhibitor versus chemotherapy' and 'next‐generation ALK inhibitor versus crizotinib’ with subgroup analysis by type of ALK inhibitor, line of treatment, and baseline central nervous system involvement. 
Main results
Eleven studies (2874 participants) met our inclusion criteria: six studies compared an ALK inhibitor (crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib) to chemotherapy, and five studies compared a next‐generation ALK inhibitor (alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib) to crizotinib. We assessed the evidence for most outcomes as of moderate to high certainty. Most studies were at low risk for selection, attrition, and reporting bias; however, no RCTs were blinded, resulting in a high risk of performance and detection bias for outcomes reliant on subjective measurement. 
ALK inhibitor versus chemotherapy 
Treatment with ALK inhibitors resulted in a large increase in PFS compared to chemotherapy (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.52, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, high‐certainty evidence). This was found regardless of line of treatment. 
ALK inhibitors may result in no difference in overall AE rate when compared to chemotherapy (RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.03, 5 RCTs, 1404 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
ALK inhibitors slightly improved OS (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, high‐certainty evidence), despite most included studies having a significant number of participants crossing over from chemotherapy to receive an ALK inhibitor after the study period. 
ALK inhibitors likely increase ORR (RR 2.43, 95% CI 2.16 to 2.75, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) including in measurable baseline brain metastases (RR 4.88, 95% CI 2.18 to 10.95, 3 RCTs, 108 participants) when compared to chemotherapy. ALK inhibitors result in a large increase in the HRQoL measure, time to deterioration (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.60, 5 RCTs, 1504 participants, high‐certainty evidence) when compared to chemotherapy. 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitor versus crizotinib 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors resulted in a large increase in PFS (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.46, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, high‐certainty evidence), particularly in participants with baseline brain metastases. 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors likely result in no difference in overall AE (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) when compared to crizotinib. 
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors likely increase OS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and slightly increase ORR (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.25, 5 RCTs, 1229 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) including a response in measurable brain metastases (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.54, 4 RCTs, 138 participants) when compared to crizotinib. 
Studies comparing ALK inhibitors were conducted exclusively or partly in the first‐line setting. 
Authors' conclusions
Next‐generation ALK inhibitors including alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib are the preferred first systemic treatment for individuals with advanced ALK‐rearranged NSCLC. Further trials are ongoing including investigation of first‐line ensartinib. Next‐generation inhibitors have not been compared to each other, and it is unknown which should be used first and what subsequent treatment sequence is optimal.

New ALK-targeted pills help people with a type of lung cancer

Rationale
Non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, is the most common lung cancer. In some people, the cancer has a change in a gene called ALK. This change can turn the cancer “on” and make it grow. This ALK change can also let the cancer spread to the brain.

Drugs called ALK inhibitors can block this ALK signal. They can slow or stop cancer growth. Crizotinib was the first ALK drug used. Newer ALK drugs include alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib.

Doctors need to know if ALK drugs work better than chemo. They also need to know if the newer ALK drugs work better than crizotinib. This review looked at past trials to answer these key questions. The main idea was that ALK drugs help people live longer and feel better.

Trial Design
This was a careful review of past studies. The team looked for all high-quality trials from 2007 to early 2021. They used big medical research lists and major cancer meetings. They also checked the papers cited by the trials.

The review included 11 randomized trials with 2,874 people. All people had advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. The cancer had spread or could not be cured with surgery. Some people had cancer that had spread to the brain.

The trials compared two things. One set compared an ALK pill to chemo. The other set compared newer ALK pills to crizotinib. Most trials looked at the first treatment given for advanced disease.

The trials did not “blind” people or doctors. That means they knew which drug they took. This can sway answers on how people feel. The text does not give ages or sex mix for the people in the trials. Time in each trial was not the same and is not set out here.

Results
Main takeaways
- ALK pills worked better than chemo at holding back the cancer.
- Newer ALK pills worked better than crizotinib.
- Side effects were about the same across the groups.
- People lived longer and felt well for more time with ALK pills.

ALK pills versus chemo
People who took an ALK pill went longer before the cancer grew. The chance that the cancer would grow at any time was about half as much as with chemo. Tumors shrank more often with ALK pills. This was more than two times as likely as with chemo.

For people with cancer that had spread to the brain, the news was even stronger. Tumors in the brain were about five times more likely to shrink on ALK pills than on chemo. People also lived a bit longer with ALK pills than with chemo. This was seen even though many on chemo later got an ALK pill. This “switch” can make the life gain look smaller, yet a gain still showed.

Side effects were about the same with ALK pills and with chemo. People on ALK pills kept their day-to-day well-being for longer. It took longer before their health and daily life got worse. In short, ALK pills helped people live better for more time.

Newer ALK pills versus crizotinib
Newer ALK pills helped people even more than crizotinib. People went longer before the cancer grew. The chance that the cancer would grow at any time was less than half as much as with crizotinib. People also lived longer on the newer drugs.

Tumors shrank a little more often with the newer ALK pills than with crizotinib. For cancer that had spread to the brain, tumors were about two and a half times more likely to shrink on the newer drugs. Side effects were about the same between the newer pills and crizotinib.

Safety and quality of the evidence
Most studies were high quality. They used fair ways to split people into groups. Few people dropped out, and the reports were clear. But no trial was blind. People and doctors knew the drug used. This can sway reports on how people feel and on some side effects.

What this means for patients
If you have advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, an ALK pill is a strong first choice. Based on these trials, newer ALK pills, such as alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib, are the best first drugs to try. They hold back the cancer longer than crizotinib. They also help people live longer. They have side effects like the older drug.

These results also apply if your cancer has spread to your brain. ALK pills, and the newer ones in particular, can work well in the brain. Tumors in the brain are more likely to shrink on these drugs.

What we still do not know
The newer ALK pills were not tested head-to-head against each other. So we do not yet know which one to use first. We also do not know the best order to use these drugs over time. Some trials are still going on. One is testing a drug called ensartinib as the first treatment.

Bottom line
ALK-targeted pills help people with ALK-positive NSCLC. They work better than chemo. Newer ALK pills work better than crizotinib. They can help you live longer and feel well for more time. Ask your care team if ALK testing is right for you. If you have the ALK change, talk with your team about starting a newer ALK pill.","Targeted treatment of non‐small cell lung cancer with an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene mutation 
Background 
The most common type of lung cancer is non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). About 5% of NSCLC will be driven by a gene mutation known as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Targeted treatments for those with advanced (not curable) ALK‐mutated NSCLC cancer have been developed and found to be more effective than chemotherapy. The first ALK inhibitor to be developed was crizotinib. Newer ALK‐targeted drugs have also been developed and include ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib. In this review we looked at treatments that target ALK‐mutated NSCLC to find out how well they work. 
Objectives  
The primary objective of this review was to find out whether people with ALK‐mutated NSCLC given treatments targeted towards ALK live longer without recurrence and have fewer side effects than those treated with chemotherapy. We also planned to evaluate whether newer ALK‐targeted drugs achieve this better than crizotinib.  
Study characteristics 
We searched the main medical databases and records of conferences up to 7 January 2021. We found 11 studies (2874 participants): six studies compared an ALK‐targeted drug to chemotherapy, and five studies compared a newer ALK‐targeted drug to crizotinib. The studies were conducted in people with advanced ALK‐mutated NSCLC using these drugs as their first or later treatment. A total of five different ALK inhibitors were used across studies: alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, and lorlatinib. 
Results 
People treated with ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those on chemotherapy. These improvements were also seen in people with cancer that had spread to the brain. People receiving ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer overall, even when some had received chemotherapy first. ALK‐targeted drugs cause a similar number of side effects as chemotherapy. ALK‐targeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size and resulted in a longer time until worsening of symptoms when compared to chemotherapy.  
People treated with newer ALK‐targeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those receiving crizotinib, including in people with cancer involving the brain. People treated with newer ALK‐targeted drugs as first treatment were likely to live longer overall with a similar number of overall side effects. Newer ALK‐targeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size when compared to crizotinib. 
The evidence for most reported measures was of moderate or high certainty.
Conclusions 
The best first treatment for people with incurable ALK‐mutated lung cancer is a newer ALK inhibitor such as alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, or lorlatinib. More studies are needed to determine which of these options is best and what treatment should be used when the cancer grows after these medicines have been given.

10.1002-14651858.CD009359.pub2,"Racecadotril to treat children under five years of age with acute diarrhoea
What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether racecadotril works for children under five years of age with diarrhoea. Cochrane Review authors collected and analysed all relevant trials to answer this question and included seven trials in this review. 
Key messages 
Racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure. We are uncertain whether or not it influences number of bowel movements or duration of diarrhoea. 
What was studied in the review? 
Diarrhoea is a leading cause of death in children under five years old, especially in low‐income countries. Children who have diarrhoea often suffer from frequent and watery bowel movements, which might cause excessive loss of fluid and electrolytes (dehydration). Fluid replacement is recommended to prevent and treat dehydration caused by diarrhoea. Racecadotril has been used in addition to fluid replacement for treating diarrhoea in children, as it reduces release of water and electrolytes into the digestive tract. The drug is supposed to improve the symptoms of diarrhoea (shorten duration of diarrhoea or reduce the stool frequency) as well as reduce the risk of rehydration failure. However, it is not clear if racecadotril really works for children with diarrhoea. 
What are the main results? 
The review authors searched for available trials and included seven trials. The trials were conducted in a total of 1140 children aged from 3 months to 5 years. Children who were given racecadotril were compared to a control group (children who, instead of racecadotril, received a placebo (a dummy drug that contains no racecadotril) or no drug). The review shows that when children with diarrhoea were given racecadotril, compared to placebo or no drug: 
• racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure (low‐certainty evidence); • we are uncertain whether or not racecadotril shortens duration of diarrhoea (very low‐certainty evidence); • we are uncertain whether racecadotril influences the number of stools (very low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may reduce weight of stool output (low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may make little or no difference to length of hospital stay for inpatients (low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may make little or no difference to rates of side‐effect events (low‐certainty evidence) 
How up to date is this review? 
The review authors searched for trials published up to 4 March 2019.

Can racecadotril help young children with sudden diarrhea?

Rationale
Diarrhea is common in young children. It can lead to many loose, watery poops. This can cause the body to lose too much water and body salts. That can make a child weak and very sick.

Doctors give fluids to prevent or treat this fluid loss. This is called rehydration. It may be by mouth or in the hospital. Some children still do not get better with fluids alone.

Racecadotril is a drug used with fluid treatment. It works in the gut. It helps the gut leak less water and body salts. The hope is that it can lessen diarrhea. It may also lower the risk that fluids will not work.

The aim of this work was clear. The team wanted to learn if racecadotril helps children under five with sudden diarrhea. They also wanted to know if it is safe.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team looked for all good trials on this topic. They used set methods to find and judge them. They then grouped what they found.

They found seven trials to include. These trials had 1140 children in total. The children were 3 months to 5 years old. All had sudden diarrhea. Some children got racecadotril with fluid care. Others got a placebo, which is a dummy drug. Some got no drug. All children got fluid care.

This review looked at short term results. It checked how long diarrhea lasted. It checked how many poops the child had. It checked if fluid care failed. It looked at time in the hospital. It also checked for side effects, which are unwanted effects. The exact time each child stayed in a trial was not given here.

Results
This review found some signs that racecadotril may help. But the proof is not strong. Here is what they saw.

Racecadotril may lower the chance that fluid care will fail. This means the child is less likely to stay too dry. That is important. Fluid loss can harm young children fast. The proof for this is not strong. So we cannot be very sure.

We do not know if racecadotril makes diarrhea end sooner. The proof here is very weak. Some trials did not show a clear change in the number of days with diarrhea. So we cannot say for sure.

We also do not know if it cuts how often a child poops. Again, the proof is very weak. Some trials did not find a clear drop in stool count. So we cannot be sure about this, either.

Racecadotril may reduce the total amount of poop. That means the weight of stool may be less. If true, that may help with skin care and comfort. But the proof is not strong here, too.

Racecadotril may make little or no change in time in the hospital. Children in the drug group and the other group stayed a similar time. This was seen in inpatients. The proof is not strong, so we must be careful.

Racecadotril may make little or no change in side effects. The number of unwanted effects looked similar. That suggests it may be safe for short use. But again, the proof is not strong.

What does this mean for families? First, give fluids as advised. Fluid treatment is key. It can save lives. Racecadotril, when added to fluids, may help some children. It may lower the chance that fluids will not work. But we are not sure it makes diarrhea end faster. We are not sure it lowers poop count. It may not cut time in the hospital.

The main take home point is this. Racecadotril could help in some ways. But we still need better trials. We need larger and high quality studies. These should tell us who will benefit most, and how much.

This review looked at trials up to March 4, 2019. Newer trials may exist. Ask your child’s doctor about the most up to date advice. Each child is different. The doctor will weigh the pros and cons for your child.

In short, fluids come first. Racecadotril may help as an add-on. It may lower the chance that fluid care fails. It may not change how long diarrhea lasts. It may not change time in the hospital. Side effects seem similar to no drug. But the proof is weak. More good studies are needed.","Racecadotril to treat children under five years of age with acute diarrhoea

Diarrhoea is a leading cause of death in children under five years old, especially in low‐income countries. Children who have diarrhoea often suffer from frequent and watery bowel movements, which might cause excessive loss of fluid and electrolytes (dehydration). Fluid replacement is recommended to prevent and treat dehydration caused by diarrhoea. Racecadotril has been used in addition to fluid replacement for treating diarrhoea in children, as it reduces release of water and electrolytes into the digestive tract. The drug is supposed to improve the symptoms of diarrhoea (shorten duration of diarrhoea or reduce the stool frequency) as well as reduce the risk of rehydration failure. However, it is not clear if racecadotril really works for children with diarrhoea. 
What are the main results? 
The review authors searched for available trials and included seven trials. The trials were conducted in a total of 1140 children aged from 3 months to 5 years. Children who were given racecadotril were compared to a control group (children who, instead of racecadotril, received a placebo (a dummy drug that contains no racecadotril) or no drug). The review shows that when children with diarrhoea were given racecadotril, compared to placebo or no drug: 
• racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure (low‐certainty evidence); • we are uncertain whether or not racecadotril shortens duration of diarrhoea (very low‐certainty evidence); • we are uncertain whether racecadotril influences the number of stools (very low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may reduce weight of stool output (low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may make little or no difference to length of hospital stay for inpatients (low‐certainty evidence); • racecadotril may make little or no difference to rates of side‐effect events (low‐certainty evidence)

10.1002-14651858.CD013787,"Background
Specific diagnostic tests to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and resulting COVID‐19 disease are not always available and take time to obtain results. Routine laboratory markers such as white blood cell count, measures of anticoagulation, C‐reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin, are used to assess the clinical status of a patient. These laboratory tests may be useful for the triage of people with potential COVID‐19 to prioritize them for different levels of treatment, especially in situations where time and resources are limited. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of routine laboratory testing as a triage test to determine if a person has COVID‐19. 
Search methods
On 4 May 2020 we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the COVID‐19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID‐19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included both case‐control designs and consecutive series of patients that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of routine laboratory testing as a triage test to determine if a person has COVID‐19. The reference standard could be reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) alone; RT‐PCR plus clinical expertise or and imaging; repeated RT‐PCR several days apart or from different samples; WHO and other case definitions; and any other reference standard used by the study authors. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from each included study. They also assessed the methodological quality of the studies, using QUADAS‐2. We used the 'NLMIXED' procedure in SAS 9.4 for the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) meta‐analyses of tests for which we included four or more studies. To facilitate interpretation of results, for each meta‐analysis we estimated summary sensitivity at the points on the SROC curve that corresponded to the median and interquartile range boundaries of specificities in the included studies. 
Main results
We included 21 studies in this review, including 14,126 COVID‐19 patients and 56,585 non‐COVID‐19 patients in total. Studies evaluated a total of 67 different laboratory tests. Although we were interested in the diagnotic accuracy of routine tests for COVID‐19, the included studies used detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection through RT‐PCR as reference standard. There was considerable heterogeneity between tests, threshold values and the settings in which they were applied. For some tests a positive result was defined as a decrease compared to normal vaues, for other tests a positive result was defined as an increase, and for some tests both increase and decrease may have indicated test positivity. None of the studies had either low risk of bias on all domains or low concerns for applicability for all domains. Only three of the tests evaluated had a summary sensitivity and specificity over 50%. These were: increase in interleukin‐6, increase in C‐reactive protein and lymphocyte count decrease. 
Blood count 
Eleven studies evaluated a decrease in white blood cell count, with a median specificity of 93% and a summary sensitivity of 25% (95% CI 8.0% to 27%; very low‐certainty evidence). The 15 studies that evaluated an increase in white blood cell count had a lower median specificity and a lower corresponding sensitivity. Four studies evaluated a decrease in neutrophil count. Their median specificity was 93%, corresponding to a summary sensitivity of 10% (95% CI 1.0% to 56%; low‐certainty evidence). The 11 studies that evaluated an increase in neutrophil count had a lower median specificity and a lower corresponding sensitivity. The summary sensitivity of an increase in neutrophil percentage (4 studies) was 59% (95% CI 1.0% to 100%) at median specificity (38%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in monocyte count (4 studies) was 13% (95% CI 6.0% to 26%) at median specificity (73%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of a decrease in lymphocyte count (13 studies) was 64% (95% CI 28% to 89%) at median specificity (53%; low‐certainty evidence). Four studies that evaluated a decrease in lymphocyte percentage showed a lower median specificity and lower corresponding sensitivity. The summary sensitivity of a decrease in platelets (4 studies) was 19% (95% CI 10% to 32%) at median specificity (88%; low‐certainty evidence). 
Liver function tests 
The summary sensitivity of an increase in alanine aminotransferase (9 studies) was 12% (95% CI 3% to 34%) at median specificity (92%; low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (7 studies) was 29% (95% CI 17% to 45%) at median specificity (81%) (low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of a decrease in albumin (4 studies) was 21% (95% CI 3% to 67%) at median specificity (66%; low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in total bilirubin (4 studies) was 12% (95% CI 3.0% to 34%) at median specificity (92%; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Markers of inflammation 
The summary sensitivity of an increase in CRP (14 studies) was 66% (95% CI 55% to 75%) at median specificity (44%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in procalcitonin (6 studies) was 3% (95% CI 1% to 19%) at median specificity (86%; very low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in IL‐6 (four studies) was 73% (95% CI 36% to 93%) at median specificity (58%) (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Other biomarkers 
The summary sensitivity of an increase in creatine kinase (5 studies) was 11% (95% CI 6% to 19%) at median specificity (94%) (low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in serum creatinine (four studies) was 7% (95% CI 1% to 37%) at median specificity (91%; low‐certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (4 studies) was 25% (95% CI 15% to 38%) at median specificity (72%; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Although these tests give an indication about the general health status of patients and some tests may be specific indicators for inflammatory processes, none of the tests we investigated are useful for accurately ruling in or ruling out COVID‐19 on their own. Studies were done in specific hospitalized populations, and future studies should consider non‐hospital settings to evaluate how these tests would perform in people with milder symptoms. 
","Plain Title
Can common blood tests tell if someone has COVID-19?

Rationale
COVID-19 is a lung and whole body illness from a new virus. It can cause cough, fever, and trouble breathing. It can lead to long stays in the hospital. It can also cause harm to the heart, liver, and kidneys.

The best way to tell if you have COVID-19 is a lab test for the virus. This test is called RT‑PCR. It looks for the virus in your nose or throat. But this test is not always fast or on hand.

Doctors often use common blood tests to check how sick a person is. These include white blood cells, C‑reactive protein, and others. Some of these tests rise or fall when the body fights an infection. This review asked: can common lab tests help sort (triage) who likely has COVID‑19 when time and tools are tight?

The team thought these tests might help pick who needs care fast. They also thought the tests might help guide care. But they did not test a drug. They only looked at how well the tests point to COVID‑19.

Trial Design
This was not one trial. It was a summary of many studies. Experts searched for studies on May 4, 2020. They searched large health science lists each day. They also checked preprint sites. They did not limit by language.

The team included studies that checked how well common blood tests could tell if a person had COVID‑19. These studies used a virus test as the “gold standard.” Most used RT‑PCR. Some also used doctor review or scans. The studies took place in hospitals. People were sick enough to need care.

In total, they found 21 studies. These studies looked at 14,126 people with COVID‑19. They also looked at 56,585 people without COVID‑19. The studies tested 67 different lab measures. The time each person stayed in a study was not clear. The authors rated how good the studies were. The quality was mixed.

Results
Key point: no single common blood test could prove or rule out COVID‑19 on its own. Some tests found many people with COVID‑19. But those same tests also flagged many people who did not have it. Other tests rarely flagged people without COVID‑19. But they missed many people who had it.

Here is what they found for some well‑known tests:
- C‑reactive protein (CRP) is a sign of swelling in the body. High CRP was seen in about two out of three people with COVID‑19. But many people without COVID‑19 also had high CRP. So CRP alone does not tell who has COVID‑19.
- Interleukin‑6 (IL‑6) is a body signal that can rise with bad swelling. High IL‑6 was seen in about three out of four people with COVID‑19. But again, many without COVID‑19 also had high IL‑6. So IL‑6 alone does not sort people well.
- Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that fights germs. A low lymphocyte count was seen in about two out of three people with COVID‑19. But many without COVID‑19 also had a low count.

Some other blood tests did not help much:
- Low white blood cell count found only about one out of four people with COVID‑19. Few people without COVID‑19 had this result. This means the test missed most true cases.
- A high neutrophil percent found about three out of five people with COVID‑19. But many without COVID‑19 also had it.
- A low platelet count found about one out of five people with COVID‑19.
- Liver tests were not very helpful. A high AST found about three out of ten people with COVID‑19. A high ALT found about one out of ten.
- A high procalcitonin found almost none of the people with COVID‑19. So it did not help to find cases.
- A high lactate dehydrogenase found about one out of four people with COVID‑19.
- A high creatine kinase found about one out of nine. A high creatinine found about one out of fourteen.

Across all studies, only three tests did even fair on both finding cases and not flagging people without the virus. These were: high IL‑6, high CRP, and low lymphocyte count. But even these were not good enough to stand alone.

There were also problems with how the studies were done. The cut‑off levels for a “high” or “low” result were not the same across studies. The test settings also varied. Most people were in the hospital. Few studies looked at people with mild signs. The quality of many studies had issues.

What does this mean for patients and care teams? Common blood tests can help tell how sick someone is. They can help guide care once a doctor knows the person has COVID‑19. But no single routine blood test can tell for sure if you have COVID‑19. You still need a virus test like RT‑PCR to confirm.

This review helps the field by showing limits of these common tests. It warns against using them alone to sort who has COVID‑19. It also shows a need for better studies outside hospitals. We need studies in clinics and the community. We need data in people with mild signs.

In short, use common blood tests to check health and track care. Do not use them alone to prove or rule out COVID‑19. A virus test is still key.","How accurate are routine laboratory tests for diagnosis of COVID‐19?
What are routine laboratory tests? 
Routine laboratory tests are blood tests that assess the health status of a patient. Tests include counts of different types of white blood cells (these help the body fight infection), and detection of markers (proteins) that indicate organ damage, and general inflammation. These tests are widely available and in some places they may be the only tests available for diagnosis of COVID‐19. 
What did we want to find out? 
People with suspected COVID‐19 need to know quickly whether they are infected so that they can self‐isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. 
Currently, the standard test for COVID‐19 is usually the RT‐PCR test. In the RT‐PCR, samples from the nose and throat are sent away for testing, usually to a large, central laboratory with specialist equipment. Other tests include imaging tests, like X‐rays, which also require specialist equipment. 
We wanted to know whether routine laboratory tests were sufficiently accurate to diagnose COVID‐19 in people with suspected COVID‐19. We also wanted to know whether they were accurate enough to prioritize patients for different levels of treatment. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of routine laboratory tests to diagnose COVID‐19 compared with RT‐PCR or other tests. Studies could be of any design and be set anywhere in the world. Studies could include participants of any age or sex, with suspected COVID‐19, or use samples from people known to have – or not to have ‐ COVID‐19. 
What we found 
We found 21 studies that looked at 67 different routine laboratory tests for COVID‐19. Most of the studies looked at how accurately these tests diagnosed infection with the virus causing COVID‐19. Four studies included both children and adults, 16 included only adults and one study only children. Seventeen studies were done in China, and one each in Iran, Italy, Taiwan and the USA. All studies took place in hospitals, except one that used samples from a database. Most studies used RT‐PCR to confirm COVID‐19 diagnosis. 
Accuracy of tests is most often reported using ‘sensitivity’ and ‘specificity’. Sensitivity is the proportion of people with COVID‐19 correctly detected by the test; specificity is the proportion of people without COVID‐19 who are correctly identified by the test. The nearer sensitivity and specificity are to 100%, the better the test. A test to prioritize people for treatment would require a high sensitivity of more than 80%. 
Where four or more studies evaluated a particular test, we pooled their results and analyzed them together. Our analyses showed that only three of the tests had both sensitivity and specificity over 50%. Two of these were markers for general inflammation (increases in interleukin‐6 and C‐reactive protein). The third was for lymphocyte count decrease. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell where a low count might indicate infection. 
How reliable are the results? 
Our confidence in the evidence from this review is low because the studies were different from each other, which made them difficult to compare. For example, some included very sick people, while some included people with hardly any COVID‐19 symptoms. Also, the diagnosis of COVID‐19 was confirmed in different ways: RT‐PCR was sometimes used in combination with other tests. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Routine laboratory tests can be issued by most healthcare facilities. However, our results are probably not representative of most clinical situations in which these tests are being used. Most studies included very sick people with high rates of COVID‐19 virus infection of between 27% and 76%. In most primary healthcare facilities, this percentage will be lower. 
What does this mean? 
Routine laboratory tests cannot distinguish between COVID‐19 and other diseases as the cause of infection, inflammation or tissue damage. None of the tests performed well enough to be a standalone diagnostic test for COVID‐19 nor to prioritize patients for treatment. They will mainly be used to provide an overall picture about the health status of the patient. The final COVID‐19 diagnosis has to be made based on other tests. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched all COVID‐19 studies up to 4 May 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013348.pub2,"Background
Cervical cancer ranks as the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in women. Historically, women with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer have had limited treatment options. New anti‐angiogenesis therapies, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting agents, offer an alternative strategy to conventional chemotherapy; they act by inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels, thereby restricting tumour growth by blocking the blood supply. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of VEGF targeting agents in the management of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer. 
Search methods
We performed searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, online registers of clinical trials, and abstracts of scientific meetings up until 27 May 2020. 
Selection criteria
We examined randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the use of VEGF targeting agents alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy or other VEGF targeting agents. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently screened the results of search strategies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and analysed data according to the standard methods expected by Cochrane. The certainty of evidence was assessed via the GRADE approach. 
Main results
A total of 1634 records were identified. From these, we identified four studies with a total of 808 participants for inclusion. We also identified two studies that were awaiting classification and nine ongoing studies. 
Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy 
Treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy may result in lower risk of death compared to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.95; 1 study, 452 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, there are probably more specific adverse events when compared to chemotherapy alone, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (risk ratio (RR) 18.00, 95% CI 2.42 to 133.67; 1 study, 440 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); serious thromboembolic events (RR 4.5, 95% CI 1.55 to 13.08; 1 study, 440 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and hypertension (RR 13.75, 95% CI 5.07 to 37.29; 1 study, 440 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There may also be a higher incidence of serious haemorrhage (RR 5.00, 95% CI 1.11 to 22.56; 1 study, 440 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In addition, the incidence of serious adverse events is probably higher (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.79; 1 study, 439 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio was USD 295,164 per quality‐adjusted life‐year (1 study, 452 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Cediranib plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy 
Treatment with cediranib plus chemotherapy may or may not result in similar risk of death when compared to chemotherapy alone (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.65; 1 study, 69 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very uncertain results for the incidences of specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (RR 3.27, 95% CI 0.14 to 77.57; 1 study, 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); serious haemorrhage (RR 5.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 109.49; 1 study, 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); serious thromboembolic events (RR 3.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 80.59; 1 study, 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and serious hypertension (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.02 to 8.62; 1 study, 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In addition, there may or may not be a similar incidence of serious adverse events compared to chemotherapy alone (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.78; 1 study, 67 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy/brachytherapy versus chemotherapy or chemotherapy/brachytherapy 
Treatment with apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy/brachytherapy may or may not result in similar risk of death compared to chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy/brachytherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.60; 1 study, 52 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, hypertension events may occur at a higher incidence as compared to chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy/brachytherapy alone (RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.28 to 20.73; 1 study, 52 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Pazopanib plus lapatinib versus lapatinib 
Treatment with pazopanib plus lapatinib may result in higher risk of death compared to lapatinib alone (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.31; 1 study, 117 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very uncertain results for the incidences of specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.59; 1 study, 152 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); haemorrhage (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 5.58; 1 study, 152 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and thromboembolic events (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.50; 1 study, 152 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In addition, the incidence of hypertension events is probably higher (RR 12.00, 95% CI 2.94 to 49.01; 1 study, 152 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There may or may not be a similar incidence of serious adverse events as compared to lapatinib alone (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.26; 1 study, 152 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Pazopanib versus lapatinib 
Treatment with pazopanib may or may not result in similar risk of death as compared to lapatinib (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.38; 1 study, 152 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very uncertain results for the incidences of specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.12; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); haemorrhage (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.40; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and thromboembolic events (RR 3.08, 95% CI 0.13 to 74.42; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). In addition, the incidence of hypertension events is probably higher (RR 11.81, 95% CI 2.89 to 48.33; 1 study, 150 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The risk of serious adverse events may or may not be similar as compared to lapatinib (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.07; 1 study, 150 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We found low‐certainty evidence in favour of the use of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. However, bevacizumab probably increases specific adverse events (gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae, thromboembolic events, hypertension) and serious adverse events. We found low‐certainty evidence that does not support the use of cediranib plus chemotherapy, apatinib plus chemotherapy, apatinib plus chemotherapy/brachytherapy, or pazopanib monotherapy. We found low‐certainty evidence suggesting that pazopanib plus lapatinib worsens outcomes. The VEGF inhibitors apatinib and pazopanib may increase the probability of hypertension events. 
","1. Plain Title
Do drugs that block new blood flow help women with advanced cervical cancer?

2. Rationale
Cervical cancer is a major cause of death in women. Some women have cancer that comes back or spreads. This kind of cancer is hard to treat. Many women still die from it.

These cancers need blood to grow. A group of drugs can block new blood flow to tumors. Doctors call these VEGF drugs. They aim to starve the tumor of blood.

This review asked a key question. Do these drugs help women live longer or feel better? Do they cause harm? We also wanted to know if the cost makes sense.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team looked for the best kind of trials. These trials used a fair method to compare treatments. In these trials, chance chose which treatment each woman got.

The team searched several large data banks. They looked at all trials up to late May 2020. They found four trials that fit the rules. These trials had 808 women in total.

All women had tough to treat cervical cancer. The cancer had not gone away, had come back, or had spread. The trials tested VEGF drugs, alone or with chemo. Some women also had a type of internal radiation, called brachytherapy.

Each trial had its own time plan. This report did not state how long each woman was in a trial. The review team used a strict method to check the data. They also rated how sure we can be of the results.

4. Results
What did the review find? One drug, called bevacizumab, showed a benefit. Women who got chemo plus bevacizumab lived longer than women who got chemo alone. This came from one trial of 452 women. The strength of this proof was low, so we should be cautious.

But bevacizumab also raised the chance of bad side effects. These included a hole or an odd link in the gut. It also raised the chance of blood clots. It raised the chance of high blood pressure. Heavy bleeding may also have been more common. Serious side effects of any kind were also more common.

Cost was high for this drug in that trial. The cost was about 295,000 US dollars for one extra year of good health. This is very high.

Other VEGF drugs did not show clear benefits. Cediranib plus chemo did not help women live longer than chemo alone. The proof for this was weak. We cannot be sure if it helps or harms.

Apatinib plus chemo, or plus chemo and brachytherapy, did not show a clear life gain. High blood pressure was more common with apatinib. Again, the proof was weak.

Two other drugs, pazopanib and lapatinib, were also tested. Women who got both pazopanib and lapatinib did worse than women who got lapatinib alone. They lived for a shorter time. High blood pressure was also more common. The proof for harm was stronger here than for the other drugs.

Women who got pazopanib alone did not live longer than women who got lapatinib. High blood pressure was more common with pazopanib. We do not know for sure about other harms.

What does this mean for women? Adding bevacizumab to chemo may help some women live longer. But it also brings more risk of serious harm. Other VEGF drugs did not help, and one mix seemed to harm. High blood pressure was a common risk with some VEGF drugs.

How sure are we? The review rated most results as low or very low certainty. This means the true effect could be quite different. The bevacizumab result had low certainty for life gain and moderate certainty for some harms. The pazopanib plus lapatinib harm signal had low to moderate certainty. We need more and better trials.

Why is this study useful? It sums up what we know so far. It helps patients and doctors weigh pros and cons. It also points to gaps. We need safer ways to add to chemo. We need trials that measure life, side effects, and day to day well‑being.

Key take‑aways:
- Chemo plus bevacizumab may help women live longer. It also raises serious risks.
- Cediranib and apatinib did not show clear life gain. They may raise blood pressure.
- Pazopanib plus lapatinib seemed to make outcomes worse. Avoid this mix.
- Pazopanib alone did not help more than lapatinib and raised blood pressure.
- The cost of bevacizumab was very high in one trial.
- More trials are in progress. We hope they will give clearer answers.

If you have cervical cancer that came back or spread, talk with your care team. Ask about the chance of benefit and harm for each drug. Ask how side effects will be watched and treated. Your values and goals matter in these choices. This summary does not replace advice from your doctor.","Inhibition of blood vessel formation in advanced cervical cancer
What is the aim of this review?The aim of this Cochrane Review is to find out whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting drugs, which inhibit the formation of new blood vessels, can improve survival in women with cervical cancer that has spread to distant sites (metastasised) or has not responded to or come back (recurred) after initial treatment. These drugs include bevacizumab, cediranib, apatinib, pazopanib, anlotinib, and nintedanib. 
Key messagesBevacizumab plus chemotherapy may improve survival and probably increases specific and serious adverse events, including gastrointestinal perforations through the gut wall, blood clot formation (thromboembolic events) in blood vessels, hypertension (increased blood pressure), and bleeding (haemorrhage). 
Cediranib or apatinib plus chemotherapy, or pazopanib alone, may make little to no difference in survival. Pazopanib plus lapatinib may reduce survival. 
What are the main results of the review?We found four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria and enrolled 808 women. 
We found one study, which included 452 women, that assessed the use of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. The inclusion of bevacizumab may improve overall survival and probably increases the incidences of specific and serious adverse events. 
A second study analysed 69 women treated with cediranib plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. Cediranib may make little to no difference in survival, and it is uncertain whether it increases the incidences of specific or serious adverse events. 
Another study with 59 women reported data on the use of apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy) versus chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy alone. Apatinib may make little to no difference in survival, but it exhibited promising efficacy for progression‐free survival. 
We found one study with 228 women that compared pazopanib plus lapatinib versus only lapatinib, or pazopanib versus lapatinib: pazopanib plus lapatinib may reduce survival and probably increases the incidence of hypertension; pazopanib alone may make little to no difference in survival and probably increases the incidence of hypertension. 
Overall the quality (certainty) of the evidence was low, as each comparison included only one study and most studies were small.

We searched the Cochrane Methodology Review Group Specialised Register (CMR) in the Cochrane Library (July 2012, searched 11 February 2015); MEDLINE and MEDLINE In Process (OVID) (1946 to 10 February 2015); Embase (OVID) (1996 to 2015 Week 06); Science Citation Index & Social Science Citation Index (ISI) (2009 to 11 February 2015) and ERIC (EBSCO) (2009 to 11 February 2015). 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials of methods to increase recruitment to randomised trials. This includes non‐healthcare studies and studies recruiting to hypothetical trials. We excluded studies aiming to increase response rates to questionnaires or trial retention and those evaluating incentives and disincentives for clinicians to recruit participants. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on: the method evaluated; country in which the study was carried out; nature of the population; nature of the study setting; nature of the study to be recruited into; randomisation or quasi‐randomisation method; and numbers and proportions in each intervention group. We used a risk difference to estimate the absolute improvement and the 95% confidence interval (CI) to describe the effect in individual trials. We assessed heterogeneity between trial results. We used GRADE to judge the certainty we had in the evidence coming from each comparison. 
Main results
We identified 68 eligible trials (24 new to this update) with more than 74,000 participants. There were 63 studies involving interventions aimed directly at trial participants, while five evaluated interventions aimed at people recruiting participants. All studies were in health care. 
We found 72 comparisons, but just three are supported by high‐certainty evidence according to GRADE. 
1. Open trials rather than blinded, placebo trials. The absolute improvement was 10% (95% CI 7% to 13%). 
2. Telephone reminders to people who do not respond to a postal invitation. The absolute improvement was 6% (95% CI 3% to 9%). This result applies to trials that have low underlying recruitment. We are less certain for trials that start out with moderately good recruitment (i.e. over 10%). 
3. Using a particular, bespoke, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets. This method involved spending a lot of time working with the target population for recruitment to decide on the content, format and appearance of the participant information leaflet. This made little or no difference to recruitment: absolute improvement was 1% (95% CI −1% to 3%). 
We had moderate‐certainty evidence for eight other comparisons; our confidence was reduced for most of these because the results came from a single study. Three of the methods were changes to trial management, three were changes to how potential participants received information, one was aimed at recruiters, and the last was a test of financial incentives. All of these comparisons would benefit from other researchers replicating the evaluation. There were no evaluations in paediatric trials. 
We had much less confidence in the other 61 comparisons because the studies had design flaws, were single studies, had very uncertain results or were hypothetical (mock) trials rather than real ones. 
Authors' conclusions
The literature on interventions to improve recruitment to trials has plenty of variety but little depth. Only 3 of 72 comparisons are supported by high‐certainty evidence according to GRADE: having an open trial and using telephone reminders to non‐responders to postal interventions both increase recruitment; a specialised way of developing participant information leaflets had little or no effect. The methodology research community should improve the evidence base by replicating evaluations of existing strategies, rather than developing and testing new ones.

What helps more people join health studies?

Rationale
Health studies need people to join. Without enough people, studies run slow. Results can be weak or late. This hurts health care progress.

It is hard to get people to sign up. Many people do not reply to invites. Some feel unsure about what will happen. Clear steps may help them decide.

This study asked a simple question. Which invite methods help more people join? The team thought some methods would work better than others.

They also wanted to know where it works best. For example, in a family clinic or a hospital clinic. This work can guide teams who run studies.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. The team did not run a new trial. They looked at trials that test invite methods. In those trials, people got one method or another by chance.

They searched many large science libraries. They looked for trials through early 2015. The trials had to aim to boost sign‑up to real trials. They left out studies on survey return or on keeping people in a trial. They also left out studies that paid doctors to recruit.

They found 68 good trials. These trials had more than 74,000 people. Of these, 63 trials tested methods that spoke to people who may join. Five trials tested ways to help staff who ask people to join. All were in health care. None were in children.

The trials took place in many care sites. Some used mail or phone. Some changed the look of invite papers. Some changed how the study team worked.

The review did not follow people itself. So it did not set how long a person was in a study. Time in each trial was set by that trial.

The team looked at a simple result. Out of 100 people, how many more joined? They also judged how sure each result was. They called this high, medium, or low sure.

Results
Three results were high sure. The first result was about open trials. In an open trial, people and staff know the treatment. In a blind trial, they do not know. Some blind trials use a dummy pill.

Open trials had more people join. About 10 more out of 100 joined. The range was between 7 and 13 more out of 100. So, open trials can bring in more people.

The second result was about phone calls. Some trials sent a mail invite first. If a person did not reply, the team then called by phone. Phone calls led to more people joining.

About 6 more out of 100 joined after a call. This worked when few people joined at first. It is less clear if it helps when 10 or more out of 100 join at first.

The third result was about the invite paper. A team used long, careful tests with the target group. They worked on the words, look, and order of the paper. This “user tested” paper made little or no change.

About 1 more out of 100 joined. The range was from 1 fewer to 3 more out of 100. So, that special paper did not help much.

Eight other ideas had medium sure results. Three ideas changed how the study team worked. Three ideas changed how people got the invite or study facts. One idea trained staff who recruit. One idea offered money to people. Each of these came from just one trial. We need more trials to be sure.

There were many more ideas. Sixty‑one other tests had low sure results. Some had design flaws. Some had very mixed results. Some used pretend trials, not real ones. We cannot rely on those.

The team also wanted to see if place of care matters. For example, family care versus hospital care. This review did not give a clear answer on that point.

What do these results mean for patients and teams? Some steps can help more people join. Running open trials can help. Calling people who do not reply to mail can help. A special, user‑tested invite paper does not seem to help much.

No good trials were in children. We need tests in child health too. We also need teams to repeat tests of ideas that look good. This is better than making new ideas each time.

Why does this matter? Health studies need enough people to give clear answers. Better sign‑up means faster and stronger results. That can lead to better care, sooner.

In short, this review found a few clear wins. Open trials help more people say yes. Phone calls after a mail invite help too. A fancy invite paper does not help much. Many other ideas need more proof.

If you get a study invite, you may now know what to expect. You may get mail first, then a call. You may learn if the study is open or blind. Ask questions. Take your time. Your choice can help science and care.","What improves trial recruitment?
Key messages 
We had high‐certainty evidence for three methods to improve recruitment, two of which are effective: 
1. Telling people what they are receiving in the trial rather than not telling them improves recruitment. 
2. Phoning people who do not respond to a postal invitation is also effective (although we are not certain this works as well in all trials). 
3. Using a tailored, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets makes little or no difference to recruitment. 
Of the 72 strategies tested, only 7 involved more than one study. We need more studies to understand whether they work or not. 
Our question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of things trial teams do to try and improve recruitment to their trials. We found 68 studies involving more than 74,000 people. 
Background 
Finding participants for trials can be difficult, and trial teams try many things to improve recruitment. It is important to know whether these actually work. Our review looked for studies that examined this question using chance to allocate people to different recruitment strategies because this is the fairest way of seeing if one approach is better than another. 
Key results 
We found 68 studies including 72 comparisons. We have high certainty in what we found for only three of these. 
1. Telling people what they are receiving in the trial rather than not telling them improves recruitment. Our best estimate is that if 100 people were told what they were receiving in a randomised trial, and 100 people were not, 10 more would take part n the group who knew. There is some uncertainty though: it could be as few as 7 more per hundred, or as many as 13 more. 
2. Phoning people who do not respond to a postal invitation to take part is also effective. Our best estimate is that if investigators called 100 people who did not respond to a postal invitation, and did not call 100 others, 6 more would take part in the trial among the group who received a call. However, this number could be as few as 3 more per hundred, or as many as 9 more. 
3. Using a tailored, user‐testing approach to develop participant information leaflets did not make much difference. The researchers who tested this method spent a lot of time working with people like those to be recruited to decide what should be in the participant information leaflet and what it should look like. Our best estimate is that if 100 people got the new leaflet, 1 more would take part in the trial compared to 100 who got the old leaflet. However, there is some uncertainty, and it could be 1 fewer (i.e. worse than the old leaflet) per hundred, or as many as 3 more. 
We had moderate certainty in what we found for eight other comparisons; our confidence was reduced for most of these because the method had been tested in only one study. We had much less confidence in the other 61 comparisons because the studies had design flaws, were the only studies to look at a particular method, had a very uncertain result or were mock trials rather than real ones. 
Study characteristics 
The 68 included studies covered a very wide range of disease areas, including antenatal care, cancer, home safety, hypertension, podiatry, smoking cessation and surgery. Primary, secondary and community care were included. The size of the studies ranged from 15 to 14,467 participants. Studies came from 12 countries; there was also one multinational study involving 19 countries. The USA and UK dominated with 25 and 22 studies, respectively. The next largest contribution came from Australia with eight studies. 
The small print 
Our search updated our 2010 review and is current to February 2015. We also identified six studies published after 2015 outside the search. The review includes 24 mock trials where the researchers asked people about whether they would take part in an imaginary trial. We have not presented or discussed their results because it is hard to see how the findings relate to real trial decisions.

10.1002-14651858.CD004474.pub2,"Tongxinluo (a traditional Chinese medicine) capsules may help patients suffering from unstable angina 
Tongxinluo, in capsule form, is a traditional Chinese medicine which consists of herbs and insects. Traditionally it has been thought to have clinical benefits for patients with angina, including the reduction of the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and complications of some types of heart surgery. Some studies also suggest a possible benefit in reducing the frequency and severity of angina attacks and improving symptoms. However, none of these individual studies have been reviewed systematically. 
The review authors systematically reviewed evidence from 18 randomised controlled trials for the benefit of tongxinluo with or without other treatments, including routine care or placebo, for patients with unstable angina. All the trials were conducted in China. The total number of participants was 1413, ranging in age from 25 to 88 years. Most studies randomised patients to receive tongxinluo with conventional medication or conventional medications alone. 
There was some evidence from seven studies that tongxinluo improved the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes indicating ischaemia and reduced the number of people with no improvement or worsening of ECG (six studies). Some improvement in angina symptoms (10 studies) and reduced numbers of people showing no improvement or worsening of symptoms were apparent with tongxinluo. Tongxinluo appeared to be as effective as isosorbide mononitrate in three studies. A few cases of slight gastrointestinal discomfort were reported after giving tongxinluo in seven studies and three cases of breaking of tiny blood vessels under the skin (ecchymosis) in one study. 
The evidence suggested possible benefits relating to a range of outcomes among patients with unstable angina but all the studies were of poor quality and neither blinding nor allocation concealment were used. This makes it impossible to reach firm conclusions about the benefit of this treatment. Large, high quality, randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the possible benefit of tongxinluo for unstable angina and to suggest appropriate future use of this herbal medicine. 
","1. Plain Title
Can a traditional pill called tongxinluo help sudden chest pain?

2. Rationale
Unstable angina is a sudden chest pain. It happens when the heart gets too little blood. It can lead to a heart attack. It can scare people and stop daily life.

Doctors use several drugs and care plans. Yet some people still have chest pain. They want fewer attacks and less pain. Safer choices are also a need.

Tongxinluo is a pill used in China. It is made from herbs and insects. People have used it for heart pain for years. Some small tests suggest it may ease pain and help blood flow.

Past reports said it might cut heart attacks. It may also help people feel better. But each test looked at small groups. A careful review of all tests was needed.

3. Trial Design
This study was a review of many trials. A review sums up all the best tests we have. A “fair test” puts people into groups by chance. This helps keep the groups the same.

The review looked at 18 fair tests. All took place in China. The tests had 1,413 people with unstable angina. Their ages were 25 to 88.

Most tests used tongxinluo with usual drugs. They compared it to usual drugs alone or to a dummy pill. A few tests compared tongxinluo to a chest pain drug called isosorbide mononitrate. The tests checked chest pain and the heart trace.

The heart trace is called an ECG. It shows how blood flows to the heart. The time each person stayed in a test was not clear in this summary. This makes it hard to judge long term effects.

The trials did not hide which pill people got. Staff and patients knew the group. The way people were put in groups was not hidden. This can bias the results.

4. Results
Some tests found signs of better heart blood flow. This came from the heart trace. Seven tests showed better ECG changes with tongxinluo. Six tests found fewer people with no change or worse ECG.

Many tests found less chest pain. Ten tests showed better pain relief with tongxinluo. People had fewer or milder pain spells. More people felt some symptom relief.

Three tests compared tongxinluo to isosorbide mononitrate. Tongxinluo worked about the same as that drug in those tests. This suggests tongxinluo may help chest pain. But we still need stronger proof.

Side effects seemed mild in the reports we have. Some people had slight stomach upset in seven tests. One test found three people with small skin bruises. These come from tiny blood vessels that break under the skin.

The review did not list other serious harms. But the tests were small and short. A small test can miss rare harms. We cannot be sure about safety yet.

The tests had low quality. They did not hide group choice or pills. This can make a treatment look better than it is. So, we cannot make firm claims.

The review team said the pill may help. Still, the proof is not strong. We need large, high quality tests. Those tests should hide group choice and pills.

What does this mean for patients? The pill may ease pain and help the heart trace. Some people may feel better on it. But we do not yet know for sure.

If you have unstable angina, talk with your heart doctor. Do not stop your usual drugs without advice. Ask if a trial is a fit for you. Safer, stronger proof will guide care.

In short, tongxinluo showed promise in these tests. It may help both symptoms and heart blood flow. Side effects were few and mild in these reports. Better and larger trials must confirm these early signs.","Tongxinluo (a traditional Chinese medicine) capsules may help patients suffering from unstable angina

10.1002-14651858.CD013192,"Background
Melanoma accounts for a small proportion of all skin cancer cases but is responsible for most skin cancer‐related deaths. Early detection and treatment can improve survival. Smartphone applications are readily accessible and potentially offer an instant risk assessment of the likelihood of malignancy so that the right people seek further medical attention from a clinician for more detailed assessment of the lesion. There is, however, a risk that melanomas will be missed and treatment delayed if the application reassures the user that their lesion is low risk. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone applications to rule out cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in adults with concerns about suspicious skin lesions. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design evaluating smartphone applications intended for use by individuals in a community setting who have lesions that might be suspicious for melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants versus a reference standard of histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up and expert opinion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). Due to scarcity of data and poor quality of studies, we did not perform a meta‐analysis for this review. For illustrative purposes, we plotted estimates of sensitivity and specificity on coupled forest plots for each application under consideration. 
Main results
This review reports on two cohorts of lesions published in two studies. Both studies were at high risk of bias from selective participant recruitment and high rates of non‐evaluable images. Concerns about applicability of findings were high due to inclusion only of lesions already selected for excision in a dermatology clinic setting, and image acquisition by clinicians rather than by smartphone app users. 
We report data for five mobile phone applications and 332 suspicious skin lesions with 86 melanomas across the two studies. Across the four artificial intelligence‐based applications that classified lesion images (photographs) as melanomas (one application) or as high risk or 'problematic' lesions (three applications) using a pre‐programmed algorithm, sensitivities ranged from 7% (95% CI 2% to 16%) to 73% (95% CI 52% to 88%) and specificities from 37% (95% CI 29% to 46%) to 94% (95% CI 87% to 97%). The single application using store‐and‐forward review of lesion images by a dermatologist had a sensitivity of 98% (95% CI 90% to 100%) and specificity of 30% (95% CI 22% to 40%). 
The number of test failures (lesion images analysed by the applications but classed as 'unevaluable' and excluded by the study authors) ranged from 3 to 31 (or 2% to 18% of lesions analysed). The store‐and‐forward application had one of the highest rates of test failure (15%). At least one melanoma was classed as unevaluable in three of the four application evaluations. 
Authors' conclusions
Smartphone applications using artificial intelligence‐based analysis have not yet demonstrated sufficient promise in terms of accuracy, and they are associated with a high likelihood of missing melanomas. Applications based on store‐and‐forward images could have a potential role in the timely presentation of people with potentially malignant lesions by facilitating active self‐management health practices and early engagement of those with suspicious skin lesions; however, they may incur a significant increase in resource and workload. Given the paucity of evidence and low methodological quality of existing studies, it is not possible to draw any implications for practice. Nevertheless, this is a rapidly advancing field, and new and better applications with robust reporting of studies could change these conclusions substantially.

Can phone apps find melanoma? What we know so far

Rationale
Melanoma is a deadly skin cancer. It causes most deaths from skin cancer. When we find it early, care works better. Fast care can save lives.

Many people now use phone apps to check skin spots. These apps say if a spot may be risky or not. Quick help on a phone sounds great. It may help people see a doctor sooner.

But there is a risk. An app may say a risky spot is safe. That can delay care. Delay can let cancer grow.

This study looked at how well these apps work. It asked if apps can spot melanoma. It also looked at some early skin cell changes linked to melanoma. The team wanted to see if apps can guide who should see a doctor.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies, not a new trial. The team searched many medical sources. They looked for all studies up to August 2016. They found studies that tested phone apps for skin spots.

The team picked studies with clear proof of the true result. The true result came from a skin sample check in a lab. This is called a biopsy. Some spots also had expert follow up.

Two studies fit the plan. They looked at five phone apps. Adults with skin spots took part. But doctors took the photos in a clinic, not people at home.

In these studies, the apps gave a yes or no style risk call. Then the team compared the app call to the lab result. No new people joined this review. Time in each study was the time to take a photo and get the lab check.

Results
This review covered 332 risky skin spots. Of these, 86 were melanoma. The studies tested five apps. Four used a built‑in computer program. One sent the photo to a skin doctor to read.

How often did the apps catch melanoma? The four computer apps had a wide range. Some caught about 7 out of 100 melanomas. Others caught about 73 out of 100. That means many melanomas were missed in some apps.

How often did they avoid false alarms? The computer apps got safe spots right from about 37 to 94 out of 100. In some apps, many safe moles were called risky. In other apps, many risky ones were missed. The results were not steady.

The app that sent photos to a skin doctor did best at finding melanoma. It caught about 98 out of 100 melanomas. But it had many false alarms. It got safe spots right in about 30 out of 100. So, many people with safe moles might be told to seek care.

Some photos could not be rated by the apps. This rate was about 2 to 18 out of 100 images. The send‑to‑doctor app had about 15 out of 100 photo fails. In three of four app checks, at least one melanoma photo could not be rated. That is a worry.

There were other limits. The study photos were taken by doctors, not by people at home. The spots were already picked for removal in a clinic. So the results may not show how apps work in real life at home.

What does this mean for you? Right now, the computer apps do not work well enough. They can miss melanoma. A miss can delay care. The send‑to‑doctor app may help people get seen fast. But it may also flood clinics with many false alarms.

The team could not give clear advice on using these apps now. The proof we have is small and not strong. New apps may do better in the future. We need better, larger, well run studies. These studies should use photos taken by people at home. They should also report results in a clear, full way.

Your next steps are simple. If you see a new or odd skin spot, get it checked. If a mole grows, bleeds, or looks very dark, see a clinician. You can use an app as a prompt. But do not let an app delay a real exam.

In sum, phone apps may help one day. But today, they are not good enough to rule out melanoma. A skin check by a trained clinician is still key. Early care saves lives.","How accurate are smartphone applications ('apps') for detecting melanoma in adults?
What is the aim of the review? 
We wanted to find out how well smartphone applications can help the general public understand whether their skin lesions might be melanoma. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of malignant melanoma skin cancer important? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. Not recognising a melanoma (a false negative test result) could delay seeking appropriate advice and surgery to remove it. This increases the risk of the cancer spreading to other organs in the body and possibly causing death. Diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not present (a false positive result) may cause anxiety and lead to unnecessary surgery and further investigations. 
What was studied in the review? 
Specialised applications ('apps') that provide advice on skin lesions or moles that might cause people concern are widely available for smartphones. Some apps allow people to photograph any skin lesion they might be worried about and then receive guidance on whether to get medical advice. Apps may automatically classify lesions as high or low risk, while others can act as store‐and‐forward devices where images are sent to an experienced professional, such as a dermatologist, who then makes a risk assessment based on the photo. Cochrane researchers found two studies, evaluating five apps that used automated analysis of images and one that used a store‐and‐forward approach, to evaluate suspicious skin lesions. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included two studies with 332 lesions, including 86 melanomas, analysed by at least one smartphone application. Both studies used photographs of moles or skin lesions that were about to be removed because doctors had already decided they could be melanomas. The photographs were taken by doctors instead of people taking pictures of their lesions with their own smartphones. For these reasons, we are not able to make a reliable estimate about how well the apps actually work. 
Four apps that produce an immediate (automated) assessment of a skin lesion or mole that has been photographed by the smartphone missed between 7 and 55 melanomas. 
One app that sends the photograph of a mole or skin lesion to a dermatologist for assessment missed only one melanoma. Another 6 melanomas examined by the dermatologist via the application were not classified as high risk; instead the dermatologist was not able to classify the lesion as either 'atypical' (possibly a melanoma) or 'typical' (definitely not a melanoma). 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The small number and poor quality of included studies reduces the reliability of findings. The people included were not typical of those who would use the applications in real life. The final diagnosis of melanoma was made by histology, which is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had melanoma*. However, the studies excluded between 2% and 18% of images because the applications failed to produce a recommendation. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies took place in the USA and Germany. They did not report key patient information such as age and gender. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma was 18% and 35%, much higher than that observed in community settings. The definition of eligible patients was narrow in comparison to likely users of the applications. The photographs used were taken by doctors rather than by smartphone users, which seriously impacts the applicability of results. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Current smartphone applications using automated analysis are observed to have a high chance of missing melanomas (false negatives). Store‐and‐forward image applications could have a potential role in the timely identification of people with potentially malignant lesions by facilitating early engagement of those with suspicious skin lesions, but they have resource and workload implications. 
The development of applications to help identify people who might have melanoma is a fast‐moving field. The emergence of new applications, higher quality and better reported studies could change the conclusions of this review substantially. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies biopsy was the reference standard (means of establishing final diagnoses).

10.1002-14651858.CD013779,"Background
Evidence from disease epidemics shows that healthcare workers are at risk of developing short‐ and long‐term mental health problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned about the potential negative impact of the COVID‐19 crisis on the mental well‐being of health and social care professionals. Symptoms of mental health problems commonly include depression, anxiety, stress, and additional cognitive and social problems; these can impact on function in the workplace. The mental health and resilience (ability to cope with the negative effects of stress) of frontline health and social care professionals ('frontline workers' in this review) could be supported during disease epidemics by workplace interventions, interventions to support basic daily needs, psychological support interventions, pharmacological interventions, or a combination of any or all of these. 
Objectives
Objective 1: to assess the effects of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. 
Objective 2: to identify barriers and facilitators that may impact on the implementation of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. 
Search methods
On 28 May 2020 we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus databases and WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing. We also searched ongoing trials registers and Google Scholar. We ran all searches from the year 2002 onwards, with no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included studies in which participants were health and social care professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks, categorised as epidemics or pandemics by WHO, from 2002 onwards. For objective 1 we included quantitative evidence from randomised trials, non‐randomised trials, controlled before‐after studies and interrupted time series studies, which investigated the effect of any intervention to support mental health or resilience, compared to no intervention, standard care, placebo or attention control intervention, or other active interventions. For objective 2 we included qualitative evidence from studies that described barriers and facilitators to the implementation of interventions. Outcomes critical to this review were general mental health and resilience. Additional outcomes included psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression or stress; burnout; other mental health disorders; workplace staffing; and adverse events arising from interventions. 
Data collection and analysis
Pairs of review authors independently applied selection criteria to abstracts and full papers, with disagreements resolved through discussion. One review author systematically extracted data, cross‐checked by a second review author. For objective 1, we assessed risk of bias of studies of effectiveness using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. For objective 2, we assessed methodological limitations using either the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) qualitative study tool, for qualitative studies, or WEIRD (Ways of Evaluating Important and Relevant Data) tool, for descriptive studies. We planned meta‐analyses of pairwise comparisons for outcomes if direct evidence were available. Two review authors extracted evidence relating to barriers and facilitators to implementation, organised these around the domains of the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research, and used the GRADE‐CERQual approach to assess confidence in each finding. We planned to produce an overarching synthesis, bringing quantitative and qualitative findings together.

We included 16 studies that reported implementation of an intervention aimed at supporting the resilience or mental health of frontline workers during disease outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): 2; Ebola: 9; Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS): 1; COVID‐19: 4). Interventions studied included workplace interventions, such as training, structure and communication (6 studies); psychological support interventions, such as counselling and psychology services (8 studies); and multifaceted interventions (2 studies). 
Objective 1: a mixed‐methods study that incorporated a cluster‐randomised trial, investigating the effect of a work‐based intervention, provided very low‐certainty evidence about the effect of training frontline healthcare workers to deliver psychological first aid on a measure of burnout. 
Objective 2: we included all 16 studies in our qualitative evidence synthesis; we classified seven as qualitative and nine as descriptive studies. We identified 17 key findings from multiple barriers and facilitators reported in studies. We did not have high confidence in any of the findings; we had moderate confidence in six findings and low to very low confidence in 11 findings. We are moderately confident that the following two factors were barriers to intervention implementation: frontline workers, or the organisations in which they worked, not being fully aware of what they needed to support their mental well‐being; and a lack of equipment, staff time or skills needed for an intervention. We are moderately confident that the following three factors were facilitators of intervention implementation: interventions that could be adapted for local needs; having effective communication, both formally and socially; and having positive, safe and supportive learning environments for frontline workers. We are moderately confident that the knowledge or beliefs, or both, that people have about an intervention can act as either barriers or facilitators to implementation of the intervention. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a lack of both quantitative and qualitative evidence from studies carried out during or after disease epidemics and pandemics that can inform the selection of interventions that are beneficial to the resilience and mental health of frontline workers. Alternative sources of evidence (e.g. from other healthcare crises, and general evidence about interventions that support mental well‐being) could therefore be used to inform decision making. When selecting interventions aimed at supporting frontline workers' mental health, organisational, social, personal, and psychological factors may all be important. Research to determine the effectiveness of interventions is a high priority. The COVID‐19 pandemic provides unique opportunities for robust evaluation of interventions. Future studies must be developed with appropriately rigorous planning, including development, peer review and transparent reporting of research protocols, following guidance and standards for best practice, and with appropriate length of follow‐up. Factors that may act as barriers and facilitators to implementation of interventions should be considered during the planning of future research and when selecting interventions to deliver within local settings.

Helping the mental health of care workers in disease outbreaks

2. Rationale
Big disease outbreaks can harm the mind. Care staff can feel low, tense, or on edge. They may feel worn out at work. They may also have trouble with focus and with friends.

The World Health Organization warned about this risk in COVID-19. Frontline staff face sick people each day. This adds stress and strain. It can hurt work and home life.

We need ways to help staff cope and stay well. We call this “resilience,” or the skill to handle stress. Good support can lower harm and help staff keep going.

Many kinds of help may work. Some help comes from the job site, like clear plans and training. Some help comes from talk therapy or peer support. Some plans may include basic needs or even medicine. This review asked what helps most and what gets in the way.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of research. The team did not run one new trial. They looked for all good studies from 2002 to May 28, 2020. They searched many medical databases and trial lists.

They sought studies on health and social care staff on the front line. A “frontline worker” is a person who gives care to patients during an outbreak. Outbreaks in this review were ones the WHO called an epidemic or pandemic. These included SARS, Ebola, MERS, and COVID-19.

The team looked for two kinds of reports. One kind tested if a support plan helped staff mental health. The other kind told what made a plan easy or hard to put in place.

The main things they looked for were mental health and coping skills. They also looked at worry, low mood, and stress. They checked for burnout, which means feeling worn out by work. They looked for other mental health issues, staffing changes, and any harms from the plans.

The people in these studies were care staff, not patients. Ages and gender were not the focus. The time in each study was not the same. Some papers did not state how long people took part.

The team also judged how strong the proof was. They checked how the studies were done. They planned to join results when they could.

4. Results
The review found 16 studies on support for care staff. Two were from SARS, nine from Ebola, one from MERS, and four from COVID-19. The plans tested were of three types. Six were job site plans, like training, clear roles, and better talk at work. Eight were talk support, like counseling or psychology services. Two used more than one kind of plan.

Only one study tested if a plan changed how staff felt over time. It looked at a work class on “psychological first aid.” That class teaches basic steps to help people in crisis. The study did not give clear proof that the class cut burnout. The proof of benefit was very weak.

The team also looked at what helps or hurts plan use at work. They drew 17 key points from the reports. None had very strong proof. They felt fairly sure about six points.

Two things often got in the way. First, staff or leaders did not always know what they needed to support the mind. Second, places lacked gear, staff time, or skills to run the plan. These gaps made plans hard to start or keep.

Three things often helped plans work. First, a plan that can fit local needs works better. One size does not fit all sites. Second, clear and kind talk helps. This means both formal updates and social support. Third, safe and warm places to learn help staff use the plan.

One more point stood out. What people know and believe about a plan can help or harm it. If staff think the plan helps, they use it more. If they doubt it, they may not join.

What does this mean for care staff and leaders? There is not enough strong proof to pick one best plan. We may need to use proof from other health crises. We can also use what we know from general mental health care.

When leaders choose a plan, they should think wide. Job rules and team culture matter. Social support, personal needs, and mind health all play a role. Plans should match the place and the people.

We also need better research. Future studies should have strong plans and clear reports. They should last long enough to see real change. The COVID-19 time gives a chance to test plans well.

In short, we still have much to learn. But we do see signs of what helps. Fit the plan to the site. Make time, train staff, and talk well. Build a safe place to learn and grow. This may help care staff cope and stay well in hard times.","What is the best way to support resilience and mental well‐being in frontline healthcare professionals during and after a pandemic? 
What is ‘resilience’? 
Working as a 'frontline' health or social care professional during a global disease pandemic, like COVID‐19, can be very stressful. Over time, the negative effects of stress can lead to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, which, in turn, may affect work, family and other social relationships. ‘Resilience’ is the ability to cope with the negative effects of stress and so avoid mental health problems and their wider effects. 
Healthcare providers can use various strategies (interventions) to support resilience and mental well‐being in their frontline healthcare professionals. These could include work‐based interventions, such as changing routines or improving equipment; or psychological support interventions, such as counselling. 
What did we want to find out? 
First (objective 1), we wanted to know how successfully any interventions improved frontline health professionals’ resilience or mental well‐being. 
Second (objective 2), we wanted to know what made it easier (facilitators) or harder (barriers) to deliver these interventions. 
What did we do? 
We searched medical databases for any kind of study that investigated interventions designed to support resilience and mental well‐being in healthcare professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks. The disease outbreaks had to be classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as epidemics or pandemics, and take place from 2002 onwards (the year before the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak). 
What did we find? 
We found 16 relevant studies. These studies came from different disease outbreaks ‐ two were from SARS; nine from Ebola; one from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); and four from COVID‐19. The studies mainly looked at workplace interventions that involved either psychological support (for example, counselling or seeing a psychologist) or work‐based interventions (for example, giving training, or changing routines). 
Objective 1: one study investigated how well an intervention worked. This study was carried out immediately after the Ebola outbreak, and investigated whether staff who were training to give other people (such as patients and their family members) 'psychological first aid' felt less ‘burnt out’. We had some concerns about the results that this study reported and about some of its methods. This means that our certainty of the evidence is very low and we cannot say whether the intervention helped or not. 
Objective 2: all 16 studies provided some evidence about barriers and facilitators to implement interventions. We found 17 main findings from these studies. We do not have high confidence in any of the findings; we had moderate confidence in six findings and low to very low confidence in 11 findings. 
We are moderately confident that the following two factors were barriers to implementation of an intervention: frontline workers, or the organisations in which they worked, not being fully aware of what they needed to support their mental well‐being; and a lack of equipment, staff time or skills needed for an intervention. 
We are moderately confident that the following three factors were facilitators to implementation of an intervention: interventions that could be adapted for a local area; having effective communication, both formally within an organisation and informal or social networks; and having positive, safe and supportive learning environments for frontline healthcare professionals. 
We are moderately confident that the knowledge and beliefs that frontline healthcare professionals have about an intervention can either help or hinder implementation of the intervention. 
Key messages 
We did not find any evidence that tells us about how well different strategies work at supporting the resilience and mental well‐being of frontline workers. We found some limited evidence about things that might help successful delivery of interventions. Properly planned research studies to find out the best ways to support the resilience and mental well‐being of health and social care workers are urgently required.

10.1002-14651858.CD013443.pub2,"Background
Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and debilitating condition. Several pharmacological interventions have been proposed with the aim to prevent or mitigate it. These interventions should balance efficacy and tolerability, given that not all individuals exposed to a traumatic event will develop PTSD. There are different possible approaches to preventing PTSD; universal prevention is aimed at individuals at risk of developing PTSD on the basis of having been exposed to a traumatic event, irrespective of whether they are showing signs of psychological difficulties. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of pharmacological interventions for universal prevention of PTSD in adults exposed to a traumatic event. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMDCTR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trials registers (November 2020). We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. The search was last updated on 13 November 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials on adults exposed to any kind of traumatic event. We considered comparisons of any medication with placebo or with another medication. We excluded trials that investigated medications as an augmentation to psychotherapy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. In a random‐effects model, we analysed dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/NNTH). We analysed continuous data as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). 
Main results
We included 13 studies which considered eight interventions (hydrocortisone, propranolol, dexamethasone, omega‐3 fatty acids, gabapentin, paroxetine, PulmoCare enteral formula, Oxepa enteral formula and 5‐hydroxytryptophan) and involved 2023 participants, with a single trial contributing 1244 participants. Eight studies enrolled participants from emergency departments or trauma centres or similar settings. Participants were exposed to a range of both intentional and unintentional traumatic events. Five studies considered participants in the context of intensive care units with traumatic events consisting of severe physical illness. Our concerns about risk of bias in the included studies were mostly due to high attrition and possible selective reporting. We could meta‐analyse data for two comparisons: hydrocortisone versus placebo, but limited to secondary outcomes; and propranolol versus placebo. No study compared hydrocortisone to placebo at the primary endpoint of three months after the traumatic event. 
The evidence on whether propranolol was more effective in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms compared to placebo at three months after the traumatic event is inconclusive, because of serious risk of bias amongst the included studies, serious inconsistency amongst the studies' results, and very serious imprecision of the estimate of effect (SMD ‐0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.61 to 0.59; I2 = 83%; 3 studies, 86 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No study provided data on dropout rates due to side effects at three months post‐traumatic event. The evidence on whether propranolol was more effective than placebo in reducing the probability of experiencing PTSD at three months after the traumatic event is inconclusive, because of serious risk of bias amongst the included studies, and very serious imprecision of the estimate of effect (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92; 3 studies, 88 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No study assessed functional disability or quality of life.  
Only one study compared gabapentin to placebo at the primary endpoint of three months after the traumatic event, with inconclusive evidence in terms of both PTSD severity and probability of experiencing PTSD, because of imprecision of the effect estimate, serious risk of bias and serious imprecision (very low‐certainty evidence). We found no data on dropout rates due to side effects, functional disability or quality of life. 
For the remaining comparisons, the available data are inconclusive or missing in terms of PTSD severity reduction and dropout rates due to adverse events. No study assessed functional disability. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides uncertain evidence only regarding the use of hydrocortisone, propranolol, dexamethasone, omega‐3 fatty acids, gabapentin, paroxetine, PulmoCare formula, Oxepa formula, or 5‐hydroxytryptophan as universal PTSD prevention strategies. Future research might benefit from larger samples, better reporting of side effects and inclusion of quality of life and functioning measures.

Medicines given soon after trauma to prevent PTSD: what we know

Rationale
Post‑traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, can follow a scary or harmful event. People may have flashbacks, bad dreams, or feel on edge. It can last for months or more. It can hurt work, school, sleep, and family life.

Not all people who face trauma get PTSD. Many people heal with time and support. Because of this, any early drug should be safe and easy to take.

Doctors have tried to use medicines right after trauma. The hope is to lower stress and fear early. The goal is to prevent PTSD, or make it less severe. This is called universal prevention. It means giving a drug to all adults after trauma, even if they have no signs yet.

This review asked a clear question. Do early medicines help prevent PTSD in adults after a trauma? Are these medicines safe and well liked? The team also looked for signs of harm.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team searched many medical databases. The last search was on November 13, 2020. They looked for the best type of studies. These are studies that put people into groups by chance. One group got a drug. One group got a dummy pill, called a placebo. Some studies compared one drug to another drug.

All people in the trials were adults. All had a recent trauma. Many came from emergency rooms or trauma centers. Some were in intensive care units after a severe illness. The traumatic events varied. Some were from accidents or other unplanned events. Some were from harm done by others.

The team included 13 trials. In total, 2023 adults took part. One trial was very large and had over 1200 people. Most studies checked people for about three months after the trauma. Some looked at other times too. The team left out studies that gave a drug along with talk therapy.

The medicines tested were different. They included hydrocortisone and dexamethasone (types of anti‑inflammatory drugs), propranolol (a heart and blood pressure drug), omega‑3 (fish oil), gabapentin (a nerve pain drug), paroxetine (an antidepressant), two nutrition drinks (PulmoCare and Oxepa), and 5‑hydroxytryptophan (also called 5‑HTP). The studies also looked at side effects. Some tried to measure how people felt and worked day to day.

Results
Overall, the results were not clear. The trials were small or very different from each other. Many people left the studies early. Reports did not always include all results. Because of this, we cannot be sure what works.

Propranolol had the most data at three months. Three small trials tested it. In total, fewer than 100 people took part in those trials. The results did not agree with each other. We cannot tell if propranolol lowers PTSD symptoms at three months. We also cannot tell if it lowers the chance of getting PTSD. The studies did not report how many people stopped due to side effects. They did not measure how well people felt or functioned.

Hydrocortisone had some data. But no study compared it to a placebo at the three‑month point. Some other checks were done earlier or later. Because of this, we cannot say if hydrocortisone helps prevent PTSD at three months.

One small trial tested gabapentin. Its results were unclear. We cannot tell if it reduced PTSD symptoms or the chance of PTSD. Side effect dropouts were not reported. It did not include daily life or quality of life measures.

Other drugs had little or no clear data at three months. These included dexamethasone, omega‑3 (fish oil), paroxetine, PulmoCare, Oxepa, and 5‑HTP. The studies were few and small. Results were mixed or missing. No study measured daily function in a clear way. Most did not measure quality of life.

What does this mean for patients? We do not have strong proof that any tested drug helps prevent PTSD when given to all adults right after trauma. We also do not know enough about side effects from these trials. The studies rarely reported if people stopped the drug because of side effects. They also rarely checked how people felt in daily life.

This review is important for care after trauma. It shows that we need better and larger trials. Future studies should keep people in the study for long enough. They should report side effects in a clear way. They should measure daily life and well‑being, not just symptoms.

In short, we cannot recommend any of these drugs for routine use to prevent PTSD in all adults after trauma. The evidence is uncertain at this time. Care teams should rely on proven support after trauma. Researchers should run larger, high‑quality trials. These should test safety and benefit. They should focus on what matters to patients, like sleep, work, and family life.","Medicines for preventing post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Why is this review important? 
Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and disabling condition which may develop in people exposed to traumatic events. Such events can have long‐lasting negative repercussions on the lives of those who have experienced them, as well as on the lives of loved ones. 
Research has shown that there are some alterations in how the brain works in people with PTSD. Some researchers have thus proposed using medicines to target these alterations soon after a traumatic event, as a way to prevent the development of PTSD. However, the majority of people who experience a traumatic event will not develop PTSD. Therefore, medicines that can be given soon after exposure to a traumatic event must be carefully evaluated for their effectiveness, including balancing the risk of side effects against the risk of developing PTSD. 
Who will be interested? 
‐ People exposed to traumatic events and their family, friends, and loved ones
‐ Professionals working in mental health 
‐ Professionals working in traumatology and emergency medicine
‐ People caring for victims of traumatic experiences and veterans of the armed forces
What questions did this review try to answer? 
For people exposed to a traumatic event, whether or not they have psychological symptoms, are some medicines more effective than other medicines or placebo (dummy pills) in: 
‐ reducing the severity of symptoms of PTSD?
‐ reducing the number of people stopping the medication because of side effects?
‐ reducing the probability of developing PTSD?
Which studies were included? 
We searched scientific databases for studies in which participants were randomly assigned to a medicine with the aim of preventing PTSD and its symptoms or reducing severity. We included studies published up until November 2020. We selected studies in adults who had experienced any kind of traumatic event, and which provided treatment, regardless of whether or not the participants had psychological symptoms. 
We included 13 studies, with a total of 2023 participants. One study alone contributed 1244 participants. The studies took place in different settings and involved people exposed to a wide range of traumatic events. Some studies took place in emergency departments and considered people whose trauma resulted from intentional harm or unintentional harm. Other studies focused on life‐threatening illness as the source of trauma, including major surgeries or being admitted to intensive care units. The medicines most commonly given to participants in the studies included: hydrocortisone (which reduces the body's immune response), propranolol (used to treat heart problems and anxiety, amongst other conditions), and gabapentin (a medicine primarily used to treat seizures and nerve pain). 
What did the evidence tell us? 
We found four trials comparing hydrocortisone to placebo. These trials did not report how participants were doing at three months after a traumatic event, a time point that is usually useful to assess the evolution of PTSD symptoms. 
We found very low‐certainty evidence about propranolol compared to placebo three months after a traumatic event. This evidence does not tell us whether or not propranolol is more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms and the probability of developing PTSD. We did not find evidence on the probability of people stopping the medication because of side effects, quality of life, or functional disability (a measure of how much one’s life is limited by symptoms). 
We found very low‐certainty evidence about gabapentin compared to placebo three months after a traumatic event. This evidence does not tell us whether or not gabapentin is more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms and the probability of developing PTSD. We did not find evidence on the probability of people stopping the medication because of side effects, quality of life, or functional disability. 
We found studies on additional medicines, for which information about the reduction of PTSD severity and the probability of people stopping the medication was either inconclusive or missing. 
None of the included studies measured the functional disability of participants.
What should happen next? 
The evidence we found does not support the use of any medicines for the prevention of PTSD in people exposed to a traumatic event, regardless of whether or not they have psychological symptoms. More higher quality studies involving more people are needed to draw conclusions about these treatments.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about how long intravenous antibiotic treatment (antibiotics given directly into the blood stream) is needed to clear flare ups of chest symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Flare ups of symptoms (exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis are treated aggressively to prevent further damage to the lungs. This practice has led to better survival rates for people with cystic fibrosis in recent years. However, there are no clear guidelines on how long treatment with intravenous antibiotics should be to treat these flare ups. Different centres tend to use different treatment regimens. Most centres use 10 or 14 days, extending this to 21 days if there is no improvement in a person's symptoms. This is an update of previously published reviews. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 30 May 2019.
Study characteristics 
No completed studies have compared different lengths of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, but there is one study under way looking at this question. When the results are published, we plan to include the study in this review. 
Key results 
Further research is needed to find the best duration of treatment for exacerbations. A shorter duration of treatment may be better as these courses of treatment are easier for people to complete. They are also less expensive and cause fewer drug reactions than longer treatments. However, it is not clear if shorter treatment is enough to treat infections adequately. It is also not clear whether shorter treatment results in early recurrence or increased frequency of chest infections. 
","Plain Title
How long should IV antibiotics last for chest flare-ups in cystic fibrosis?

Rationale
Cystic fibrosis, or CF, is an inherited disease. It makes thick, sticky mucus in the lungs. This mucus can block air flow and trap germs. This can cause lung damage over time.

People with CF often have chest flare-ups. A flare-up is a sudden worse spell of cough, mucus, or shortness of breath. These spells can harm the lungs if not treated fast. Doctors treat flare-ups with strong care to protect the lungs.

One key treatment is antibiotics into a vein. This is called IV antibiotics. “IV” means the drug goes right into the blood. This helps the drug reach the lungs fast. It may work better for bad infections than pills.

But we do not know how many days of IV antibiotics work best. Many clinics use 10 or 14 days. If a person does not get better, they may use 21 days. There are no clear rules that say which length is best. A shorter course may be easier to finish. It may also cost less and cause fewer drug side effects. But it might not clear the infection well. The infection could come back soon. This review set out to find the best length.

Trial Design
This was a review of past research. The team looked for studies that test different IV antibiotic lengths. They wanted to see which length works best for CF chest flare-ups. They searched health databases for reports and trials.

The team set a clear date for the search. The evidence is up to date to May 30, 2019. They used standard methods to find and check studies. They looked for studies in people with CF who had a flare-up. This could include kids, teens, and adults. The abstract does not list ages or gender.

The goal was to compare different IV course lengths. For example, 10 days versus 14 days. Or 14 days versus 21 days. They planned to see how people felt and how their lungs did. They also planned to look at safety and cost.

The review found no finished studies that compare IV course length. One study is still in progress. When that study is done, the team plans to add it to the review. Because there were no trials, we do not know how long a person would be in such a study. The review did note what many clinics do in real life. Many use 10 or 14 days. If a person does not improve, they may extend to 21 days.

Results
No completed studies compared different IV antibiotic lengths. So, we do not yet know the best number of days. We cannot say if 10 days is as good as 14 days. We also cannot say if 21 days helps more than 14 days. There is not enough proof.

A shorter course might help people in some ways. It is easier to finish. It may cause fewer drug reactions. It may cost less. People might spend less time in the hospital or on home IV care. These are clear plus points.

But a shorter course may not be enough for some people. It may not fully clear the germs. The infection may come back soon. People may then need more care. They may also have more flare-ups in a short time. These are real risks.

We also do not know who might do well with a short course. We do not know who might need a long course. The review could not answer these key points. It did not find trials that test and compare course lengths.

Why does this matter? CF care has improved. Strong, fast flare-up care helps people live longer. Clear guidance on IV length could help people and clinics. It could guide care at home and in the hospital. It could help plan time, cost, and safety. It could help people get the care that fits their needs.

What did the reviewers conclude? They said we need more research. We need well run trials that test 10 versus 14 days. Or 14 versus 21 days. These trials should track how people feel and breathe. They should track side effects and return of infection. They should also track cost and time on IVs.

One trial on this topic is now under way. When that trial reports, the team will add it to the review. That will bring new facts to this topic. Until then, doctors will use the best plan for each person. They will look at symptoms and test results. They will watch how fast a person gets better. They will adjust IV days if needed.

What does this mean for people with CF? If you need IV antibiotics for a flare-up, ask your care team about the plan. Ask why they chose the number of days. Ask how they will check your progress. Ask what signs mean you may need more or fewer days. Your team can help you find the best plan for you.

This summary does not give medical advice. It shares what this review found. Right now, there is no firm rule on IV length for CF flare-ups. More research will help fill this gap.","Length of time needed for antibiotic treatment given directly into the blood stream to clear acute chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis

10.1002-14651858.CD011106.pub2,"The usefulness of protocols for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit 
Review question 
Are protocols useful for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit?  Background 
Mechanical ventilation is used to help newborns to breath when they are too sick or born too premature to breath on their own. However, mechanical ventilation is not without risk, and can cause (permanent) damage to the lungs. For example, the pressure needed to fill the lungs with air may destroy the very fragile air sacs, and result in scaring of the lungs. For this reason, it is important to recognize when a newborn is mature and strong enough to start breathing for himself/herself, and to reduce (wean) the ventilator support. There is, unfortunately, no current agreement on the best way to wean newborns off the ventilator. Researchers have studied the usefulness of standardized protocols to guide the process of weaning off the ventilator in adults and children. In adults, 17 studies of weaning protocols have shown benefit in helping the doctors and nurses wean adults off the ventilator in a safe and timely manner. In children, three studies of weaning protocols have shown they are beneficial in reducing time on the ventilator, but the studies were too few to show harms. As yet, we do not know if weaning protocols in neonates provide benefits or harms. However, these standardized protocols have supplied us with firm evidence for their usefulness in weaning from mechanical ventilation in the care of children.  Study characteristics 
The purpose of this review was to look at weaning protocol studies in newborn infants to see if we could draw conclusions on their usefulness for weaning practice in neonatal care.  Key results  We found no studies that involved newborn infants before the 28th day of life. We found two studies with a subpopulation of newborns, but we were not able to extract the data from this subgroup out of the total group studied.  Quality of evidence 
There is currently no evidence comparing protocolized and non‐protocolized weaning in newborn infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. 
","Plain Title
Do set care plans help newborns come off breathing machines sooner?

Rationale
Some newborns need help to breathe. This can be due to early birth or illness. In these cases, staff use a breathing machine, also called a ventilator. It can save a baby’s life.

A breathing machine can also cause harm. Air pressure can hurt tiny air sacs in the lungs. This can lead to scars. The longer a baby needs the machine, the higher the risk of harm. So it is key to stop the machine as soon as it is safe.

“Weaning” means to lower and then stop machine help. There is no one agreed way to do this in newborns. A set care plan, or “protocol,” gives step‑by‑step rules for when to turn down support. In adults, 17 studies found that such plans help staff wean in a safe, timely way. In children, three studies found that plans can shorten time on the machine. But there were too few child studies to show possible harms. We do not yet know if these plans help or harm newborns.

This review asked a clear question. Do set care plans help cut time on the ventilator for newborns in the NICU? The NICU is a hospital unit for very sick or very early babies. The idea was that a set plan might reduce time on the machine and lower harm. This would be good for babies and families. It could also guide staff across many NICUs.

Trial Design
This was a review of past research. No new patients took part. The team looked for studies done in newborns in their first 28 days of life. The team focused on the NICU setting. They looked for studies that compared a set plan to usual care.

They wanted to include studies with only newborns. They also checked mixed‑age studies. They planned to pull out newborn data if they could. They would then compare time on the machine with and without a set plan.

The team found no studies that only enrolled newborns. They found two studies that did include some newborns. But the reports did not break out the newborn data. So the team could not use those results for this review. Since this was a review, there was no set time in the study for any one person.

Results
What did the review find? There is no evidence in newborns that compares a set plan to usual care. The team could not say if a set plan cuts time on the ventilator. They also could not say if it is safer or less safe for newborns. In short, we do not know if set plans help or harm newborns in the NICU.

What do we know from other age groups? In adults, 17 studies show that set plans can help. They can guide staff to wean in a safe, timely way. In children, three studies show shorter time on the ventilator with a plan. But there were too few child studies to tell if there were harms. Newborns are not the same as older children or adults. Their lungs are more fragile. So we cannot assume the same results will hold for newborns.

How does this help the field? This review points to a clear gap. We need well‑done trials in newborns in the NICU. These trials should compare a set plan with usual care. They should track time on the ventilator. They should also track safety and harms. This would help doctors and nurses make the best choice for each baby.

What does this mean for families today? Right now, there is no proof that a set plan works better for newborns. Care teams still use their skill and watch each baby closely. They adjust support based on the baby’s signs and needs. A set plan may help in the future. But we need newborn‑specific research to be sure.

In conclusion, the investigators found a lack of newborn data. They could not draw firm conclusions for newborns. They call attention to the need for newborn trials in the NICU. Until then, teams will keep using careful, case‑by‑case care to guide weaning.","The usefulness of protocols for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit 
Review question 
Are protocols useful for reducing the time newborn infants spend on mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit?  Background 
Mechanical ventilation is used to help newborns to breath when they are too sick or born too premature to breath on their own. However, mechanical ventilation is not without risk, and can cause (permanent) damage to the lungs. For example, the pressure needed to fill the lungs with air may destroy the very fragile air sacs, and result in scaring of the lungs. For this reason, it is important to recognize when a newborn is mature and strong enough to start breathing for himself/herself, and to reduce (wean) the ventilator support. There is, unfortunately, no current agreement on the best way to wean newborns off the ventilator. Researchers have studied the usefulness of standardized protocols to guide the process of weaning off the ventilator in adults and children. In adults, 17 studies of weaning protocols have shown benefit in helping the doctors and nurses wean adults off the ventilator in a safe and timely manner. In children, three studies of weaning protocols have shown they are beneficial in reducing time on the ventilator, but the studies were too few to show harms. As yet, we do not know if weaning protocols in neonates provide benefits or harms. However, these standardized protocols have supplied us with firm evidence for their usefulness in weaning from mechanical ventilation in the care of children.  Study characteristics 
The purpose of this review was to look at weaning protocol studies in newborn infants to see if we could draw conclusions on their usefulness for weaning practice in neonatal care.  Key results  We found no studies that involved newborn infants before the 28th day of life. We found two studies with a subpopulation of newborns, but we were not able to extract the data from this subgroup out of the total group studied.  Quality of evidence 
There is currently no evidence comparing protocolized and non‐protocolized weaning in newborn infants in the neonatal intensive care unit.

Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure injuries, pressure sores and bed sores) are localised injuries to the skin or underlying soft tissue, or both, caused by unrelieved pressure, shear or friction. Specific kinds of beds, overlays and mattresses are widely used with the aim of preventing and treating pressure ulcers. 
Objectives
To summarise evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assess the effects of beds, overlays and mattresses on reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers and on increasing pressure ulcer healing in any setting and population. 
To assess the relative effects of different types of beds, overlays and mattresses for reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers and increasing pressure ulcer healing in any setting and population. 
To cumulatively rank the different treatment options of beds, overlays and mattresses in order of their effectiveness in pressure ulcer prevention and treatment. 
Methods
In July 2020, we searched the Cochrane Library. Cochrane Reviews reporting the effectiveness of beds, mattresses or overlays for preventing or treating pressure ulcers were eligible for inclusion in this overview. Two review authors independently screened search results and undertook data extraction and risk of bias assessment using the ROBIS tool. We summarised the reported evidence in an overview of reviews. Where possible, we included the randomised controlled trials from each included review in network meta‐analyses. We assessed the relative effectiveness of beds, overlays and mattresses for preventing or treating pressure ulcers and their probabilities of being, comparably, the most effective treatment. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We include six Cochrane Reviews in this overview of reviews, all at low or unclear risk of bias. 
Pressure ulcer prevention: four reviews (of 68 studies with 18,174 participants) report direct evidence for 27 pairwise comparisons between 12 types of support surface on the following outcomes: pressure ulcer incidence, time to pressure ulcer incidence, patient comfort response, adverse event rates, health‐related quality of life, and cost‐effectiveness. Here we focus on outcomes with some evidence at a minimum of low certainty. 
(1) Pressure ulcer incidence: our overview includes direct evidence for 27 comparisons that mostly (19/27) have very low‐certainty evidence concerning reduction of pressure ulcer risk. We included 40 studies (12,517 participants; 1298 participants with new ulcers) in a network meta‐analysis involving 13 types of intervention. Data informing the network are sparse and this, together with the high risk of bias in most studies informing the network, means most network contrasts (64/78) yield evidence of very low certainty. There is low‐certainty evidence that, compared with foam surfaces (reference treatment), reactive air surfaces (e.g. static air overlays) (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.75), alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (e.g. alternating pressure air mattresses, large‐celled ripple mattresses) (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.93), and reactive gel surfaces (e.g. gel pads used on operating tables) (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.01) may reduce pressure ulcer incidence. The ranking of treatments in terms of effectiveness is also of very low certainty for all interventions. It is unclear which treatment is best for preventing ulceration. 
(2) Time to pressure ulcer incidence: four reviews had direct evidence on this outcome for seven comparisons. We included 10 studies (7211 participants; 699 participants with new ulcers) evaluating six interventions in a network meta‐analysis. Again, data from most network contrasts (13/15) are of very low certainty. There is low‐certainty evidence that, compared with foam surfaces (reference treatment), reactive air surfaces may reduce the hazard of developing new pressure ulcers (hazard ratio (HR) 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.05). The ranking of all support surfaces for preventing pressure ulcers in terms of time to healing is uncertain. 
(3) Cost‐effectiveness: this overview includes direct evidence for three comparisons. For preventing pressure ulcers, alternating pressure air surfaces are probably more cost‐effective than foam surfaces (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Pressure ulcer treatment: two reviews (of 12 studies with 972 participants) report direct evidence for five comparisons on: complete pressure ulcer healing, time to complete pressure ulcer healing, patient comfort response, adverse event rates, and cost‐effectiveness. Here we focus on outcomes with some evidence at a minimum of low certainty. 
(1) Complete pressure ulcer healing: our overview includes direct evidence for five comparisons. There is uncertainty about the relative effects of beds, overlays and mattresses on ulcer healing. The corresponding network meta‐analysis (with four studies, 397 participants) had only three direct contrasts and a total of six network contrasts. Again, most network contrasts (5/6) have very low‐certainty evidence. There was low‐certainty evidence that more people with pressure ulcers may heal completely using reactive air surfaces than using foam surfaces (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.80). We are uncertain which surfaces have the highest probability of being the most effective (all very low‐certainty evidence). 
(2) Time to complete pressure ulcer healing: this overview includes direct evidence for one comparison: people using reactive air surfaces may be more likely to have healed pressure ulcers compared with those using foam surfaces in long‐term care settings (HR 2.66, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.17; low‐certainty evidence). 
(3) Cost‐effectiveness: this overview includes direct evidence for one comparison: compared with foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces may cost an extra 26 US dollars for every ulcer‐free day in the first year of use in long‐term care settings (low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Compared with foam surfaces, reactive air surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk and may increase complete ulcer healing. Compared with foam surfaces, alternating pressure air surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk and are probably more cost‐effective in preventing pressure ulcers. Compared with foam surfaces, reactive gel surfaces may reduce pressure ulcer risk, particularly for people in operating rooms and long‐term care settings. There are uncertainties for the relative effectiveness of other support surfaces for preventing and treating pressure ulcers, and their efficacy ranking. 
More high‐quality research is required; for example, for the comparison of reactive air surfaces with alternating pressure air surfaces. Future studies should consider time‐to‐event outcomes and be designed to minimise any risk of bias.

Which beds and pads help prevent and heal pressure sores?

Rationale
Pressure sores are also called bed sores. They form when skin gets too much pressure. Rubbing and sliding can also harm the skin. These sores can hurt, get infected, and heal slow.

People who stay in bed or sit most of the day can get sores. This can happen in hospitals, nursing homes, and at home. Surgery time can also raise risk.

Many beds and pads claim to help. They try to spread body weight. They also aim to cut rubbing and sliding. But it is hard to know which ones work best.

This study looked at past research. It asked which beds, pads, and mattresses help most. It also asked which ones give good value for the money. The team thought some air or gel pads may lower risk and help sores heal.

Trial Design
This was a review of reviews. The team searched the Cochrane Library in July 2020. Cochrane Reviews are careful checks of past studies. They help show what works and what does not.

The team found six Cochrane Reviews. Four reviews looked at sore prevention. Two reviews looked at sore healing. The studies took place in many settings. These included hospitals, long term care, and operating rooms.

The people in the studies were adults who had a high risk of sores. Some people already had sores. Some did not have sores yet. The reviews included many types of beds and pads. These included foam, air, and gel surfaces.

Time in each study was not the same. The review did not set one time. Some studies were short. Some were longer. The review grouped and compared the results.

Results
Prevention
The four prevention reviews included 68 studies. These studies had 18,174 people. A large set of studies compared 12 kinds of surfaces. These included foam, reactive air, alternating pressure air, and reactive gel.

Foam is the common mattress. Reactive air has air that stays in place. It molds to the body to spread pressure. Alternating pressure air has air cells that fill and empty in turns. This shifts pressure over time. Reactive gel pads use gel to spread weight. They are often used in surgery.

Compared to foam, some air and gel surfaces may lower the chance of new sores. Reactive air surfaces may help reduce new sores. Alternating pressure air surfaces may also help reduce new sores. Gel pads may help reduce sores, at least in surgery and long term care. These findings are based on low certainty. That means we are not very sure.

One large set of data had 40 studies and 12,517 people. In that set, 1,298 people got new sores. Many of those studies had weak methods. Because of this, we are less sure about many of the results. The review could not say which surface is best.

Time to first sore
Ten studies with 7,211 people looked at how long it took to get a sore. In those studies, 699 people got new sores. Reactive air surfaces may delay the start of new sores. This is based on low certainty. We cannot rank all surfaces for this result.

Cost for prevention
Alternating pressure air surfaces were probably better value for money than foam. This was for preventing sores. The certainty for this cost finding was moderate. That means we can be more confident here.

Treatment
Two reviews studied healing of sores. They included 12 studies with 972 people. These studies compared several surfaces. Most compared reactive air or other surfaces to foam.

Reactive air surfaces may help more sores heal than foam. People on reactive air may also heal sooner in long term care. These findings are based on low certainty. We are not very sure which surface heals best overall.

Cost for treatment
In long term care, reactive air may cost more than foam at first. One review found an extra 26 US dollars for each sore‑free day in the first year. This is a rough guide. It is based on low certainty.

What this means
Some air and gel surfaces may help stop new sores. Some may help sores heal. Reactive air and alternating pressure air look helpful for prevention. Reactive air may also help healing. Gel pads may help in surgery and long term care.

But many studies were small or had weak methods. So we are not very sure about many results. We cannot say which surface is the best choice in all cases.

What matters to you
Your risk and needs may be unique. Your care team can weigh comfort, skin risk, and cost. They can match a surface to your body, health, and setting. Moving often, good skin care, and good food also help.

What is next
We need better studies. We need fair tests that compare air types head to head. We also need studies that track how long it takes to get or heal a sore. Strong study methods will help us be more sure.

Bottom line
Compared to foam, some air and gel surfaces may help. They may lower the chance of new sores. They may help sores heal. Costs can differ by type and setting. Talk with your care team to choose what fits you best.","What are the benefits and risks of beds, mattresses and overlays for preventing and treating pressure ulcers? 
The overview presents a lot of data from randomised controlled trials and contains an advanced analysis called 'network meta‐analysis'. The analysis allows comparisons of all types of support surfaces for preventing or treating pressure ulcers. This interactive tool may help with navigation of the datahttps://stopthepressure.shinyapps.io/Cochrane_support_surface_reviews/. 
Key messages 
Static air mattresses or overlays, alternating pressure air mattresses or overlays, and gel pads used on operating tables may be better than foam mattresses for preventing pressure ulcers. 
Compared with foam mattresses, alternating pressure air mattresses or overlays probably result in health benefits that outweigh their costs in preventing pressure ulcers. 
Static air mattresses or overlays may be better than foam mattresses for ulcer healing, but may cost more. 
It is unclear what the best treatment is for either preventing or treating pressure ulcers; what the effects of these treatment options are on people’s comfort and quality of life; and whether or not there are any unwanted effects. 
What are pressure ulcers? 
Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores or bed sores) are wounds to the skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure or rubbing. People who have mobility problems or who lie in bed for long periods are at risk of developing pressure ulcers. 
What did we want to find out? 
There are many types of beds, mattresses and overlays specifically designed for people with pressure ulcers. These can be made from a range of materials (such as foam, air cells and gel pads) and are divided into two groups: 
‐ reactive (static) surfaces that apply a constant pressure to the skin; and
‐ active (alternating pressure) surfaces that regularly redistribute the pressure under the body. 
We wanted to find out if different types of reactive and active surfaces:
‐ prevent pressure ulcers;
‐ help ulcers to heal;
‐ are comfortable and improve people’s quality of life;
‐ have health benefits that outweigh their costs; and
‐ have any unwanted effects.
We also wanted to find out what the best treatment options are for either preventing or healing pressure ulcers. 
What did we do? 
We searched for Cochrane Reviews that summarised the results of all available carefully designed studies (controlled trials) evaluating different beds, mattresses and overlays in preventing and treating pressure ulcers. A Cochrane Review provides a high level of evidence on the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. We summarised the results of these reviews in a single document (called an overview of reviews). 
We also collected studies included in these reviews and compared all available treatments at the same time in a single analysis (called network meta‐analysis). We then summarised these results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
Effects in preventing pressure ulcers  
We found four reviews on the use of beds, mattresses and overlays for preventing pressure ulcers. From these, we included 40 studies (12,517 people) in a network meta‐analysis evaluating reduction of pressure ulcer risk. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that static (reactive) air overlays, alternating pressure air mattresses, and (reactive) gel pads used on operating tables may reduce pressure ulcer risk compared with foam mattresses. 
We also included 10 studies (7211 people) in a network meta‐analysis evaluating the time taken for new ulcers to develop. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that reactive air surfaces may reduce the chances of developing new ulcers compared with foam surfaces. 
Effects in treating pressure ulcers  
We found two reviews on pressure ulcer healing. From these, we included four studies (397 people) in a network meta‐analysis. The network meta‐analysis evidence suggests that more people with ulcers may heal completely using reactive air surfaces than foam surfaces. 
The overview evidence suggests that, if the time needed to completely heal an ulcer is looked at, reactive air surfaces may improve the chances of pressure ulcers healing when compared with foam mattresses. 
However, it is unclear which treatment is best for either preventing or treating pressure ulcers. 
Other effects in preventing and treating pressure ulcers  
The overview evidence suggests that:
‐ compared with foam mattresses, alternating pressure air surfaces probably result in health benefits that outweigh their costs in preventing pressure ulcers; 
‐ reactive air‐filled surfaces may cost more than foam mattresses in healing ulcers; and 
‐ the other benefits and risks of these beds, mattresses and mattress overlays are unclear. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Although the reviews we found used reliable methods, most of the studies in them were small and used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence in this overview is current to July 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013495.pub2,"Background
Depression and anxiety are the most frequent indication for which antidepressants are prescribed. Long‐term antidepressant use is driving much of the internationally observed rise in antidepressant consumption. Surveys of antidepressant users suggest that 30% to 50% of long‐term antidepressant prescriptions had no evidence‐based indication. Unnecessary use of antidepressants puts people at risk of adverse events. However, high‐certainty evidence is lacking regarding the effectiveness and safety of approaches to discontinuing long‐term antidepressants. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of approaches for discontinuation versus continuation of long‐term antidepressant use for depressive and anxiety disorders in adults. 
Search methods
We searched all databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) until January 2020.
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing approaches to discontinuation with continuation of antidepressants (or usual care) for people with depression or anxiety who are prescribed antidepressants for at least six months. Interventions included discontinuation alone (abrupt or taper), discontinuation with psychological therapy support, and discontinuation with minimal intervention. Primary outcomes were successful discontinuation rate,relapse (as defined by authors of the original study), withdrawal symptoms, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, social and occupational functioning, and severity of illness. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. 
Main results
We included 33 studies involving 4995 participants. Nearly all studies were conducted in a specialist mental healthcare service and included participants with recurrent depression (i.e. two or more episodes of depression prior to discontinuation). All included trials were at high risk of bias. The main limitation of the review is bias due to confounding withdrawal symptoms with symptoms of relapse of depression. Withdrawal symptoms (such as low mood, dizziness) may have an effect on almost every outcome including adverse events, quality of life, social functioning, and severity of illness. 
Abrupt discontinuation  
Thirteen studies reported abrupt discontinuation of antidepressant.
Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that abrupt discontinuation without psychological support may increase risk of relapse (hazard ratio (HR) 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59 to 2.74; 1373 participants, 10 studies) and there is insufficient evidence of its effect on adverse events (odds ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.99; 1012 participants, 7 studies; I² = 37%) compared to continuation of antidepressants, without specific assessment of withdrawal symptoms. Evidence about the effects of abrupt discontinuation on withdrawal symptoms (1 study) is very uncertain. 
None of these studies included successful discontinuation rate as a primary endpoint. 
Discontinuation by ""taper""  
Eighteen studies examined discontinuation by ""tapering"" (one week or longer). Most tapering regimens lasted four weeks or less. 
Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that ""tapered"" discontinuation may lead to higher risk of relapse (HR 2.97, 95% CI 2.24 to 3.93; 1546 participants, 13 studies) with no or little difference in adverse events (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.38; 1479 participants, 7 studies; I² = 0%) compared to continuation of antidepressants, without specific assessment of withdrawal symptoms. Evidence about the effects of discontinuation on withdrawal symptoms (1 study) is very uncertain. 
Discontinuation with psychological support  
Four studies reported discontinuation with psychological support. Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that initiation of preventive cognitive therapy (PCT), or MBCT, combined with ""tapering"" may result in successful discontinuation rates of 40% to 75% in the discontinuation group (690 participants, 3 studies). Data from control groups in these studies were requested but are not yet available. 
Low‐certainty evidence suggests that discontinuation combined with psychological intervention may result in no or little effect on relapse (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.19; 690 participants, 3 studies) compared to continuation of antidepressants. Withdrawal symptoms were not measured. Pooling data on adverse events was not possible due to insufficient information (3 studies). 
Discontinuation with minimal intervention  
Low‐certainty evidence from one study suggests that a letter to the general practitioner (GP) to review antidepressant treatment may result in no or little effect on successful discontinuation rate compared to usual care (6% versus 8%; 146 participants, 1 study) or on relapse (relapse rate 26% vs 13%; 146 participants, 1 study). No data on withdrawal symptoms nor adverse events were provided. 
None of the studies used low‐intensity psychological interventions such as online support or a changed pharmaceutical formulation that allows tapering with low doses over several months. Insufficient data were available for the majority of people taking antidepressants in the community (i.e. those with only one or no prior episode of depression), for people aged 65 years and older, and for people taking antidepressants for anxiety. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently, relatively few studies have focused on approaches to discontinuation of long‐term antidepressants. We cannot make any firm conclusions about effects and safety of the approaches studied to date. The true effect and safety are likely to be substantially different from the data presented due to assessment of relapse of depression that is confounded by withdrawal symptoms. All other outcomes are confounded with withdrawal symptoms. Most tapering regimens were limited to four weeks or less. In the studies with rapid tapering schemes the risk of withdrawal symptoms may be similar to studies using abrupt discontinuation which may influence the effectiveness of the interventions. Nearly all data come from people with recurrent depression.   
There is an urgent need for trials that adequately address withdrawal confounding bias, and carefully distinguish relapse from withdrawal symptoms. Future studies should report key outcomes such as successful discontinuation rate and should include populations with one or no prior depression episodes in primary care, older people, and people taking antidepressants for anxiety and use tapering schemes longer than 4 weeks.

Stopping long-term antidepressants: what we know and what we still need to learn

Rationale
Depression and anxiety can cause deep sadness, worry, poor sleep, and low energy. Many adults take antidepressant drugs for these health problems. Use of these drugs has gone up over time. Some people stay on them a long time.

Some long-term use may not be needed. Past surveys found that about one third to one half of long-term use had no clear reason. Any drug can cause harm. For some, side effects or drug risks may grow with time. So, some people may want or need to stop.

But how can people stop in a safe way? Will symptoms come back if they stop? Will they have withdrawal, like dizzy spells or low mood, from a drop in dose? This study looked for the best way to stop. The team asked: does stop now, stop slow, or stop with talk therapy help?

Trial Design
This work is a review of many trials. Trials are studies where people join by choice and get a plan set by chance. The team looked for trials up to January 2020. They found 33 trials with 4,995 adults.

All people had taken an antidepressant for six months or more. Most had repeat depression in the past. Most trials took place in mental health clinics. Few trials looked at people with anxiety. Few trials included people age 65 or more.

The trials tested four ways. One way was to stop all at once. This is “abrupt stop.” A second way was to taper. This means a slow drop in dose. In most trials, the taper took one to four weeks. A third way paired taper with talk therapy. The talk therapy was to help stop low mood from coming back. This included mindful therapy and a type of planned talk therapy. A fourth way sent a letter to the family doctor to review the drug.

The trials tracked these main things. They looked at who could fully stop the drug. They looked at relapse. Relapse means the old symptoms come back. They looked at withdrawal. Withdrawal means new body or mood signs when the drug is cut or stopped. They also tracked harms and life quality.

Results
Main take-away: we still do not know the best way to stop. The studies had many limits. Many mixed up relapse with withdrawal. This makes it hard to trust the results. Many people in these trials cut the dose fast. That can look like a stop all at once for some people.

Abrupt stop
Some trials had people stop all at once. In these trials, more people had symptoms come back after they stopped. We do not know if this was relapse or withdrawal, or both. These trials did not report clear data on withdrawal. They also did not show clear change in harms. None set “full stop of the drug” as their main goal.

Taper
Other trials had people lower the dose over time. Most tapers took four weeks or less. In these trials, more people had a return of symptoms after they tapered. Again, we cannot tell relapse from withdrawal. Harms did not change much. Only one trial looked at withdrawal in a clear way. That result was not clear.

Taper with talk therapy
A few trials paired taper with talk therapy. The talk therapy was made to help keep low mood from coming back. This included mindful based therapy, and planned talk therapy to prevent relapse. In the stop group, about two to three in four people were able to stop. In these trials, the chance that symptoms came back was about the same as if people stayed on the drug. The trials did not track withdrawal. The data on harms were too thin to pool.

Letter to the doctor
One trial sent a letter to the family doctor to review the drug. This did not seem to help people stop more than usual care. It also did not seem to change relapse. The trial did not track withdrawal or harms.

Who was and was not in these trials
Most people had repeat bouts of low mood in the past. We have little data for people with one or no past bout. We have little data for older adults. We have little data for those who took the drug for anxiety. No trials tested very slow tapers that last many months. No trials tested tiny dose steps that may help some people.

Limits of the evidence
The biggest limit was this: signs of withdrawal can look like signs of relapse. For example, low mood, sleep change, and worry can be part of both. This can affect almost all results. It can also change how we see harms and life quality. Many trials also used fast tapers. A fast taper can act like a stop all at once for some.

What this means
Right now, we cannot give firm advice on the best way to stop. Abrupt stop or short tapers may raise the chance that symptoms come back. Taper with talk therapy may help some people stop. It may keep symptoms from coming back. But we need better trials to be sure.

What should future studies do?
New trials should tell relapse apart from withdrawal. They should track who can stop fully. They should include people in primary care. They should include people age 65 or more. They should include people who use the drug for anxiety. They should test slow tapers longer than four weeks. They should test small dose steps and low-intense supports, like online tools.

Bottom line
Many adults want to know how to stop long-term antidepressants. This review shows we still lack clear answers. Some ways may help, but the proof is weak. We need better, clearer trials so people and doctors can choose the safest path.","Stopping long‐term antidepressants in people with depression or anxiety
Review question 
We aimed to find out if it is effective and safe to stop antidepressants for people with depression or anxiety who have been taking them for six months or longer. 
We compared different approaches for stopping long‐term antidepressants versus continuation. We looked at benefits (e.g. successful discontinuation rate) and harms, such as return of the depressive or anxiety episode (relapse), side effects, and withdrawal symptoms (i.e. symptoms people experience when stopping an antidepressant). 
Background 
Antidepressants are widely used for depression and anxiety. Guidelines recommend that an antidepressant should be continued for at least six months after people start to feel better, and for at least two years if they have had two or more periods of depression. Many people take antidepressants for much longer, and as they can cause unpleasant side effects, long‐term use puts people at risk of harm that may outweigh the benefits. 
Study characteristics 
Our search up until January 2020 found 33 studies, which included 4995 adult participants. Most people in these studies had recurrent depression (two or more episodes of depression before stopping antidepressants), and most were recruited from specialist mental healthcare services. In 13 studies, the antidepressant was stopped abruptly; in 18 studies, the antidepressant was stopped gradually over several weeks (""tapering""); in four studies, psychological therapy support was also offered; and in one study, stopping was prompted by a letter to the GP with guidance on tapering. Most tapering schemes lasted four weeks or less. 
Key results 
We found very low‐certainty evidence suggesting that abrupt stopping may lead to higher risk of relapse and there was insufficient evidence of its effect on occurrence of side effects compared to continuation of the antidepressant. 
We found very low‐certainty evidence suggesting that ""tapering"" over a few weeks may lead to higher risk of a return and again may have little or no effect on side effects compared to continuation. 
We found evidence of very low to low certainty to suggest that stopping the antidepressant in combination with providing preventive cognitive therapy (PCT), or MBCT, was possible for 40% to 75% of participants in the group tapering the antidepressant and may show no difference in effects on relapse. 
We found low‐certainty evidence suggesting that a prompt letter and guidance on tapering sent to the GP may have no effect on the number of people who stop their antidepressant. 
We were unable to draw conclusions about withdrawal symptoms after abrupt or gradual stopping of an antidepressant, as this generally was not assessed. 
None of the studies used very slow tapering schemes beyond a few weeks, tapered liquid forms of antidepressants, or used tapering strips (to allow tapering with very low doses). 
None of the identified studies investigated stopping combined with providing supportive therapy such as online support or self‐help therapy. 
Certainty of evidence 
Overall, the certainty of evidence was low to very low. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and new research is likely to change our conclusions. The main reasons for this assessment of evidence certainty were that trials did not distinguish between symptoms of relapse of depression and symptoms of withdrawal. Also, most studies used no tapering or very ""rapid"" tapering schedules (four weeks or less), and nearly all studies included people with recurrent depression (more than two episodes). 
Conclusions 
We found few studies that examined stopping long‐term antidepressants. We are uncertain if the approaches for stopping long‐term antidepressants studied to date are effective and safe in people with recurrent depression. People should discuss with their doctor when they want to stop their antidepressant. 
Future studies should include people in primary care with only one or no earlier episodes of depression, older people, and people taking antidepressants for anxiety. Studies should taper antidepressants slowly while taking care to distinguish withdrawal symptoms from relapse.

10.1002-14651858.CD013874.pub2,"Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological cause of disability in young adults. Off‐label rituximab for MS is used in most countries surveyed by the International Federation of MS, including high‐income countries where on‐label disease‐modifying treatments (DMTs) are available.  
Objectives
To assess beneficial and adverse effects of rituximab as 'first choice' and as 'switching' for adults with MS. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and trial registers for completed and ongoing studies on 31 January 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) comparing rituximab with placebo or another DMT for adults with MS. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We used the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias. We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE for: disability worsening, relapse, serious adverse events (SAEs), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), common infections, cancer, and mortality. We conducted separate analyses for rituximab as 'first choice' or as 'switching', relapsing or progressive MS, comparison versus placebo or another DMT, and RCTs or NRSIs. 
Main results
We included 15 studies (5 RCTs, 10 NRSIs) with 16,429 participants of whom 13,143 were relapsing MS and 3286 progressive MS. The studies were one to two years long and compared rituximab as 'first choice' with placebo (1 RCT) or other DMTs (1 NRSI), rituximab as 'switching' against placebo (2 RCTs) or other DMTs (2 RCTs, 9 NRSIs). The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high‐income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two studies. We identified 14 ongoing studies. 
Rituximab as 'first choice' for relapsing MS 
Rituximab versus placebo: no studies met eligibility criteria for this comparison.
Rituximab versus other DMTs: one NRSI compared rituximab with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, or fingolimod in active relapsing MS at 24 months' follow‐up. Rituximab likely results in a large reduction in relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (hazard ratio (HR) 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.39; 335 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may reduce relapses compared with dimethyl fumarate (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.00; 206 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and natalizumab (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.00; 170 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It may make little or no difference on relapse compared with fingolimod (HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.69; 137 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported no deaths over 24 months. The study did not measure disability worsening, SAEs, HRQoL, and common infections. 
Rituximab as 'first choice' for progressive MS 
One RCT compared rituximab with placebo in primary progressive MS at 24 months' follow‐up. Rituximab likely results in little to no difference in the number of participants who have disability worsening compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.11; 439 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may result in little to no difference in recurrence of relapses (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.99; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), SAEs (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.20; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), common infections (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.73; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), cancer (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.59; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and mortality (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.77; 439 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure HRQoL. 
Rituximab versus other DMTs: no studies met eligibility criteria for this comparison.
Rituximab as 'switching' for relapsing MS  
One RCT compared rituximab with placebo in relapsing MS at 12 months' follow‐up. Rituximab may decrease recurrence of relapses compared with placebo (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.93; 104 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to placebo on SAEs (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.92; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), common infections (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.24; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), cancer (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 39.15; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and mortality (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 39.15; 104 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure disability worsening and HRQoL.  
Five NRSIs compared rituximab with other DMTs in relapsing MS at 24 months' follow‐up. The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to interferon beta or glatiramer acetate on disability worsening (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.42; 1 NRSI, 853 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Rituximab likely results in a large reduction in relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; 1 NRSI, 1383 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and fingolimod (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32; 1 NRSI, 256 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab relative to natalizumab on relapses (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.2 to 5.0; 1 NRSI, 153 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Rituximab likely increases slightly common infections compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.62; 1 NRSI, 5477 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); and compared with natalizumab (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.32; 2 NRSIs, 5001 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Rituximab may increase slightly common infections compared with fingolimod (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.77; 3 NRSIs, 5187 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It may make little or no difference compared with ocrelizumab (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.40; 1 NRSI, 472 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of rituximab on mortality compared with fingolimod (OR 5.59, 95% CI 0.22 to 139.89; 1 NRSI, 136 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and natalizumab (OR 6.66, 95% CI 0.27 to 166.58; 1 NRSI, 153 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The included studies did not measure SAEs, HRQoL, and cancer. 
Authors' conclusions
For preventing relapses in relapsing MS, rituximab as 'first choice' and as 'switching' may compare favourably with a wide range of approved DMTs. A protective effect of rituximab against disability worsening is uncertain. There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for progressive MS.  
The evidence is uncertain about the effect of rituximab on SAEs. They are relatively rare in people with MS, thus difficult to study, and they were not well reported in studies. There is an increased risk of common infections with rituximab, but absolute risk is small.  
Rituximab is widely used as off‐label treatment in people with MS; however, randomised evidence is weak. In the absence of randomised evidence, remaining uncertainties on beneficial and adverse effects of rituximab for MS might be clarified by making real‐world data available.

Rituximab for multiple sclerosis: what a review of studies shows

Rationale
Multiple sclerosis, or MS, harms the brain and spinal cord.
It can cause weakness, numbness, vision loss, and tiredness.
It can lead to trouble with work and daily life.
MS often starts in young adults and can last a long time.

Some people have relapsing MS.
This means new attacks come and go.
Others have progressive MS.
This means slow, steady loss of ability over time.

Many drugs try to lower relapses and slow damage.
These are called disease‑modifying treatments, or DMTs.
Rituximab is one such drug.
It is used “off‑label” for MS in many places.
That means it is not approved for MS in some countries, but many doctors use it.

Doctors use rituximab since they think it may help MS.
But we need clear proof of its help and its risks.
This review asked two key questions.
Does rituximab help as a first drug?
Does it help for people who switch from another drug?
The team also checked for side effects and deaths.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies.
The team searched big medical lists up to January 31, 2021.
They looked for good‑quality studies in adults with MS.
They included fair tests where chance picks the drug.
They also included careful studies that matched people across groups.

They found 15 studies.
Five were fair tests.
Ten were careful, but not by chance.
In all, there were 16,429 people.
About 13,000 had relapsing MS.
About 3,000 had progressive MS.

People got rituximab as a first drug or after a switch.
Rituximab was compared to a dummy drug (placebo) or to other MS drugs.
These other drugs included interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, natalizumab, and ocrelizumab.
Most studies took place in high‑income countries.
Six studies used data from Sweden.
Two studies had drug company funds.
Most studies lasted one to two years.
Fourteen more studies are still in progress.

The review looked at these outcomes:
– Relapses, which are new or worse MS attacks
– Worsening of disability over time
– Serious side effects
– Day to day well‑being
– Common infections
– Cancer
– Death

Results
Relapsing MS, rituximab as the first drug
There was no fair test versus a dummy drug.
One careful study compared rituximab to other MS drugs over two years.
Rituximab led to fewer relapses than interferon beta or glatiramer acetate.
It may also lead to fewer relapses than dimethyl fumarate or natalizumab.
It seemed about the same as fingolimod for relapses.
No deaths were seen in that study.
That study did not report disability change, serious side effects, well‑being, or common infections.

Progressive MS, rituximab as the first drug
One fair test compared rituximab to a dummy drug over two years.
Rituximab did not show clear help on disability worsening.
Relapses were rare in this group, and there was no clear difference.
Serious side effects were not clearly higher or lower.
Common infections were not clearly higher or lower.
Cancers and deaths were rare and showed no clear difference.
The study did not report day to day well‑being.

Relapsing MS, rituximab after a switch
One fair test compared rituximab to a dummy drug over one year.
Rituximab led to fewer relapses.
It was not clear if serious side effects, infections, cancer, or death were higher or lower.
This study did not report disability change or day to day well‑being.

Five careful studies compared rituximab to other drugs over two years.
Rituximab seemed to cut relapses a lot versus interferon beta or glatiramer acetate.
It also cut relapses a lot versus fingolimod.
It looked about the same as natalizumab for relapses.
These studies did not show a clear effect on disability worsening.

Infections and other safety results
Across some studies, rituximab had more common infections than some drugs.
This was seen when compared to interferon beta or glatiramer acetate.
It also was seen when compared to natalizumab.
When compared to fingolimod, infections may be a bit more common with rituximab.
When compared to ocrelizumab, infections seemed about the same.
Most infections were common types, like colds, chest, or urine infections.
Serious side effects were rare and not well reported.
Deaths and cancers were very rare.
The data were too small to be sure of any change in these risks.

What this means
For people with relapsing MS, rituximab may help reduce relapses.
This was seen when used first or after a switch.
It seemed to work as well as, or better than, many other MS drugs for relapses.
We do not know if it slows long‑term disability.
For progressive MS, there is not enough proof of benefit.

Rituximab may raise the chance of common infections.
But the number of people with these was small.
There is not enough clear proof on serious side effects, cancer, or death.

What is still unknown
Few fair tests have been done.
Many results came from careful, but not by chance, studies.
More fair tests are needed.
Real‑world data from clinics may also help fill the gaps.

Bottom line
Rituximab may be a useful choice for relapsing MS to lower relapses.
Its effect on long‑term disability is still not clear.
Common infections may be a bit more frequent.
Serious harms were rare but not well studied.
More strong studies are needed to guide care.","Rituximab for people with multiple sclerosis
Key messages 
– Rituximab may offer moderate‐to‐large benefit against a range of other medicines in preventing relapses in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Compared with no medicines, the desirable effects would be greater. 
– There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for preventing disability worsening in all forms of MS.  
– Serious harmful effects are relatively rare in people with MS making them difficult to study, and they were also not well reported in studies. 
What is the issue? 
Rituximab is a medicine administered by intravenous (by a vein) infusion that can suppress certain immune cells. The immune system fights infections and consists of many immune cells; it is affected in MS. 
Rituximab is currently used in many low‐ to middle‐income countries that have major barriers for accessing approved medicines for MS. However, rituximab is not always reimbursed by health systems because it is not licensed for MS by marketing authorities.  
Rituximab is considered a feasible treatment option as it is considered a highly effective treatment (similar to other approved medicines used to treat MS) but has considerably lower cost and less frequent dosing. Treatment with rituximab requires specialist care and infusion facilities, but other approved medicines do too. 
What did we want to find out? 
We aimed to investigate the beneficial and unwanted effects of rituximab for people with MS, when is used as a 'first choice' or as 'switching' (in other words, used when other medicines do not work well or become contraindicated). 
We wanted to find out if rituximab was better than other medicines to prevent disability worsening and recurrence of relapse, and to improve well‐being. 
We also wanted to find out if rituximab was associated with any unwanted or harmful effects, for example, serious harmful effects, common infections, cancer, and mortality (death). 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that investigated rituximab compared with all other approved medicines for MS. We searched the literature up to January 2021. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and quality. 
What did we find?  
We found 15 studies that involved about 16,000 people with MS and lasted one or two years. The biggest study was of 6421 people and the smallest study was of 27 people. The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high‐income countries, six from the Swedish MS register. Pharmaceutical companies funded two included studies. 
Main results 
Rituximab as a first choice treatment in relapsing MS: 
– likely results in a large reduction in the number of people who have relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study in 335 people); 
– may reduce the number of people who have relapses compared with dimethyl fumarate and natalizumab, but the evidence is uncertain (evidence from one study). 
There was no usable information on disability worsening, well‐being, and serious harmful effects. 
Rituximab as a first choice treatment in progressive MS: 
– likely results in little to no difference in the number of participants who have disability worsening over 24 months compared with pretend treatment (evidence from one study of 439 people); 
– the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of rituximab on well‐being and serious harmful effects. 
Rituximab as 'switching' for relapsing MS: 
– likely results in a large reduction in the number of people who have relapses compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study of 1383 people), and fingolimod (evidence from one study of 256 people). The evidence is very uncertain on the comparison of rituximab with natalizumab; 
– the evidence is very uncertain on disability worsening;
– likely increases slightly the number of people who have common infections compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (evidence from one study of 5477 people), and natalizumab (evidence from two studies of 5001 people). The evidence is uncertain for the comparisons of rituximab with fingolimod and ocrelizumab. 
There was no usable information on well‐being and serious harmful effects.
Rituximab as 'switching' for progressive MS 
Only three small studies investigated rituximab in secondary progressive MS. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of rituximab on disability worsening, well‐being, and serious harmful effects. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
– Limited confidence about the effect of rituximab on disability worsening in all forms of MS. 
– Limited information to determine the effect of rituximab for progressive forms of MS. 
– Studies were short with a median duration of 24 months.
How up to date is the evidence? 
This review is up to day to 31 January 2021.

Humour‐based interventions are defined as any intervention that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression, or appreciation of the absurdity or incongruity of life's situations. Humour‐based interventions can be implemented in different settings, including hospitals, nursing homes and day care centres. They have been posed as an adjunct to usual care for people with schizophrenia, but a summary of the evidence is lacking. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of humour‐based interventions as an add‐on intervention to standard care for people with schizophrenia. 
Search methods
On 31 July 2019 and 10 February 2021 we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study‐based register of trials, which is based on CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.Gov, Embase, ISRCTN, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and WHO ICTRP. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing humour‐based interventions with active controls, other psychological interventions, or standard care for people with schizophrenia. We excluded studies fulfilling our prespecified selection criteria but without useable data from further quantitative synthesis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality, following the guidance from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For binary outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean differences (MDs) and their 95% CIs. We assessed risks of bias for included studies and created summary of findings tables using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included three studies in this review for qualitative synthesis, although one study did not report any relevant outcomes. We therefore include two studies (n = 96) in our quantitative synthesis. No data were available on the following prespecified primary outcomes: clinically‐important change in general mental state, clinically‐important change in negative symptoms, clinically‐important change in overall quality of life, and adverse effects. As compared with active control, humour‐based interventions may not improve the average endpoint score of a general mental state scale (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score: MD −1.70, 95% CI −17.01 to 13.61; 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence); positive symptoms (PANSS positive symptom score: MD 0.00, 95% CI −2.58 to 2.58; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence), negative symptoms (PANSS negative symptom score: MD −0.70, 95% CI −4.22 to 2.82; 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence) and anxiety (State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI): MD −2.60, 95% CI −5.76 to 0.56; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence). Due to the small sample size, we remain uncertain about the effect of humour‐based interventions on leaving the study early as compared with active control (no event, 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence). On the other hand, humour‐based interventions may reduce depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): MD −6.20, 95% CI −12.08 to −0.32; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence). Compared with standard care, humour‐based interventions may not improve  depressive symptoms (BDI second edition: MD 0.80, 95% CI −2.64 to 4.24; 1 study, 59 participants; low certainty of evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of humour‐based interventions on leaving the study early for any reason compared with standard care (risk ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.80; 1 study, 66 participants; very low certainty of evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We are currently uncertain whether the evidence supports the use of humour‐based interventions in people with schizophrenia. Future research with rigorous and transparent methodology investigating clinically important outcomes is warranted. 
","Plain Title
Do humor groups help people with schizophrenia?

Rationale
Schizophrenia is a brain illness. It can make people hear or see things. It can also cause mixed up thoughts and strong fear. Life with this illness can be hard.

Most people get pills and talk therapy. These help, but some still have hard days. Many also feel sad or low in mood. They may feel alone.

Humor may help ease stress and low mood. Humor groups use jokes, play, or fun acts. The goal is to spark joy and a smile. Laughter can feel good and bring people close.

Doctors hoped humor could add to usual care. They thought it might lift mood. It might also help with daily life and social ties. It could be a safe add-on.

But past tests were not clear. We did not have a good summary of the proof. This study set out to fill that gap. The main idea: test if humor helps as an add-on.

Trial Design
This was a review of fair tests. In these tests, people were put in groups by chance. One group had humor sessions. The other group had usual care or another activity.

The team looked for all such trials. They searched many health study lists. They looked up to July 2019 and again in February 2021. They picked trials on people with schizophrenia.

They found three trials that fit. Only two trials had data they could use. These two trials had 96 people in all. One trial had 30 people. The other had about 60 people.

The trials compared humor to two things. One used another active group as a control. The other used standard, or usual, care. How long people stayed in each trial was not clear.

The team planned to look at key results. These were changes in symptoms, mood, and life quality. They also looked for side effects and people leaving the study early. They checked how sure we can be about the proof.

Results
What did the review find? The trials were few and small. The proof was low or very low. This means the results may change with better tests.

The review did not find data on some key points. It had no proof on big changes in overall mental state. It had no proof on big changes in low drive or social withdrawal. It did not find data on life quality. It did not find data on harms or side effects.

In one small trial, humor was matched with another active group. Humor did not change the main illness signs. It did not change “positive” signs, like hearing voices. It did not change “negative” signs, like low energy. It did not seem to cut fear and worry.

In that same trial, humor did help low mood scores. This means humor may lift depression in some. But this was one small group of 30 people. So we must be careful with that result.

In the other trial, humor was matched with usual care. In that case, humor did not help low mood scores. This adds doubt about the mood effect. Again, the proof was low.

People who took part were about as likely to leave early. We do not know if humor made people more or less likely to stop. The trials were too small to be sure. We also do not know about harms. The study reports gave no data on that.

What does this mean for patients? Today, we do not know if humor groups help core symptoms. These include hearing voices, mixed up thoughts, or low drive. Humor might help low mood in some people. But that is not clear yet.

What does this mean for care teams? Humor groups may feel warm and safe. People may enjoy time to laugh and share. But we still lack strong proof that they improve health outcomes. We also lack data on harms or side effects.

What is next for research? We need more and better trials. These trials should be larger and well planned. They should track what matters to people. This includes big changes in symptoms, mood, daily life, and any harm. Trials should also say how long they last and who took part.

Bottom line: The proof is not firm. We cannot say that humor groups help people with schizophrenia at this time. They may help with low mood for some, but we do not know for sure. If you wish to try a humor group, talk with your care team. Keep your usual care in place while you explore add-on options.","Humour‐based interventions for people with schizophrenia
Review question 
Are humour‐based interventions effective in treating people with schizophrenia?
Background 
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness. It is a disorder of thought, namely firm fixed false beliefs despite there being evidence to the contrary, loss of reality ties, and altered perception. These symptoms are further classified as (i) positive symptoms, such as speech without order, illusions or mistaken and persistent ideas; and (ii) negative symptoms, a lack of emotion or restricted quantity of speech; and decline in cognitive function, including attention, memory, and behavior control. The standard treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications. Treatment with humour‐based interventions, such as watching humorous movies, funny videos, or comedies, has been proposed as an add‐on treatment that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression, or appreciation of the irrationality or inconsistency of life's situations. 
Searching for evidence 
We ran an electronic search in February 2021 for trials that randomised people with schizophrenia to receive humour‐based interventions in addition to usual care, or to receive usual care only, another psychological intervention or a control condition. We found eight records and checked them for suitability to include in our review. 
Evidence found 
Three trials met the review requirements and two low‐quality trials (total number of participants = 96) provided useable data. Compared with active control, humour‐based interventions may not improve positive symptoms and anxiety, but may improve depressive symptoms. However, when compared with standard care, humour‐based intervention may not improve the depressive symptoms. Current evidence is very limited and is of low to very low quality. We are uncertain as to whether humour‐based interventions may lead to clinically‐important improvement in mental state or quality of life in people with schizophrenia. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient research evidence to support the use of humour‐based interventions in people with schizophrenia.

10.1002-14651858.CD013186,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) are high‐risk skin cancers which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early curable cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Computer‐assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems use artificial intelligence to analyse lesion data and arrive at a diagnosis of skin cancer. When used in unreferred settings ('primary care'), CAD may assist general practitioners (GPs) or other clinicians to more appropriately triage high‐risk lesions to secondary care. Used alongside clinical and dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, CAD may reduce unnecessary excisions without missing melanoma cases. 
Objectives
To determine the accuracy of CAD systems for diagnosing cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, BCC or cSCC in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of dermoscopy. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design that evaluated CAD alone, or in comparison with dermoscopy, in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma or BCC or cSCC, and compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities separately by type of CAD system, using the bivariate hierarchical model. We compared CAD with dermoscopy using (a) all available CAD data (indirect comparisons), and (b) studies providing paired data for both tests (direct comparisons). We tested the contribution of human decision‐making to the accuracy of CAD diagnoses in a sensitivity analysis by removing studies that gave CAD results to clinicians to guide diagnostic decision‐making. 
Main results
We included 42 studies, 24 evaluating digital dermoscopy‐based CAD systems (Derm–CAD) in 23 study cohorts with 9602 lesions (1220 melanomas, at least 83 BCCs, 9 cSCCs), providing 32 datasets for Derm–CAD and seven for dermoscopy. Eighteen studies evaluated spectroscopy‐based CAD (Spectro–CAD) in 16 study cohorts with 6336 lesions (934 melanomas, 163 BCC, 49 cSCCs), providing 32 datasets for Spectro–CAD and six for dermoscopy. These consisted of 15 studies using multispectral imaging (MSI), two studies using electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and one study using diffuse‐reflectance spectroscopy. Studies were incompletely reported and at unclear to high risk of bias across all domains. Included studies inadequately address the review question, due to an abundance of low‐quality studies, poor reporting, and recruitment of highly selected groups of participants. 
Across all CAD systems, we found considerable variation in the hardware and software technologies used, the types of classification algorithm employed, methods used to train the algorithms, and which lesion morphological features were extracted and analysed across all CAD systems, and even between studies evaluating CAD systems. Meta–analysis found CAD systems had high sensitivity for correct identification of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in highly selected populations, but with low and very variable specificity, particularly for Spectro–CAD systems. Pooled data from 22 studies estimated the sensitivity of Derm–CAD for the detection of melanoma as 90.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 84.0% to 94.0%) and specificity as 74.3% (95% CI 63.6% to 82.7%). Pooled data from eight studies estimated the sensitivity of multispectral imaging CAD (MSI–CAD) as 92.9% (95% CI 83.7% to 97.1%) and specificity as 43.6% (95% CI 24.8% to 64.5%). When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the mean observed melanoma prevalence of 20%, Derm–CAD would miss 20 melanomas and would lead to 206 false‐positive results for melanoma. MSI–CAD would miss 14 melanomas and would lead to 451 false diagnoses for melanoma. Preliminary findings suggest CAD systems are at least as sensitive as assessment of dermoscopic images for the diagnosis of invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants. We are unable to make summary statements about the use of CAD in unreferred populations, or its accuracy in detecting keratinocyte cancers, or its use in any setting as a diagnostic aid, because of the paucity of studies. 
Authors' conclusions
In highly selected patient populations all CAD types demonstrate high sensitivity, and could prove useful as a back‐up for specialist diagnosis to assist in minimising the risk of missing melanomas. However, the evidence base is currently too poor to understand whether CAD system outputs translate to different clinical decision–making in practice. Insufficient data are available on the use of CAD in community settings, or for the detection of keratinocyte cancers. The evidence base for individual systems is too limited to draw conclusions on which might be preferred for practice. Prospective comparative studies are required that evaluate the use of already evaluated CAD systems as diagnostic aids, by comparison to face–to–face dermoscopy, and in participant populations that are representative of those in which the test would be used in practice.

Can computer tools help doctors find skin cancer early?

Rationale
Skin cancer is common and can be deadly. Melanoma can spread to other parts fast. Squamous cell skin cancer can spread as well. Basal cell skin cancer grows slow but can harm skin.

Doctors want to find cancer early and not miss it. But they also want to avoid cuts on safe spots. A small light scope helps doctors see a spot up close. A computer tool may read the images and flag risk. It can look for tiny color and shape clues.

Trial Design
This study is a review of many past studies. The team looked for studies up to August 2016. They searched many medical lists and trial sites. They also checked past review papers and their lists.

They picked studies in adults with risky skin spots. Doctors thought these spots might be melanoma or others. The tests used computer tools or a small light scope. Results used lab checks after removal or clinic follow up. The report did not say how long people stayed in studies.

Two main tool types were in the review. One read close-up skin photos from the light scope. We call this Derm-CAD in this summary. The other used light scans or tiny safe current. We call this Spectro-CAD in this summary.

Results
The review found 42 studies. Twenty four studies tested Derm-CAD in 23 groups. These groups had 9602 skin spots. 1220 of these were melanoma. Some were basal cell or squamous cell cancer.

Eighteen studies tested Spectro-CAD in 16 groups. They had 6336 skin spots. 934 of these were melanoma. Some were basal cell skin cancer. Some were squamous cell skin cancer.

The tools and methods were not the same. Many reports left out key facts. Many studies had limits that can skew results. People in the studies were a very select group. Most took place in skin expert clinics.

In these select groups, CAD found most melanomas. But CAD also raised many false alarms. Spectro-CAD had more false alarms than Derm-CAD. Here is what the numbers may mean.

Picture 1000 skin spots like in these studies. About 200 would be melanoma. With Derm-CAD, about 20 melanomas would be missed. 206 spots would be false alarms for melanoma.

With a kind of light scan tool, about 14 would be missed. 451 spots would be false alarms for melanoma. A false alarm means a spot is flagged but not cancer. A missed case means a cancer is not flagged.

CAD seemed at least as good as a light scope exam. This was true for finding melanoma in those groups. But there were too few strong studies to be sure. We do not know how CAD works in family clinics. We do not know how well CAD finds other skin cancers.

We cannot say which tool or brand is best. We also do not know if CAD changes doctor choices. CAD may help skin experts as a back-up check. It may help lower missed melanomas. We need better tests in real life clinics.

New studies should compare CAD with face-to-face exams. They should test people like those seen in daily care. They should use clear steps and full reports. They should track wrong alarms and missed cases.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of computer‐assisted diagnosis techniques for the detection of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms. If it is not recognised early treatment can be delayed and this risks the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body and may eventually lead to death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and BCC are considered less dangerous, as they are localised (less likely to spread to other parts of the body compared to melanoma). However, cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) might result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations and can cause stress and anxiety to the patient. Missing a diagnosis of skin cancer may result in the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate computer–assisted diagnosis (CAD) is for diagnosing melanoma, BCC or cSCC. The review also compared the accuracy of two different types of CAD, and compared the accuracy of CAD with diagnosis by a doctor using a handheld illuminated microscope (a dermatoscope or ‘dermoscopy’). We included 42 studies to answer these questions. 
What was studied in the review? 
A number of tools are available to skin cancer specialists which allow a more detailed examination of the skin compared to examination by the naked eye alone. Currently a dermatoscope which magnifies the skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) using a bright light source is used by most skin cancer specialists. CAD tests are computer systems that analyse information about skin lesions obtained from a dermatoscope or other techniques that use light to describe the features of a skin lesion (spectroscopy) to produce a result indicating whether skin cancer is likely to be present. We included CAD systems that get their information from dermoscopic images of lesions (Derm–CAD), or that use data from spectroscopy. Most of the spectroscopy studies used data from multispectral imaging (MSI–CAD) and are the main focus here. When a skin cancer specialist finds a lesion is suspicious using visual examination with or without additional dermoscopy, results from CAD systems can be used alone to make a diagnosis of skin cancer (CAD–based diagnosis), or can be used by doctors in addition to their visual inspection examination of a skin lesion to help them reach a diagnosis (CAD–aided diagnosis). Researchers examined how useful CAD systems are to help diagnose skin cancers in addition to visual inspection and dermoscopy. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included 42 studies looking at CAD systems for the diagnosis of melanoma. There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of CAD systems for the diagnosis of BCC (3 studies) or cSCC (1 study). 
Derm‐CAD results for diagnosis of melanoma  
The main results for Derm‐CAD are based on 22 studies including 8992 lesions.
Applied to a group of 1000 skin lesions, of which 200 (20%) are given a final diagnosis* of melanoma, the results suggest that: 
‐ An estimated 386 people will have a Derm–CAD result suggesting that a melanoma is present, and of these 206 (53%) will not actually have a melanoma (false‐positive result) 
‐ Of the 614 people with a Derm–CAD result indicating that no melanoma is present, 20 (3%) will in fact actually have a melanoma (false‐negative result) 
There was no evidence to suggest that dermoscopy or Derm–CAD was different in its ability to detect or rule out melanoma. 
MSI‐CAD results for diagnosis of melanoma  
The main results for MSI–CAD are based on eight studies including 2401 lesions. In a group of 1000 people, of whom 200 (20%) actually do have melanoma*, then: 
‐ An estimated 637 people will have an MSI–CAD result suggesting that a melanoma is present, and of these 451 (71%) will not actually have a melanoma (false‐positive result) 
‐ Of the 363 people with an MSI–CAD result indicating that no melanoma is present, 14 (4%) will in fact have a melanoma (false‐negative result) 
MSI–CAD detects more melanomas, but possibly produces more false‐positive results (an increase in unnecessary surgery). 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
Incomplete reporting of studies made it difficult for us to judge how reliable they were. Many studies had important limitations. Some studies only included particular types of skin lesions or excluded lesions that were considered difficult to diagnose. Importantly, most of the studies only included skin lesions with a biopsy result, which means that only a sample of lesions that would be seen by a doctor in practice were included. These characteristics may result in CAD systems appearing more or less accurate than they actually are. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were largely conducted in Europe (29, 69%) and North America (8, 19%). Mean age (reported in 6/42 studies) ranged from 32 to 49 years for melanoma. The percentage of people with a final diagnosis of melanoma ranged from 1% to 52%. It was not always possible to tell whether suspicion of skin cancer in study participants was based on clinical examination alone, or both clinical and dermoscopic examinations. Almost all studies were done in people with skin lesions who were seen at specialist clinics rather than by doctors in primary care. 
What are the implications of this review? 
CAD systems appear to be accurate for identification of melanomas in skin lesions that have already been selected for excision on the basis of clinical examination (visual inspection and dermoscopy). It is possible that some CAD systems identify more melanomas than doctors using dermoscopy images. However, CAD systems also produced far more false‐positive diagnoses than dermoscopy, and could lead to considerable increases in unnecessary surgery. The performance of CAD systems for detecting BCC and cSCC skin cancers is unclear. More studies are needed to evaluate the use of CAD by doctors for the diagnosis of skin cancer in comparison to face‐to‐face diagnosis using dermoscopy, both in primary care and in specialist skin cancer clinics. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow up, or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference standards (means of establishing the final diagnosis).

10.1002-14651858.CD013193,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are high‐risk skin cancers which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early curable cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Teledermatology provides a way for generalist clinicians to access the opinion of a specialist dermatologist for skin lesions that they consider to be suspicious without referring the patients through the normal referral pathway. Teledermatology consultations can be 'store‐and‐forward' with electronic digital images of a lesion sent to a dermatologist for review at a later time, or can be live and interactive consultations using videoconferencing to connect the patient, referrer and dermatologist in real time. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of teledermatology for the detection of any skin cancer (melanoma, BCC or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)) in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of in‐person diagnosis. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CPCI, Zetoc, Science Citation Index, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies evaluating skin cancer diagnosis for teledermatology alone, or in comparison with face‐to‐face diagnosis by a specialist clinician, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up and expert opinion. We also included studies evaluating the referral accuracy of teledermatology compared with a reference standard of face‐to‐face diagnosis by a specialist clinician. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where there were information related to the target condition of any skin cancer missing. Data permitting, we estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. Due to the scarcity of data, we undertook no covariate investigations for this review. For illustrative purposes, we plotted estimates of sensitivity and specificity on coupled forest plots for diagnostic threshold and target condition under consideration. 
Main results
The review included 22 studies reporting diagnostic accuracy data for 4057 lesions and 879 malignant cases (16 studies) and referral accuracy data for reported data for 1449 lesions and 270 'positive' cases as determined by the reference standard face‐to‐face decision (six studies). Methodological quality was variable with poor reporting hindering assessment. The overall risk of bias was high or unclear for participant selection, reference standard, and participant flow and timing in at least half of all studies; the majority were at low risk of bias for the index test. The applicability of study findings were of high or unclear concern for most studies in all domains assessed due to the recruitment of participants from secondary care settings or specialist clinics rather than from primary or community‐based settings in which teledermatology is more likely to be used and due to the acquisition of lesion images by dermatologists or in specialist imaging units rather than by primary care clinicians. 
Seven studies provided data for the primary target condition of any skin cancer (1588 lesions and 638 malignancies). For the correct diagnosis of lesions as malignant using photographic images, summary sensitivity was 94.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 90.1% to 97.4%) and summary specificity was 84.3% (95% CI 48.5% to 96.8%) (from four studies). Individual study estimates using dermoscopic images or a combination of photographic and dermoscopic images generally suggested similarly high sensitivities with highly variable specificities. Limited comparative data suggested similar diagnostic accuracy between teledermatology assessment and in‐person diagnosis by a dermatologist; however, data were too scarce to draw firm conclusions. For the detection of invasive melanoma or atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants both sensitivities and specificities were more variable. Sensitivities ranged from 59% (95% CI 42% to 74%) to 100% (95% CI 48% to 100%) and specificities from 30% (95% CI 22% to 40%) to 100% (95% CI 93% to 100%), with reported diagnostic thresholds including the correct diagnosis of melanoma, classification of lesions as 'atypical' or 'typical, and the decision to refer or to excise a lesion. 
Referral accuracy data comparing teledermatology against a face‐to‐face reference standard suggested good agreement for lesions considered to require some positive action by face‐to‐face assessment (sensitivities of over 90%). For lesions considered of less concern when assessed face‐to‐face (e.g. for lesions not recommended for excision or referral), agreement was more variable with teledermatology specificities ranging from 57% (95% CI 39% to 73%) to 100% (95% CI 86% to 100%), suggesting that remote assessment is more likely recommend excision, referral or follow‐up compared to in‐person decisions. 
Authors' conclusions
Studies were generally small and heterogeneous and methodological quality was difficult to judge due to poor reporting. Bearing in mind concerns regarding the applicability of study participants and of lesion image acquisition in specialist settings, our results suggest that teledermatology can correctly identify the majority of malignant lesions. Using a more widely defined threshold to identify 'possibly' malignant cases or lesions that should be considered for excision is likely to appropriately triage those lesions requiring face‐to‐face assessment by a specialist. Despite the increasing use of teledermatology on an international level, the evidence base to support its ability to accurately diagnose lesions and to triage lesions from primary to secondary care is lacking and further prospective and pragmatic evaluation is needed.

Remote skin checks for skin cancer: how well do they work?

Rationale
Skin cancer is common. Some types, like melanoma and squamous cell skin cancer, can spread and kill. Another type, basal cell skin cancer, can grow and harm skin and tissue. Many skin spots are not cancer at all. It is hard to know which ones to worry about.

Early find is key. A skin doctor can spot danger signs. But many people wait a long time to see one. Teledermatology may help. In teledermatology, a doctor sends skin photos or video to a skin doctor. The skin doctor gives advice from far away.

There are two ways to do this. One way is store-and-forward. A clinic takes pictures and sends them for later review. The other way is live video. The skin doctor, the clinic, and the patient talk by video in real time. This study asked: Can these remote checks find skin cancer well? Can they guide who needs to see a skin doctor in person?

The team thought remote checks could find most skin cancers. They also thought remote checks might send more people for more tests. That can be good if it helps catch cancer early. It can be hard if it leads to extra cuts or visits that are not needed.

Trial Design
This was not one single trial. It was a review of many past studies. The team searched many data bases. They looked for studies up to August 2016. They checked lists of other reviews, too.

The review looked at adults with skin spots. Some spots were cancer. Some were not. The team compared remote skin checks to in-person care by a skin doctor. They also checked how remote advice matched lab tests on tissue from a spot. This lab test is called a biopsy. In a biopsy, a small piece of the spot is cut out and checked under a scope. Some studies used close-up lens photos, called dermoscopy. This tool shows skin lines and dots in fine detail.

In all, the review found 22 studies. These studies had 4057 skin spots. Of these, 879 were cancer. Seven studies looked at “any skin cancer” as the main goal. These seven had 1588 spots. Of these, 638 were cancer. Six studies looked at how well remote checks sent people to the right next step.

Many studies took place in special skin clinics. In many cases, a skin doctor took the photos. In day to day care, a family doctor or nurse may take the photos. The studies did not give one set time that each person was in a study. There was no study drug or device to test. Two team members checked the study data and the study quality.

Results
Main finding: Remote skin checks can find most skin cancers. When doctors used regular photos, they found about 95 out of 100 true skin cancers. They also called about 84 out of 100 non-cancer spots “not cancer.” This second number varied a lot across studies. When doctors used close-up lens photos, the ability to find cancer stayed high. But the calls on non-cancer spots still varied a lot.

For melanoma alone, the results were mixed. Some studies found as low as about 59 out of 100 melanomas. Some found as high as 100 out of 100. For non-cancer spots in these melanoma tests, correct calls ranged from about 30 out of 100 to 100 out of 100. This shows results for melanoma can swing a lot from one study to the next.

Remote checks and in-person care had similar skill in some studies. But there were not enough data to make a firm call on this.

The review also asked: Do remote checks send people to the right next step? For spots that in-person care said “needs action,” remote checks agreed most of the time. In these cases, remote checks made the “needs action” call in over 90 out of 100 spots. For spots that in-person care said “no action,” the match was not as strong. Remote checks said “take action” more often. In simple words, remote care is more likely to say “get a biopsy,” “refer,” or “follow up.” That can mean more peace of mind. It can also mean more extra visits or cuts that may not be needed.

These results matter for real life care. Remote skin checks can help sort who needs a fast in-person visit. This may help people get care sooner. It may also help clinics with long wait lists. A family doctor can send a photo and get fast advice from a skin doctor.

There are limits to the proof. Many studies were small. Many did not report all key parts well. Many used photos taken by skin experts in skin clinics. Day to day use may be in a family clinic with staff who are not skin experts. So the results may look better than what most people will get. Also, the studies used many ways to judge a spot. This makes it hard to compare across studies.

What does this mean for you? Remote skin checks can help flag most skin cancers. They can help decide who needs an in-person visit or a biopsy. They may also lead to more extra checks. Talk with your doctor about which path is best for you. Good photos and clear notes can help a lot.

The authors say we need more real-world tests. These should take place in family care sites. They should use photos taken by non-specialists. They should follow people forward in time. This will show how well remote checks work in day to day care.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of teledermatology for the diagnosis of skin cancer in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are different types of skin cancer. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms and it is important to identify it early so that it can be removed. If it is not recognised when first brought to the attention of doctors (also known as a false‐negative test result) treatment can be delayed resulting in the melanoma spreading to other organs in the body and possibly causing early death. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are usually localised skin cancers, although cSCC can spread to other parts of the body and BCC can cause disfigurement if not recognised early. Calling something a skin cancer when it is not really a skin cancer (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery and other investigations that can cause stress and worry to the patient. Making the correct diagnosis is important. Mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether teledermatology is accurate enough to identify which people with skin lesions need to be referred to see a specialist dermatologist (a doctor concerned with disease of the skin) and who can be safely reassured that their lesion (damage or change of the skin) is not malignant. We included 22 studies to answer this question. 
What was studied in the review? 
Teledermatology means sending pictures of skin lesions or rashes to a specialist for advice on diagnosis or management. It is a way for primary care doctors (general practitioners (GPs)) to get an opinion from a specialist dermatologist without having to refer patients through the normal referral pathway. Teledermatology can involve sending photographs or magnified images of a skin lesion taken with a special camera (dermatoscope) to a skin specialist to look at or it might involve immediate discussion about a skin lesion between a GP and a skin specialist using videoconferencing. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review included 22 studies, 16 studies comparing teledermatology diagnoses to the final lesion diagnoses (diagnostic accuracy) for 4057 lesions and 879 malignant cases and five studies comparing teledermatology decisions to the decisions that would be made with the patient present (referral accuracy) for 1449 lesions and 270 'positive' cases. 
The studies were very different from each other in terms of the types of people with suspicious skin cancer lesions included and the type of teledermatology used. A single reliable estimate of the accuracy of teledermatology could not be made. For the correct diagnosis of a lesion to be a skin cancer, data suggested that less than 7% of malignant skin lesions were missed by teledermatology. Study results were too variable to tell us how many people would be referred unnecessarily for a specialist dermatology appointment following a teledermatology consultation. Without access to teledermatology services however, most of the lesions included in these studies would likely be referred to a dermatologist. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
In the included studies, the final diagnosis of skin cancer was made by lesion biopsy (taking a small sample of the lesion so it could be examined under a microscope) and the absence of skin cancer was confirmed by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer. In a few studies, a diagnosis of no skin cancer was made by a skin specialist rather than biopsy. This is less likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether people really had skin cancer*. Poor reporting of what was done in the study made it difficult for us to say how reliable the study results are. Selecting some patients from specialist clinics instead of primary care along with different ways of doing teledermatology were common problems. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in: Europe (64%), North America (18%), South America (9%) or Oceania (9%). The average age of people who were studied was 52 years; however, several studies included at least some people under the age of 16 years. The percentage of people with skin cancer ranged between 2% and 88% with an average of 30%, which is much higher than would be observed in a primary care setting in the UK. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Teledermatology is likely to be a good way of helping GPs to decide which skin lesions need to be seen by a skin specialist. Our review suggests that using magnified images, in addition to photographs of the lesion, improves accuracy. More research is needed to establish the best way of providing teledermatology services. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow‐up or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference comparisons.

10.1002-14651858.CD013479,"Background
Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in many countries, although the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines given as a three‐dose schedule are effective in the prevention of precancerous lesions of the cervix in women. Simpler immunisation schedules, such as those with fewer doses, might reduce barriers to vaccination, as may programmes that include males. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of different dose schedules and different types of HPV vaccines in females and males. 
Search methods
We conducted electronic searches on 27 September 2018 in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library), and Ovid Embase. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov (both 27 September 2018), vaccine manufacturer websites, and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restriction. We considered studies if they enrolled HIV‐negative males or females aged 9 to 26 years, or HIV‐positive males or females of any age. 
Data collection and analysis
We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products containing an adjuvant or active vaccine and 'placebo' to refer to products that contain no adjuvant or active vaccine. Most primary outcomes in this review were clinical outcomes. However, for comparisons comparing dose schedules, the included RCTs were designed to measure antibody responses (i.e. immunogenicity) as the primary outcome, rather than clinical outcomes, since it is unethical to collect cervical samples from girls under 16 years of age. We analysed immunogenicity outcomes (i.e. geometric mean titres) with ratios of means, clinical outcomes (e.g. cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia) with risk ratios or rate ratios and, for serious adverse events and deaths, we calculated odds ratios. We rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE. 
Main results
We included 20 RCTs with 31,940 participants. The length of follow‐up in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years. 
Two doses versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 15‐year‐old females 
Antibody responses after two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules were similar after up to five years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected clinical outcome data. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing dose schedules was of very low‐certainty owing to imprecision and indirectness (three doses 35/1159; two doses 36/1158; 4 RCTs). One death was reported in the three‐dose group (1/898) and none in the two‐dose group (0/899) (low‐certainty evidence). 
Interval between doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 14‐year‐old females and males 
Antibody responses were stronger with a longer interval (6 or 12 months) between the first two doses of HPV vaccine than a shorter interval (2 or 6 months) at up to three years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected data about clinical outcomes. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing intervals was of very low‐certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. No deaths were reported in any of the studies (0/1898, 3 RCTs, low‐certainty evidence). 
HPV vaccination of 10‐ to 26‐year‐old males 
In one RCT there was moderate‐certainty evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control, reduced the incidence of external genital lesions (control 36 per 3081 person‐years; quadrivalent 6 per 3173 person‐years; rate ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 6254 person‐years) and anogenital warts (control 28 per 2814 person‐years; quadrivalent 3 per 2831 person‐years; rate ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; 5645 person‐years). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection‐site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (537 versus 601 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18, 3895 participants, high‐certainty evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence from two RCTs about serious adverse events with quadrivalent vaccine (control 12/2588; quadrivalent 8/2574), and about deaths (control 11/2591; quadrivalent 3/2582), owing to imprecision and indirectness. 
Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9‐ to 26‐year‐old females and males 
Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9‐ to 15‐years (n = 600), one in females aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 500). The RCT in 16‐ to 26‐year‐old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high‐grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high‐certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Comparative evidence about serious adverse events in the three RCTs (nonavalent 243/8234, quadrivalent 192/7629; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.61) was of low certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. 
HPV vaccination for people living with HIV 
Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low‐certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness. 
Authors' conclusions
The immunogenicity of two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules, measured using antibody responses in young females, is comparable. The quadrivalent vaccine probably reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males compared with control. The nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines offer similar protection against a combined outcome of cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions or cancer. In people living with HIV, both the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in high antibody responses. For all comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, the certainty of the body of evidence about serious adverse events reported during the study periods was low or very low, either because the number of events was low, or the evidence was indirect, or both. Post‐marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms that might be associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and this evidence will be incorporated in future updates of this review. Long‐term observational studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of reduced‐dose schedules against HPV‐related cancer endpoints, and whether adopting these schedules improves vaccine coverage rates.

HPV shots: how many, which kind, and who they help

2. Rationale
HPV is a common virus. It can cause warts. It can also lead to cancer. In women, it can cause changes in the cervix. The cervix is the low end of the womb.

HPV shots can help stop these health problems. But many people do not get all their shots. A plan with three shots can be hard to finish.

Fewer shots may be easier to get. Giving shots to boys may help more people. This study looked at these ideas. It asked: Do fewer shots work as well? Does the space between shots matter? Do different kinds of HPV shots work the same? How do people with HIV respond to the shots?

3. Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. The team searched health study lists up to late 2018. They found 20 high‑quality trials. These trials had 31,940 people in total.

The trials enrolled girls and boys age 9 to 26. Some trials enrolled people with HIV of any age. HIV is a virus that harms the body’s defenses. The trials took place over seven months to five years.

Some trials looked at two shots vs three shots. Some looked at a short gap vs a long gap between shots. Some compared shot types. Two types protect against 2 HPV types. Four types protect against 4 types. Nine types protect against 9 types. Some trials looked at shots in boys and men. Some looked at people with HIV.

The trials tracked health events. These include warts, skin growths, and signs of pre‑cancer. They also checked blood for “antibodies.” Antibodies are proteins that fight germs. A strong “immune response” means the shot made more of these proteins. Trials also tracked side effects. In girls under 16, they did not test the cervix.

4. Results
Two vs three shots in girls age 9 to 15:
Two shots made about the same antibody levels as three shots. This held for up to five years. We do not know if two shots stop pre‑cancer or cancer. These trials did not test that in young girls.

Serious side effects were rare in these trials. But we are not sure about the risk. There were too few events to be clear. One death took place in a three‑shot group. None took place in a two‑shot group. We cannot say if the shot caused this. The data do not show that.

Time between shots in girls and boys age 9 to 14:
A longer gap between the first two shots worked better. It made stronger antibody levels. This held for up to three years. We do not know if this led to fewer warts or less cancer yet. Trials did not test that.

Serious side effects were rare here too. We are still not sure about the risk. No deaths were seen in these trials.

HPV shots in males age 10 to 26:
One trial tested the four‑type shot in males. It cut the number of skin growths on sex organs. It also cut the number of genital warts. A control shot group had more of these problems.

More pain and red skin at the shot site did occur. This was more common with the four‑type shot than control. We do not know if the shot raised the chance of rare, serious harms. The data here were not clear.

Nine‑type vs four‑type shots in people age 9 to 26:
One large trial in young women tested health events. The nine‑type and four‑type shots worked about the same. They gave similar protection from high‑grade pre‑cancer or cancer of the cervix.

Two other trials only checked antibody levels. The nine‑type shot caused a few more sore arms and red skin. Serious side effects were rare in these trials. But we cannot say which shot gives fewer rare, serious harms. There were too few events to be sure.

HPV shots for people with HIV:
Seven trials looked at people with HIV. Two small trials checked health events. The shots raised antibody levels more than control shots. In children with HIV, this lasted up to two years.

We do not know if shots cut warts or cancer in people with HIV yet. Trials were small. There were not enough events to be sure about harms either.

What this means for patients and families:
Two shots in young girls seem to work as well as three shots. They make strong, long‑lasting antibodies. A longer gap between doses seems to help the body more. This could make shot plans easier to finish.

In males, the four‑type shot lowers the chance of warts. It also lowers other skin growths on sex organs. This can help boys and men.

In young women, the nine‑type and four‑type shots protect about the same. The nine‑type shot may cause a few more sore arms.

In people with HIV, HPV shots make strong antibodies. We still need more data on long‑term health results.

Across all trials, most side effects were mild. Sore arms and red skin were the most common. Rare, serious harms were hard to judge. There were too few events to be sure.

Doctors and public health teams still need to track safety over time. We also need long‑term follow‑up. We must learn if two shots can stop cancer later in life. We must also learn if simpler plans help more people get the shot.

These results can guide patients, parents, and doctors now. They show that fewer shots may work well. They show that boys gain clear benefit. They show that both shot types help protect young women. They also show where we still need more answers.","Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines and the number of doses administered to prevent HPV‐related disease in females and males 
Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a group of viruses that infect the skin and mucous membranes. Some types of HPV are sexually transmitted and are common in young people. Most infections will be cleared by the immune system, but some people will experience persistent infection with certain HPV types that go on to cause abnormalities in infected cells. These changes are called 'precancerous' because they can develop into cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anal canal, penis, and head and neck. Infection with other HPV types causes warts in the genital area or around the anus. 
Vaccination aims to prevent future HPV infections. Three HPV vaccines are in use – a bivalent one (protects against two HPV types), a quadrivalent one (protects against four HPV types), and a nonavalent one (protects against nine HPV types). In women, three doses of the bivalent or the quadrivalent HPV vaccines protect against precancer of the cervix caused by the HPV types contained in the vaccine. Evidence about the nonavalent vaccine, about the effects of the quadrivalent vaccine in males, and about the effects of HPV vaccines in people with HIV infection, has not yet been reviewed thoroughly. Uptake of HPV vaccines remains low in many countries. Simpler vaccine schedules, or giving the vaccine to both girls and boys, could increase the number of people being vaccinated. 
Trials of HPV vaccines are not always designed to collect data about precancer and cancer, for several reasons. Firstly, HPV vaccine is routinely given before girls become sexually active, and it is not ethical to take specimens from the cervix of girls who have not had sex. Secondly, HPV‐related precancer and cancer are rare and do not develop until years after HPV infection has occurred. Thirdly, participants in a trial will be offered treatment if precancer develops, so progression to cervical cancer would be even rarer, even without vaccination. An international committee of experts states that, in some circumstances, antibody levels (i.e. showing a strong immune system response), can be used to demonstrate protection against cervical and anal cancer. The antibody levels following vaccination in a trial should not be lower than those found in other studies on adults in whom the vaccine has been shown to protect against severe HPV‐related cervical or anal disease. 
Review question(s) 
How effective or harmful are different HPV vaccine schedules (i.e. number and timing of doses) and different HPV vaccines in females and males? 
Main results 
These results are based on research evidence to 27 September 2018. We analysed 20 studies involving 31,940 people. 
Studies comparing two doses of HPV vaccine to three doses, or comparing the time interval between doses, focus on immune system responses rather than infection or disease outcomes. Two doses of HPV vaccine result in similar immune system responses to three doses, and a longer interval (up to 12 months) between doses gives a stronger immune system response than a shorter interval. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the vaccine schedules for serious adverse events and death. 
In 16‐ to 26‐year‐old men, one study showed evidence of moderate certainty that a quadrivalent HPV vaccine provides better protection against external genital lesions and genital warts than a dummy treatment (control). In 16‐ to 26‐year‐old women, one study showed that the nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines provide the same levels of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer (high‐certainty evidence). 
There was evidence that the quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more local adverse events (such as pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site) than a control treatment in males, and that the nonavalent vaccine resulted in more local adverse events than the quadrivalent vaccine in males and females. Evidence about serious adverse events and deaths from studies comparing different HPV vaccine types or dose schedules was of low or very low‐certainty. 
In people living with HIV, HPV vaccines result in reasonable levels of immune system response, but evidence about their effects on persistent HPV infection or HPV‐related disease outcomes and harms is limited. 
Certainty of the evidence 
No major issues were identified with the methodological quality of the studies for the measurements of infection and disease outcomes, or for immune system responses. Our certainty in the evidence about serious harms and deaths across all the studies comparing different HPV vaccines and vaccine schedules is low, either because of their low frequency, or because the evidence is indirect, or both. Evidence graded as high certainty means that we were confident that further research is unlikely to change our findings. Moderate‐certainty evidence means that there is a possibility that further research may have an important effect on our findings, whilst low‐certainty evidence means that our confidence was limited and further research may have an important impact on our findings. Very low‐certainty evidence means that we were uncertain about the result. 
Conclusion 
A two‐dose schedule of HPV vaccines in young females results in immune system responses that are comparable with a three‐dose schedule. In males, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine appears to be effective in the prevention of external genital lesions and genital warts. Quadrivalent and nonavalent HPV vaccines in young women result in similar levels of protection against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer. Evidence about the efficacy and harms in people living with HIV is limited. Further long‐term population‐level studies are needed to continue monitoring safety of these vaccines, to determine for how long two doses of vaccine can provide protection against HPV‐related disease, the effect against HPV‐related cancer, and whether a two‐dose immunisation schedule will increase vaccine coverage.

10.1002-14651858.CD015374,"Background
Human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a severe disease affecting people in the poorest parts of Africa. It is usually fatal without treatment. Conventional treatments require days of intravenous infusion, but a recently developed drug, fexinidazole, can be given orally. Another oral drug candidate, acoziborole, is undergoing clinical development and will be considered in subsequent editions.   
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of currently used drugs for treating second‐stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense trypanosomiasis (gambiense human African trypanosomiasis, g‐HAT). 
Search methods
On 14 May 2021, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database, BIOSIS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also searched reference lists of included studies, contacted researchers working in the field, and contacted relevant organizations. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials that included adults and children with second‐stage g‐HAT, treated with anti‐trypanosomal drugs currently in use. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias; a third review author acted as an arbitrator if needed. The included trial only reported dichotomous outcomes, which we presented as risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).   
Main results
We included one trial comparing fexinidazole to nifurtimox combined with eflornithine (NECT). This trial was conducted between October 2012 and November 2016 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic, and included 394 participants. The study reported on efficacy and safety, with up to 24 months' follow‐up.  We judged the study to be at low risk of bias in all domains except blinding;  as the route of administration and dosing regimens differed between treatment groups,  participants and personnel were not blinded, resulting in a high risk of performance bias.   
Mortality with fexinidazole may be higher at 24 months compared to NECT. There were 9/264 deaths in the fexinidazole group and 2/130 deaths in the NECT group (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.49 to 10.11; 394 participants; low‐certainty evidence). None of the deaths were related to treatment. 
Fexinidazole likely results in an increase in the number of people relapsing during follow‐up, with 14 participants in the fexinidazole group (14/264) and none in the NECT group (0/130) relapsing at 24 months (RD 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.08; 394 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
 We are uncertain whether there is any difference between the drugs regarding the incidence of serious adverse events at 24 months. (31/264 with fexinidazole and 13/130 with NECT group at 24 months). Adverse events were common with both drugs (247/264 with fexinidazole versus 121/130 with NECT), with no difference between groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; 394 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Authors' conclusions
Oral treatment with fexinidazole is much easier to administer than conventional treatment, but deaths and relapse appear to be more common. However, the advantages or an oral option are considerable, in terms of convenience, avoiding hospitalisation and multiple intravenous infusions, thus increasing adherence.

A pill for sleeping sickness versus the usual hospital treatment

Rationale
Sleeping sickness is a very serious illness in parts of Africa. Without care, many people die. Care can be hard to get. Usual drugs often need many days in a hospital. They go in by a drip into a vein.

A new drug, fexinidazole, is a pill. A pill may help more people get care. It may also help people stay on the plan. This study asked: Does this pill work as well, and is it safe?

Doctors need clear facts to choose the best care. A pill is easier to give and take. It may also lower travel and hospital time. Another pill, acoziborole, is still in testing and not in this report.

Trial Design
The team looked for the best type of trials. In these trials, people go into groups by chance. The team searched many medical lists on May 14, 2021. They looked for trials in people with later stage sleeping sickness.

They found one trial that met their rules. The trial took place in the Congo and the Central African Republic. It ran from 2012 to 2016. It had 394 people with this illness. The trial compared two care plans.

One group took fexinidazole as a pill. The other group got NECT, the usual care. NECT uses two drugs, nifurtimox and eflornithine. It needs many drips into a vein in a hospital.

People and staff knew which care they got. This is because the care types were very different. The team checked how people did for up to 24 months. That is about two years. The abstract did not list ages or gender.

Results
Deaths by two years were low in both groups. But more deaths happened in the pill group. Nine of 264 people on fexinidazole died. Two of 130 people on NECT died. None of the deaths were due to the drugs.

More people had the illness come back in the pill group. This is called a relapse. Fourteen of 264 people on fexinidazole had a relapse. None of 130 people on NECT had a relapse. This means relapse was more common with the pill.

Many people had side effects in both groups. A side effect is a new health problem during care. In the pill group, 247 of 264 people had a side effect. In the NECT group, 121 of 130 people had a side effect. The number was about the same in both groups.

Serious side effects also took place in both groups. In the pill group, 31 of 264 people had a serious side effect. In the NECT group, 13 of 130 people had a serious side effect. We cannot tell if the true risk was different.

What do these results mean for care? A pill is much easier to give and take. It can avoid a hospital stay and many vein drips. This can help people get care and stay on care. But the pill may lead to more deaths and more relapses.

These results came from one trial in two countries. People and staff knew which care they got. This can change how people act or tell staff about symptoms. Still, the follow-up was long, up to two years.

This study helps doctors weigh pros and cons. NECT may cure more people and keep them well. But it needs a hospital and many drips. The pill is far easier to use in hard-to-reach places. It may help more people start and finish care.

The authors’ view is clear. An oral drug like fexinidazole has big plus points for ease. But deaths and relapse appear more common with the pill. The choice of care should fit each person and place. New drugs, like acoziborole, are still in tests.","Medicines for second‐stage human African trypanosomiasis
What is the aim of this review? 
Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (g‐HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a severe disease transmitted through the bite of infected tsetse flies found in rural parts of sub‐Saharan Africa. Sleeping sickness has two clinical stages. This review only examines treating the second‐stage, where people develop symptoms caused by invasion of the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in changes in the nervous system. Death is inevitable without treatment. Drugs for treatment are few, often require intravenous infusion every day over several weeks, and have serious side effects. In this review we aimed to compare the effects of current drugs for gambiense sleeping sickness and we examined nifurtimox‐eflornithine combination (NECT) with a new drug, fexinidazole, that can be taken orally. 
Key messages 
Whilst fexinidazole cures some people, deaths from any cause and treatment failure rates are higher than with conventional treatment. Adverse events were common in both groups. Fexinidazole is more practical to give, and means less time in hospital for intravenous treatment infusion. 
What was studied in this review? 
We looked at the evidence about the benefits and harms of current drugs used in people with second stage g‐HAT. We searched for randomized trials, which provide robust evidence about the various treatments. We aimed to determine whether any drug provides a definite advantage over the other, measured in terms of clinical outcomes and in relation to the severity of adverse effects. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We only identified one suitable trial, which included 394 people and was conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. The trial showed that deaths from any cause at 24 months may be higher with fexinidazole compared with NECT. Nine of the 264 people who took fexinidazole died, compared with two of the 130 people who took NECT. Fexinidazole probably increases the number of people who relapse during two years. Fourteen people in the fexinidazole group relapsed, and none in the NECT group. Adverse events were very common in both groups over the two years, and there is not likely to be much difference between the two drugs (247/264 in the fexinidazole group and 121/130 in the NECT group). We do not know about the effect of fexinidazole on serious adverse events, as the evidence is very uncertain. There were 31/264 serious adverse events in the fexinidazole group and 13/130 in the NECT group at 24 months.  
How up to date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 14 May 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013860.pub2,"Background
Physicians often prescribe opioids for pain in the acute care setting. Nausea and vomiting are well‐described adverse events, occurring in over one‐third of patients. Prophylactic antiemetics may be one option to reduce opioid‐associated nausea and vomiting. However, these medications also have their own adverse effects, so it is important to understand their efficacy and safety prior to routine use. This is a review of randomized controlled trials comparing prophylactic antiemetics versus placebo or standard care for preventing opioid‐associated nausea and vomiting. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of prophylactic antiemetics for nausea and vomiting in adults (aged 16 years or older) receiving intravenous opioids in the acute care setting. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID) from inception to January 2022, and Google Scholar (17 January 2022). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and screened reference lists. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials of prophylactic antiemetics versus placebo or standard care in adults prior to receiving an intravenous opioid. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (MG, JNC) independently determined the eligibility of each study according to the inclusion criteria. Two review authors (MG, GDP) then independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and determined the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Our primary outcomes were the occurrence of nausea, vomiting, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included nausea severity, number of vomiting episodes, and number of participants requiring antiemetic rescue therapy. We presented outcomes as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data (e.g. presence of vomiting, presence of nausea, number of participants requiring rescue medication, adverse events) and mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference for continuous data (e.g. number of vomiting episodes, nausea severity) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We included three studies involving 527 participants (187 women and 340 men) with a mean age of 42 years.  All studies used intravenous metoclopramide (10 mg) as the intervention and a placebo for the comparator. No studies assessed any other antiemetic or compared the intervention to standard care. 
Compared to placebo, metoclopramide did not reduce vomiting (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.26 to 5.32; low‐certainty evidence) or nausea (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.15 to 2.03; low‐certainty evidence) and there was no difference in adverse events (RR 2.34, 95% CI 0.47 to 11.61; low‐certainty evidence).  No data were available regarding the number of vomiting episodes. Metoclopramide did reduce the severity of nausea compared with placebo (MD −0.49, 95% CI −0.75 to −0.23; low‐certainty evidence) but did not reduce the need for rescue medication (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.17 to 20.16; low‐certainty evidence).  
Two studies were at unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation, one for blinding of outcome assessors, one for incomplete outcome data, and two for selective reporting. The studies were at low risk of bias for all remaining components. 
Authors' conclusions
There was no evidence that prophylactic metoclopramide affected the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for rescue medication when provided prior to intravenous opioids in the acute care setting. There was a clinically insignificant difference in nausea severity when comparing prophylactic metoclopramide with placebo. Overall, the evidence was of low certainty. Future research could better delineate the effects of prophylactic antiemetics on specific populations, and new studies are needed to evaluate the use of other prophylactic antiemetic agents, for which there were no data. 
","Plain Title
Do early anti-nausea drugs help when people get opioid pain drugs?

Rationale
Opioids are strong pain drugs. Doctors often give them by a vein in the arm.
These drugs can help pain. But they can also make people feel sick to the stomach.
About one in three people feel sick. Some people also throw up.

Some doctors give an anti-nausea drug first. This aims to stop the sick feeling.
An anti-nausea drug is a drug that helps with upset stomach and throwing up.
These drugs can also cause side effects. So we need to know if they help enough.
We also need to know if they are safe.

This study checked if early anti-nausea drugs help. It looked at people who got opioids for sudden pain.
The main idea was simple. Do early anti-nausea drugs prevent nausea and throwing up?
And do they cause any harm?

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. A trial is a study that tests a care plan.
In these trials, people were put into groups by chance. This is called random.
This helps make the groups fair alike.

The team searched big medical libraries. They looked from the start of those files to January 2022.
They also checked trial lists and refs from other papers.
They found three trials that fit the plan.

All trials looked at adults. Adults were age sixteen or older.
All got an opioid by vein in an acute care setting.
Acute care means care for sudden illness or injury in the hospital.

In total, 527 people took part. The average age was 42 years.
There were 187 women and 340 men.
All three trials gave the same anti-nausea drug. It was metoclopramide, ten milligrams, by vein.
They compared it to a placebo. A placebo is a look‑alike with no drug.

No trial tested other anti-nausea drugs. No trial used standard care as the match.
The trials checked who felt sick. They checked who threw up.
They also checked side effects. Some trials also scored how bad the nausea felt.
They checked if people needed an extra anti-nausea drug later. This is called rescue medicine.

The abstract did not say how long people stayed in each trial.
It likely covered the time near the opioid dose. But the abstract did not report that.

Results
The main question was this. Does metoclopramide, given first, prevent nausea and throwing up?
Across the three trials, metoclopramide did not help people throw up less often.
It also did not lower how many people felt sick.

The drug did make the sick feeling a bit less strong for some people.
But the size of this change was small.
The study team felt it may not matter for day to day care.

People in the drug group did not need fewer rescue doses.
This means they still often needed another anti-nausea drug later.
Side effects were about the same in the drug and placebo groups.
No new safety concerns came up in these small trials.

The results had low certainty. This means we have limits in what we can claim.
Why low certainty? The trials were few and small.
Some trial methods were not fully clear from their reports.
With better trials, the results could change.

What does this mean for patients? Giving metoclopramide before an opioid may not help much.
It did not stop nausea or throwing up in more people.
It did not cut the need for extra anti-nausea drugs.
It did not change side effects when used this way.

What does this mean for doctors? Routine use may not be worth it.
Each person is different. A doctor may still choose to use it in some cases.
But the proof for broad use is weak right now.

What does this mean for research? We need better, larger trials.
We also need trials in key groups. For example, people at high risk of nausea.
We need to test other anti-nausea drugs as well.
These trials should report how long they watch people and what side effects occur.

In short, here is the take‑home message.
Three small trials looked at one drug, metoclopramide, used before an opioid.
It did not stop nausea or throwing up in more people.
It may make nausea feel a bit less bad, but only a little.
The proof is weak, so the results could change with new studies.","Prophylactic antiemetics for adults receiving intravenous opioids in the acute care setting 
Key messages 
Metoclopramide did not reduce the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for rescue medication when provided prior to intravenous opioids in the emergency department.  
In terms of the severity of nausea, metoclopramide did not help patients any more than placebo (sham treatment). 
What is opioid‐induced emesis? 
Physicians often give patients opioids for pain in emergency departments, but over a third experience the side effects of nausea and vomiting (emesis). Some experts have suggested that taking antiemetics before receiving the opioid (that is, as a prophylactic) could prevent these symptoms from occurring. However, these medications have their own side effects, so it is important to understand whether they are effective and safe before routinely using them. 
What did we want to find out? 
This review looks at whether taking antiemetics (medications to treat or prevent nausea and vomiting) before receiving an intravenous opioid reduces the risk of experiencing nausea and vomiting as side effects. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies involving adults (aged 16 years or older) who received prophylactic antiemetics compared with either placebo or standard care before receiving an intravenous opioid. 
What did we find? 
We found three studies with a total of 527 patients. All the studies used metoclopramide as the antiemetic. Compared with placebo, metoclopramide did not reduce the risk of vomiting, nausea, or the need for an antiemetic later on. There was also no difference in side effects between those who received antiemetics and those who did not. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The studies investigated only one medication (metoclopramide) and did not report all the information we were interested in. The intervention probably makes little or no difference in terms of experiencing nausea or vomiting. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
This evidence is up to date to 17 January 2022.

This review includes 76 studies involving 8018 people with COPD (published before 27 June 2019). Most studies were funded by government bodies, although some were sponsored by equipment or drug manufacturers. Many strategies have been developed and different studies have measured physical activity in lots of different ways. This means that it was hard to compare and combine their findings. It was also hard to tell exactly what was involved in some of the interventions, and therefore which components were important for improving physical activity. 
Key results 
Some studies looked at current interventions for people with COPD, including pulmonary rehabilitation and different types of exercise training as well as self‐management and education. Other studies have looked at special types of nutritional supplements, oxygen therapy, surgery, muscle stimulation and singing. 
Some strategies that did work involved exercise training, physical activity counselling and COPD medications. Some studies showed that people did an extra 6 to 24 minutes of at least moderate‐intensity physical activity, as well as walking for longer or taking more steps each day. However, we are still uncertain about when or how these approaches should be used. Only a few studies followed people up after the intervention finished. It is not clear exactly what needs to be done to improve physical activity in the long term, which is what may be required for health benefits. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low, due to difficulties working out exactly what people did in the studies, and also because there were lots of single studies (some quite small) looking at different types of interventions. This means that it was difficult to generalise these findings to all people with COPD.

Ways to help people with COPD move more in daily life

Rationale
COPD is long term lung disease. It makes it hard to breathe. Simple tasks can feel tough. Many people feel tired and short of breath.
Moving more can help health and mood. It can help people do daily tasks. It can help the heart, bones, and sleep. But moving more can be hard with COPD.
Doctors and patients want clear help. They ask, what plans help people move more? They also ask, what lasts over time? This review looked at that.
The idea was simple. Find what gets people with COPD to move more. Learn what works, and what still needs study. This can guide care now.

Trial Design
This was a review. A review looks at many past studies. It puts the results side by side. It can show what helps most.
The team found 76 studies. They had 8018 people with COPD. The studies were done before late June 2019. Most had public funds. Some had help from companies.
The studies tested many kinds of plans. These included lung rehab and exercise plans. Some used teaching or self help plans. Others tried food aids, oxygen, surgery, or muscle pads. Some even used singing.
People in the studies had COPD. The review did not give ages or sex. The COPD stage could vary. We do not have one set profile.
Time in each study was not the same. Some ran for weeks or months. Only a few checked in after the plan ended. So we do not know how long gains last.

Results
Some plans did help people move more. Exercise training helped. Help with setting goals and plans to move also helped. Usual COPD drugs helped some people move more as well.
How much more did people move? In some studies, people did 6 to 24 more minutes a day. This was for activity that makes you breathe faster. That means a brisk walk or like tasks. People also walked longer or took more steps each day.
These are good signs. Small gains can add up in daily life. More steps can mean more trips to the shop. More minutes can mean more time with grandkids.
Some plans did not show clear gains. Food aids did not stand out. Oxygen or surgery did not show a clear link to more movement. Muscle pads and singing had mixed results.
Why is it hard to be sure? The studies did not all measure movement the same way. Some used step counts. Some used time in activity. Some used other tools. That makes it hard to compare.
Also, plan details were not always clear. We often could not tell what parts of a plan helped most. For example, an exercise plan may also include teaching. Then we cannot say which part did the most.
Most studies were small or stood alone. That also limits what we can know. Results may not apply to all people with COPD. Doctors should keep that in mind.
Few studies checked in after the plan ended. We do not know the best way to keep gains. We do not know how to help people stay active for years.
What does this mean for care now? Exercise training can help people with COPD move more. Help with goals and daily plans to move can help. Usual COPD drugs may help some people move more.
What does this mean for the field? We need clear, simple plans that people can fit in life. We need to test them in more people. We need to track results for longer.
Future studies should make plan parts clear. They should use the same ways to measure movement. They should keep track after the plan ends. This will help us know what lasts.
In short, some things help people with COPD move more. But we still do not know the best mix. We also do not know the best time to start or how long to keep plans.
Talk with your care team. Ask about safe exercise training. Ask for help to set movement goals. Small steps can help, and gains can grow.","What are the most effective ways to encourage people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to be more physically active?

Human milk as compared to formula reduces morbidity in preterm infants but requires fortification to meet their nutritional needs and to reduce the risk of extrauterine growth failure. Standard fortification methods are not individualized to the infant and assume that breast milk is uniform in nutritional content. Strategies for individualizing fortification are available; however it is not known whether these are safe, or if they improve outcomes in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To determine whether individualizing fortification of breast milk feeds in response to infant blood urea nitrogen (adjustable fortification) or to breast milk macronutrient content as measured with a milk analyzer (targeted fortification) reduces mortality and morbidity and promotes growth and development compared to standard, non‐individualized fortification for preterm infants receiving human milk at < 37 weeks' gestation or at birth weight < 2500 grams. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 9), in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Daily and Versions(R); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), on September 20, 2019. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for pertinent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomized trials. 
Selection criteria
We considered randomized, quasi‐randomized, and cluster‐randomized controlled trials of preterm infants fed exclusively breast milk that compared a standard non‐individualized fortification strategy to individualized fortification using a targeted or adjustable strategy. We considered studies that examined any use of fortification in eligible infants for a minimum duration of two weeks, initiated at any time during enteral feeding, and providing any regimen of human milk feeding. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were collected using the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. Two review authors evaluated the quality of the studies and extracted data. We reported analyses of continuous data using mean differences (MDs), and dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
Data were extracted from seven RCTs, resulting in eight publications (521 total participants were enrolled among these studies), with duration of study interventions ranging from two to seven weeks. As compared to standard non‐individualized fortification, individualized (targeted or adjustable) fortification of enteral feeds probably increased weight gain during the intervention (typical mean difference [MD] 1.88 g/kg/d, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26 to 2.50; 6 studies, 345 participants), may have increased length gain during the intervention (typical MD 0.43 mm/d, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.53; 5 studies, 242 participants), and may have increased head circumference gain during the intervention (typical MD 0.14 mm/d, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.23; 5 studies, 242 participants). Compared to standard non‐individualized fortification, targeted fortification probably increased weight gain during the intervention (typical MD 1.87 g/kg/d, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.58; 4 studies, 269 participants) and may have increased length gain during the intervention (typical MD 0.45 mm/d, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57; 3 studies, 166 participants). Adjustable fortification probably increased weight gain during the intervention (typical MD 2.86 g/kg/d, 95% CI 1.69 to 4.03; 3 studies, 96 participants), probably increased gain in length during the intervention (typical MD 0.54 mm/d, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.7; 3 studies, 96 participants), and increased gain in head circumference during the intervention (typical MD 0.36 mm/d, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.5; 3 studies, 96 participants). We are uncertain whether there are differences between individualized versus standard fortification strategies in the incidence of in‐hospital mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, culture‐proven late‐onset bacterial sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, osteopenia, length of hospital stay, or post‐hospital discharge growth. No study reported severe neurodevelopmental disability as an outcome. One study that was published after our literature search was completed is awaiting classification. 
Authors' conclusions
We found moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence suggesting that individualized (either targeted or adjustable) fortification of enteral feeds in very low birth weight infants increases growth velocity of weight, length, and head circumference during the intervention compared with standard non‐individualized fortification. Evidence showing important in‐hospital and post‐discharge clinical outcomes was sparse and of very low certainty, precluding inferences regarding safety or clinical benefits beyond short‐term growth.

Custom add-ons to breast milk may help tiny preterm babies grow better

Rationale
Some babies are born too soon. Doctors call this preterm. These babies often weigh very little. They can get sick more easily.

Human milk helps protect these babies. It lowers illness when compared with formula. But it may not have enough nutrients for fast growth. So care teams add a nutrient “add‑on” to the milk. An add‑on is extra protein, fat, and sugar.

Most units use the same add‑on for all babies. But each mother’s milk is different. Each baby’s needs are different too. A one‑size plan may not fit well.

There are two custom plans. One plan tests the milk. It adds what the milk lacks. This is called a “targeted” add‑on. The other plan checks a baby blood test named urea nitrogen. This test can show protein needs. Staff then raise or lower the add‑on. This is called an “adjustable” add‑on.

Doctors want to know if custom add‑ons help babies grow more. They also want to know if they are safe. This review looked at those questions. It could guide care for preterm babies and their families.

Trial Design
This was a review of past clinical trials. Experts searched many medical databases. They looked for fair tests where chance chose the group. These are called randomized trials. The team used standard, careful methods.

The review found 7 trials. The trials led to 8 papers in total. They enrolled 521 babies. All babies were born early or were very small. All got human milk.

Each trial lasted two to seven weeks. Babies got an add‑on for at least two weeks. The trials compared three plans. One plan used the same add‑on for all. One plan tested the milk and aimed at set goals. One plan used the baby blood test to guide protein.

The trials tracked growth in the hospital. They looked at weight gain, length, and head size. They also checked health problems in the hospital. Some looked at growth after going home. Gender details were not stated.

Results
Custom add‑ons helped babies grow faster during the study time. Babies gained more weight each day. The gain was about 2 grams per kilogram more each day. They also grew a bit more in length. Their head size grew a bit more too.

Both custom plans helped. The milk test plan raised growth. The blood test plan raised growth as well. In some trials, the blood test plan helped a bit more.

We do not know if custom add‑ons changed key health risks. The trials did not show clear changes in death in the hospital. They did not show clear changes in lung disease of prematurity. They did not show clear changes in severe gut injury. Doctors call that necrotizing enterocolitis. They did not show clear changes in eye disease of prematurity. They did not show clear changes in blood infection. They did not show clear changes in weak bones. Days in the hospital did not clearly change. Growth after going home did not clearly change.

No trial reported severe brain and nerve delay. So we cannot say if custom add‑ons change long‑term brain growth. The proof for growth gains was moderate to low. The proof for health risks was very low. So we cannot be sure about safety beyond short term.

What does this mean for you?
Custom add‑ons may help your preterm baby grow more in the hospital. They could help weight, length, and head size. This may lower the risk of slow growth outside the womb. But we still do not know if they change other health risks.

More large and fair trials are needed. We need to learn about long‑term safety and brain growth. We also need to know which plan helps most, and for which babies.

If your baby is in the NICU, ask your care team about milk add‑ons. Ask if they test your milk or your baby’s blood. Ask how they track growth. Your team can explain the plan that fits your baby best.

Notes on the research
This review used trials of babies born before 37 weeks. Some babies also had birth weight under 2,500 grams. All babies got human milk. The add‑on was given for two to seven weeks. One new study was found later. It was not yet reviewed in detail.

In short, custom add‑ons likely boost short‑term growth in preterm babies. We still need better proof on safety and other health results.","Individualized versus standard diet fortification for growth and development in very low birth weight infants receiving human milk 
Review question: does individualized rather than standard, non‐individualized addition of nutrients and calories to breast milk feeds safely improve growth and other outcomes in preterm infants? 
Background: preterm infants are at risk for poor growth following birth. Breast milk reduces their risk of illness but does not meet their nutritional needs. Therefore, breast milk fed to preterm infants must be fortified with extra nutrients. Usual methods of fortifying breast milk treat all breast milk and all preterm infants the same. However, two methods are available for individualizing fortification for each preterm infant. Targeted fortification adds nutrients to breast milk based on the results of breast milk analysis. Adjustable fortification adds nutrients based on the results of preterm infant laboratory results. Individualized fortification may improve preterm infant growth or other outcomes. However, it is not known whether targeted or adjustable fortification is safe or improves outcomes for preterm infants compared with the standard method. 
Study characteristics: through literature searches updated to September 2019, we found seven studies that tested the effects of targeted or adjustable fortification of breast milk feeds compared to standard fortification in preterm infants, yielding eight publications (521 total participants were enrolled in these studies). One study that was published after our literature search was completed is awaiting classification. 
Key results: targeted or adjustable fortification improves short‐term growth compared to standard fortification in preterm infants. Determining the best way to customize breast milk feeds is necessary, as is clarifying its safety and effects on other clinical outcomes. 
Certainty of evidence: very low to moderate. Moderate certainty means that the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants is likely to be close to the result of this review but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty means that the true effect may be substantially different from the results of this review. Very low certainty means that the true effect of individualized fortification on growth in preterm infants is likely to be substantially different from the results of this review. Certainty of evidence was downgraded most often in this review due to small numbers of participants in included studies and significant differences in study design and outcome measures among included studies.

10.1002-14651858.CD014698,"Background
Ultrasound examination of pregnancy before 24 weeks gestation may lead to more accurate dating and earlier diagnosis of pathology, but may also give false reassurance. It can be used to monitor development or diagnose conditions of an unborn baby. This review compares the effect of routine or universal, ultrasound examination, performed before 24 completed weeks' gestation, with selective or no ultrasound examination.  
Objectives
To assess the effect of routine pregnancy ultrasound before 24 weeks as part of a screening programme, compared to selective ultrasound or no ultrasound, on the early diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy location, termination for fetal congenital abnormality, multiple pregnancy, maternal outcomes and later fetal compromise. 
To assess the effect of first trimester (before 14 weeks) and second trimester (14 to 24 weeks) ultrasound, separately. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 11 August 2020. We also examined the reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs and RCTs published in abstract form. We included all trials with pregnant women who had routine or revealed ultrasound versus selective ultrasound, no ultrasound, or concealed ultrasound, before 24 weeks' gestation. All eligible studies were screened for scientific integrity and trustworthiness. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, extracted data and checked extracted data for accuracy. Two review authors independently used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome 
Main results
Our review included data from 13 RCTs including 85,265 women. The review included four comparisons. Four trials were assessed to be at low risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation concealment and two as high risk. The nature of the intervention made it impossible to blind women and staff providing care to treatment allocation.  Sample attrition was low in the majority of trials and outcome data were available for most women. Many trials were conducted before it was customary for trials to be registered and protocols published. 
First trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: four studies, 1791 women, from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). 
First trimester scans probably reduce short‐term maternal anxiety about pregnancy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; moderate‐certainty evidence). We do not have information on whether the reduction was sustained.  
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of first trimester scans on perinatal loss (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73; 648 participants; one study; low‐certainty evidence) or induction of labour for post‐maturity (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.37; 1474 participants; three studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
The effect of routine first trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or termination of pregnancy for fetal abnormality was not reported. 
Second trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: seven studies, 36,053 women, from Finland, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and the US. 
Second trimester scans probably make little difference to perinatal loss (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.20; 17,918 participants, three studies; moderate‐certainty evidence) or intrauterine fetal death (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.42; 29,584 participants, three studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
Second trimester scans may reduce induction of labour for post‐maturity (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73; 24,174 participants, six studies; low‐certainty evidence), presumably by more accurate dating. 
Routine second trimester ultrasound may improve detection of multiple pregnancy (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16; 274 participants, five studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
Routine second trimester ultrasound may increase detection of major fetal abnormality before 24 weeks (RR 3.45, 95% CI 1.67 to 7.12; 387 participants, two studies; low‐certainty evidence) and probably increases the number of women terminating pregnancy for major anomaly (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.93; 26,893 participants, four studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Long‐term follow‐up of children exposed to scans before birth did not indicate harm to children's physical or intellectual development (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.34; 603 participants, one study; low‐certainty evidence). 
The effect of routine second trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or maternal anxiety was not reported. 
Standard care plus two ultrasounds and referral for complications versus standard care: one cluster‐RCT, 47,431 women, from Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan and Zambia. 
This trial included a co‐intervention, training of healthcare workers and referral for complications and was, therefore, assessed separately. 
Standard pregnancy care plus two scans, and training and referral for complications, versus standard care probably makes little difference to whether women with complications give birth in a risk appropriate setting with facilities for caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.19; 11,680 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  The intervention also probably makes little to no difference to low birthweight (< 2500 g) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13; 47,312 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about whether the community intervention (including ultrasound) makes any difference to maternal mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.55; 46,768 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Revealed ultrasound results (communicated to both patient and doctor) versus concealed ultrasound results (blinded to both patient and doctor at any time before 24 weeks): one study, 1095 women, from the UK. 
The evidence was very uncertain for all results relating to revealed versus concealed ultrasound scan (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Early scans probably reduce short term maternal anxiety. 
Later scans may reduce labour induction for post‐maturity. They may improve detection of major fetal abnormalities and increase the number of women who choose termination of pregnancy for this reason. They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies. All these findings accord with observational data.  
Neither type of scan appears to alter other important maternal or fetal outcomes, but our review may underestimate the effect in modern practice because trials were mostly  from relatively early in the development of the technology, and many control participants also had scans. The trials were also underpowered to show an effect on other important maternal or fetal outcomes.

What early pregnancy ultrasound scans can and cannot do

Rationale
An ultrasound scan uses sound waves to make a picture of a baby in the womb. It can help tell how far along the pregnancy is. It can also show twins or more, and some major birth problems.

Many people hope that routine scans help moms and babies do better. Early scans may spot problems sooner. This could guide care and ease worry. But scans can also give false ease when they miss a problem.

Doctors do not all agree on routine scans for every pregnant woman. Some give scans to all. Others give scans only if there is a reason. This study set out to compare these two ways.

The main question was: Do routine scans before 24 weeks help? The team also asked if scans help more in the first 14 weeks or in weeks 14 to 24. They looked at mom’s worry, baby loss, twins, birth problems, and care choices.

Trial Design
This was a review of medical trials. In these trials, women were put by chance into groups. One group got routine scans before 24 weeks. The other group got scans only if needed, or no scan.

The review looked at 13 trials with about 85,000 pregnant women. The trials took place in many countries. These included places in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe.

Some trials tested scans in the first 14 weeks. Some tested scans in weeks 14 to 24. One large trial also added training for clinic staff and a plan to send women with problems to hospitals.

Most women stayed in the trials through birth. One trial also checked on children later on. Ages were not reported, but all were pregnant women.

Results
First trimester scans (before 14 weeks)
Early scans likely lowered short term worry about the pregnancy. Women felt calmer soon after the scan. We do not know if that calm feeling lasted.

Early scans did not show a clear change in loss of the baby around birth. They also did not show a clear change in starting labor because the baby was past due. We do not know if early scans changed very early birth or choices to end a pregnancy due to a major problem.

Second trimester scans (weeks 14 to 24)
Scans in weeks 14 to 24 made little difference in baby loss. They made little difference in babies who died before birth.

These scans may lower the need to start labor for a past due date. This is likely because they set the due date better. Better due dates can help avoid unneeded steps near the end.

These scans may help find twins or more. They may also help find major birth problems before 24 weeks. When scans found major problems, more women chose to end the pregnancy. This tells us that earlier facts can change care choices.

One trial looked at children later in life. It did not find clear harm to body growth or to learning from having had a scan before birth.

Standard care plus two scans and a referral plan
One large trial took place in five lower income countries. Women got two scans as part of their care. Staff also got training. Women with problems were sent to higher level care.

This plan did not change where most women gave birth. It did not change how many babies were born small. We do not know if it changed the number of mothers who died.

Revealed versus hidden scan results
In one trial, scan results were hidden from women and doctors. In another group, results were shared. The proof here was not clear. We cannot say if sharing results helped or harmed.

What this means for patients and families
Early scans can calm worry, at least for a while. Later scans can help set the due date. This can help avoid starting labor when it is not needed.

Scans can find twins and some major birth problems sooner. Early facts may help you plan care. They may also lead some to choose to end the pregnancy when a major problem is found.

Scans did not change many other key results for mother or baby in these trials. That does not mean scans have no value. It means the trials did not show clear changes in these areas.

Most trials were done years ago. Scan tools and skills are better now. Many women in the “no routine scan” groups still had a scan. That can hide the true effect of routine scans.

What you can do
Talk with your care team about scans. Ask what each scan can and cannot show. Ask how a scan may change your care.

If you want a scan, ask about the best time for it. If a scan finds a problem, ask what that means for your baby and for you. Your values and goals matter in each choice you make.","Routine ultrasound scans for babies before 24 weeks of pregnancy.
We set out to determine the effect of routine ultrasound scans early in pregnancy (before 24 weeks). This was in comparison to no scan at all, or scans only when a clinical problem was suspected, such as if the woman has vaginal bleeding, or the baby is at high risk of having an abnormality. 
What is the issue? 
Ultrasound scans send out high‐frequency sound waves directed to the area being examined, and use the reflected sound to make an image. This review considers two types of scan in the first half of pregnancy.  Early scans (before 14 weeks) mainly aim to count the number of babies, to check they are growing in the correct place and check the pregnancy dates.  Later scans, typically done around 18 to 24 weeks, recheck all the above, and also examine the baby's anatomy and whether the placenta (afterbirth) is in the correct place. Both types of scan may cause parental anxiety and a false positive diagnoses could lead to harm. The aim of this review is to compare routine with selective or no scans. 
Why is this important? 
It has been assumed that routine scans before 24 weeks' gestation will result in the earlier detection of problems and improve management and the pregnancy outcome. The alternative is selective scans for specific reasons. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials. We found 13 studies including 85,265 women. We included two main comparisons. 
Routine early scanning  
Ultrasound scans in the first 14 weeks reduced short‐term maternal worries about the pregnancy. There was no evidence of a clear effect on induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue, loss of the baby, early birth (before 34 weeks) or mothers choosing termination for baby abnormalities. 
Routine later scanning  
Second trimester scans, at 14 to 24 weeks, increased detection of baby abnormalities, and more women chose termination of pregnancy for this reason. There was no evidence of an effect on perinatal loss. Induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue was reduced. No studies reported how it affected maternal anxiety. Multiple pregnancies were more likely to be detected by 24 weeks. Long‐term follow‐up of children exposed to these scans did not indicate that they were harmful to children's physical or intellectual development. 
We also found one trial from a group of low and middle income countries, comparing a combination of two scans and specialist training of health professionals and referral of women with complications, with selective scans and routine care. The intervention did not alter the number of women delivering in a hospital with caesarean section facility. Nor did it appear to reduce maternal deaths or the numbers of low‐birthweight babies, although the evidence was very uncertain. 
We also found one trial where all women underwent scans but the results were revealed to the health care professionals in half the cases. This trial showed no important effect of revealing the scan results but the evidence was very uncertain. 
Most studies were carried out relatively early in the development of scan technology and when training in its use was less advanced. In most trials a large proportion of women in the control groups received a scan too. 
What does this mean? 
Early scans probably reduce maternal worries about the baby in the short term. Later scans may reduce labour induction to prevent the pregnancy going overdue. They may also improve detection of major abnormalities in the baby and increase the number of women who choose pregnancy termination for this reason. They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies. All these findings accord with common sense.  
Although neither type of scan appears to alter other important outcomes, our review may underestimate the effect in modern practice because the trials were mostly from relatively early in the development of scan technology, and many participants in the control arms also had scans.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD‐1/PD‐L1 axis have changed the first‐line treatment of people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Single‐agent pembrolizumab (a PD‐1 inhibitor) is currently the standard of care as monotherapy in patients with PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50%, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy when PD‐L1 expression is less than 50%. Atezolizumab (PD‐L1 inhibitor) has also been approved in combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab (an anti‐angiogenic antibody) in first‐line NSCLC regardless of PD‐L1 expression. The combination of first‐line PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitors with anti‐CTLA‐4 antibodies has also been shown to improve survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, particularly in people with high tumour mutational burden (TMB). The association of ipilimumab (an anti CTLA4) and nivolumab (PD‐1 inhibitor) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in all patients with PD‐L1 expression ≥1%. Although these antibodies are currently used in clinical practice, some questions remain unanswered, such as the best‐treatment strategy, the role of different biomarkers for treatment selection and the effectiveness of immunotherapy according to specific clinical characteristics. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of first‐line immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), as monotherapy or in combination, compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab for people with advanced NSCLC, according to the level of PD‐L1 expression. 
Search methods
We performed an electronic search of the main databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase) from inception until 31 December 2020 and conferences meetings from 2015 onwards. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy or safety of first‐line ICI treatment for adults with advanced NSCLC who had not previously received any anticancer treatment. We included trials comparing single‐ or double‐ICI treatment to standard first‐line therapy (platinum‐based chemotherapy +/‐ bevacizumab). All data come from ‘international multicentre studies involving adults, age 18 or over, with histologically‐confirmed stage IV NSCLC. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed the search results and a fourth review author resolved any disagreements. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS); secondary outcomes were overall objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v 1.1, grade 3 to 5 treatment‐related adverse events (AEs) (CTCAE v 5.0) and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). We performed meta‐analyses where appropriate using the random‐effects model for hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and used the I² statistic to investigate heterogeneity. 
Main results
Main results 
We identified 15 trials for inclusion, seven completed and eight ongoing trials. We obtained data for 5893 participants from seven trials comparing first‐line single‐ (six trials) or double‐ (two trials) agent ICI with platinum‐based chemotherapy, one trial comparing both first‐line single‐ and double‐agent ICsI with platinum‐based chemotherapy. All trials were at low risk of selection and detection bias, some were classified at high risk of performance, attrition or other source of bias. The overall certainty of evidence according to GRADE ranged from moderate‐to‐low because of risk of bias, inconsistency, or imprecision. The majority of the included trials reported their outcomes by PD‐L1 expressions, with PD‐L1 ≥ 50 being considered the most clinically useful cut‐off level for decision makers. Also, iIn order to avoid overlaps between various PDL‐1 expressions we prioritised the review outcomes according to PD‐L1 ≥ 50. 
Single‐agent ICIIn the PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50% group single‐agent ICI probably improved OS compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.76, 6 RCTs, 2111 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). In this group, single‐agent ICI also may improve PFS (HR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.88, 5 RCTs, 1886 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and ORR (risk ratio (RR):1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75, 4 RCTs, 1672 participants, low‐certainty evidence). HRQoL data were available for only one study including only people with PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50%, which suggested that single‐agent ICI may improve HRQoL at 15 weeks compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 1.51, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.10, 1 RCT, 297 participants, low‐certainty evidence).In the included studies, treatment‐related AEs were not reported according to PD‐L1 expression levels. Grade 3‐4 AEs may be less frequent with single‐agent ICI compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 0.41, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.50, I² = 62%, 5 RCTs, 3346 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
More information about efficacy of single‐agent ICI compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy according to the level of PD‐L1 expression and to TMB status or specific clinical characteristics is available in the full text. 
Double‐agent ICI Double‐ICI treatment probably prolonged OS compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy in people with PD‐L1 expression ≥50% (HR: 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.89 2 RCTs, 612 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence).Trials did not report data on HRQoL, PFS and ORR according to PD‐L1 groups.Treatment related AEs were not reported according to PD‐L1 expression levels. The frequency of grade 3‐4 AEs may not differ between double‐ICI treatment and platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09, I² = 81%, 2 RCTs, 1869 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
More information about efficacy of double‐agent ICI according to the level of PD‐L1 expression and to TMB status is available in the full text. 
Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence in this review suggests that single‐agent ICI in people with NSCLC and PD‐L1 ≥50% probably leads to a higher overall survival rate and may lead to a higher progression‐free survival and overall response rate when compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy and may also lead to a lower rate of adverse events and higher HRQoL. Combined ICI in people with NSCLC and PD‐L1 ≥50% also probably leads to a higher overall survival rate when compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy, but its effect on progression‐free survival, overall response rate and HRQoL is unknown due to a lack of data. The rate of adverse events may not differ between groups. 
This review used to be a living review. It is transitioned out of living mode because current research is exploring ICI in association with chemotherapy or other immunotherapeutic drugs versus ICI as single agent rather than platinum based chemotherapy.

First treatment for advanced lung cancer: immune therapy or chemo?

2. Rationale
Non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common lung cancer. When it has spread, it is hard to treat. It can cause cough, pain, and shortness of breath. It can also lower strength and mood.

Chemo has been the usual first treatment. New drugs called immune therapy help your own immune system fight the cancer. These drugs can block “brakes” on immune cells. Two key brakes are PD‑1/PD‑L1 and CTLA‑4. Some tumors have high PD‑L1. This can help doctors pick treatment.

Doctors want to know which first treatment works best. They also want to know who is most likely to benefit. This review looked at immune drugs used first, alone or in pairs, versus chemo. It focused on people with high PD‑L1 (about one half or more). The main idea was that immune therapy could help people live longer, with fewer bad side effects.

3. Trial Design
How is this study designed? This is a review of many trials. The team searched medical databases to the end of 2020. They also checked big cancer meetings from 2015 on. They only used randomized trials. That means people were put in groups by chance.

The trials were global. All people were adults age 18 or more. All had stage 4 NSCLC proven by lab tests. None had cancer drugs before. The trials compared immune therapy (one drug or two) to standard chemo. Chemo sometimes also used a drug called bevacizumab.

The review looked at key results. These were how long people lived, how long before the cancer grew again, how often tumors shrank, side effects, and quality of life. In total, 15 trials met the rules. Seven had results the team could use. Eight are still running. The seven trials had 5893 people.

The trials often looked at PD‑L1 level. High PD‑L1 (at least one half) is a common cut‑off for care. The review gave first place to this group to avoid mix‑ups. How long each person stayed in a trial was not stated in this summary.

4. Results
What were the main results? In people with high PD‑L1 (at least one half), one immune drug used alone helped people live longer than chemo. It also likely held the cancer back for more time. Tumors also shrank in more people on the immune drug. One study at about 15 weeks found better quality of life with the immune drug. These findings are from several trials. The strength of the proof is moderate for living longer, and lower for the other results.

Side effects matter a lot. Serious side effects were less common with one immune drug than with chemo. This can help people stay on treatment. It may also help day‑to‑day life. The trials did not report side effects by PD‑L1 level. But across the studies, fewer people had the most serious problems on one immune drug.

Some trials used two immune drugs together. In people with high PD‑L1, two drugs also helped people live longer than chemo. The trials did not share clear data, by PD‑L1 level, on how long until the cancer grew again. They also did not share clear data, by PD‑L1 level, on how often tumors shrank. Quality of life data for two‑drug plans were not reported. Serious side effects with two drugs were about the same as with chemo in the studies used for this review.

What does this mean for you? If your tumor has high PD‑L1 (at least one half), one immune drug as the first treatment likely helps you live longer than chemo. It may also delay growth and shrink tumors more often. It may have fewer bad side effects. Your quality of life may be better early on. For two immune drugs, living longer is also likely, but we do not yet know about time to growth, response, or quality of life in this group.

How strong is the proof? The trials were well done in many ways. Still, some parts had limits. Not all results were the same from trial to trial. Some results were not exact. So, the proof ranges from moderate to low, based on the outcome.

Why is this study important? It pulls together the best trials so far. It helps doctors and patients talk about first treatment choices. It also shows where we still need answers. Many new trials now test chemo plus immune drugs or two immune drugs. They compare those to one immune drug used alone.

Bottom line: For advanced NSCLC with high PD‑L1, one immune drug first is a strong choice. It likely helps you live longer than chemo. It may have fewer serious side effects. Two immune drugs first can also help you live longer, but we need more data on other outcomes. Your care team can use your tumor tests, your health, and these results to guide your plan.","Immunotherapy versus chemotherapy for people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer who have not been not previously been treated 
Review question 
Is immunotherapy more effective and less toxic than chemotherapy for people diagnosed with non‐small cell lung cancer (a subtype of lung cancer) who have not previously been treated and who are not suitable for curative treatment? 
Background 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths and non‐small cell lung cancer represent more than 85% of all lung cancer cases. Curative surgery and radiotherapy are not treatment options when the disease is at an advanced stage and until recently these people were offered chemotherapy. Since 2016, immunotherapies (antibodies able to stimulate the immune system against cancer cells) have been shown to improve survival for these patients. 
Side effects of immunotherapies are mainly inflammation of the tissues caused by the activation of the immune system against different organs, while chemotherapy usually causes a reduction in the white blood cells and red blood cells, hair loss, nausea and vomiting.In this Cochrane Review, we tried to find out how effective and safe immunotherapies (given alone or as combinations) are compared to standard chemotherapy for people with non‐small cell lung cancer who are not suitable for possibly curative treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the main databases and records of conference meetings up to 31st December 2020. We included seven studies (5893 participants) comparing immunotherapies (antibodies that interact with specific proteins called immune checkpoints) with chemotherapy for people with non‐small cell lung cancer not previously treated. 
Key results 
We reported the results by PD‐L1 levels (a protein produced by the tumour or immune cells and bound by immune checkpoint inhibitors) 
In people with more than 50% of tumour/immune cells expressing PD‐L1 protein, single immunotherapy might improve survival with fewer side effects. In addition, treatment with combined immunotherapies may improve survival in both people with high expression of PD‐L1 protein.The rate of toxic effects may be the same for people treated with combined immunotherapies or chemotherapy. 
Certainty of evidence 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low.
Conclusions 
For people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer with a high expression of PD‐L1 protein, immunotherapies alone or combinations of immunotherapies prolonged life compared to chemotherapy. The frequency of side effects may be lower with the use of immunotherapies alone compared to chemotherapy. The frequency of side effects may not differ between combinations of immunotherapies and chemotherapy.

10.1002-14651858.CD014201,"Background
The hallmark of severe hemophilia (A or B) is recurrent bleeding into joints and soft tissues with progressive joint damage, despite on‐demand treatment. Prophylaxis has long been used, but not universally adopted, because of medical, psychosocial, and cost controversies. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of clotting factor concentrate prophylaxis in managing previously‐treated individuals with hemophilia A or B. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. In addition, we searched MEDLINE and Embase and online trial registries. 
Most recent search of Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register: 24 February 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs evaluating people with hemophilia A or hemophilia B, who were previously treated with clotting factor concentrates to manage their hemophilia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently reviewed trials for eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
Ten trials (including 608 participants) were eligible for inclusion. Eight of the trials (477 participants) had arms comparing two or more prophylactic regimens to one another and four of the trials (n = 258) compared prophylaxis to on‐demand treatment (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). 
Comparison of two or more prophylactic regimens 
For trials comparing one prophylaxis regimen to another, given the heterogeneity of the data, none of the data were pooled for this comparison. Considering the individual trials, three trials reported the primary outcome of joint bleeding, and none showed a dfference between dosing regimens (low‐certainty evidence). For the secondary outcome of total bleeding events, prophylaxis with a twice‐weekly regimen of FIX likely results in reduced total bleeds compared to a once‐a‐week regimen of the same dose, mean difference (MD) 11.2 (5.81 to 16.59) (one trial, 10 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Transient low‐titer anti‐FVIII inhibitors were reported in one of the trials. Blood‐transmitted infections were not identified. Other adverse events reported include hypersensitivity, oedema, and weight gain. These were, however, rare and unrelated to study drugs (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Comparison of prophylactic and on‐demand regimens 
Four of the trials (258 participants) had arms that compared prophylaxis to on‐demand treatment. Prophylaxis may result in a large decrease in the number of joint bleeds compared to on‐demand treatment, MD ‐30.34 (95% CI ‐46.95 to ‐13.73) (two trials, 164 participants, low‐certainty evidence). One of these trials (84 participants) also reported the long‐term effects of prophylaxis versus on‐demand therapy showing improved joint function, quality of life, and pain; but no differences between groups in joint structure when assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
In one trial (84 participants) validated measures for joint health and pain assessment showed that prophylaxis likely improves joint health compared to an on‐demand regimen with an estimated change difference of 0.94 points (95% CI 0.23 to 1.65) and improves total pain scores, MD ‐17.20 (95% CI ‐27.48 to ‐6.92 (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Two trials (131 participants) reported that prophylaxis likely results in a slight increase in adverse events, risk ratio 1.71 (1.24 to 2.37) (moderate‐certainty evidence). No inhibitor development and blood‐transmitted infections were identified. 
Overall, the certainty of the body of evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have altered the effect. 
 
Authors' conclusions
There is evidence from RCTs that prophylaxis, as compared to on‐demand treatment, may reduce bleeding frequency in previously‐treated people with hemophilia. Prophylaxis may also improve joint function, pain and quality of life, even though this does not translate into a detectable improvement of articular damage when assessed by MRI.  
When comparing two different prophylaxis regimens, no significant differences in terms of protection from bleeding were found. Dose optimization could, however, result in improved efficacy. Given the heterogeneity of the data, pooled estimates were not obtained for most comparisons.  
Well‐designed RCTs and prospective observational controlled studies with standardised definitions and measurements are needed to establish the optimal and most cost‐effective treatment regimens.

Regular clotting factor to prevent bleeds in hemophilia: what do the trials show?

Rationale
Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder. The blood lacks a key protein needed to clot. Many people bleed into joints and muscles. This can cause pain and harm to the joints over time.

Doctors can treat a bleed after it starts. This is called on-demand care. Doctors can also give the clotting protein on a set plan. This is called prophylaxis, or “pro-feh-LAK-sis.” The goal is to stop bleeds before they start.

The study looked at people with hemophilia A or B. These are the two main types. People with severe disease often have repeat bleeds. That can lead to joint damage and less movement. This hurts daily life.

Clotting factor is the missing protein. It can help blood clot. Regular use may stop bleeds and protect joints. But it can be hard to use. It may cost more. People want to know if it is worth it. The team asked: Does regular factor help more than on-demand care?

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. In these trials, people were put into groups by chance. This type of trial is strong. It can reduce unfairness in who gets which care.

The team searched several medical databases. The last search date was February 24, 2021. They found ten trials with 608 people. All had used clotting factor before. Some had hemophilia A. Some had hemophilia B.

Four trials compared regular factor to on-demand care. Eight trials compared one regular plan to another plan. Two trials did both types of comparisons. The trials took place in many places. Ages and genders were not stated in this summary.

Time in each trial was not the same. The exact time in each trial was not given here. The trials used different plans for dose and timing. That means the team could not mix all the data together.

Results
Main finding: Regular factor likely lowers bleeds. In trials that compared regular care to on-demand care, people on regular care had fewer joint bleeds. One trial also found better joint function and less pain. People felt their quality of life was better on regular care.

In that same trial, joint pictures did not look better. These pictures were from a type of scan called MRI. MRI takes clear pictures inside the body. The scans did not show clear joint repair. But people still moved better and hurt less.

Side effects were slightly higher with regular care in two trials. Most side effects were mild. No one got a virus from blood products in these trials. No one in those trials formed long-term blockers to the factor. A blocker is when the body fights the factor protein. In one other trial, a few people had a short rise in blockers to factor VIII. These went away. Doctors did not link rare events like rash, swelling, or weight gain to the study drugs.

The review also looked at different regular plans. Some plans used more or less factor. Some used different timing. Most trials did not find one plan that stopped joint bleeds better than the others. But one small study of ten people with type B saw a difference. Two times a week did better than once a week at the same total dose. People had fewer total bleeds with the two-times plan.

What do these results mean for people with hemophilia?
- Regular factor may help many people bleed less.
- It may also help people move more and hurt less.
- People may feel better in daily life with regular care.
- Joint pictures may not change right away. But life and movement can improve.
- Side effects may be a little higher with regular care. Most are mild.

How strong is the proof?
The proof in this review was not strong. The trials did not all use the same methods. Some were small. Some had limits in how they ran the groups or measured outcomes. Because of this, the team could not combine many results. We should be careful in how we read the size of the benefit.

What is still not clear?
We still do not know the best dose or timing for all people. We do not know the best plan for cost and ease of use. We also do not know how long joint gains last. Better trials are needed. They should use the same ways to measure bleeds, pain, joint health, and daily life.

Bottom line
For people with hemophilia A or B who have used factor before, regular factor may cut bleeds. It may also help with pain and movement. It may help people feel better day to day. We do not yet know the single “best” regular plan. The proof so far points to benefit, with a small rise in side effects. More large and careful trials are needed to guide dose, timing, and cost. Talk with your care team about your goals and needs. They can help you weigh the pros and cons for you.","Regular clotting factor replacement therapy to prevent joint damage in people living with severe hemophilia A or B 
Review question 
Should people, who have previously been treated for joint bleeding, be given regular preventative treatment with clotting factor concentrates to manage their condition? 
Background 
Hemophilia A and B are X‐linked inherited bleeding disorders in which bleeding  into joints is a major problem. Repeated joint bleeds can lead to affected joints (commonly referred to as 'target joints') becoming damaged and painful, with limited movement. Currently, bleeding is treated and prevented with plasma‐derived or recombinant clotting factor concentrates, and more recently non‐clotting factor formulations. This review looked at how useful and effective different clotting factor treatment strategies are for preventing joint bleeding and other outcomes in previously treated people with hemophilia A or B. 
Search date 
Date of last search: 24 February 2021.
Study characteristics 
This review includes 10 randomised controlled trials. Eight had treatment arms that compared the regular use of clotting factor concentrates to prevent joint bleeds with different dosing schemes to identify regimens that may be better; four had treatment arms that compared the regular use of factor concentrates to prevent bleeds to their 'on demand' use to treat bleeds once they occur (two trials had multiple arms and were included in both comparisons). 
Key results 
In people living with hemophilia A or B previously treated for joint bleeding or with existing joint damage, preventive therapy may reduce the number of joint bleeds compared to 'on‐demand therapy'. This reduction in bleeds may lead to an improvement in joint function, pain, and quality of life. However, preventive therapy is linked to an increased use of factor concentrates and therefore higher treatment costs. Further studies are needed to establish the best preventive course of treatment in terms of starting time, frequency and dose level. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be low because of different types of bias that could have affected the results. Future research might have an important role in changing our confidence in these results.

10.1002-14651858.CD013191,"Background
Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is important to guide appropriate management and improve morbidity and survival. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually a localised skin cancer but with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue, whereas cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma are higher risk skin cancers with the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death. When used in conjunction with clinical or dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, or both, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) may help to identify cancers eligible for non‐surgical treatment without the need for a diagnostic biopsy, particularly in people with suspected BCC. Any potential benefit must be balanced against the risk of any misdiagnoses. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of RCM for the detection of BCC, cSCC, or any skin cancer in adults with any suspicious lesion and lesions that are difficult to diagnose (equivocal); and to compare its accuracy with that of usual practice (visual inspection or dermoscopy, or both). 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies of any design that evaluated the accuracy of RCM alone, or RCM in comparison to visual inspection or dermoscopy, or both, in adults with lesions suspicious for skin cancer compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up, or both. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. For computation of likely numbers of true‐positive, false‐positive, false‐negative, and true‐negative findings in the 'Summary of findings' tables, we applied summary sensitivity and specificity estimates to lower quartile, median and upper quartiles of the prevalence observed in the study groups. We also investigated the impact of observer experience. 
Main results
The review included 10 studies reporting on 11 study cohorts. All 11 cohorts reported data for the detection of BCC, including 2037 lesions (464 with BCC); and four cohorts reported data for the detection of cSCC, including 834 lesions (71 with cSCC). Only one study also reported data for the detection of BCC or cSCC using dermoscopy, limiting comparisons between RCM and dermoscopy. Studies were at high or unclear risk of bias across almost all methodological quality domains, and were of high or unclear concern regarding applicability of the evidence. Selective participant recruitment, unclear blinding of the reference test, and exclusions due to image quality or technical difficulties were observed. It was unclear whether studies were representative of populations eligible for testing with RCM, and test interpretation was often undertaken using images, remotely from the participant and the interpreter blinded to clinical information that would normally be available in practice. 
Meta‐analysis found RCM to be more sensitive but less specific for the detection of BCC in studies of participants with equivocal lesions (sensitivity 94%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 79% to 98%; specificity 85%, 95% CI 72% to 92%; 3 studies) compared to studies that included any suspicious lesion (sensitivity 76%, 95% CI 45% to 92%; specificity 95%, 95% CI 66% to 99%; 4 studies), although CIs were wide. At the median prevalence of disease of 12.5% observed in studies including any suspicious lesion, applying these results to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions results in 30 BCCs missed with 44 false‐positive results (lesions misdiagnosed as BCCs). At the median prevalence of disease of 15% observed in studies of equivocal lesions, nine BCCs would be missed with 128 false‐positive results in a population of 1000 lesions. Across both sets of studies, up to 15% of these false‐positive lesions were observed to be melanomas mistaken for BCCs. There was some suggestion of higher sensitivities in studies with more experienced observers. Summary sensitivity and specificity could not be estimated for the detection of cSCC due to paucity of data. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence for the use of RCM for the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC in either population group. A possible role for RCM in clinical practice is as a tool to avoid diagnostic biopsies in lesions with a relatively high clinical suspicion of BCC. The potential for, and consequences of, misclassification of other skin cancers such as melanoma as BCCs requires further research. Importantly, data are lacking that compare RCM to standard clinical practice (with or without dermoscopy). 
","1. Plain Title
Can a light scan help spot skin cancer without a biopsy?

2. Rationale
Skin cancer is common. Some types stay local but still harm skin. Other types can spread and can be deadly. Finding cancer early helps people live longer.

Doctors often need a biopsy to be sure. A biopsy is a small cut to take a bit of skin. A lab then checks the cells. Doctors also use a hand lens “skin scope” to look close.

A newer test may help. It is called reflectance confocal microscopy, or RCM. It is a skin scan that uses light to see cells in living skin. It might help tell which spots need care, and which do not.

This study asked if RCM can spot skin cancer well. The team looked at two main types. They looked at basal cell cancer (also called BCC). They also looked at cutaneous squamous cell cancer (also called cSCC). They wanted to know if RCM could help skip a biopsy in some cases.

3. Trial Design
This was not one trial. It was a review of many past studies. The team searched many medical lists and trial sites. They looked from the start of those lists up to August 2016.

They looked for studies in adults with spots that might be cancer. Each study had to test RCM. Each study had to check results against a “sure” answer. The “sure” answer was lab check after a biopsy, or close follow‑up.

They found 10 studies. These were in 11 groups of people. All 11 groups checked for BCC. These had 2037 skin spots. Of these, 464 were BCC. Four groups checked for cSCC. These had 834 skin spots. Of these, 71 were cSCC. Only one study also did a head‑to‑head check with a skin scope.

Most reports did not give full details on who took part. All were adults. Reports did not make gender clear. Time in each study was not clear. In many studies, readers looked at scans from afar. They often did not have the clinic facts a doctor would have.

4. Results
The team mixed data from the studies. They looked at two kinds of spots. One kind was “hard to call” spots. These are spots that even trained eyes find hard to judge. The other kind was “any spot that looked bad.”

For any spot that looked bad, think of 1000 spots. About 125 of those were BCC. With RCM, about 30 of those would be missed. RCM would also flag about 44 spots that were not BCC.

For hard to call spots, think of 1000 spots. About 150 of those were BCC. With RCM, about 9 of those would be missed. RCM would also flag about 128 spots that were not BCC.

Some false alarms were worrisome. As many as 1 in 7 false alarms were melanoma. That means a melanoma could look like a BCC on RCM. This could lead to the wrong plan.

The team could not add up the cSCC data. There were too few cases. So they could not say how well RCM worked for cSCC.

Reader skill may matter. Studies hint that more trained readers found more real BCC. But the reports did not make this very clear. We need stronger tests of this point.

Many studies had set‑up limits. Some picked people in ways that can skew results. Some left out scans due to poor image quality. Many readers did not see the patient. They did not have key clinic details. These limits can change how RCM seems to work.

Few studies checked RCM against usual care. Usual care is an eye exam, with or without a skin scope. Only one study did that head‑to‑head check. So we cannot say that RCM is better than usual care.

What does this mean for patients? There is not enough proof to use RCM alone to tell if a spot is BCC or cSCC. RCM may help in a narrow case. If a doctor already thinks a spot is BCC, RCM may help avoid a biopsy. This may spare a cut and a scar for some people.

But wrong calls can harm. A melanoma might get called a BCC. Then the plan may not fit the true risk. We need more and better studies to learn how often this happens.

We also need fair tests that match real clinic life. Future studies should compare RCM with usual care. They should say who took part, and how long they were watched. They should test readers with real clinic facts. This will show how RCM works in day‑to‑day care.

In sum, RCM is a promising tool. It may help in some BCC cases. But for now, it should not replace a biopsy or usual care. Talk with your skin doctor about the best test for you.","What is the diagnostic accuracy of reflectance confocal microscopy for the detection of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in adults? 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is on its own or compared to inspection of a skin lesion with the naked eye alone or using a hand‐held microscope called dermoscopy for diagnosing two common forms of keratinocyte skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in adults. Review authors in Cochrane included 10 studies to answer this question. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer. BCC and cSCC are usually localised skin cancers. Making the correct diagnosis is important because mistaking one skin cancer for another can lead to the wrong treatment being used or lead to a delay in effective treatment. A missed diagnosis of BCC (known as a false‐negative result) can result in the missed BCC growing and causing disfigurement. A missed diagnosis of cSCC is more serious as it could spread to other parts of the body. Diagnosing a skin cancer when it is not actually present (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary biopsy or treatment and can cause discomfort and worry to patients. 
What was studied in the review? 
Microscopic techniques are used by skin cancer specialists to provide a more detailed, magnified examination of suspicious skin lesions than can be achieved using the naked eye alone. Currently, dermoscopy is used by doctors as part of the examination of suspicious skin lesions. RCM is a new microscopic technique to increase the magnification. It is a hand‐held device or static unit using infrared light that can visualise deeper layers of the skin when compared with dermoscopy. Both techniques are painless procedures, but RCM is more expensive, time consuming, and requires additional specialised training. Dermoscopy can be used by general practitioners (GP) whereas RCM is likely to only be used by hospital specialists for people who have been referred with a skin lesion that is suspected to be a skin cancer. We wanted to see if RCM should be used instead of, or as well as, inspection of a skin lesion with the naked eye alone or using dermoscopy to diagnose BCC or cSCC. The accuracy of the test was looked at when used on people with any suspicious skin lesion and also in people with skin lesions that were tricky to diagnose. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 10 studies that included information on 11 groups of people with lesions suspicious for skin cancer. The main results were based on seven of the 11 sets of data: four in any lesion suspicious for skin cancer and three in particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions. 
For the comparison of RCM versus dermoscopy, we found four sets of data that included 912 suspicious skin lesions. The results suggested that in a group of 1000 people with any suspicious lesion, of whom 125 (12.5%) really do have BCC: 
‐ an estimated 139 people will have an RCM result indicating BCC is present;
‐ of these, 44 (32%) people will not have BCC (false‐positive results) including one person with a melanoma mistaken for a BCC; 
‐ of the 861 people with an RCM result indicating that BCC is not present, 30 (3%) will actually have BCC. 
The review also included three sets of data on people that had 668 particularly difficult to diagnose skin lesions, one comparing RCM to dermoscopy. The results suggested that if RCM was to be used by skin specialists in a group of 1000 people, of whom 150 (15%) really do have BCC: 
‐ an estimated 269 people will have an RCM result indicating BCC is present;
‐ of these, 128 (48%) people will not have a BCC (known as a false‐positive result), including as many as 19 people with melanomas mistaken for BCCs; 
‐ of the 732 people with an RCM result indicating that BCC is not present, nine (1%) will actually have BCC. 
There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of RCM for the detection of cSCC in either population group. 
How reliable are the results of this review? 
There was a lot of variation in the results of the studies in this review. Poor reporting of study conduct made assessment of the reliability of studies difficult. It was unclear whether studies were representative of populations eligible for testing with RCM, and test interpretation was often undertaken using images, remotely from the patient and the interpreter blinded to clinical information that would normally be available in practice. Only one study compared the accuracy of dermoscopy and RCM. Most studies were conducted by specialist research teams with high levels of training and experience with RCM, meaning that RCM may appear better than it would be when used in everyday practice. Most studies reported diagnosis based on observers' subjective views, which might not be the same for people using the technique in everyday practice. In nine studies, the diagnosis of skin cancer was made by a skin biopsy or by following up those people over time to make sure they remained negative for skin cancer*. This is likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had skin cancer. In one study, the absence of skin cancer was made by experts looking at the skin, a method that may be less reliable for deciding whether patients really had skin cancer. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Five studies were carried out in Europe (61%), and the rest in Asia, Oceania, North America, or more than one continent. The average ages of people who took part ranged from 41 to 65 years. The percentage of people with BCC in these studies ranged from 6% to 83% (a middle value of 12% for any suspicious lesion and 15% for difficult to diagnose skin lesions). For studies of RCM used for cSCC, the percentage of people with cSCC ranged between 4% and 13%. In many studies it was not clear what tests people taking part had received before RCM. 
What are the implications of this review? 
There was not enough good evidence to support the use of RCM for the diagnosis of BCC or cSCC outside of research studies. There was a lot of variation and uncertainty in results and in the ways studies were carried out, reducing the reliability of findings. Using RCM might avoid the need for a diagnostic biopsy in people who see a doctor with a high suspicion of a BCC lesion, but more research is needed to confirm this. Such research should compare RCM to dermoscopy in well‐described groups of people with suspicious skin lesions and they must say whether other skin cancers end up being missed or being wrongly classified as BCC. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy or clinical follow‐up were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses).

10.1002-14651858.CD005293.pub2,"Treatments for accidental damage during surgery to the nerves supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin 
Review question 
The main question addressed by this review is how effective are different treatments and what are the best timings for these treatments following accidental damage during surgery to the nerves that supply sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin. 
Background 
The nerves (alveolar and lingual) supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin, may be injured as a result of surgical treatments to the mouth and face, including surgery to remove lower wisdom teeth. The vast majority (90%) of these injuries are temporary and get better within eight weeks. However if they last for longer than six months they are considered to be permanent. Damage to these nerves can lead to altered sensation in the region of the lower lip and chin, or tongue or both. Furthermore, damage to the nerve supplying the tongue may lead to altered taste perception. These injuries can affect people's quality of life leading to emotional problems, problems with socialising and disabilities. Accidental injury after surgery can also give rise to legal action. 
There are many interventions or treatments available, surgical and non‐surgical, that may enhance recovery, including improving sensation. They can be grouped as. 
1. Surgical – a variety of procedures. 2. Laser treatment – low‐level laser treatment has been used to treat partial loss of sensation. 3. Medical – treatment with drugs including antiepileptics, antidepressants and painkillers. 4. Counselling – including cognitive behavioural and relaxation therapy, changing behaviour and hypnosis. 
Study characteristics 
The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review, and the evidence is current as of 9 October 2013. There are two studies included, both published in 1996, which compared low‐level laser treatment to placebo or fake treatment for partial loss of sensation following surgery to the lower jaw. There were 15 participants in one study and 16 in the other, their ages ranging from 17 to 55 years. All had suffered accidental damage to nerves of the lower jaw and tongue causing some loss of sensation following surgery. 
Key results 
Low‐level laser therapy was the only treatment to be evaluated in the included studies and this was compared to fake or placebo laser therapy. No studies were found that evaluated other surgical, medical or counselling treatments. 
There was some evidence of an improvement when participants reported whether or not sensation was better in the lip and chin areas with low‐level laser therapy. This is based on the results of a single, small study, so the results should be interpreted with caution. 
No studies reported on the effects of the treatment on other outcomes such as pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste. No studies reported on quality of life or harm. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence is very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the two included studies and the low number of participants, and evidence from participants with only partial sensory loss.

Treating nerve injury to the tongue, lip, and chin after mouth surgery

Rationale
Some people have mouth or face surgery. This can harm the nerves that let you feel touch. These nerves serve the tongue, lower lip, and chin. When hurt, they can cause numb, tingling, or odd feel.

Most nerve harm gets better on its own. About 9 out of 10 people feel better in about two months. If signs last more than six months, they may be long term. Tongue nerve harm can also change how food tastes.

These signs can hurt daily life. They can cause mood strain and stress. They can make it hard to eat, talk, kiss, or smile. Some people may avoid friends and fun.

Many kinds of care may help. These include surgery on the nerve. They also include weak laser light, drugs for nerve pain, and talk care. Talk care can mean learning how to cope and relax.

But we need clear proof on what helps. We also want to know when to start care. Early care might help, but we need data. The study below asks these key points.

Trial Design
This was a review of past research. A group called Cochrane Oral Health did the review. They looked for studies up to 9 October 2013. They found two studies, both from 1996.

Both studies tested a weak laser light. The goal was to help a partial loss of feel. The studies used a fake laser, too. That fake light did not give real care.

People in the studies were ages 17 to 55. All had nerve harm after lower jaw surgery. The harm was to nerves for the lip, chin, or tongue. All had some loss of feel, not a full loss.

The review also asked about timing of care. It asked when to start care after the nerve harm. But the two studies did not test timing. The review did not say how long each study ran.

No studies on other care types were found. There were no tests of surgery, drugs, or talk care. So the review could not judge those options.

Results
Only weak laser light had test data to review. One small study showed a hint of gain. More people said their lip and chin feel got better with the laser. This was better than with the fake light.

This hint came from few people. One study had 15 people. The other had 16 people. Small studies can give unsure results.

The second study did not add clear proof of gain. So we must be careful. A small hint is not strong proof. We need more and larger trials.

No study looked at pain changes. No study asked if eating or talking got easier. No study looked at taste change. No study looked at life quality or day to day tasks.

No study shared harm or side effect data. So we do not know if the laser caused harm. We also do not know the best dose or plan. We do not know how long any gain may last.

The review said the proof was very weak. There were flaws in how the studies were done and told. The number of people was low. They only had a partial loss of feel.

What does this mean for you? Weak laser light may help some people feel better. But the proof is small and unsure. We do not know if it helps pain, speech, food, or taste.

We also do not know the best time to start care. We do not know if other care types help more. This includes surgery, drugs, and talk care. No trials for these were found in the review.

More and better studies are needed. These should test more people and share clear plans. They should track pain, taste, speech, and life quality. They should also share harms.

If you have these signs, talk with your care team. Ask about the small hint for laser light. Ask what is known and what is not known. Ask about other care choices and what they may do.

You and your care team can make a plan. Your plan should fit your signs and goals. It should weigh hopes for gain with the lack of firm proof. It should also watch for any harms.

In short, there is a small hint of help with weak laser light. But we lack strong proof. We also lack proof for other care. More research will help guide care in the future.","Treatments for accidental damage during surgery to the nerves supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin

10.1002-14651858.CD013440.pub2,"Background
Primary malignant brain tumours can have an unpredictable course, but high‐grade gliomas typically have a relentlessly progressive disease trajectory. They can cause profound symptom burden, affecting physical, neurocognitive, and social functioning from an early stage in the illness. This can significantly impact on role function and on the experiences and needs of informal caregivers. Access to specialist palliative and supportive care early in the disease trajectory, for those with high‐grade tumours in particular, has the potential to improve patients' and caregivers' quality of life. However, provision of palliative and supportive care for people with primary brain tumours ‐ and their informal caregivers ‐ is historically ill‐defined and ad hoc, and the benefits of early palliative interventions have not been confirmed. It is therefore important to define the role and effectiveness of early referral to specialist palliative care services and/or the effectiveness of other interventions focused on palliating disease impact on people and their informal caregivers. This would help guide improvement to service provision, by defining those interventions which are effective across a range of domains, and developing an evidence‐based model of integrated supportive and palliative care for this population. 
Objectives
To assess the evidence base for early palliative care interventions, including referral to specialist palliative care services compared to usual care, for improving outcomes in adults diagnosed with a primary brain tumour and their carers. 
Search methods
We conducted searches of electronic databases, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO (last searched 16 November 2021). We conducted searches to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative search terms. In addition to this, we searched for any currently recruiting trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and in the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal, and undertook citation tracking via Scopus. We also handsearched reference lists of potentially eligible systematic review articles to identify any other relevant studies, contacted experts in the field and searched key authors via Web of Science and searched SIGLE (System of Information on Grey Literature in Europe). 
Selection criteria
We included studies looking at early referral to specialist palliative care services ‐ or early targeted palliative interventions by other healthcare professionals ‐ for improving quality of life, symptom control, psychological outcomes, or overall survival as a primary or secondary outcome measure. Studies included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised studies (NRS), as well as qualitative and mixed‐methods studies where both qualitative and quantitative data were included. Participants were adults with a confirmed radiological and/or histological diagnosis of a primary malignant brain tumour, and/or informal adult carers (either at individual or family level) of people with a primary malignant brain tumour. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodological procedures for data extraction, management, and analysis. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for symptom control, i.e. cognitive function. 
Main results
We identified 9748 references from the searches, with 8337 remaining after duplicates were removed. After full‐text review, we included one trial. There were no studies of early specialist palliative care interventions or of early, co‐ordinated generalist palliative care approaches. 
The included randomised trial addressed a single symptom area, focusing on early cognitive rehabilitation, administered within two weeks of surgery in a mixed brain tumour population, of whom approximately half had a high‐grade glioma. The intervention was administered individually as therapist‐led computerised exercises over 16 one‐hour sessions, four times/week for four weeks. Sessions addressed several cognitive domains including time orientation, spatial orientation, visual attention, logical reasoning, memory, and executive function. 
There were no between‐group differences in outcome for tests of logical‐executive function, but differences were observed in the domains of visual attention and verbal memory. Risk of bias was assessed and stated as high for performance bias and attrition bias but for selective reporting it was unclear whether all outcomes were reported. We considered the certainty of the evidence, as assessed by GRADE, to be very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently there is a lack of research focusing on the introduction of early palliative interventions specifically for people with primary brain tumours, either as co‐ordinated specialist palliative care approaches or interventions focusing on a specific aspect of palliation. Future research should address the methodological shortcomings described in early palliative intervention studies in other cancers and chronic conditions. In particular, the specific population under investigation, the timing and the setting of the intervention should be clearly described and the standardised palliative care‐specific components of the intervention should be defined in detail.

Early care to ease symptoms for adults with brain tumors: what we found

Rationale
Some brain tumors grow fast and are hard to treat. One fast type is a high‑grade glioma. These tumors can cause many hard symptoms early on. They can affect movement, mood, and clear thinking.

These problems can change work and home life. They can also strain family and friends who give care. Many people need help to feel better day to day.

Palliative care may help. Palliative care is care that eases symptoms and stress. It can begin early, along with other treatment.

Early palliative care may raise quality of life. It may help family carers too. But services for people with brain tumors are not clear or equal. We still do not know if early palliative care helps this group. This study set out to find that out.

Trial Design
This study was a review of research. The team looked for fair tests of early palliative care. They also looked for early steps to ease symptoms. They focused on adults with a main brain tumor. They also looked for effects on family carers.

The team searched many research sources. They used medical libraries and trial lists. The last search was on 16 November 2021. They checked thousands of records.

They set clear rules to pick studies. They could include fair tests where a computer picks groups. They could include other study types too. They looked for changes in life quality, symptoms, mood, thinking, and life length.

The team found one trial that fit their rules. They found no trials of early palliative care programs. They found no trials of a full care plan run by a palliative team. The single trial tested a narrow early step to help thinking.

That trial took place soon after brain surgery. People started the study within two weeks of surgery. Adults had brain tumors of mixed types. About half had a fast‑growing tumor.

The trial tested early “brain training.” This is also called cognitive rehab. It is a set of guided tasks to help the brain. A therapist led each session on a computer.

People had 16 one‑hour sessions. They met four times each week for four weeks. The training worked on time and place skills. It also trained attention, logic, memory, and planning skills.

Results
No studies tested full early palliative care programs in this group. No studies tested a joined‑up plan across many needs. The one trial only tested early brain training for thinking.

The trial compared people who got training with those who did not. The training helped some thinking tasks. People did better with visual attention. This means focus on things you see.

People also did better with word memory. This means recall of words you hear or read. But the training did not help all thinking skills. It did not help planning and problem solving.

These gains were small and in only a few areas. The team judged the trial had limits. The way the trial ran may affect trust in the results. The number of people and drop‑outs were concerns in such trials. Because of this, trust in the findings is very low.

What does this mean for you? We do not yet know if early palliative care helps adults with brain tumors. We also do not know how it affects family carers. We need better studies to guide care.

This review shows a big gap in research. People with brain tumors have many needs. They and their families often need help early. Yet we lack solid tests of early palliative care for them.

Future studies should give clear details. They should name who is in the study. They should say when the care starts and where it takes place. They should list each part of care and why it may help.

New studies should also use fair, strong methods. Groups should be set at random. Measures should be clear and the same for all. The plan should track people long enough to see change.

In summary, early palliative care may help. But we do not have good proof yet for brain tumors. One small trial found slight gains in attention and word memory. It did not help other thinking skills.

We need more and better research in this area. Good studies can guide care and services. They can help people live as well as they can. They can also support family carers in real ways.","Improving the outcome of people with primary brain tumours and their carers using early palliative interventions 
Why this question is important 
Brain tumours can have a significant impact on people and their carers. Brain tumours can impair people's physical, neurocognitive, and social functioning, which can affect the whole family, particularly informal caregivers, who often receive inadequate support. There is evidence in other cancers that providing access to palliative support in the early stages of a person's illness can help to improve their, and their caregivers', quality of life. However, it has not been confirmed that this is the case for people with brain tumours. 
Objectives 
We aimed to assess studies that included early palliative care interventions, including referral to specialist palliative care services compared to usual care, for improving outcomes in adults diagnosed with a primary brain tumour and their carers. 
How we searched for evidence 
We searched electronic medical literature databases for studies that included a range of different types of medical trials, both published and ongoing. We handsearched the reference lists of key papers and searched for key authors of research in the area. We included adults confirmed with a primary brain tumour and informal caregivers such as relatives. 
What we found 
We could not find any trials examining the impact of specialist palliative care teams on outcomes for patients or their carers. We included one trial which focused on a single symptom area – that of cognition – in a patient group of whom about half had a high‐grade tumour. The trial randomised patients between a group receiving a structured cognitive rehabilitation intervention and a group receiving usual rehabilitation care of medications and physiotherapy. Cognitive rehabilitation consisted of supervised computer‐based exercises, lasting 45 minutes at a time, four times a week, over a four‐week period. There was no important difference between the two groups apart from some improvement in visual attention and verbal memory in those who received the cognitive rehabilitation intervention. However, we assessed the certainty of the evidence as being very low, and we could find no evidence in this or other studies on any other aspect of palliative care. 
What this means 
Not enough research has been undertaken on early palliative care interventions which support people with primary brain tumours, and their caregivers. Research is needed which examines co‐ordinated approaches to overall palliative care provision, and interventions which focus on specific aspects of palliation in this population.

Stem cell therapy (SCT) has been proposed as an alternative treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), nonetheless its effectiveness remains debatable. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of SCT in adults with non‐ischaemic DCM.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase for relevant trials in November 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers in May 2020. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing stem/progenitor cells with no cells in adults with non‐ischaemic DCM. We included co‐interventions such as the administration of stem cell mobilizing agents. Studies were classified and analysed into three categories according to the comparison intervention, which consisted of no intervention/placebo, cell mobilization with cytokines, or a different mode of SCT. 
The first two comparisons (no cells in the control group) served to assess the efficacy of SCT while the third (different mode of SCT) served to complement the review with information about safety and other information of potential utility for a better understanding of the effects of SCT. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened all references for eligibility, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. We undertook a quantitative evaluation of data using random‐effects meta‐analyses. We evaluated heterogeneity using the I² statistic. We could not explore potential effect modifiers through subgroup analyses as they were deemed uninformative due to the scarce number of trials available. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We created summary of findings tables using GRADEpro GDT. We focused our summary of findings on all‐cause mortality, safety, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), performance status, and major adverse cardiovascular events. 
Main results
We included 13 RCTs involving 762 participants (452 cell therapy and 310 controls). Only one study was at low risk of bias in all domains. There were many shortcomings in the publications that did not allow a precise assessment of the risk of bias in many domains. Due to the nature of the intervention, the main source of potential bias was lack of blinding of participants (performance bias). Frequently, the format of the continuous data available was not ideal for use in the meta‐analysis and forced us to seek strategies for transforming data in a usable format. 
We are uncertain whether SCT reduces all‐cause mortality in people with DCM compared to no intervention/placebo (mean follow‐up 12 months) (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.31; I² = 0%; studies = 7, participants = 361; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether SCT increases the risk of procedural complications associated with cells injection in people with DCM (data could not be pooled; studies = 7; participants = 361; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether SCT improves HRQoL (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.62, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.23; I² = 72%; studies = 5, participants = 272; very low‐certainty evidence) and functional capacity (6‐minute walk test) (mean difference (MD) 70.12 m, 95% CI –5.28 to 145.51; I² = 87%; studies = 5, participants = 230; very low‐certainty evidence). SCT may result in a slight functional class (New York Heart Association) improvement (data could not be pooled; studies = 6, participants = 398; low‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported major adverse cardiovascular events as defined in our protocol. SCT may not increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (data could not be pooled; studies = 8, participants = 504; low‐certainty evidence). 
When comparing SCT to cell mobilization with granulocyte‐colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF), we are uncertain whether SCT reduces all‐cause mortality (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.31; I² = 39%; studies = 3, participants = 195; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether SCT increases the risk of procedural complications associated with cells injection (studies = 1, participants = 60; very low‐certainty evidence). SCT may not improve HRQoL (MD 4.61 points, 95% CI –5.62 to 14.83; studies = 1, participants = 22; low‐certainty evidence). SCT may improve functional capacity (6‐minute walk test) (MD 140.14 m, 95% CI 119.51 to 160.77; I² = 0%; studies = 2, participants = 155; low‐certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported MACE as defined in our protocol or ventricular arrhythmia. 
The most commonly reported outcomes across studies were based on physiological measures of cardiac function where there were some beneficial effects suggesting potential benefits of SCT in people with non‐ischaemic DCM. However, it is unclear if this intermediate effects translates into clinical benefits for these patients. 
With regard to specific aspects related to the modality of cell therapy and its delivery, uncertainties remain as subgroup analyses could not be performed as planned, making it necessary to wait for the publication of several studies that are currently in progress before any firm conclusion can be reached. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether SCT in people with DCM reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality and procedural complications, improves HRQoL, and performance status (exercise capacity). SCT may improve functional class (NYHA), compared to usual care (no cells). 
Similarly, when compared to G‐CSF, we are also uncertain whether SCT in people with DCM reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality although some studies within this comparison observed a favourable effect that should be interpreted with caution. SCT may not improve HRQoL but may improve to some extent performance status (exercise capacity). Very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding procedural complications. These suggested beneficial effects of SCT, although uncertain due to the very low certainty of the evidence, are accompanied by favourable effects on some physiological measures of cardiac function. 
Presently, the most effective mode of administration of SCT and the population that could benefit the most is unclear. Therefore, it seems reasonable that use of SCT in people with DCM is limited to clinical research settings. Results of ongoing studies are likely to modify these conclusions.

Stem cells for a weak, enlarged heart: what we know so far

Rationale
Dilated cardiomyopathy is a long name. It means the heart is weak and big. It is not due to clogged heart blood pipes. Doctors call that “non‑ischaemic.”

A weak heart does not pump well. People can feel short of breath and very tired. Some have swollen legs or need to stay in the hospital. It can shorten life.

Usual drugs can help many people. But some still feel unwell. So, new care is under study.

Stem cell therapy uses special cells from the body. These cells may help fix or calm harm in the heart. They may help the heart pump better. The big hope is to help people feel better and live longer.

This review asked a clear question. Do stem cells help adults with a weak, enlarged heart? And are they safe? The team also asked if one way to give cells works better than others.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. The team looked for high‑quality trials in big medical lists. They last searched in late 2020. They only used trials where choice of care was by chance.

They found 13 trials. In total, 762 adults took part. Some got stem cells. Some did not get cells. Some got a drug called G‑CSF. This drug moves stem cells from bone to blood. The team also looked at different ways to give cells.

People were adults with a weak, enlarged heart not due to blocked arteries. Men and women took part. Most people were in a study for about one year. The team checked life span, side effects, how people felt, and how far they could walk.

Results
What did the review find? The main point is this: we are not sure yet. The trials were small. Many had limits. This makes it hard to be sure.

Life span: We are not sure if stem cells help people live longer. Over about one year, results were mixed. Some trials saw fewer deaths. Others did not. The team could not rule out no real effect.

Safety: We are not sure if the cell shots add risk. Some people had problems tied to the way cells were given. But the trials did not show a clear, firm pattern. Large, careful trials are still needed.

How people feel: We are not sure if life quality got better. Some trials saw small gains. Others did not show change. The gains, when seen, were not the same across trials.

Daily limits: The team looked at class of symptoms. Doctors call this NYHA class. A lower class means fewer limits in daily life. Stem cells may help this class a bit. But we still need better proof.

Walk tests: Some trials used a six‑minute walk test. A few trials saw people walk farther. Others did not see a clear change. The size of any gain is not clear.

Heart rhythm: A few trials looked at fast, unsafe beats from the bottom heart rooms. These are called ventricular rhythms. Stem cells did not seem to raise this risk. But we still need more good data.

Big heart events: Trials did not report these in the same way. So, the team could not tell if stem cells change this risk.

Heart pump tests: Some trials used scans or echo tests. A few saw better pump numbers after stem cells. This may be a good sign. But we do not yet know if better numbers help people live longer or feel better.

G‑CSF drug versus stem cells: Some trials used G‑CSF to move cells inside the body. The team compared this to giving stem cells. We are not sure which path works best for life span. One or two trials looked better for stem cells. But we must be careful with those small signals. Life quality did not seem to change. Walk tests may have shown some gain with stem cells. Safety data here was also not clear.

Why the results are not clear: Many trials were small. In some, people knew which care they got. Ways of giving cells were not the same. The time in the study was short. Not all trials used the same tests. All this lowers our trust in the results.

What this means for patients: Stem cells for this heart problem may help some signs. They may help daily limits a bit. They may help some people walk a bit more. But we do not know if they help people live longer. We also do not know the true risk of harm.

What doctors suggest now: Use stem cells for this heart problem only in research. Join a well‑run trial if you want to try this care. New, larger trials are in progress. Their results may change what we know.

Bottom line: We still do not have clear proof that stem cells help this heart problem in a strong and safe way. We hope new trials will give clear answers. For now, talk with your heart doctor. Ask about pros, cons, and other care that is known to help.","Bone marrow cells in non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy
Review question 
Are bone marrow cells safe and effective as a treatment for non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)? 
Background 
DCM is a disorder of the heart muscle with heart dilation (heart muscle becomes stretched) and impaired contraction, in the absence of high blood pressure, damaged or diseased heart valves, or heart disease present at birth or related to myocardial infarction (heart attack). The current standard of treatment is based on medicines and cardiac devices. However, DCM is still one of the leading causes of heart transplantation in adults. 
Stem cells are special cells produced in the bone marrow that are able to develop into many different cell types. Giving stem cells directly into the heart muscle has been proposed as an alternative treatment to reduce or stop further deterioration in heart function in people with DCM. 
Study characteristics 
We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the infusion of bone marrow‐derived stem cells into the heart muscle with the usual‐care (control) treatment in people diagnosed with DCM. We searched multiple databases for trials up to 10 November 2020. 
We included 13 RCTs involving 762 participants (452 receiving stem cell therapy and 310 controls). The trials included people with severe symptoms of ischaemic (following a heart attack) and non‐ischaemic DCM. We selected only the data from non‐ischaemic DCM. 
The studies included an average of 60 people aged about 45 to 58.5 years and 50% to 89% men in each trial. Following therapy, the participants were assessed for six months to five years, with most at one year. One study declared a private funding whereas seven others had public or governmental funding, two had non‐profit funding, and four did not report this information. 
Key results 
SCT versus control: very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding mortality, procedural complications, health‐related quality of life and exercise capacity. Low‐quality evidence suggests that SCT may slightly improve deterioration of heart function and may not increase the risk of abnormal heartbeats in people with DCM. No studies reported other relevant outcomes such as major cardiac adverse events. 
STC plus cytokine versus control: very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding mortality. Low‐quality evidence suggests that SCT plus cytokine may not improve health‐related quality of life but may improve exercise capacity as well as some physiological measures related to cardiac function (although it is unclear to what extent these latter outcomes are associated with relevant clinical benefits for patients). Hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. Very low‐quality evidence reflects uncertainty regarding procedural complications. No studies reported major cardiac adverse events or abnormal heartbeats. 
Due to the limited number of studies we could not perform analyses to identify which specific features of SCT and clinical characteristics of patients are associated with better results. Thus, more research is needed to establish the role of SCT in the treatment of DCM and the most effective therapies. 
Quality of evidence 
The evidence in this review is of low to very low quality due to the small number of events, results not similar across studies, risk of bias, and issues with study design. Furthermore, the limitations in the reporting of most studies made it difficult to obtain and use the information to reach clearer conclusions.

10.1002-14651858.CD013287.pub2,"Background
Psychosis is an illness characterised by the presence of hallucinations and delusions that can cause distress or a marked change in an individual's behaviour (e.g. social withdrawal, flat or blunted affect). A first episode of psychosis (FEP) is the first time someone experiences these symptoms that can occur at any age, but the condition is most common in late adolescence and early adulthood. This review is concerned with FEP and the early stages of a psychosis, referred to throughout this review as 'recent‐onset psychosis.' 
Specialised early intervention (SEI) teams are community mental health teams that specifically treat people who are experiencing, or have experienced, a recent‐onset psychosis. SEI teams provide a range of treatments including medication, psychotherapy, psychoeducation, educational and employment support, augmented by assertive contact with the service user and small caseloads. Treatment is time limited, usually offered for two to three years, after which service users are either discharged to primary care or transferred to a standard adult community mental health team. Evidence suggests that once SEI treatment ends, improvements may not be sustained, bringing uncertainty about the optimal duration of SEI to ensure the best long‐term outcomes. Extending SEI has been proposed as a way of providing continued intensive treatment and continuity of care, of usually up to five years, in order to a) sustain the positive initial outcomes of SEI; and b) improve the long‐term trajectory of the illness. 
Objectives
To compare extended SEI teams with treatment as usual (TAU) for people with recent‐onset psychosis.To compare extended SEI teams with standard SEI teams followed by TAU (standard SEI + TAU) for people with recent‐onset psychosis. 
Search methods
On 3 October 2018 and 22 October 2019, we searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's study‐based register of trials, including registries of clinical trials. 
Selection criteria
We selected all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing extended SEI with TAU for people with recent‐onset psychosis and all RCTs comparing extended SEI with standard SEI + TAU for people with recent‐onset psychosis. We entered trials meeting these criteria and reporting usable data as included studies. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes we calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and their 95% CIs, or if assessment measures differed for the same construct, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included three RCTs, with a total 780 participants, aged 16 to 35 years. All participants met the criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorders or affective psychoses. No trials compared extended SEI with TAU. All three trials randomly allocated people approximately two years into standard SEI to either extended SEI or standard SEI + TAU. 
The certainty of evidence for outcomes varied from low to very low. Our primary outcomes were recovery and disengagement from mental health services. No trials reported on recovery, and we used remission as a proxy. 
Three trials reported on remission, with the point estimate suggesting a 13% increase in remission in favour of extended SEI, but this included wide confidence intervals (CIs) and a very uncertain estimate of no benefit (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.31; 3 trials, 780 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Two trials provided data on disengagement from services with evidence that extended SEI care may result in fewer disengagements from mental health treatment (15%) in comparison to standard SEI + TAU (34%) (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75; 2 trials, 380 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
There may be no evidence of a difference in rates of psychiatric hospital admission (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.52; 1 trial, 160 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or the number of days spent in a psychiatric hospital (MD ‐2.70, 95% CI ‐8.30 to 2.90; 1 trial, 400 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
One trial found uncertain evidence regarding lower global psychotic symptoms in extended SEI in comparison to standard SEI + TAU (MD ‐1.90, 95% CI ‐3.28 to ‐0.52; 1 trial, 156 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
It was uncertain whether the use of extended SEI over standard SEI + TAU resulted in fewer deaths due to all‐cause mortality, as so few deaths were recorded in trials (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.64; 3 trials, 780 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Very uncertain evidence suggests that using extended SEI instead of standard SEI + TAU may not improve global functioning (SMD 0.23, 95% CI ‐0.29 to 0.76; 2 trials, 560 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
There was low risk of bias in all three trials for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and other biases. All three trials had high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel due to the nature of the intervention. For the risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessments and incomplete outcome data there was at least one trial with high or unclear risk of bias. 
Authors' conclusions
There may be preliminary evidence of benefit from extending SEI team care for treating people experiencing psychosis, with fewer people disengaging from mental health services. Evidence regarding other outcomes was uncertain. The certainty of evidence for the measured outcomes was low or very low. 
Further, suitably powered studies that use a consistent approach to outcome selection are needed, but with only one further ongoing trial, there is unlikely to be any definitive conclusion for the effectiveness of extended SEI for at least the next few years. 
","1. Plain Title
Does longer early team care help people after a first episode of psychosis?

2. Rationale
Psychosis can make people see or hear things that are not there. It can cause strong beliefs that are not true. It can also lead to pulling away from friends or family. This often starts in late teen years or early adult years.

A first episode of psychosis is the first time these signs appear. Life can change fast. School, work, and home life can suffer. People and families need fast, skilled help.

Early intervention teams give this help. These teams use many tools. They give medicine, talk therapy, and teach about the illness. They also help with school and work. They keep in close touch and have small case loads. Team care often lasts two to three years.

Some gains may fade when this care ends. People may drop out of care. This can lead to worse health and stress. One idea is to keep team care going for longer. This “extended” care can last up to five years. It may help keep gains and improve long term health.

This study looked at that idea. The main question was simple. Does longer early team care work better than the usual length of care?

3. Trial Design
This was a review of fair tests. In fair tests, chance decides who gets which care. The team searched trial lists in 2018 and 2019. They looked for trials in people with recent psychosis.

The review found three trials. In total, 780 people took part. They were ages 16 to 35 years. They had schizophrenia type illness or mood type psychosis.

All people had already had about two years of early team care. Then chance put them into one of two groups. One group got more years of early team care. This is the “extended” group. The other group moved to usual care after the team care ended. This is the “standard team care then usual care” group.

The trials did not test extended care versus usual care alone. They only tested extended care versus standard team care, then usual care. The abstract did not state how long people stayed in the trials. In real life, standard team care lasts two to three years. Extended care can last up to five years.

4. Results
The review asked if more people got well. Trials did not report “recovery.” They used “remission” instead. Remission means a quiet phase when signs are low. More people may have reached remission with extended care. But we are not sure. The proof for this was very weak.

Staying in care was better with extended care. About 15 out of 100 people stopped care with extended care. About 34 out of 100 people stopped care with standard care then usual care. This points to a real gain. The proof for this was low, but not very weak.

The need to go into a psych hospital did not look different. One trial looked at this. There was no clear gap between the two groups. Days spent in hospital also looked the same. One trial looked at days in hospital.

One trial found fewer overall symptoms with extended care. But this finding was very unsure. Day to day function did not seem to improve with extended care. This result was also very unsure.

There were very few deaths in the trials. We cannot tell if extended care changed this. The review did not find clear harm from extended care. But the data were too small to be sure.

The trials had some good parts. They used chance to pick who got which care. They hid the group choice at the start. But people and staff knew which care they got. That is hard to avoid in this type of care. This can add bias. Some other parts also had unclear risk of bias.

What does this mean for patients and families? Longer team care may help people stay in care. Staying in care can help people get help when they need it. It may also help with trust and support. These are real, everyday goals for many people.

We still do not know if longer care improves health in other ways. We do not know if it cuts hospital use. We do not know if it helps with school, work, or daily life. We also do not know how long any gains last.

The proof we have is small and weak. Most results had low or very low strength. This means we should be careful when we use them. We need more and larger trials. These trials should use the same key measures. That way we can compare results across studies.

Only one new trial is still in progress. So, strong answers may take years. For now, the main take home is clear and simple. Longer early team care may help people stay linked to care. Other benefits are still unclear. More good studies are needed to guide care choices.","Is extending the treatment time by specialist mental health teams better for people with recent‐onset psychosis? 
What is psychosis? 
Psychosis describes conditions affecting the mind, in which people have trouble distinguishing what is real from what is not real. This might involve seeing or hearing things that other people cannot see or hear (hallucinations), or believing things that are not true (delusions). The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can cause severe distress and a change in behaviour. A first episode psychosis is the first time a person experiences an episode of psychosis. Recent‐onset psychosis is the first few years of the illness after someone experiences it for the first time. 
Psychosis is treatable 
Many people recover from a first episode and never experience another psychotic episode.
Early intervention teams specialise in treating recent‐onset psychosis, and aim to treat psychosis as quickly and intensively as possible. Intensive, early treatment of psychosis may help more people to continue with their treatment and to recover. 
Early intervention treatment usually lasts for two or three years. After early intervention treatment, a person will be cared for by their doctor or by standard community mental health professionals. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out if longer treatment (for up to 5 years) by specialist early intervention teams was more successful at treating recent‐onset psychosis than the usual two or three years of treatment followed by treatment by non‐specialist teams. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the use of longer treatment of recent‐onset psychosis by specialist early intervention teams. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random. This type of study usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
We wanted to find out, at the end of the treatment:
‐ how many people recovered;
‐ how many people stopped their treatment too soon;
‐ how many people were admitted to a psychiatric hospital, and for how long;
‐ people's psychotic symptoms and functioning (how well they cope with daily life); and 
‐ how many people died.
Search date: we included evidence published up to 22 October 2019. 
What we found 
We found three studies conducted in Denmark, Canada and Hong Kong in 780 people (55% men; average age 20 to 25 years). 
The studies compared longer treatment (up to 5 years) with standard treatment (up to 3 years) by an early intervention team followed by treatment as usual (by their doctor or community mental health professionals). 
What are the results of our review? 
We found no difference between standard treatment and longer treatment by an early intervention team in the numbers of people who recovered (assessed by remission of symptoms; 3 studies; 780 people). 
Fewer people may stop their treatment too soon during longer treatment than standard treatment (2 studies; 380 people). 
There may be no difference between standard treatment and longer treatment for how many people are admitted to a psychiatric hospital (1 study; 160 people), or for how long they stay in hospital (1 study; 400 people). 
Longer treatment may reduce psychotic symptoms more than standard treatment (1 study; 156 people); but may not improve people's functioning (2 studies; 560 people). 
We are uncertain about whether longer treatment reduces the number of people who died, compared with standard treatment, because so few deaths were reported in the studies (3 studies; 780 people). 
How reliable are these results? 
Our results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. We are not confident that longer treatment affects how many people stop treatment too soon, how many are admitted to hospital and how long they stay in hospital. 
We are uncertain about the effect of longer treatment on how many people recover, people's psychotic symptoms and functioning, and on the number of people who die. These results will change when more evidence becomes available. 
Key messages 
Longer treatment of recent‐onset psychosis by specialist mental health teams may lead to fewer people stopping their treatment early. However, we need more evidence before we can be certain about whether longer treatment is better overall than the usual two‐ or three‐year treatment.

10.1002-14651858.CD014963,"Background
Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID‐19 because they counter hyper‐inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. So far, systemic corticosteroids are one of the few treatment options for COVID‐19. Nonetheless, size of effect, certainty of the evidence, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated. 
Objectives
To assess whether systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID‐19, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 16 April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID‐19, irrespective of disease severity, participant age, gender or ethnicity.  
We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids. We included the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (plus/minus placebo), dose comparisons, timing comparisons (early versus late), different types of corticosteroids and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances.  
We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome), corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long‐COVID treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all‐cause mortality, ventilator‐free days, new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, quality of life, serious adverse events, adverse events, and hospital‐acquired infections. 
Main results
We included 11 RCTs in 8075 participants, of whom 7041 (87%) originated from high‐income countries. A total of 3072 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 2322). We also identified 42 ongoing studies and 16 studies reported as being completed or terminated in a study registry, but without results yet.  
Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID‐19 
Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo  
We included 10 RCTs (7989 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre‐specified outcomes and thus our analysis included outcome data from nine studies.  
All‐cause mortality (at longest follow‐up available): systemic corticosteroids plus standard care probably reduce all‐cause mortality slightly in people with COVID‐19 compared to standard care alone (median 28 days: risk difference of 30 in 1000 participants fewer than the control group rate of 275 in 1000 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.00; 9 RCTs, 7930 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Ventilator‐free days: corticosteroids may increase ventilator‐free days (MD 2.6 days more than control group rate of 4 days, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.53; 1 RCT, 299 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Ventilator‐free days have inherent limitations as a composite endpoint and should be interpreted with caution.  
New need for invasive ventilation: the evidence is of very low certainty. Because of high risk of bias arising from deaths that occurred before ventilation we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics.  
Quality of life/neurological outcome: no data were available. 
Serious adverse events: we included data on two RCTs (678 participants) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids compared to standard care (plus/minus placebo); for adverse events and hospital‐acquired infections, we included data on five RCTs (660 participants). Because of high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics (very low‐certainty evidence).    
Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids   
We identified one study that compared methylprednisolone with dexamethasone. The evidence for mortality and new need for invasive mechanical ventilation is very low certainty due to the small number of participants (n = 86). No data were available for the other outcomes. 
We did not identify comparisons of different dosages or timing.
Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease 
Currently, there are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease. 
Authors' conclusions
Moderate‐certainty evidence shows that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all‐cause mortality in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID‐19. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that there may also be a reduction in ventilator‐free days. Since we are unable to  adjust for the impact of early death on subsequent endpoints, the findings for ventilation outcomes and harms have limited applicability to inform treatment decisions. Currently, there is no evidence for asymptomatic or mild disease (non‐hospitalised participants).  
There is an urgent need for good‐quality evidence for specific subgroups of disease severity, for which we propose level of respiratory support at randomisation. This applies to the comparison or subgroups of different types and doses of corticosteroids, too. Outcomes apart from mortality should be measured and analysed appropriately taking into account confounding through death if applicable.  
We identified 42 ongoing and 16 completed but not published RCTs in trials registries suggesting possible changes of effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future. Most ongoing studies target people who need respiratory support at baseline. With the living approach of this review, we will continue to update our search and include eligible trials and published data. 
","1. Plain Title
Do steroid drugs help people in the hospital with COVID-19?

2. Rationale
COVID-19 can cause bad lung disease. In some people, the body’s defense goes into high gear. This can cause wide spread swelling in the body. Swelling can harm the lungs and other parts.

Steroid drugs can calm this swelling. Doctors use them for many lung and immune problems. Early studies hinted they may help people with COVID-19 live longer. But we did not know how much they help. We also did not know who they help most, or the best dose.

This study set out to learn if steroid drugs are safe and help people with COVID-19. The team also planned to keep the study up to date as new trials come out. This type of work is a “living review.” It adds new data when it is ready.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. In each trial, people were put into groups by chance. Some got a steroid drug plus usual care. Some got usual care alone, or a look-alike pill. This is the best way to test a drug.

The team searched many sources for trials up to mid April 2021. They found 11 trials with 8075 people. Most people were in the hospital with COVID-19 and had symptoms. The trials took place mainly in high income countries.

Most people who got a steroid took dexamethasone. One small trial compared two steroids: methylprednisolone and dexamethasone. The trials looked at death and other outcomes for about one month. (Most tracked people for about 28 days.)

The trials did not focus on age or sex groups. This review also found no trials in people at home with mild or no symptoms.

4. Results
Main finding on death
Steroid drugs probably help some people in the hospital live longer. In the trials, with usual care alone, about 275 out of 1000 people died. With a steroid plus usual care, about 30 fewer out of 1000 died. We have some trust in this result. The trials were well run and had many people.

Help with breathing
Steroids may help people spend more days off a breathing machine. One small trial found about 3 more days off the machine. A breathing machine is a device that helps you breathe. But this kind of measure is hard to judge. So we are less sure about this result.

Need for a breathing machine
We do not know if steroids lower the chance that a person will need a breathing machine. The data here were weak and hard to read. Some people died before they could need a machine. That makes the results hard to use.

Side effects and new infections
We do not know if steroids cause more harms or more hospital infections. Some trials did not track harms well. Some used terms in different ways. The numbers were small. This makes it hard to draw a clear line. We need better data on harms.

Quality of life
The trials did not report on life quality or brain health. This is a gap. These outcomes matter to patients and families.

Which steroid and what dose?
One small trial compared two steroid drugs. It was too small to say which drug is best. No trials tested high dose versus low dose. No trials tested early use versus late use. We still need those answers.

Who might benefit most?
The trials took place in people in the hospital with symptoms. Most who join future trials will need help with breathing at the start. We do not yet know which group gains the most. We also do not know if people with mild or no symptoms would gain. There are no trials in those groups so far.

What this means for patients
If you are in the hospital with COVID-19, a steroid drug may help. It may lower the chance of death a small amount. It may give you a few more days off a breathing machine. We do not yet know the full picture on harms. Talk with your care team. They can weigh your case and the current guidance.

What this means for the field
This study pulls together the best trials we have to date. It shows a small drop in deaths with steroid use in the hospital. This backs the use of steroid drugs like dexamethasone in this group. But we still lack clear data on side effects, dose, and timing. We also lack data for people not in the hospital.

Next steps
There are many trials in progress. The team found 42 trials still going on. They also found 16 trials done but not yet shared. As new data come in, the team will update this review. Future work should track more than death. It should track harms and life quality as well. It should also test dose, type, and best time to start.

Investigator’s conclusion
Steroid drugs probably help some people in the hospital with COVID-19 live a bit longer. They may add days off a breathing machine. We are less sure about other outcomes and harms. We need more good trials to guide which drug, what dose, and when to use it. We also need trials in people with mild or no symptoms.","Are corticosteroids (anti‐inflammatory medicines) given orally or by injection an effective treatment for people with COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
• Corticosteroids (anti‐inflammatory medicines) given orally or by injection (systemic) are probably effective treatments for people hospitalised with COVID‐19. We don’t know whether they cause unwanted effects.  
• We don’t know which systemic corticosteroid is the most effective. We found no evidence about people without symptoms or with mild COVID‐19 who were not hospitalised.  
• We found 42 ongoing studies and 16 completed studies that have not published their results. We will update this review when we find new evidence.     
What are corticosteroids? 
Corticosteroids are anti‐inflammatory medicines that reduce redness and swelling. They also reduce the activity of the immune system, which defends the body against disease and infection. Corticosteroids are used to treat a variety of conditions, such as asthma, eczema, joint strains and rheumatoid arthritis.  
Systemic corticosteroids can be swallowed or given by injection to treat the whole body. High doses of corticosteroids taken over a long time may cause unwanted effects, such as increased appetite, difficulty sleeping and mood changes.  
Why are corticosteroids possible treatments for COVID‐19?  
COVID‐19 affects the lungs and airways. As the immune system fights the virus, the lungs and airways become inflamed, causing breathing difficulties. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation, so may reduce the need for breathing support with a ventilator (a machine that breathes for a patient). Some patients’ immune systems overreact to the virus causing further inflammation and tissue damage; corticosteroids may help to control this response. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether systemic corticosteroids are an effective treatment for people with COVID‐19 and whether they cause unwanted effects. 
We were interested in:
• deaths from any cause up to 14 days after treatment, or longer if reported;• whether people got better or worse after treatment, based on their need for breathing support;• quality of life;• unwanted effects and infections caught in hospital. 
What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated systemic corticosteroids for people with mild, moderate or severe COVID‐19. People could be any age, sex or ethnicity. 
Studies could compare:
• corticosteroids plus usual care versus usual care with or without placebo (sham medicine);• one corticosteroid versus another;• corticosteroids versus a different medicine;• different doses of a corticosteroid; or• early versus late treatment. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 11 studies with 8075 people. About 3000 people received corticosteroids, mostly dexamethasone (2322 people). Most studies took place in high‐income countries.  
We also found 42 ongoing studies, and 16 completed studies that have not yet published their results.  
Main results 
Ten studies compared corticosteroids plus usual care versus usual care with or without placebo. Only one study compared two corticosteroids. The studies included only hospitalised people with confirmed or suspected COVID‐19. No studies looked at non‐hospitalised people, different doses or timing, or provided information about quality of life. 
Corticosteroids plus usual care compared to usual care with or without placebo (10 studies) 
• Corticosteroids probably reduce the number of deaths from any cause slightly, up to 60 days after treatment (9 studies, 7930 people).• One study (299 people) reported that people on a ventilator at the start of the study were ventilation‐free for more days with corticosteroids than with usual care, so corticosteroids may improve people’s symptoms.• Four studies (427 people) reported whether people not on a ventilator at the start of treatment later needed to be put on a ventilator, but we could not pool the studies’ results, so we are unsure if people’s symptoms get worse with corticosteroids or usual care.• We don’t know if corticosteroids increase or reduce serious unwanted effects (2 studies, 678 people), any unwanted effects (5 studies, 660 people), or infections caught in hospital (5 studies, 660 people). 
Methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone (1 study, 86 people) 
• We don’t know whether the corticosteroid methylprednisolone reduces the number of deaths from any cause compared to dexamethasone in the 28 days after treatment.• We don’t know if methylprednisolone worsens people’s symptoms compared to dexamethasone, based on whether they needed ventilation in the 28 days after treatment.• The study did not provide information about anything else we were interested in. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are moderately confident in the evidence about corticosteroids’ effect on deaths from any cause. However, our confidence in the other evidence is low to very low, because studies did not use the most robust methods, and the way results were recorded and reported differed across studies. We did not find any evidence on quality of life and there was no evidence from low‐income countries or on people with mild COVID‐19 or no symptoms, who were not hospitalised.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
Our evidence is up to date to 16 April 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD004019.pub4,"Osteotomy for treating knee osteoarthritis
Researchers from The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effects of an osteotomy in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Upon searching for all relevant studies until November 2013, they found 21 studies that included up to 1065 people. Their findings are summarised below. 
This review shows that in people with osteoarthritis of the knee:
• osteotomy can improve pain and function, but this is based on changes within a treatment group. No studies compared osteotomy versus conservative treatment; and • no evidence can be found for a preferred osteotomy technique. 
What is osteoarthritis of the knee, and what is an osteotomy?  Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as the knee or the hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen, and this can make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect physical function or ability to use the knee. Two main types of surgery are used to treat patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: knee replacement and osteotomy. 
Osteotomy is surgery in which the bones are cut and realigned. Osteotomy around the knee changes the alignment of the knee. Weight bearing will be shifted from the diseased part to a healthy part of the knee. By 'unloading' the damaged cartilage of the knee, osteotomy may decrease pain, improve function, slow knee deterioration and possibly delay the need for (partial or) total knee replacement surgery. 
What happens to people after an osteotomy for knee osteoarthritis?  Follow‐up of all studies was too short to allow scoring of treatment failure; this refers to a revision to a knee replacement. 
In all studies, people reported less pain and improved knee function and quality of life after any type of high tibial osteotomy. However this comparison is based on differences before and after an osteotomy, not on comparison with non‐operative treatment. Probably no differences in pain and function scores are noted between different osteotomy techniques. 
Rare complications may include thromboembolism and lesions to nerves and vascular structures. 
The most important reasons for reoperation include hardware removal resulting from pain and pin track infection due to the external fixator. This reoperation rate may be higher in patients undergoing another high tibial osteotomy technique compared with those treated with the closing wedge technique. 
Two studies compared high tibial osteotomy versus partial knee replacement. Benefits did not differ between these types of surgery.

Knee bone straightening surgery for knee arthritis: what this review found

Rationale
Knee arthritis is common. The smooth cushion in the joint wears thin. Bone can grow in a bad way. The knee can ache and feel stiff. It can be hard to walk or climb stairs.

A surgery called osteotomy may help some people. In this surgery, the doctor cuts the bone. The doctor changes the knee angle to shift body weight. This takes pressure off the worn side of the knee. It may ease pain and help you move better.

Osteotomy may slow knee harm over time. It may also delay a full knee replace. But we need to know how well it works. We need to know which way to do it is best. This review looked for clear, fair tests.

Trial Design
This was a review of past research. It was done by The Cochrane group. They looked for all good studies up to November 2013. They found 21 studies. Up to 1065 people took part.

All people had knee arthritis. Most studies used a high tibial osteotomy. This is surgery near the top of the shin bone. Some studies set one surgery method against another. Two studies compared osteotomy to a partial knee replace.

A partial knee replace swaps one worn part of the joint. No study compared osteotomy to non surgery care. Time in each study was short. It was not long enough to track later knee replace needs. This makes long term results unclear.

Results
After osteotomy, people had less knee pain. They could use the knee more in daily life. They also felt better in life quality scores. These gains were in the same group over time. We do not know if they beat non surgery care.

No one surgery method stood out as best. Pain and use scores were much the same across methods. The review saw no clear winner. So the choice of method is still open. More head to head tests are needed.

Two studies set osteotomy against partial knee replace. They found no clear edge for either type. Both seemed to help in like ways. So each may be a sound choice for the right person. We cannot say one is better from these tests.

Some harms can occur, but they were rare. Blood clots can form and block blood flow. Nerves or blood tubes can be hurt. A nerve helps you feel and move. A blood tube carries blood.

Some people needed a second surgery. A common reason was to take out metal parts due to pain. Some had a skin and bone tract germ where pins went in. This can happen with an outside frame on the leg. These second surgeries add time to heal.

The need for a second surgery may vary by method. It may be higher with some methods than with one called “closing wedge.” The review did not show which method is best. But it flagged this concern. Doctors and patients should weigh this point.

Follow up time was short in most studies. So we do not know how long the gains last. We do not know how often folks later need a full knee replace. Strong tests against non surgery care are also missing. These gaps limit what we can claim.

What does this mean for care? Osteotomy can help pain and knee use. It may slow knee harm and delay a knee replace. But we lack clear proof that it beats non surgery care. We also lack proof that one method is best.

The authors call for better and longer trials. Future work should test surgery against non surgery care. It should track people for many years. It should report harms and second surgery needs well. This will guide people and doctors in choice of care.","Osteotomy for treating knee osteoarthritis

Mechanical ventilation is a potentially painful and discomforting intervention that is widely used in neonatal intensive care. Newborn infants demonstrate increased sensitivity to pain, which may affect clinical and neurodevelopmental outcomes. The use of drugs that reduce pain might be important in improving survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of opioid analgesics for neonates (term or preterm) receiving mechanical ventilation compared to placebo or no drug, other opioids, or other analgesics or sedatives. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 9), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 29 September 2020); Embase (1980 to 29 September 2020); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 29 September 2020). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing opioids to placebo or no drug, to other opioids, or to other analgesics or sedatives in newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. We excluded cross‐over trials. We included term (≥ 37 weeks' gestational age) and preterm (< 37 weeks' gestational age) newborn infants on mechanical ventilation. We included any duration of drug treatment and any dosage given continuously or as bolus; we excluded studies that gave opioids to ventilated infants for procedures. 
Data collection and analysis
For each of the included trials, we independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, types of opioids) using Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) criteria and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomisation, blinding, completeness of follow‐up). We evaluated treatment effects using a fixed‐effect model with risk ratio (RR) for categorical data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included 23 studies (enrolling 2023 infants) published between 1992 and 2019. Fifteen studies (1632 infants) compared the use of morphine or fentanyl versus placebo or no intervention. Four studies included both term and preterm infants, and one study only term infants; all other studies included only preterm infants, with five studies including only very preterm infants. We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) Scale in the first 12 hours after infusion (MD ‐5.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐6.88 to ‐4.59; 50 participants, 2 studies) and between 12 and 48 hours after infusion (MD ‐0.98, 95% CI ‐1.35 to ‐0.61; 963 participants, 3 studies) because of limitations in study design, high heterogeneity (inconsistency), and imprecision of estimates (very low‐certainty evidence ‐ GRADE). The use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing duration of mechanical ventilation (MD 0.23 days, 95% CI ‐0.38 to 0.83; 1259 participants, 7 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence because of unclear risk of bias in most studies) and neonatal mortality (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.55; 1189 participants, 5 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence because of imprecision of estimates). We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.39 to 10.29; 78 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence because of serious imprecision of the estimates and indirectness). Limited data were available for the other comparisons (i.e. two studies (54 infants) on morphine versus midazolam, three (222 infants) on morphine versus fentanyl, and one each on morphine versus diamorphine (88 infants), morphine versus remifentanil (20 infants), fentanyl versus sufentanil (20 infants), and fentanyl versus remifentanil (24 infants)). For these comparisons, no meta‐analysis was conducted because outcomes were reported by one study. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on pain and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months; the use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and neonatal mortality. Data on the other comparisons planned in this review (opioids versus analgesics; opioids versus other opioids) are extremely limited and do not allow any conclusions. In the absence of firm evidence to support a routine policy, opioids should be used selectively ‐ based on clinical judgement and evaluation of pain indicators ‐ although pain measurement in newborns has limitations.

Do pain drugs like morphine help newborns on breathing machines?

Rationale
Some newborns need a machine to help them breathe. This is called a breathing machine. It can hurt and cause stress. Newborns feel pain more than older kids and adults. Pain may harm growth and brain health.

Doctors use strong pain drugs for this. These are called opioids. Morphine and fentanyl are two common ones. These drugs can ease pain. But they may also cause harms. We need to know if they help more than they harm.

This study asked a key question. Do opioids help newborns on a breathing machine? The team looked at pain, time on the machine, death, and later brain and learning. They also asked if one opioid works better than another.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. In these trials, babies were put in groups by chance. Some got an opioid. Some got no drug or a fake drug. Some got a different pain or sleep drug. Some got a different opioid. The team did not include “cross over” trials.

The team searched many data banks. They used set rules to find and check the trials. They found 23 trials from 1992 to 2019. These trials had 2023 babies in all.

Most babies were born early. Some were born at term. All were on a breathing machine. Most trials looked at morphine or fentanyl. A few compared one opioid to another. A few compared morphine to a sleep drug.

The dose and time on the drug were not the same in all trials. Some trials looked at pain in the first 12 hours. Some looked at pain from 12 to 48 hours. Some looked at time on the breathing machine and death. One small trial looked at brain and learning at 18 to 24 months. So the time a baby was in a trial was not the same for all trials.

Results
Main finding on pain:
We are not sure if opioids lower pain in the first 12 hours. Two small trials looked at this. The proof is weak. The trials were not all alike.

From 12 to 48 hours, we are still not sure. Three trials looked at this. The proof is weak. The trials did not agree.

Note: Pain was scored with a tool for preterm babies. It is called the PIPP pain score. It uses signs like face moves and heart rate. It is not a perfect tool.

Main finding on time on the breathing machine:
Opioids like morphine or fentanyl did not change days on the machine. Seven trials looked at this. On average, days were about the same in both groups. The proof here was fair in strength.

Main finding on death in the newborn period:
Opioids did not seem to change death in the newborn period. Five trials looked at this. Deaths were about the same in both groups. The proof here was fair in strength.

Main finding on brain and learning at 18 to 24 months:
We are not sure if opioids help or harm brain and learning. One small trial looked at this. The proof is too weak to judge.

Other drug match-ups:
Only a few babies were in trials that compared opioids to other drugs. These were small, single trials. They looked at:
- Morphine vs midazolam (a sleep drug)
- Morphine vs fentanyl
- Morphine vs diamorphine
- Morphine vs remifentanil
- Fentanyl vs sufentanil
- Fentanyl vs remifentanil

There were not enough babies to give clear answers. The team could not join the data for these match-ups.

What this means for care:
There is no strong proof that all babies on a breathing machine should get an opioid. Opioids may still help some babies who show clear pain. But we should not use them for all babies as a rule.

Care teams should use their best judgment. They should watch each baby for signs of pain. They should weigh the need to ease pain with the risk of harms. It is also hard to measure pain in newborns. That makes these choices tough.

What this means for research:
We need better trials. Trials should use clear and simple pain signs. Trials should include both term and preterm babies. Trials should look at brain and learning in the long term. We also need to know if one drug works better than others. We need to learn the safe dose and time on the drug.

In short:
- This review looked at 23 trials with 2023 babies.
- We are not sure if opioids lower pain in the first two days.
- Opioids did not change days on the machine or deaths.
- We are not sure about brain and learning at 18 to 24 months.
- There is not enough proof to use opioids for all babies on a breathing machine.
- Use opioids case by case, based on signs of pain.","Opioids for newborns receiving mechanical ventilation
Review question 
Do drugs such as morphine and fentanyl (opioids) save lives, reduce pain, or improve the long‐term development of newborns needing breathing machines (mechanical ventilators)?Background 
Breathing machines are widely used for newborn full‐term (≥ 37 weeks' gestational age) and preterm (< 37 weeks' gestational age) babies with breathing problems. Breathing machines may cause babies pain. Moreover, their use requires the presence and suctioning of a tube placed in the baby's trachea (which connects the larynx to the bronchi of the lungs), thus causing additional pain and distress. Since newborn babies are very sensitive to pain, which may have a bad effect on future development, pain reduction with drugs (including opioids such as morphine and fentanyl) might be very important. Pain in babies is assessed by adults by using different scales, which focus on the baby's appearance and behaviour, and on other parameters. Study characteristicsWe collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found 23 studies enrolling 2023 babies. In most studies, babies were born before the due date (before 37 weeks' gestational age). Eight studies compared the use of morphine versus placebo (a substance with no therapeutic value) or no intervention, and seven versus fentanyl. We analysed the other studies separately because researchers compared the use of these two drugs with other opioids or other analgesics. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on pain and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months; use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and neonatal mortality. Further research is needed. 
Certainty of evidence 
The certainty of evidence is very low to moderate because overall only a small number of studies have looked at this intervention, few babies were included in these studies, and some studies could have been better designed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to 29 September 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013518.pub2,"Background
Asthma affects 350 million people worldwide including 45% to 70% with mild disease. Treatment is mainly with inhalers containing beta₂‐agonists, typically taken as required to relieve bronchospasm, and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as regular preventive therapy. Poor adherence to regular therapy is common and increases the risk of exacerbations, morbidity and mortality. Fixed‐dose combination inhalers containing both a steroid and a fast‐acting beta₂‐agonist (FABA) in the same device simplify inhalers regimens and ensure symptomatic relief is accompanied by preventative therapy. Their use is established in moderate asthma, but they may also have potential utility in mild asthma. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of single combined (fast‐onset beta₂‐agonist plus an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)) inhaler only used as needed in people with mild asthma. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal. We contacted trial authors for further information and requested details regarding the possibility of unpublished trials. The most recent search was conducted on 19 March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cross‐over trials with at least one week washout period. We included studies of a single fixed‐dose FABA/ICS inhaler used as required compared with no treatment, placebo, short‐acting beta agonist (SABA) as required, regular ICS with SABA as required, regular fixed‐dose combination ICS/long‐acting beta agonist (LABA), or regular fixed‐dose combination ICS/FABA with as required ICS/FABA. We planned to include cluster‐randomised trials if the data had been or could be adjusted for clustering. We excluded trials shorter than 12 weeks. We included full texts, abstracts and unpublished data. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (OR) or rate ratios (RR) and continuous data as mean difference (MD). We reported 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures of meta‐analysis. We applied the GRADE approach to summarise results and to assess the overall certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring systemic steroids, hospital admissions/emergency department or urgent care visits for asthma, and measures of asthma control. 
Main results
We included six studies of which five contributed results to the meta‐analyses. All five used budesonide 200 μg and formoterol 6 μg in a dry powder formulation as the combination inhaler. Comparator fast‐acting bronchodilators included terbutaline and formoterol. Two studies included children aged 12+ and adults; two studies were open‐label. A total of 9657 participants were included, with a mean age of 36 to 43 years. 2.3% to 11% were current smokers. 
FABA / ICS as required versus FABA as required 
Compared with as‐required FABA alone, as‐required FABA/ICS reduced exacerbations requiring systemic steroids (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.60, 2 RCTs, 2997 participants, high‐certainty evidence), equivalent to 109 people out of 1000 in the FABA alone group experiencing an exacerbation requiring systemic steroids, compared to 52 (95% CI 40 to 68) out of 1000 in the FABA/ICS as‐required group. FABA/ICS as required may also reduce the odds of an asthma‐related hospital admission or emergency department or urgent care visit (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.60, 2 RCTs, 2997 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Compared with as‐required FABA alone, any changes in asthma control or spirometry, though favouring as‐required FABA/ICS, were small and less than the minimal clinically‐important differences. We did not find evidence of differences in asthma‐associated quality of life or mortality. For other secondary outcomes FABA/ICS as required was associated with reductions in fractional exhaled nitric oxide, probably reduces the odds of an adverse event (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95, 2 RCTs, 3002 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and may reduce total systemic steroid dose (MD ‐9.90, 95% CI ‐19.38 to ‐0.42, 1 RCT, 443 participants, low‐certainty evidence), and with an increase in the daily inhaled steroid dose (MD 77 μg beclomethasone equiv./day, 95% CI 69 to 84, 2 RCTs, 2554 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
FABA/ICS as required versus regular ICS plus FABA as required 
There may be little or no difference in the number of people with asthma exacerbations requiring systemic steroid with FABA/ICS as required compared with regular ICS (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.07, 4 RCTs, 8065 participants, low‐certainty evidence), equivalent to 81 people out of 1000 in the regular ICS plus FABA group experiencing an exacerbation requiring systemic steroids, compared to 65 (95% CI 49 to 86) out of 1000 FABA/ICS as required group. The odds of an asthma‐related hospital admission or emergency department or urgent care visit may be reduced in those taking FABA/ICS as required (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91, 4 RCTs, 8065 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Compared with regular ICS, any changes in asthma control, spirometry, peak flow rates (PFR), or asthma‐associated quality of life, though favouring regular ICS, were small and less than the minimal clinically important differences (MCID). Adverse events, serious adverse events, total systemic corticosteroid dose and mortality were similar between groups, although deaths were rare, so confidence intervals for this analysis were wide. We found moderate‐certainty evidence from four trials involving 7180 participants that FABA/ICS as required was likely associated with less average daily exposure to inhaled corticosteroids than those on regular ICS (MD ‐154.51 μg/day, 95% CI ‐207.94 to ‐101.09). 
Authors' conclusions
We found FABA/ICS as required is clinically effective in adults and adolescents with mild asthma. Their use instead of FABA as required alone reduced exacerbations, hospital admissions or unscheduled healthcare visits and exposure to systemic corticosteroids and probably reduces adverse events. FABA/ICS as required is as effective as regular ICS and reduced asthma‐related hospital admissions or unscheduled healthcare visits, and average exposure to ICS, and is unlikely to be associated with an increase in adverse events. 
Further research is needed to explore use of FABA/ICS as required in children under 12 years of age, use of other FABA/ICS preparations, and long‐term outcomes beyond 52 weeks.

One as-needed combo inhaler for mild asthma

Rationale
Asthma makes it hard to breathe. Airways swell and tighten. This can cause cough, wheeze, and chest tightness. Many people live with this every day.

Most people with asthma use two types of inhalers. One is a quick‑relief inhaler. It opens the airways fast. The other is a preventer steroid inhaler. It calms airway swelling over time.

Many people do not take the daily preventer as told. Life gets busy. Skipping it can lead to bad asthma attacks. These attacks can lead to urgent care, or even death.

A combo inhaler may help. It has two drugs in one device. One drug opens airways fast. The other is a steroid to calm swelling. You use it when you have symptoms. So each use gives quick relief and some preventer medicine.

This idea works in moderate asthma. Doctors wanted to know if it helps mild asthma too. The hope was fewer bad attacks. The hope was also less need for steroid pills.

Trial Design
This study looked at results from several trials. The team searched many medical databases. They asked trial authors for more facts. They checked for missing trials.

They found six good trials. Five trials gave data they could pool. In all, 9657 people took part. All had mild asthma.

People were age 12 and up. The average age was in the late thirties to early forties. A small number smoked. The trials took at least 12 weeks. Some lasted up to one year.

People were put into groups by chance. One group used a combo inhaler only when needed. Most used a combo with budesonide and formoterol. Another group used a quick‑relief inhaler alone when needed. A third group used a daily steroid inhaler plus a quick‑relief inhaler when needed.

The main thing they looked for was bad asthma attacks. These are attacks that need steroid pills or shots. They also looked at hospital or urgent care visits. They looked at day‑to‑day symptom control and side effects.

Results
First, they compared the combo inhaler to a quick‑relief inhaler alone. Fewer people had bad attacks with the combo. Out of 1000 people using quick‑relief alone, about 109 had a bad attack. Out of 1000 using the combo only when needed, about 52 had a bad attack.

Fewer people on the combo needed hospital or urgent care. The chance of side effects was also a bit lower. Day‑to‑day control and lung tests were about the same. The small changes were not likely to be felt in daily life.

People using the combo needed fewer steroid pills overall. This is good, since steroid pills can have more side effects. People using the combo took more steroid by inhaler than quick‑relief alone. This makes sense, since the combo has a steroid in it. But this inhaled steroid acts mainly in the lungs.

Next, they compared the combo inhaler to a daily steroid inhaler plus quick‑relief. The number of bad attacks was close in both groups. Out of 1000 on a daily steroid, about 81 had a bad attack. Out of 1000 on the combo only when needed, about 65 had a bad attack.

People on the combo had fewer hospital or urgent visits. Day‑to‑day control and lung test scores were a little better with a daily steroid. But the difference was very small. Most people would not notice this small change.

Side effects were much the same between these two groups. Deaths were rare in both groups. The combo group used a lower total daily dose of inhaled steroid. This may lower long‑term risks from steroids.

What does this mean for people with mild asthma? Using one combo inhaler only when needed can help. It cut the number of bad attacks. It cut hospital or urgent care visits. It lowered the need for steroid pills.

The combo worked as well as a daily steroid for bad attacks. It also used less steroid over time. Many people may find one inhaler easier to use. It links relief with preventer care with each use.

This review had limits. It looked at teens and adults, not younger children. It mostly studied one combo drug type. We need more data on other combo inhalers. We also need longer follow‑up beyond one year.

In short, for mild asthma, one as‑needed combo inhaler can be a good choice. It keeps things simple. It helps prevent bad attacks. It may also lower total steroid use. Talk with your doctor to see if it fits your needs.","Combination fixed‐dose beta agonist and steroid inhaler as required for adults or children with mild asthma 
Background 
Asthma is the most common respiratory illness. Many people with asthma have mild asthma, but still remain at risk of severe asthma exacerbations, which often result in the use of oral steroids. Mild asthma is commonly treated with preventative inhalers, which contain a steroid used to reduce inflammation in the airways, and with reliever inhalers, which relax the muscles of the airways causing quick relief of asthma symptoms. Combination inhalers contain both the preventative steroid and the reliever, simplifying treatment and ensuring steroids are always given alongside the immediate relief of symptoms. 
Review question 
We examined the findings of clinical trials to assess the use of combination inhalers in the treatment of mild asthma when taken on an as‐needed, symptom‐driven basis. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to March 2021. Results were collected from six studies which compared use of a combination inhaler used on an as‐needed basis with either as‐needed reliever‐only therapy or daily treatment with a low dose preventative inhaler. 
Key findings 
We found that combination inhalers used as‐needed when compared with reliever‐only treatment reduced severe exacerbations requiring tablet steroids and rates of emergency admission to hospital with asthma symptoms. Differences in other measures relating to symptom control and lung function were too small to be clinically important. Rates of severe exacerbations were similar between patients on daily preventative steroid inhalers and those using combination inhalers as‐needed. People using combination inhalers had lower rates of hospital admission and lower total inhaled steroid dose, whilst the differences in lung function and asthma symptom control were not clinically significant. 
This review found the use of combination inhalers used when the patient experiences asthma symptoms was beneficial in reducing severe exacerbations when compared to stand‐alone reliever therapy in mild asthma. In addition to this the use of combination inhalers used on an as‐needed basis was associated with a reduction in hospital admissions and total inhaled steroid dose when compared with regularly‐taken low dose preventative inhaler therapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies which contributed data were well‐designed and robust, although two were open‐label (participants knew which treatment they were getting), with some potential for bias, so the evidence was generally of moderate‐to‐high quality.

People who suffer a heart attack (due to a blockage in the artery supplying blood to the heart) are usually affected by the damage to a portion of their heart muscle. Current treatment options are unable to restore the damaged section of the heart. Recently, stem cells have been shown to be able to restore and replace the damaged tissue in patients with heart attack. These cells could be mobilized to the heart with agents such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF). 
In this review, analysis of seven included studies with low risk of bias using G‐CSF to improve the function of damaged heart of patient with heart attack failed to show any beneficial effects of this treatment. The rate of mortality was not different between the two groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.80, P = 0.55). Also, left ventricular parameters including left ventricular ejection fraction (RR 3.41, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 7.44, P = 0.1), end systolic volume (RR ‐1.35, 95% CI ‐4.68 to 1.99, P = 0.43) and end diastolic volume (RR ‐4.08, 95% CI ‐8.28 to 0.12, P = 0.06) did not show significant changes between the treatment and the control groups. There was no evidence that the study was associated with serious adverse effects, however it should be noted that the study was limited since the trials included lacked long enough follow up durations. Additionally four studies had either high or unclear risk of bias for blinding. Therefore, based on the results of the current study, G‐CSF treatment should not be administered for patients with heart attack.

Do G-CSF drugs help the heart after a heart attack?

Rationale
A heart attack happens when a blood tube to the heart gets blocked. This harms part of the heart muscle. Many people live with weak hearts after this event. This can lead to low energy, breath shortness, and hospital stays.

Doctors want to find ways to fix the harmed heart muscle. Stem cells are special cells that can grow and change into other cells. Some early work raised hope that stem cells might help fix heart muscle. A drug called G-CSF may move these cells into the blood. The idea is that they might then help heal the heart.

This study asked a clear question. Does G-CSF help people after a heart attack? Will it help the heart pump blood better? Will it reduce deaths or harm? The team also checked if the drug is safe.

Trial Design
This was a review of earlier trials. The team looked at seven trials of G-CSF used after a heart attack. Each trial had a group who got G-CSF and a group who did not get it. The goal was to see if G-CSF helped the heart or saved lives.

The people in these trials had a recent heart attack. The trials checked how well the heart pumps blood. They also checked the size of the heart chambers. These are common ways to track heart health. The trials also counted deaths. They looked for serious side effects from the drug.

The team judged the quality of the trials. Many parts of the trials had low risk of error. But in four trials, people or staff may have known who got the drug. This can tilt results. Also, follow-up time was short. The trials did not watch people for a long time. Times varied by trial, but were not long enough to show long-term effects.

Results
The review found no clear benefit from G-CSF. People who got the drug did not live longer. Deaths were about the same in the two groups. The drug did not help the heart pump better. How much blood the heart pushed out with each beat did not improve. The size of the heart chambers did not improve either.

In short, G-CSF did not fix heart muscle harm after a heart attack. The drug did not make a clear change in the main heart tests. These tests track pump strength and heart size. These are key signs of heart health after a heart attack.

The trials did not find serious harm from G-CSF in the short term. That is good news for safety. But the follow-up was short. We do not know the long-term safety. We also do not know if small harms or rare harms might show up later.

Some parts of the trials could have biased results. In four trials, staff or patients may have known who got the drug. Knowing who got the drug can change how people act or report signs. This can push results in one way or another. Still, even with this risk, the results did not show a benefit.

What does this mean for patients and care teams? Based on these seven trials, G-CSF should not be used after a heart attack. It did not help the heart. It did not help people live longer. It did not change heart pump tests in a clear way. The review team says not to give G-CSF for heart attack care.

This review helps guide care. It shows that this drug does not meet the goal to fix heart muscle harm. Care teams should use proven care for heart attacks. This includes fast opening of the blocked blood tube and heart drugs known to help. Patients may ask about stem cell drugs. For now, this drug does not help the heart heal.

More work could be done. Future trials should watch people for a longer time. They should make sure no one knows who gets the drug during the trial. They should use the same heart tests in the same way. But at this time, the best plan is clear. Do not use G-CSF after a heart attack outside a research study.","Granulocyte colony stimulating factor treatment following a heart attack

10.1002-14651858.CD012595.pub4,"School dental screening programmes for improving oral health of children
What was the aim of this review? 
Oral health means the condition of the mouth, throat, teeth and gums. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if school dental screening improves oral health of children; and if it does, which screening method works best. We found eight relevant studies to answer this question. This is the second update of a review that was published in December 2017 and first updated in August 2019. 
Key message 
There is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about whether traditional school dental screening can improve dental attendance (can lead to children visiting the dentist more often). Moreover, it is not clear if improvement in dental attendance leads to better oral health. We still need high‐quality studies that measure the impact of screening on oral health over longer periods of time. 
What did this review study? 
Oral diseases, especially tooth decay (called 'dental caries' by dentists), affect children worldwide. If untreated, oral health can deteriorate and negatively impact children's general well‐being. It also has a financial cost for families and society as a whole. 
School dental screening involves a dental professional examining children's mouths and teeth at school and letting parents know about their child's oral condition and treatment needs. It aims to identify oral health concerns at an early stage and prompt parents to seek treatment where required. Whether this actually improves children's oral health is the question we wanted to answer in this review. 
What were the main results of this review? 
Our updated search identified one new study to be included since the last version of the review was published. In total, the review includes eight studies that presented results for 21,290 children. Four studies took place in the UK, two in India, one in the USA and one in Saudi Arabia. The children were 4 to 15 years old. Studies looked at the oral health and dental attendance of children who were screened in school compared to children who did not have screening. Some studies also compared different ways of screening and different forms of follow‐up (e.g. advice letter or referral). 
We do not know whether traditional school dental screening improves dental attendance. Studies looking at screening based on specific criteria (e.g. targeted at children not registered with a dentist) suggested it may be slightly more effective than no screening for improving attendance at the dentist. There may be no difference between criteria‐based screening and universal screening for improving dental attendance, but we are very unsure about the results. 
A personalised or specific referral letter to parents may improve dental attendance more than a non‐specific letter, but we are very unsure about the results. 
Screening with added motivation (health education and offer of free treatment) may improve dental attendance compared to screening alone, but we are very unsure about the results. 
One study comparing different referral letters (with more or less information about dental diseases) found that neither was better than the other for improving dental treatment in children. 
A specific referral letter did not encourage more parents to take their children to the dentist when compared to a letter with generic advice to visit the dentist. 
The eight studies followed up children for 3 to 11 months after they received screening. Therefore, we do not know the effects of screening over a longer period of time. 
None of the studies checked whether there were any negative effects of screening programmes or how much they cost. 
How up to date is the review? 
We searched for published studies up to 15 October 2021.

Do school tooth checks help keep kids’ mouths healthy?

Rationale
Good mouth health means a healthy mouth, teeth, and gums. Bad mouth health can cause pain, missed school, and stress. Tooth decay is common in kids all over the world. If you do not treat it, it can get worse and cost more.

Many schools use tooth checks. A tooth check is a quick look by a tooth care worker at school. They send a note home to tell you what they saw and if your child may need care. The hope is that this will help find problems early and get kids to a dentist. But we need to know if school tooth checks really help.

This review asked two main things. First, do school tooth checks help kids see a dentist more? Second, do they help kids have better mouth health over time? The team also looked at which type of check or note home might work best.

Trial Design
This was a review of research studies from around the world. The team looked for all good studies on school tooth checks in kids. They searched for studies up to 15 October 2021.

Eight studies met the rules to be in this review. The studies took place in the UK, India, the USA, and Saudi Arabia. In total, they looked at 21,290 children. The kids were 4 to 15 years old. The studies did not state the mix of boys and girls.

In these studies, some kids had a school tooth check. Other kids did not have a check at school. The teams then watched to see who went to a dentist and who got care. Some studies also tried different ways to do the checks. Some aimed the checks at kids not signed up with a dentist. Some checked all kids in a grade. Some sent a basic note home. Some sent a note with the child’s name and needs. One study added a health class and an offer of free care.

Each study watched kids for 3 to 11 months after the check. None of the studies looked at harms from the checks. None looked at how much the checks cost.

Results
What did the review find? The big picture is not clear. We do not know if basic school tooth checks help more kids see a dentist. We also do not know if more visits lead to better mouth health.

Some signs may help point the way. In a few studies, checks aimed at kids not signed up with a dentist may help more than no checks. This means they may get more kids in for a visit. But the size of the help is not clear. We need better data to be sure.

There may be little to no difference between checks for all kids and checks aimed at kids not signed up with a dentist. The results here were not firm. We cannot say which way is best based on these studies.

The note you send home may matter. A note with the child’s name and needs may help more than a basic note. It may get more kids to a dentist. Still, the proof is weak, and we are not sure. One study found that a note with more facts on tooth disease did not help more than a simple note. In that study, both notes led to about the same level of dental care.

Adding a health talk and an offer of free care to the check may help more than the check alone. This may get more kids to see a dentist. But again, the proof is not strong. We need studies with better plans to know for sure.

A key gap is mouth health over time. The studies did not track mouth health for long. They only watched kids for 3 to 11 months. That is not long enough to show if checks cut tooth decay or pain. So we cannot say if school checks improve mouth health in the long run.

No study checked for harms. For example, stress from a note home, or missed class time. No study checked the cost of school checks. We cannot tell if the checks are a good use of money.

What does this mean for you and your child? School tooth checks may help in some cases. Aimed checks and clear notes home may help some families get care. But we do not have strong proof. We do not know if these checks lead to better mouth health. We also do not know which way to run the checks is best.

What should happen next? We need better and longer studies. These studies should track mouth health, not just dentist visits. They should check for harms and cost. They should test which type of check and which type of note works best. With that kind of proof, schools and health teams can choose the best plan.

In short, this review found no clear answer yet. School tooth checks may help some kids see a dentist. It is not clear if they help kids have healthier mouths. We need high‑quality, long‑term studies to guide care and policy.","School dental screening programmes for improving oral health of children

Chordoma is a rare primary bone tumour with a high propensity for local recurrence. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment, but complete resection is often morbid due to tumour location. Similarly, the dose of radiotherapy (RT) that surrounding healthy organs can tolerate is frequently below that required to provide effective tumour control. Therefore, clinicians have investigated different radiation delivery techniques, often in combination with surgery, aimed to improve the therapeutic ratio. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and toxicity of proton and photon adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in people with biopsy‐confirmed chordoma. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2021, Issue 4); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to April 2021); Embase Ovid (1980 to April 2021) and online registers of clinical trials, and abstracts of scientific meetings up until April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included adults with pathologically confirmed primary chordoma, who were irradiated with curative intent, with protons or photons in the form of fractionated RT, SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery), SBRT (stereotactic body radiotherapy), or IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy). We limited analysis to studies that included outcomes of participants treated with both protons and photons. 
Data collection and analysis
The primary outcomes were local control, mortality, recurrence, and treatment‐related toxicity. We followed current standard Cochrane methodological procedures for data extraction, management, and analysis. We used the ROBINS‐I tool to assess risk of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included six observational studies with 187 adult participants. We judged all studies to be at high risk of bias. Four studies were included in meta‐analysis. 
We are uncertain if proton compared to photon therapy worsens or has no effect on local control (hazard ratio (HR) 5.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 43.43; 2 observational studies, 39 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Median survival time ranged between 45.5 months and 66 months. We are uncertain if proton compared to photon therapy reduces or has no effect on mortality (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.57; 4 observational studies, 65 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Median recurrence‐free survival ranged between 3 and 10 years. We are uncertain whether proton compared to photon therapy reduces or has no effect on recurrence (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.17; 4 observational studies, 94 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
One study assessed treatment‐related toxicity and reported that four participants on proton therapy developed radiation‐induced necrosis in the temporal bone, radiation‐induced damage to the brainstem, and chronic mastoiditis; one participant on photon therapy developed hearing loss, worsening of the seventh cranial nerve paresis, and ulcerative keratitis (risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% CI 0.17 to 9.86; 1 observational study, 33 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There is no evidence that protons led to reduced toxicity. 
There is very low‐certainty evidence to show an advantage for proton therapy in comparison to photon therapy with respect to local control, mortality, recurrence, and treatment related toxicity. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a lack of published evidence to confirm a clinical difference in effect with either proton or photon therapy for the treatment of chordoma. As radiation techniques evolve, multi‐institutional data should be collected prospectively and published, to help identify persons that would most benefit from the available radiation treatment techniques.

Proton or photon radiation for chordoma: what do current studies show?

Rationale
Chordoma is a rare bone tumor. It often grows back near where it began. It can be hard to remove with surgery. This is because it can sit close to key nerves and organs.

Radiation can help kill tumor cells. But strong radiation can harm nearby healthy parts. Doctors use different kinds of beams to try to fix this. Two common kinds are proton beams and photon beams.

Some people hope proton beams might help more or harm less. Others think photon beams may work just as well. This study asked a simple question. Do proton beams help adults with chordoma more than photon beams?

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team looked for studies through April 2021. They searched many medical libraries and trial lists. They set clear rules before they began.

They included only adults with a biopsy that proved chordoma. Each person got radiation to try to cure the tumor. People got either proton beams or photon beams. Some also had surgery as part of care.

The studies watched what happened after treatment. They did not assign treatment by chance. The review looked at four main things. These were tumor control near the first site, deaths, tumor return, and side effects from treatment.

Six studies met the rules. All were small and had limits. In total, 187 adults took part across these studies. Four of the studies could be combined for some measures.

People were followed for years in the included reports. The middle time people lived after treatment was about 4 to 5 and a half years. The time without tumor return ranged from 3 to 10 years. Not all studies measured the same things.

Results
This review did not find clear proof that one type of beam worked better. For tumor control near the first site, the results were not clear. The data were too small and mixed. We cannot say if proton beams helped more, less, or the same.

For the risk of death, results were also unsure. Some numbers leaned one way. Other numbers leaned the other way. With the data we have, we cannot tell if one option helps people live longer.

For tumor return, results were again mixed. Some reports seemed to favor one beam. Others did not. The team could not show a clear win for either beam.

Side effects were hard to compare. Only one small study, with 33 people, reported details. In that study, four people who had proton beams had serious problems in the ear or brain area. One person who had photon beams had serious eye, ear, and nerve problems. This one small study does not show that one beam is safer.

The studies had many limits. They were small. They were not set up to assign the treatment by chance. Care teams may have chosen a beam based on each person’s case. That can skew results. Many steps in care also varied across sites.

Because of these limits, the review rated the trust in the results as very low. That means we have little confidence in the numbers. New, better studies may change what we think we know.

What does this mean for patients? The review found no strong proof that proton beams work better than photon beams. It also found no strong proof that proton beams are safer. Both kinds of beams may help some people. Both can have risks.

This review is still useful. It shows where the gaps are. We need larger, well run studies. We need the same measures across sites. We need studies that track people over time in the same way.

The authors call for teams to work together. They urge groups to plan and share data as care tools evolve. With better data, doctors can learn who may get the most help from each beam. That can guide care choices for people with chordoma.

In short, here is the take‑home message. In adults with chordoma, current studies do not show that proton beams work better than photon beams. Current studies also do not show fewer side effects with protons. More high‑quality research is needed to tell the difference.","Proton radiation therapy versus conventional radiation treatment (i.e. photon radiation) for the treatment of chordoma 
What is the issue?Chordoma is a rare tumour that can grow at any location in the spine. Because some of the locations are difficult to reach, some of the tumour may be left behind, even after aggressive surgery. When this happens, radiation to the postoperative area can help reduce the chance of the tumour coming back. Given the closeness to the spinal cord and other important organs, special radiation techniques are required to maximise tumour control, while minimising harm to normal tissues in the body. 
Why is this review important?At the time of this review, there is a lack of evidence to confirm a benefit with proton therapy compared to conventional photon radiation treatment. However, it is important to note that this review found a number of delivery techniques for both proton and photon therapy. As evidence comparing the latest techniques for proton and photon therapy emerges, we will update this review. 
The aim of the review:The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether proton therapy is more effective than photon therapy for improving local control, and reducing mortality, recurrence, and treatment‐related toxicity. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. 
What are the main findings?We included six studies that enrolled 187 adults with chordoma, four of which we included in a meta‐analysis. We are uncertain whether proton radiation therapy compared to conventional photon radiation treatment improves local control, because our confidence in the evidence was very low (2 observational studies, 39 participants). We are uncertain whether proton therapy compared to photon therapy reduces mortality (4 observational studies, 65 participants), recurrence (4 observational studies, 94 participants), or treatment‐related toxicity (1 observational study, 33 participants). 
Quality of the Evidence:We found very low‐certainty evidence for all outcomes due to high risk of bias in all the included observational studies, very small sample sizes, and varying ranges in the duration of participants' follow‐up period between studies. 
Authors' conclusions:From the currently available evidence, we do not know if proton therapy, used for adults with chordoma, is associated with clinically appreciable benefits and acceptable harms. 
The existing research on this question is solely of non‐randomised design, and is underpowered, with substantial imprecision. Any estimates of effect based on the existing insufficient evidence is very uncertain and is likely to change with future research.

10.1002-14651858.CD013845.pub2,"Background
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD; also known as autism) is a developmental disability that begins in childhood and is typically seen in around 1% to 2% of children. It is characterised by social communication difficulties and repetitive and restricted behaviours and routines that can have a negative impact on a child's quality of life, achievement at school, and social interactions with others. It has been hypothesised that memantine, which is traditionally used to treat dementia, may be effective in reducing the core symptoms of autism as well as some co‐occurring symptoms such as hyperactivity and language difficulties. If memantine is being used to treat the core symptoms of autism, it is important to review the evidence of its effectiveness. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of memantine on the core symptoms of autism, including, but not limited to, social communication and stereotypical behaviours. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases and three trials registers up to February 2022. We also checked reference lists of key studies and checked with experts in the field for any additional papers. We searched for retractions of the included studies in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Retraction Watch Database. No retractions or corrections were found. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any dose of memantine compared with placebo in autistic people. We also included RCTs in which only one group received memantine, but both groups received the same additional therapy (e.g. a behaviour intervention). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were core autism symptoms and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were language, intelligence, memory, adaptive behaviour, hyperactivity, and irritability. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included three RCTs (two double‐blind and one single‐blind) with 204 participants that examined the short‐term effect (immediately postintervention) of memantine in autistic people. Two studies took place in the USA and the other in Iran. All three studies focused on children and adolescents, with a mean age of 9.40 (standard deviation (SD) 2.26) years. Most participants were male (range across studies 73% to 87%). The diagnosis of ASD was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition; 4th edition, text revision; or 5th edition). To confirm the diagnosis, one study used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview‐Revised (ADI‐R); one used ADOS, ADI‐R or the Autism Diagnostic Interview Screener; and one used the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale. Dosage of memantine was based on the child's weight and ranged from 3 mg to 15 mg per day.  
Comparisons Two studies examined memantine compared with placebo; in the other study, both groups had a behavioural intervention while only one group was given memantine.  
Risk of biasAll studies were rated at high risk of bias overall, as they were at high or unclear risk of bias across all but four domains in one study, and all but two domains in the other two studies. One study was funded by Forest Laboratories, LLC, (Jersey City, New Jersey), Allergan. The study sponsor was involved in the study design, data collection (via contracted clinical investigator sites), analysis and interpretation of data, and the decision to present these results. The other two studies reported no financial support or sponsorship; though in one of the two, the study medication was an in‐kind contribution from Forest Pharmaceuticals. 
Primary outcomesThere was no clear evidence of a difference between memantine and placebo with respect to severity of core symptoms of autism, although we are very uncertain about the evidence. The standardised mean difference in autism symptoms score in the intervention group versus the control group was –0.74 standard deviations (95% confidence interval (CI) −2.07 to 0.58; 2 studies, 181 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; medium effect size); lower scores indicate less severe autistic symptoms. Two studies (144 participants) recorded adverse effects that the authors deemed related to the study and found there may be no difference between memantine and placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.39; low‐certainty evidence). 
Secondary outcomesThere may be no difference between memantine and placebo on language (2 studies, 144 participants; low‐certainty evidence); memory or adaptive behaviour (1 study, 23 participants; both low‐certainty evidence); or hyperactivity or irritability (1 study, 121 participants; both low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
It is unclear whether memantine is an effective treatment for autistic children. None of the three included trials reported on the effectiveness of memantine in adults. Further studies using rigorous designs, larger samples, longer follow‐up and clinically meaningful outcome measures that are important to autistic people and their families will strengthen our knowledge of the effects of memantine in autism.

Memantine for children with autism: what three trials tell us

Rationale
Autism is a brain and behavior condition. It starts in early life. It can make talk and social play hard. Many kids have set ways and repeat acts. These signs can hurt life at home, school, and with friends.

Memantine is a drug used for memory loss in older adults. Some hope it may help autism signs in kids. They think it may help talk, calm, and focus. It may also help hyperactivity and language. We need solid tests to see if it helps and is safe.

The goal of this study was to check the proof. The team wanted to see if memantine helps core autism signs. They also looked at side effects. They checked other signs like language and behavior. They asked, does this drug help kids with autism?

Trial Design
This study is a review of past trials. The team looked for all fair tests. They searched many data banks to February of 2022. They asked experts and checked lists. They also checked if any papers were pulled back, and none were.

They set rules for which trials to include. Trials had to put people in groups by chance. One group took memantine. One group took a fake pill, with no drug. In one trial, both groups also got a behavior plan.

They found three trials to study. The trials had 204 kids and teens with autism. Two trials took place in the United States. One trial took place in Iran. The average age was nine years.

Most in the trials were boys. Doctors used standard tests to confirm autism. The dose of memantine was based on weight. Doses ranged from three to fifteen milligrams a day. Kids took the drug by mouth.

Two trials kept who got the drug a secret. This helps keep the test fair. In those trials, families and staff did not know who took the drug. One trial did not hide this as well. That can make results less sure.

The trials checked change right after care. So we only know short term effects. We do not know if gains last. We also do not know effects in adult patients. No trial in this review tested adults.

Results
The main goal was core autism signs. These include social and talk skills. They also include repeat acts and set ways. Across the trials, memantine did not show clear help. It did not beat the fake pill in a clear way.

We are not very sure about this result. The trials had some limits in how they were run. That can sway what we see. So the proof is weak. The true effect could be small or none.

Side effects were also a main goal. Two trials checked side effects from the study. Side effects were about the same in both groups. We are still not very sure. There could be a small rise or a small drop.

The team also looked at other signs. These were language and memory. They also looked at daily life skills, hyperactivity, and anger. The trials showed no clear gain with memantine. Again, the proof was weak.

All three trials had design limits. This lowers how sure we can be. One trial had help from the drug maker. The maker helped plan and run the trial. This can sway what the trial finds.

What does this mean for care right now? Based on these trials, we do not know if memantine helps core signs. We also do not know if it helps talk, mood, or behavior. Side effects looked close to a fake pill. But we need stronger proof to be sure.

No trial in this review tested adults with autism. So we cannot say if adults may gain. We also lack long term data in kids. We need more and better trials. These should have more people and last longer.

New trials should use strong and fair test plans. They should hide who gets the drug. They should track change for a long time. They should test signs that matter to kids and families. Then we can know if memantine helps or not.

In short, the current proof is not clear. Memantine may not help core autism signs in kids. It did not show clear gains in talk or behavior. Side effects looked about the same as a fake pill. Better trials are needed to guide care.","Can a dementia medicine (memantine) help people with autism spectrum disorder?
BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (autism) is a condition that begins in childhood. Core symptoms include persistent difficulties with social communication (e.g. difficulties with back‐and‐forth conversations, communication without words, and in developing and maintaining relationships), and repetitive and restricted interests and behaviours (e.g. repetitive mannerisms, restricted interests and behaviours, resistance to change and sensory sensitivities). Around 1% to 2% of children have autism. Autistic people often have other conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, language impairments (e.g. difficulties understanding and using grammar) and intellectual disability. Autism can have negative impacts on quality of life, school achievement and social relationships. Memantine is a medication traditionally used to treat dementia, but some studies suggest that it may decrease core autistic symptoms. If memantine is being used to change the core symptoms of autism, it is important to assess whether it works and is safe. This review combines the research evidence on the use of memantine in autism. 
Review questionDoes memantine change the core symptoms of autism and related behaviours? 
Search dateThe evidence is current to 14 February 2022. 
Study characteristicsWe found three studies with 204 people that had evaluated the effectiveness of memantine in autism. All studies were randomised controlled trials, meaning participants were randomly allocated to receive either the treatment or a dummy pill (placebo). This is the best design for assessing the effectiveness of treatments. All three studies included children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, with an average age of 9.40 years. We found no studies in adults. The children received memantine (for 12 weeks in two studies and for 24 weeks in one study), and their behaviour was assessed before treatment and immediately after treatment. 
Study funding sourcesOne study was sponsored and funded by a laboratory that makes memantine (Forest). The study sponsor helped to design the study, collect information, analyse and interpret the information, and take the decision to publish the results. The authors of the other two smaller studies said they did not receive any funding; though in one of these studies, Forest Pharmaceuticals provided the medicine for free. 
Key resultsIt is unclear if memantine makes any difference to the core symptoms of autism. Additionally, there may be no difference between memantine and placebo in the occurrence of side effects, language ability, memory, adaptive behaviour or the autism‐related behaviours of hyperactivity and irritability. 
Limitations of the evidenceWe are not confident about the evidence for core symptoms of autism because it comes from only three small studies; because the studies included different types of people and delivered the medicine in different ways; and because the studies did not always provide information about everything we were interested in. Additionally, we have little confidence in the evidence on side effects and language because it comes from only two small studies; and we have little confidence in the evidence on intelligence, memory, adaptive behaviour, hyperactivity and irritability, because it comes from only one small study.

10.1002-14651858.CD015061,"Background
Individuals dying of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) may experience distressing symptoms such as breathlessness or delirium. Palliative symptom management can alleviate symptoms and improve the quality of life of patients. Various treatment options such as opioids or breathing techniques have been discussed for use in COVID‐19 patients. However, guidance on symptom management of COVID‐19 patients in palliative care has often been derived from clinical experiences and guidelines for the treatment of patients with other illnesses. An understanding of the effectiveness of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological palliative interventions to manage specific symptoms of COVID‐19 patients is required. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in individuals with COVID‐19. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), medRxiv); Web of Science Core Collection (Science Citation Index Expanded, Emerging Sources); CINAHL; WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease; and COAP Living Evidence on COVID‐19 to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions until 23 March 2021. 
We screened the reference lists of relevant review articles and current treatment guidelines for further literature. 
Selection criteria
We followed standard Cochrane methodology as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 
We included studies evaluating palliative symptom management for individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID‐19 receiving interventions for palliative symptom control, with no restrictions regarding comorbidities, age, gender, or ethnicity. Interventions comprised pharmacological as well as non‐pharmacological treatment (e.g. acupressure, physical therapy, relaxation, or breathing techniques). We searched for the following types of studies: randomized controlled trials (RCT), quasi‐RCTs, controlled clinical trials, controlled before‐after studies, interrupted time series (with comparison group), prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies, (nested) case‐control studies, and cross‐sectional studies. 
We searched for studies comparing pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control with standard care. 
We excluded studies evaluating palliative interventions for symptoms caused by other terminal illnesses. If studies enrolled populations with or exposed to multiple diseases, we would only include these if the authors provided subgroup data for individuals with COVID‐19. We excluded studies investigating interventions for symptom control in a curative setting, for example patients receiving life‐prolonging therapies such as invasive ventilation.  
Data collection and analysis
We used a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for non‐randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) to assess bias in the included studies. We included the following outcomes: symptom relief (primary outcome); quality of life; symptom burden; satisfaction of patients, caregivers, and relatives; serious adverse events; and grade 3 to 4 adverse events. 
We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
As meta‐analysis was not possible, we used tabulation to synthesize the studies and histograms to display the outcomes.  
Main results
Overall, we identified four uncontrolled retrospective cohort studies investigating pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in hospitalized patients and patients in nursing homes. None of the studies included a comparator. We rated the risk of bias high across all studies. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary outcome symptom relief, downgrading mainly for high risk of bias due to confounding and unblinded outcome assessors. 
Pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control 
We identified four uncontrolled retrospective cohort studies (five references) investigating pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control. Two references used the same register to form their cohorts, and study investigators confirmed a partial overlap of participants. We therefore do not know the exact number of participants, but individual reports included 61 to 2105 participants. Participants received multimodal pharmacological interventions: opioids, neuroleptics, anticholinergics, and benzodiazepines for relieving dyspnea (breathlessness), delirium, anxiety, pain, audible upper airway secretions, respiratory secretions, nausea, cough, and unspecified symptoms.  
Primary outcome: symptom relief 
All identified studies reported this outcome. For all symptoms (dyspnea, delirium, anxiety, pain, audible upper airway secretions, respiratory secretions, nausea, cough, and unspecified symptoms), a majority of interventions were rated as completely or partially effective by outcome assessors (treating clinicians or nursing staff). Interventions used in the studies were opioids, neuroleptics, anticholinergics, and benzodiazepines.  
We are very uncertain about the effect of pharmacological interventions on symptom relief (very low‐certainty evidence). The initial rating of the certainty of evidence was low since we only identified uncontrolled NRSIs. Our main reason for downgrading the certainty of evidence was high risk of bias due to confounding and unblinded outcome assessors. We therefore did not find evidence to confidently support or refute whether pharmacological interventions may be effective for palliative symptom relief in COVID‐19 patients. 
Secondary outcomes 
We planned to include the following outcomes: quality of life; symptom burden; satisfaction of patients, caregivers, and relatives; serious adverse events; and grade 3 to 4 adverse events. 
We did not find any data for these outcomes, or any other information on the efficacy and safety of used interventions. 
Non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control 
None of the identified studies used non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control. 
Authors' conclusions
We found very low certainty evidence for the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom relief in COVID‐19 patients. We found no evidence on the safety of pharmacological interventions or efficacy and safety of non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in COVID‐19 patients. The evidence presented here has no specific implications for palliative symptom control in COVID‐19 patients because we cannot draw any conclusions about the effectiveness or safety based on the identified evidence. More evidence is needed to guide clinicians, nursing staff, and caregivers when treating symptoms of COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. Specifically, future studies ought to investigate palliative symptom control in prospectively registered studies, using an active‐controlled setting, assess patient‐reported outcomes, and clearly define interventions. 
The publication of the results of ongoing studies will necessitate an update of this review. The conclusions of an updated review could differ from those of the present review and may allow for a better judgement regarding pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for palliative symptom control in COVID‐19 patients.

Comfort care for people with COVID-19: what we know

Rationale
COVID-19 can cause hard symptoms near the end of life. People may feel short of breath. Some have sudden confusion, called delirium. Others may have pain, cough, or upset stomach.

Palliative care means care to ease symptoms, not to cure. It aims to raise comfort and quality of life. Doctors use drugs and simple care steps to help. Examples are opioids, or strong pain drugs, and calm breathing.

Right now, guides for this care in COVID-19 are not clear. Many tips come from other diseases. We need to know what helps and is safe in COVID-19. This review set out to learn that.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team searched many medical sources. They looked for studies up to March 23, 2021. They used careful, standard methods.

They wanted studies on people with confirmed COVID-19. Any age or gender could be in the studies. People were in hospitals or nursing homes. Patients got care to ease symptoms, not to prolong life. They did not include people on life support machines.

They hoped to find strong trials with a comparison group. They did not find any like that. They found four studies that looked back at records. These had no comparison group.

Each report had 61 to 2105 people. Some reports shared some of the same people. We do not know the exact total number. The studies tracked relief of symptoms during care. Nurses or doctors judged if symptoms got better.

The team also set other goals. They wanted to learn about life quality and symptom load. They wanted to know what patients and families thought. They also looked for bad side effects. The studies did not report these.

Results
The four studies tested drug care only. They did not test breathing, touch, or relax methods. Patients got several kinds of drugs. These aimed to ease breath, pain, worry, secretions, or confusion.

Most drug use seemed to help in the reports. Staff rated many treatments as partly or fully helpful. These notes came from the care team, not the patients. So, we must be careful with what we conclude.

The proof from these studies is very weak. The studies had no control group. People who got care may differ from others in key ways. This can make results look better or worse than they are.

The care team knew what drug they gave. This can affect how they judged symptoms. These limits can add bias to the results. So, we are not sure the drugs truly helped.

The studies did not report safety. We do not know much about harms from these drugs. We also lack reports on quality of life or family views. Non-drug care had no proof at all.

What does this mean for patients and families? Doctors may still use these methods to ease symptoms. They do so based on training and past experience. But strong, clear proof is missing right now.

Better studies are needed. They should plan ahead and compare treatments. They should ask patients about relief and comfort. They should report safety in a clear way.

In short, this review found very weak proof. We cannot say what drug or method works best. We also cannot say what is safest. More good studies will help guide care.","Which treatments are best for symptoms in COVID‐19 patients at the end of life?
The burden of symptoms at the end of life of COVID‐19 patients and helpful treatments 
COVID‐19 patients may show symptoms such as breathlessness or delirium at the end of life. The goal of palliative medicine is to relieve such symptoms with specific treatments. Treatments can be drugs, for example opioids, or non‐drugs, such as breathing techniques or relaxation.  
What was the aim of our review? 
To explore how well different interventions (drugs and non‐drugs) work for the treatment of palliative symptoms in COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. We included patients of all ages and with all comorbidities (additional medical conditions).  
What type of studies did we search for? 
We searched selected medical databases and trial registries until 23 March 2021. We included studies looking at how well different palliative treatments work to relieve COVID‐19‐associated symptoms at the end of life. We wanted to compare studies investigating different medicines or therapies, but we only found studies without a comparison group. Only one study reported the specific drugs used for individual symptoms. 
Key results 
We found four studies that were published in five papers. Individual papers included between 61 and 2105 participants, and two papers partially reported on the same participants. All of the included studies investigated different drug treatments for palliative symptom management in people with COVID‐19. 
Drugs for symptom control at the end of life 
All of the included studies reported on the effectiveness of palliative care for symptom relief. In all studies, clinicians or nursing staff rated symptom relief rather than the patients themselves. Since the quality of the evidence was very low, we do not know the true effect of drug treatments on symptom relief and have very low confidence in the results of the studies. We did not find any data on quality of life; symptom burden; satisfaction of patients, caregivers, and relatives; or safety of the drug treatments. 
Non‐drug therapies for symptom control at the end of life 
We did not find any data on the benefits and harms of non‐drug therapies for symptom control of COVID‐19 patients at the end of life. 
Conclusions 
Based on our findings, we could not draw any conclusions on palliative symptom control of people with COVID‐19. Future studies need to be designed better so that we can determine which treatments work for symptom control in people with COVID‐19.

10.1002-14651858.CD012216.pub2,"18F‐florbetapir PET scan for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment 
Review question: In people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), does using a 18F PET scan with florbetapir predict the progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) and other dementias? 
Background 
Due to global ageing, the number of people with dementia is expected to increase dramatically in the next few decades. Diagnosing dementia at an early stage is desirable, but there is no widespread agreement on the best approach. A range of simple pen and paper tests used by healthcare professionals can assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment. Whether or not using special PET scans that detect amyloid —one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease— improves our ability to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or other forms of dementia remains unclear. Since these tests are expensive, it is important that they provide additional benefits. 
Aim 
We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the 18F‐florbetapir PET scan in identifying those people with MCI who clinically progress to ADD, other types of dementia, or any form of dementia over a period of time. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to May 2017. We found three studies including 453 participants with MCI. Two studies evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD and one study evaluated the progression from MCI to any form of dementia. 
Regarding the two studies that evaluated the progression from MCI to ADD, one study had 401 participants with a follow‐up of 1.6 years and the mean age was 72 years. The other study had 47 participants with a follow‐up of three years, and the mean age was 72 years. 
The other study that looked at any form of dementia included 5 participants over 90 years old. 
Two of the studies were funded by the test manufacturer.
Quality of the evidence 
The main limitation of this review was that our findings were based on only three studies, with insufficient detail on how the people were selected, whether the information from the scan was assessed separately from the final diagnosis. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias due to potential conflicts of interest detected. 
Key findings 
In this review, we found the following results based on the three studies.
At a follow‐up of 1.6 years, using visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 89% of the participants who progressed to ADD but only 58% of the participants who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 15% of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 of 15 people to have a positive result and the other 2 participants to be falsely negative. Also 49 people who will not develop ADD would have a negative result, but 36 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). 
In the study that followed up people for three years and used visual assessment, the scan correctly classified 67% of people who progressed to ADD and 71% who did not progress to ADD. This means that in a group of 100 people with MCI, 19 of whom will develop ADD, we would expect 13 people to have a positive result of the scan and 6 people to have a falsely negative result. In addition, 58 of 81 participants who will not progress to ADD would have a negative result, but 23 people who will not develop ADD would have a positive result (false positives). The small number of participants evaluated at three years lowered our confidence on these estimates of accuracy. 
Regarding progression to any form of dementia, the extremely small number of participants meant that we were unable to provide meaningful estimates of accuracy. 
We conclude that 18F‐florbetapir PET scans cannot be recommended for routine use in clinical practice to predict the progression from MCI to ADD or any form of dementia based on the currently available data. More studies are needed to demonstrate its usefulness. 
","Plain Title
Can a brain scan show who with memory loss will get Alzheimer’s?

Rationale
Many people have mild memory and thinking problems. Doctors call this mild cognitive impairment, or MCI. Some people with MCI later get dementia. One type is Alzheimer’s disease dementia.

A dye called florbetapir can light up amyloid in the brain. Amyloid is a sticky protein seen in Alzheimer’s disease. A PET brain scan can show this dye. The hope is that the scan can tell who with MCI will get dementia.

An early answer could help plan care. It could guide life plans and support. But these scans can cost a lot. We need to know if they add real value.

This review asked a clear question. In people with MCI, can a florbetapir PET scan help predict who will get Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other dementias? No drugs were tested. This was only a test to predict risk.

Trial Design
This was a review of studies. The team looked for all good studies up to May 2017. They found three studies with 453 people with MCI. These people were men and women.

Two studies asked if people with MCI went on to Alzheimer’s disease dementia. One study asked if people with MCI went on to any kind of dementia. Doctors checked people over time to see what happened.

One Alzheimer’s study had 401 people. Their average age was 72 years. Doctors followed them for about one and a half years. The other Alzheimer’s study had 47 people. Their average age was 72 years. Doctors followed them for three years.

The study on any kind of dementia was very small. It had only five people. All were older than 90 years. This was too few to give firm answers.

In these studies, trained staff read the scans by eye. This is called a visual read. The review could not confirm some key details. We do not know how all people were picked. We do not know if scan readers knew later test results.

Two of the three studies got money from the maker of the scan. When a maker pays, results can lean their way. This lowers our trust in the findings.

Results
The review asked, how well did the scan work? The team used simple numbers to show this. They used groups of 100 people with MCI.

First, think about the one and a half year study. In a group of 100 people with MCI, 15 would get Alzheimer’s disease dementia. The scan found 13 of these 15 people. It missed 2 of these 15 people. A “miss” means the scan looked normal, but the person later got dementia.

In the same group, 85 people would not get Alzheimer’s disease dementia. Of these, 49 had a scan that looked normal. But 36 had a scan that looked like Alzheimer’s risk. These 36 are “false alarms.” A “false alarm” means the scan looked risky, but the person did not get dementia.

Next, think about the three year study. In a group of 100 people with MCI, 19 would get Alzheimer’s disease dementia. The scan found 13 of these 19 people. It missed 6 people who later got dementia.

In the same group, 81 people would not get Alzheimer’s disease dementia. Of these, 58 had a scan that looked normal. But 23 had a scan that looked like Alzheimer’s risk. These 23 are false alarms.

The study with three year data was small. So we are less sure about those numbers. The study on any kind of dementia had only five people. That is far too few to give useful numbers.

What do these results mean for patients?
The scan did find some people who went on to Alzheimer’s disease dementia. But it also missed some people who did get dementia. And it gave many false alarms. A false alarm can cause stress, cost, and more tests. A miss can give false peace of mind.

Based on the data we have now, this scan does not work well enough to guide care. It does not give a clear and steady answer on who will get dementia. It may help in select cases, but we cannot say to use it for all people with MCI.

How is this study helpful to the field?
This review pulls together what we knew up to May 2017. It shows that florbetapir PET can spot amyloid. But spotting amyloid does not always tell what will happen next. Many people with amyloid do not get dementia in the short term. Many without amyloid still have memory loss.

The review also flags design issues. We lack clear details on how people were picked and tested. Two studies got money from the test maker. That can sway results. These gaps lower our trust.

Conclusion from the investigators
Right now, florbetapir PET should not be used in routine care to predict if a person with MCI will get Alzheimer’s disease dementia. It should not be used to predict any kind of dementia either. We need more and better studies. These studies should be large, clear in their methods, and run by independent teams.

For now, talk with your care team about your memory and your goals. Simple office tests and follow‑up over time may still guide care. New research may change this in the future.","18F‐florbetapir PET scan for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment

10.1002-14651858.CD006919.pub4,"Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) used as an adjuvant to gonadotrophins in assisted reproduction treatments 
Review question 
Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the most effective way of using gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) as part of controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing assisted reproduction technology (ART). 
Background 
GnRHa are given along with hormone injections that stimulate the ovaries, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous release of eggs prior to their planned surgical retrieval. GnRHa have been proven to improve pregnancy rates; however, various regimens are described in the literature. We conducted this review to identify the most effective regimens. 
Study characteristics 
We found 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 3872 women comparing the use of GnRHa in various protocols. Twenty of these RCTs (1643 women) compared a long protocol with a short protocol. The evidence is current to April 2015. 
Key results 
In comparisons of long GnRHa protocols (where GnRHa is given for at least 14 days prior to the start of ovarian stimulation) versus short GnRHa protocols (when the GnRHa is given at the start of stimulation) there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates. However there was moderate quality evidence of higher clinical pregnancy rates in the long protocol groups. Our findings suggest that in a population in which 14% of women achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a short protocol, between 13% and 23% will achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a long protocol. 
None of the other analyses showed any evidence of a difference in birth or pregnancy outcomes between the protocols compared. There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding adverse effects. Further research is needed to determine which long protocol is most cost effective and acceptable to women. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or ongoing pregnancy, poor reporting of methods in the primary studies, and imprecise findings due to lack of data. Only 10 of the 37 included studies were conducted within the last 10 years. 
","Plain Title
Which drug plan works best to stop early egg release in fertility care?

Rationale
Some people need help to have a baby. One way is to use drugs to make many eggs grow. Doctors then take the eggs out in a short surgery. If an egg comes out too soon, the cycle can fail. This can cause stress, delay, and high cost.

A drug called a GnRH agonist, or GnRHa, may help. It acts on the brain signal that tells the ovary to release an egg. The drug turns that signal off for a while. Doctors give GnRHa along with hormone shots that make eggs grow. Past work found this drug can raise the chance of pregnancy.

But there are many ways to give this drug. Some plans start the drug well before the egg shots. Other plans start the drug on the same day as the egg shots. It was not clear which plan works best. This study set out to test that.

Trial Design
A research team reviewed past fair tests called random trials. In a random trial, chance picks who gets which plan. The team found 37 trials with 3,872 women. All women had care to help them have a baby. All used drugs to help the ovaries grow eggs.

The trials tested many ways to give GnRHa. In 20 trials, with 1,643 women, two main plans were compared. In the long plan, women took the drug for at least 14 days. They began it before they took the egg growth shots. In the short plan, women began the drug when they started the egg shots.

The trials took place over many years. Only 10 of the 37 trials were from the last 10 years. The team looked at studies up to April 2015. The reports did not give ages in a way we can share here. All the people in the trials were women who had assisted reproduction care.

The study looked at live birth and lasting pregnancy. A lasting pregnancy means it kept going past the early weeks. The study also looked at pregnancy seen on a scan. Time in each trial was not clear in the reports. So we cannot say how long each person stayed in a trial.

Results
The main goal was live birth or a lasting pregnancy. The team found no clear gap between the long and short plans. The long plan did not prove better for live birth. The short plan did not prove better either. So, for the main goal, both plans looked much the same.

The team also looked at a near-term sign of success. That sign was a pregnancy seen on an early scan. Here, the long plan did better than the short plan. The proof for this was of fair strength. But this does not prove more live births.

The team offered a way to see the size of the effect. With the short plan, about 14 in 100 women had a live birth. Or they had a lasting pregnancy. With the long plan, about 13 to 23 in 100 did so. This wide range shows we still have doubt.

The team also checked other ways to give the drug. None of those checks showed a clear gap in births or pregnancy. So, beyond the main two plans, no plan stood out. The reports did not give enough good data on side effects. We cannot say which plan is safer based on this review.

The proof we have is not strong. Many trials did not report live birth. Some trials did not explain their methods well. Some had small groups of women, which weakens the math. Few trials were new, which also limits trust.

What does this mean for you? The long plan may raise the chance of a scan that shows an early pregnancy. But we do not know if it raises the chance to take home a baby. Some plans may cost more or feel harder to use. We do not yet know which long plan women like best. More new trials are needed to answer these points.

How is this review useful now? It shows both main plans can work. It shows the long plan may help early signs of pregnancy. But it also shows we still need better proof for live birth. If you plan a cycle, ask your care team about these plans. Ask how each plan may fit your own case and goals.","Gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) used as an adjuvant to gonadotrophins in assisted reproduction treatments 
Review question 
Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the most effective way of using gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) as part of controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing assisted reproduction technology (ART). 
Background 
GnRHa are given along with hormone injections that stimulate the ovaries, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous release of eggs prior to their planned surgical retrieval. GnRHa have been proven to improve pregnancy rates; however, various regimens are described in the literature. We conducted this review to identify the most effective regimens. 
Study characteristics 
We found 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 3872 women comparing the use of GnRHa in various protocols. Twenty of these RCTs (1643 women) compared a long protocol with a short protocol. The evidence is current to April 2015.

10.1002-14651858.CD012665.pub2,"Bilateral (two) versus unilateral (one) hearing aid(s) for bilateral hearing impairment in adults 
Review question 
Should adult patients with bilateral (two‐sided) hearing loss be fitted with one or two hearing aids? 
Background 
Hearing loss can be present from birth or can come on in later life. The latter is called 'acquired' hearing loss and is common. Its incidence increases markedly with age. In most people, 'age‐related' hearing loss is due to the loss of cells in the inner ear (so called 'sensorineural hearing loss') and affects both ears to the same degree. Hearing loss categorised as mild, moderate or severe is primarily managed with hearing aids. People with bilateral hearing loss may be offered one aid, fitted to one specific ear, or two aids fitted to both ears. There is uncertainty about the relative benefits to patients of these different strategies. 
Study characteristics 
We included four studies with a total of 209 patients, ranging in age from 23 to 85 and with more men than women. All the studies allowed the use of hearing aids for a total period of at least eight weeks before questions were asked about their preference for one or two aids. In all the studies the patients had bilateral hearing loss but there was considerable variation in what type of hearing loss they suffered from and how bad their hearing was. 
Three of the studies were published before the mid‐1990s and the fourth study was published in 2011. Therefore, only the most recent study used 'modern' hearing aids similar to those that are widely available in high‐income countries. Of the four studies, two were conducted in the UK in National Health Service (NHS – public sector) patients. One of these looked at patients from primary care whose hearing loss had been picked up by a screening programme. The other looked at patients whose primary care practitioner thought they might benefit from hearing aids so had referred them to the local ENT department to get them. The other two studies were conducted in the United States: one study recruited only people on active military duty, or who had served in the military and had hearing loss due to being exposed to loud noises. About half of the people in the other study were ex‐military. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Only one of the outcomes we thought was most important ‐ patient preference ‐ was reported in all studies. The percentage of patients who preferred two hearing aids to one varied between studies: this was 54% (51 out of 94), 39% (22 out of 56), 55% (16 out of 29) and 77% (23 out of 30), respectively. We did not combine the numbers from these four studies because it would not have been right to do so. We graded the quality of evidence for this outcome as very low on a scale that goes high – medium – low – very low. There was no information in the four studies on the other outcomes we were interested in. 
Conclusions 
This review identified only four studies comparing the use of one hearing aid with two. The studies were small and included people of widely varying ages. There was also considerable variation in the types of their deafness and in how deaf they were. 
For the most part, the types of hearing aid evaluated would now be regarded, in high‐income countries, as 'old technology', with only one study looking at 'modern' digital aids. However, we do not know if this is relevant or not. This review did not look at the differences between other 'old' and 'new' types of hearing aid. 
We could not combine the numbers from the four studies. Overall, this fact and the very low quality of the evidence leads us to conclude that we do not know if patients have a preference for one aid or two. Similarly, we do not know if a patient's quality of life is better with one or two aids. 
","1. Plain Title
One hearing aid or two for adults with hearing loss in both ears?

2. Rationale
Many adults lose hearing as they age. Often, both ears lose hearing. This can make it hard to talk, work, or enjoy life. Hearing aids can help.

People with loss in both ears may get one aid or two. Two aids may seem better. But two aids can cost more and take more care. We need to know what helps people most.

This study asked a clear question. Should adults with hearing loss in both ears use one aid or two? The hope was to learn which choice people like more. The study also looked for signs of better day to day life.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of four small studies. The studies took place in the UK and the US. Together they had 209 adults. Ages ranged from 23 to 85. There were more men than women.

All people had hearing loss in both ears. The types and levels of loss were not all the same. Some had loss from loud noise. Some had other causes. The groups were mixed.

Each study let people try the hearing aids. People used the aids for at least eight weeks. Then they shared if they liked one aid or two aids more. The time in each study was at least two months. The exact time could be longer.

Two studies were in the UK National Health Service. One group came from a hearing screen in the community. One group was sent by their family doctor to a hospital ear clinic. Two studies were in the United States. One US study only had people on active duty or veterans. Their loss was due to loud noise. In the other US study, about half were veterans.

Three studies were old. They were from before the mid‑1990s. Those used older style aids. One study was from 2011. That one used newer digital aids. These are like the aids sold now in rich countries.

The review planned to look at many outcomes. The main one was what people prefer. The review also hoped to see if life was better with one or two aids. But only preference was reported in all four studies.

4. Results
All four studies reported what people liked best. The number who liked two aids more was not the same across studies. In one study, 51 of 94 liked two aids. In another, 22 of 56 liked two aids. In a third, 16 of 29 liked two aids. In the last, 23 of 30 liked two aids.

These groups were small and very mixed. The review did not add the results together. The authors felt the groups were too different. So, a single total number would not be fair.

The review judged the proof on preference as very low. In plain words, that means we cannot be sure. If we tested again, the answer may change. The studies had limits. They used different people, settings, and aids. Most used older aid tech. Only one used newer digital aids. We do not know if that matters for results.

None of the four studies shared other key results. They did not report on day to day life. They did not show if one or two aids helped people hear speech better in real life. They did not show if stress, mood, or work got better. The review could not answer those parts.

What does this mean for patients? We still do not know if one or two aids help more. We also do not know which choice makes life better. Some people liked two aids. In some groups, many did. In other groups, fewer did. Your own ears and life may shape what works for you.

Why is this study still useful? It shows a gap. We need new, good trials with modern aids. These trials should include people of many ages and causes of loss. They should track what matters to patients. This includes hearing in noise, comfort, and daily life.

The authors’ main view is simple. With the proof we have, we cannot say which choice is best. We need better, larger, and more up to date studies. Until then, care should fit the person. Talk with your audiologist. Try the options if you can. Share what you like and what you do not. This can guide the choice for you.","Bilateral (two) versus unilateral (one) hearing aid(s) for bilateral hearing impairment in adults

10.1002-14651858.CD013212.pub2,"Background
Hypertension is a major public health challenge affecting more than one billion people worldwide; it disproportionately affects populations in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), where health systems are generally weak. The increasing prevalence of hypertension is associated with population growth, ageing, genetic factors, and behavioural risk factors, such as excessive salt and fat consumption, physical inactivity, being overweight and obese, harmful alcohol consumption, and poor management of stress. Over the long term, hypertension leads to risk for cardiovascular events, such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, disability, and premature mortality. 
Cardiovascular events can be preventable when high‐risk populations are targeted, for example, through population‐wide screening strategies. When available resources are limited, taking a total risk approach whereby several risk factors of hypertension are taken into consideration (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle factors, diabetes, blood cholesterol) can enable more accurate targeting of high‐risk groups. Targeting of high‐risk groups can help reduce costs in that resources are not spent on the entire population. 
Early detection in the form of screening for hypertension (and associated risk factors) can help identify high‐risk groups, which can result in timely treatment and management of risk factors. Ultimately, early detection can help reduce morbidity and mortality linked to it and can help contain health‐related costs, for example, those associated with hospitalisation due to severe illness and poorly managed risk factors and comorbidities. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of different screening strategies for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. 
Search methods
An Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS‐Web), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) Bireme, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) without language, publication year, or publication status restrictions. The searches were conducted from inception until 9 April 2020. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐RCTs (NRCTs), that is, controlled before and after (CBA), interrupted time series (ITS), and prospective analytic cohort studies of healthy adolescents, adults, and elderly people participating in mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening of hypertension. 
Data collection and analysis
Screening of all retrieved studies was done in Covidence. A team of reviewers, in pairs, independently assessed titles and abstracts of identified studies and acquired full texts for studies that were potentially eligible. Studies were deemed to be eligible for full‐text screening if two review authors agreed, or if consensus was reached through discussion with a third review author. It was planned that at least two review authors would independently extract data from included studies, assess risk of bias using pre‐specified Cochrane criteria, and conduct a meta‐analysis of sufficiently similar studies or present a narrative synthesis of the results. 
Main results
We screened 9335 titles and abstracts. We identified 54 potentially eligible studies for full‐text screening. However, no studies met the eligibility criteria. 
Authors' conclusions
There is an implicit assumption that early detection of hypertension through screening can reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality, but this assumption has not been tested in rigorous research studies. High‐quality evidence from RCTs or programmatic evidence from NRCTs on the effectiveness and costs or harms of different screening strategies for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce hypertension‐related morbidity and mortality is lacking. 
","Plain Title
Does checking people for high blood pressure help them live longer?

Rationale
High blood pressure is common. More than one billion people have it. It often has no signs. But over time it can harm the heart, brain, and kidneys. It can lead to stroke, heart attack, and early death.

Many things can raise blood pressure. These include salt, fat, and little movement. Being over‐weight and stress can add to it. Some people also have higher risk due to age or family history.

Doctors can find high blood pressure with a simple test. We call this “screening.” Screening means we check people even if they feel fine. The hope is to find risk early and treat it in time.

There are a few ways to screen. Mass screening is when we test many people at once. Targeted screening is when we test people with higher risk. Opportunistic screening happens during a clinic visit for any reason. People think these ways could lower illness and death.

But belief is not the same as proof. This study asked a clear question. Do these screening plans lower illness and death from high blood pressure? The team also wanted to know about costs and harms. Note: This study did not test a drug. It only looked at ways to find high blood pressure early.

We need this study because health systems have limits. Many low and middle income places have fewer resources. If we can find the best way to screen, we can use funds well. We can focus help on people most at risk.

Trial Design
This was a review. A review is a study of many studies. The team did not run a new trial. They looked for past trials that tested screening plans. They planned to compare results across those trials.

They searched many research lists from the start of each list to April 9, 2020. They did not limit by language or year. They looked in large medical databases and trial lists. Two people checked each study to be fair.

They wanted studies that put people into groups by chance. These are called randomized trials. They also allowed strong non‐randomized studies that compared groups. The people in these studies would be teens, adults, or older adults. They would be well at the start. They would get mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening. The team planned to measure illness and death linked to high blood pressure.

The review did not include a drug or device. It was about how, where, and whom to screen. It did not set a fixed time for people to be in a study. That time would depend on each trial. But in the end, no study met the rules. So time in a study is unknown here.

Results
The team screened 9,335 titles and summaries. They pulled 54 full papers for a closer look. None fit the plan for this review. So they could not combine results. They could not test if screening plans lower illness or death.

What does this mean for patients? Many of us think early checks must help. Early checks can find high blood pressure before harm occurs. That sounds good. But we still need strong proof that screening, as a plan for a whole group, saves lives or cuts illness.

This review found no trial that gave that proof. We also do not know the harms or costs of these plans. Harms can include worry, extra visits, or false alarms. Costs can be high if we screen many people who are not at risk. We do not know which plan gives the best value for money.

The authors call for new, high‐quality trials. These trials should put people into groups by chance. They should test mass, targeted, and opportunistic screening. They should track heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, and deaths. They should also track costs and any harms. Good studies can guide leaders and clinics, in rich and poor places.

What can you do now? This review does not change your care. It did not study blood pressure treatment. It only looked for proof on wide screening plans. If you have a doctor visit, you can ask to check your blood pressure. If you have risk, ask how often to check. If you take blood pressure pills, keep taking them as told. Talk with your care team about your own risks and goals.

In short, high blood pressure is a big problem. Screening might help find it early. But we do not yet have strong proof that broad screening plans reduce illness or death. We need fair, large, and clear trials to know for sure. Until then, personal care choices should be made with your doctor.","Screening strategies for hypertension
Review question 
What effects do the different ways of screening for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) have in decreasing illness and death? 
Background 
Hypertension is a long‐term non‐communicable disease (NCD), also known as high, raised, or elevated blood pressure. Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements (systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) pressures), which are the maximum and minimum pressures. High blood pressure is generally diagnosed when resting blood pressure is persistently at SBP ≥ 130/140 millimetres mercury (mmHg) or at DBP ≥ 80/90 mmHg for adults. 
Even though blood pressure in the arteries is continuously raised, in many cases, high blood pressure does not cause symptoms. Nonetheless, hypertension can increase the risk for heart failure, stroke, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease, and so on, in the long term. People who have unhealthy diets, consume harmful amounts of alcohol and/or tobacco, and are physically inactive are at higher risk of hypertension. 
Early detection, adequate treatment, and good control of high blood pressure can lower the risk of complications associated with hypertension. Although early detection through screening of hypertension has the potential to contain health‐related costs, reducing the burden of hypertension will to some extent involve addressing behavioural and socioeconomic risk factors (such as income, occupation, and level of education). Therefore, it is unclear whether early detection of mild hypertension can positively impact health‐related costs in the long term and improve health outcomes by reducing the need for hospitalisation and management of hypertension‐related complications, which can be severe. 
Review methods 
We searched various electronic databases on this topic until 9 April 2020. We searched for studies written in any language, whether published or not. We planned to include studies that compared one type of screening strategy for hypertension versus no screening strategy, that is, mass screening versus no screening, targeted screening versus no screening, and opportunistic screening versus no screening. We were interested in studies in which participants were healthy adolescents, adults, and elderly people, and in which researchers measured clinical outcomes, health system outcomes, and adverse events. 
Key results 
We found no studies that met the criteria described above.
Quality of the evidence 
High‐certainty evidence that can tell us whether mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening strategies are effective for reducing illness and death associated with hypertension is lacking.

10.1002-14651858.CD013444.pub2,"Background
Spasticity and chronic neuropathic pain are common and serious symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). These symptoms increase with disease progression and lead to worsening disability, impaired activities of daily living and quality of life. Anti‐spasticity medications and analgesics are of limited benefit or poorly tolerated. Cannabinoids may reduce spasticity and pain in people with MS. Demand for symptomatic treatment with cannabinoids is high. A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and harms of these drugs is required. 
Objectives
To assess benefit and harms of cannabinoids, including synthetic, or herbal and plant‐derived cannabinoids, for reducing symptoms for adults with MS. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases from inception to December 2021: MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library), CINAHL (EBSCO host), LILACS, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the US National Institutes of Health clinical trial register, the European Union Clinical Trials Register, the International Association for Cannabinoid Medicines databank. We hand searched citation lists of included studies and relevant reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised parallel or cross‐over trials (RCTs) evaluating any cannabinoid (including herbal Cannabis, Cannabis flowers, plant‐based cannabinoids, or synthetic cannabinoids) irrespective of dose, route, frequency, or duration of use for adults with MS. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane Risk of bias 2 tool for parallel RCTs and crossover trials. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: reduction of 30% in the spasticity Numeric Rating Scale, pain relief of 50% or greater in the Numeric Rating Scale‐Pain Intensity, much or very much improvement in the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Health‐Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs) (tolerability), serious adverse events (SAEs), nervous system disorders, psychiatric disorders, physical dependence. 
Main results
We included 25 RCTs with 3763 participants of whom 2290 received cannabinoids. Age ranged from 18 to 60 years, and between 50% and 88% participants across the studies were female.  The included studies were 3 to 48 weeks long and compared nabiximols, an oromucosal spray with a plant derived equal (1:1) combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) (13 studies), synthetic cannabinoids mimicking THC (7 studies), an oral THC extract of Cannabis sativa (2 studies), inhaled herbal Cannabis (1 study) against placebo. One study compared dronabinol, THC extract of Cannabis sativa and placebo, one compared inhaled herbal Cannabis, dronabinol and placebo. We identified eight ongoing studies. 
Critical outcomes 
• Spasticity: nabiximols probably increases the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of spasticity compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 2.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 4.04; 5 RCTs, 1143 participants; I2 = 67%; moderate‐certainty evidence). The absolute effect was 216 more people (95% CI 99 more to 332 more) per 1000 reporting benefit with cannabinoids than with placebo. 
• Chronic neuropathic pain: we found only one small trial that measured the number of participants reporting substantial pain relief with a synthetic cannabinoid compared with placebo (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 16.17; 1 study, 48 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether cannabinoids reduce chronic neuropathic pain intensity. 
• Treatment discontinuation due to AEs: cannabinoids may increase slightly the number of participants who discontinue treatment compared with placebo (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.84; 21 studies, 3110 participants; I² = 17%; low‐certainty evidence); the absolute effect is 39 more people (95% CI 15 more to 76 more) per 1000 people. 
Important outcomes 
• PGIC: cannabinoids probably increase the number of people who report 'very much' or 'much' improvement in health status compared with placebo (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.36; 8 studies, 1215 participants; I² = 0%; moderate‐certainty evidence). The absolute effect is 113 more people (95% CI 57 more to 175 more) per 1000 people reporting improvement. 
• HRQoL: cannabinoids may have little to no effect on HRQoL (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.02; 8 studies, 1942 participants; I2 = 0%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• SAEs: cannabinoids may result in little to no difference in the number of participants who have SAEs compared with placebo (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.99; 20 studies, 3124 participants; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• AEs of the nervous system: cannabinoids may increase nervous system disorders compared with placebo (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.44; 7 studies, 1154 participants; I² = 63%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• Psychiatric disorders: cannabinoids may increase psychiatric disorders compared with placebo (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.88; 6 studies, 1122 participants; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence); 
• Drug tolerance: the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of cannabinoids on drug tolerance (OR 3.07, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.95; 2 studies, 458 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Compared with placebo, nabiximols probably reduces the severity of spasticity in the short‐term in people with MS. We are uncertain about the effect on chronic neurological pain and health‐related quality of life. Cannabinoids may increase slightly treatment discontinuation due to AEs, nervous system and psychiatric disorders compared with placebo. We are uncertain about the effect on drug tolerance. The overall certainty of evidence is limited by short‐term duration of the included studies. 
","1. Plain Title
Can cannabis-based drugs help ease muscle spasms and nerve pain in MS?

2. Rationale
Multiple sclerosis, or MS, harms the brain and spinal cord. It can cause tight, stiff muscles, called spasticity. It can also cause nerve pain that burns or shoots. These problems can get worse as MS gets worse.

They can make daily tasks hard. They can hurt mood and sleep. Many current drugs do not help enough. Some cause side effects that are hard to take.

Cannabinoids are drugs from the cannabis plant or made in a lab. They may lower muscle tightness and pain. Many people with MS want to try them. This review asked if they help and if they harm.

The team also asked which type helps most. One type is a mouth spray with THC and CBD. THC and CBD are parts of cannabis plants. The spray gives them in equal parts.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of many past studies. The team looked for fair tests. In these tests, people got a study drug or a fake one, by chance. A fake treatment is also called a placebo.

Doctors then measured change in symptoms. They checked muscle tightness and pain. They asked people how they felt overall. They also tracked side effects, serious harm, and stopping the drug.

The team found 25 studies with 3763 adults with MS. People were 18 to 60 years old. About half to most were women. Studies lasted from 3 to 48 weeks.

Thirteen studies used a mouth spray called nabiximols. It has equal parts THC and CBD from the plant. Seven used lab-made drugs like THC. Two used THC pills. One used inhaled cannabis.

The studies compared these drugs with a fake treatment. The main goals were clear and simple. Did muscle tightness drop by a meaningful amount? Did pain drop by a large amount? Did people feel “much” better? Did day-to-day life improve? Did people stop due to side effects? Did serious health problems occur?

4. Results
Spasticity, or muscle tightness, was the main focus. Nabiximols probably eased muscle tightness for more people. In 1000 people, about 216 more felt clear relief than with a fake spray. These results were short term. We do not know if the effect lasts longer.

For nerve pain, the proof is weak. Only one small study looked at strong pain relief. We cannot say if these drugs lower long-term nerve pain. More and larger tests are needed.

More people felt “much” better with cannabinoids. In 1000 people, about 113 more felt “much” better. This is compared with a fake treatment. But day-to-day life scores did not change much.

Quality of life did not change by a clear amount. This means work, self-care, and social life did not improve much. The drugs may help how people feel. But they may not change daily function in a clear way.

Side effects led some people to stop the drug. In 1000 people, about 39 more stopped than with a fake drug. Serious health problems were about the same as with a fake drug. But brain and nerve side effects were more common with cannabinoids.

Mood or thought problems were also more common. Signs of physical dependence were not clear. Most studies were short. We need longer tests to judge safety and benefit.

What does this mean for people with MS? A mouth spray with THC and CBD may ease spasms for some. We are not sure it helps nerve pain. It may not change overall life quality.

Side effects can be a problem for some people. These include brain and nerve issues, and mood or thought issues. A few people may need to stop the drug. Serious harm was not higher in these short studies.

There is hope, but limits remain. The proof for spasticity relief is fairly strong in the short term. The proof for pain relief and life quality is unclear. Many studies were short, and some were small.

Talk with your care team about risks and gains. Ask which product was tested and how it was used. A spray with THC and CBD has the most data. Other forms have less proof.

In short, the spray may help ease muscle tightness. It may help some people feel much better overall. But it can cause side effects, and many people may not feel a big change in daily life. We need longer and larger studies to guide safe use.","Cannabis and cannabinoids for people with multiple sclerosis
Key messages• Treatment with nabiximols likely results in improvement of spasticity and may not increase serious harmful effects compared with placebo 
• Compared with placebo, cannabinoids (nabiximols, Cannabis extract, synthetic cannabinoids) likely improve well‐being when measured with patient‐reported outcomes  
• Due to a lack of robust evidence, the benefit of these medicines for treating chronic neuropathic pain is unclear. 
What is the issue? 
Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience spasticity that causes also pain and impacts on the ability to carry out daily activities. Spasticity is a form of increased muscle tone. Cannabis‐based medicines refer to the use of Cannabis, or its ingredients called cannabinoids, as medical therapies to alleviate spasticity, chronic pain and other symptoms in MS. An international survey found that MS was one of the five medical conditions for which Cannabis was most often used. Another survey conducted in the UK found that more than one in five people with MS reported they had used Cannabis to try to manage their symptoms.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if cannabinoids were better than placebo in adults with MS to improve: 
• spasticity;
• chronic neuropathic pain;
• well‐being,
We also wanted to find out if cannabinoids were associated with:
• treatment discontinuation due to unwanted effects; 
• serious harmful effects;
• nervous system disorders or psychiatric disorders;
• drug tolerance defined as a condition that occurs when the body gets used to a medicine so that more medicine is needed. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that compared cannabinoids against placebo in adult people with MS. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and certainty of evidence. 
What did we find?  
We found 25 studies that involved 3763 people with MS, 2290 of whom received cannabinoids. Fifteen studies were very short term or short‐term studies (two to 12 weeks), seven were intermediate term (12 to 26 weeks), and two were long term (50 and 156 weeks). One study reported results at three days only. The biggest study was conducted in 657 people and the smallest study involved 14 people. Most studies were done in European countries. Thirteen studies evaluated an oral spray (nabiximols) containing two compounds derived from the Cannabis plant. The other studies compared different cannabinoids with placebo. Pharmaceutical companies funded 15 of the studies. 
Main results 
Compared with placebo, cannabinoids: 
• probably increase the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of spasticity for up to 14 weeks (evidence from five studies in 1143 people); 
• may increase the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of chronic neuropathic pain, but the evidence is very uncertain (evidence from one study in 48 people). 
We are uncertain whether cannabinoids reduce chronic neuropathic pain intensity:
• probably increase the number of people who perceive their well‐being as 'very much' or 'much' improved (evidence from eight studies in 1215 people); 
• may increase slightly the number of people who discontinue treatment due to unwanted effects (evidence from 21 studies in 3110 people); 
• may result in little to no difference in the number of people who have serious harmful effects (evidence from 20 studies in 3124 people); 
• may increase nervous system disorders (evidence from seven studies in 1154 people) or psychiatric disorders (evidence from six studies in 1122 people); 
• may have little to no effect on the number of people who have drug tolerance, but the evidence is very uncertain (two studies in 458 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
There is no high‐quality evidence. 
We are moderately confident that cannabinoids work better versus no cannabinoids to improve severity of spasticity and well‐being in adults with MS. We have little confidence in our results for the effect on chronic neuropathic pain because the available evidence is limited. 
There is limited evidence to determine the effects of cannabinoids on serious harmful effects, nervous system or psychiatric disorders, and drug tolerance. 
How up to date is the evidence?The evidence is up‐to‐date to December 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013270.pub2,"Background
Age‐related cataract affects both eyes in most cases. Most people undergo cataract surgery in both eyes on separate days, referred to as delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). An alternative procedure involves operating on both eyes on the same day, but as two separate procedures, known as immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). Potential advantages of ISBCS include fewer hospital visits for the patient, faster visual recovery, and lower healthcare costs. Nevertheless, concerns exist about possible bilateral, postoperative, sight‐threatening adverse effects with ISBCS. Therefore, there is a clear need for evaluating evidence regarding the safety, effectiveness, and cost‐effectiveness of ISBCS versus DSBCS. 
Objectives
To assess the safety of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age‐related cataracts and to summarise current evidence for the incremental resource use, utilities, costs, and cost‐effectiveness associated with the use of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age‐related cataracts (primary objectives). The secondary objective was to assess visual and patient‐reported outcomes of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age‐related cataracts. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; the WHO ICTRP; and DARE and NHS EED on the CRD Database on 11 May 2021. There were no language restrictions. We limited the searches to a date range of 2007 onwards. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess complications, refractive outcomes, best‐corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) and patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs) with ISBCS compared to DSBCS. We included non‐randomised (NRSs), prospective, and retrospective cohort studies comparing ISBCS and DSBCS for safety assessment, because of the rare incidence of important adverse events. To assess cost‐effectiveness of ISBCS compared to DSBCS, we included both full and partial economic evaluations, and both trial‐based and model‐based economic evaluations. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures and assessed risk of bias for NRSs using the ROBINS‐I tool. For cost‐evaluations, we used the CHEC‐list, the CHEERS‐checklist, and the NICE‐checklist to investigate risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with the GRADE tool. We reported results for economic evaluations narratively. 
Main results
We included 14 studies in the review; two RCTs, seven NRSs, and six economic evaluations (one study was both an NRS and economic evaluation). The studies reported on 276,260 participants (7384 for ISBCS and 268,876 for DSBCS) and were conducted in Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, (South) Korea, Spain (Canary Islands), Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Overall, we considered the included RCTs to be at 'high to some concerns' risk of bias for complications, 'some concerns' risk of bias for refractive outcomes and visual acuity, and 'high' risk of bias for PROMs. The overall risk of bias for NRSs was graded 'serious' regarding complications and 'serious to critical' regarding refractive outcomes.  
With regard to endophthalmitis, we found that relative effects were estimated imprecisely and with low certainty, so that relative estimates were not reliable. Nonetheless, we found a very low risk of endophthalmitis in both ISBCS (1/14,076 participants) and DSBCS (55/556,246 participants) groups. Based on descriptive evidence and partially weak statistical evidence we found no evidence of an increased risk of endophthalmitis with ISBCS. Regarding refractive outcomes, we found moderate‐certainty (RCTs) and low‐certainty (NRSs) evidence there was no difference in the percentage of eyes that did not achieve refraction within 1.0 dioptre of target one to three months after surgery (RCTs: risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.26; NRSs: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.75). Similarly, postoperative complications did not differ between groups (RCTs: RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.40; NRSs: 1.04, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.29), although the certainty of this evidence was very low for both RCTs and NRSs. Furthermore, we found low‐certainty (RCTs) to very low‐certainty (NRSs) evidence that total costs per participant were lower for ISBCS compared to DSBCS, although results of individual studies could not be pooled. Only one study reported on cost‐effectiveness. This study found that ISBCS is cost‐effective compared to DSBCS, but did not measure quality‐adjusted life years using preferred methods and calculated costs erroneously. Finally, regarding secondary outcomes, we found limited evidence on BCDVA (data of two RCTs could not be pooled, although both studies individually found no difference between groups (very low‐certainty evidence)). Regarding PROMs, we found moderate‐certainty evidence (RCTs only) that there was no difference between groups one to three months after surgery (standardised mean difference −0.08, 95% CI −0.19 to 0.03). 
Authors' conclusions
Current evidence supports there are probably no clinically important differences in outcomes between ISBCS and DSBCS, but with lower costs for ISBCS. However, the amount of evidence is limited, and the certainty of the evidence was graded moderate to very low. In addition, there is a need for well‐designed cost‐effectiveness studies. 
","1. Plain Title
Cataract surgery in both eyes: same day or on two days?

2. Rationale
A cataract is a cloudy lens in the eye.
It can blur sight and make daily life hard.
Most older adults get cataracts in both eyes.
Surgery can clear the cloudy lens and help sight.

People often have surgery on each eye on different days.
This is two trips and two healing times.
Another way is to do both eyes on the same day.
Each eye is a separate, clean surgery on that day.

Same day surgery may save time and trips.
It may help people see well sooner.
It may also lower health costs.
But doctors worry about risk to both eyes at once.

A rare deep eye infection can harm sight.
This is called endophthalmitis.
We need to know if same day surgery raises that risk.
We also need to know about sight results and costs.

This study asked one main question.
Is same day surgery as safe as two day surgery?
It also looked at how well people see after surgery.
It looked at costs and value for money as well.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of past studies.
The team searched many research lists in May 2021.
They looked for studies from 2007 and later.
They had no limits on language.

They found 14 studies in total.
Two were random tests with a flip of a coin.
Seven were other kinds of comparison studies.
Six looked at costs and money value.

In all, the studies had about 276,000 people.
All had age‑related cataracts in both eyes.
The studies took place in many countries.
The review did not list ages or gender details here.

The team compared two surgery plans.
Same day means both eyes done on one day.
Two day means each eye on a different day.
Both plans use clean steps for each eye.

The team checked how safe each plan was.
They looked for deep eye infection after surgery.
They looked at other problems after surgery.
They looked at how well people could see.

They also checked what people said about their sight.
They checked how close sight was to the doctor’s goal.
They looked at costs for each plan.
Many results were checked one to three months after surgery.

The team also rated how strong the proof was.
Some proof was moderate in strength.
Some proof was low or very low.
This means we feel sure about some results, but not all.

4. Results
Safety
Deep eye infection was very rare with both plans.
It happened in 1 out of about 14,000 same day cases.
It happened in 55 out of about 556,000 two day cases.
The review found no clear higher risk with same day surgery.

Other problems after surgery were also rare.
These problems were about the same in both plans.
The proof on these problems was not strong.
So, more good studies would help.

Sight results
Sight after surgery was about the same in both plans.
How close sight was to the doctor’s goal was also the same.
Two studies looked at best sight with glasses.
Each of these two studies found no difference.

What people said about their sight also matched.
One to three months after surgery, people reported similar gains.
This means both plans helped people in daily life.
There was no clear winner for sight or comfort.

Costs and value for money
Total costs were lower with same day surgery in most reports.
The size of the savings varied by study.
Only one study looked at value for money in depth.
It said same day surgery gave good value.

But that one cost study had method and math problems.
So we should be careful with that one result.
We need more strong cost and value studies.
They should use clear and standard ways to measure value.

What this means
For most people with cataracts in both eyes, both plans work well.
Same day surgery likely works as well as two day surgery.
It may cost less and mean fewer clinic trips.
It may also help people see well sooner.

The risk of a deep eye infection was very low in both plans.
The review found no clear higher risk with same day surgery.
But some proof was weak, and rare harms are hard to measure.
So, care and clean steps are still key for both plans.

Bottom line
This review supports same day surgery as a fair choice.
It likely matches two day surgery for safety and sight.
It likely costs less money overall.
But we still need better cost and value research.

If you face cataract surgery in both eyes, ask your doctor.
Talk about your health, your home help, and your needs.
Ask about clinic steps to keep each eye safe and clean.
Choose the plan that fits you and your life.","Surgery on both eyes on the same day or on different days: which works better to treat cataract in both eyes? 
Key messages 
‐ Current evidence supports there may be no important difference between surgery on both eyes on the same day (ISBCS) and surgery on different days (DSBCS) for the following clinical outcomes: eye (ocular) infection (endophthalmitis, a severe, sight‐threatening but rare complication), spectacle correction after surgery (refraction), complications, vision with spectacle correction (if needed), and patient‐reported outcomes (PROMs; questionnaires on vision). 
‐ Current evidence supports the costs for ISBCS are lower compared to DSBCS, but evidence on the balance between the costs and how well it works (cost‐effectiveness) was lacking. 
‐ Overall, the amount and quality of the evidence was limited.
What is cataract and how is it treated? 
Age‐related cataract is a natural ageing process of the lens of the eye, in which the lens becomes cloudy and vision decreases. The only way to treat cataract is by surgery. During surgery, the clouded lens is removed and replaced by an artificial lens, implanted in the eye. Currently, most people undergo cataract surgery on both eyes on different days, with a period of days, weeks, or even months between surgeries, called delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). However, it is also possible to have cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day, called immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). 
Potential advantages to ISBCS include fewer visits to the hospital, faster visual recovery, and lower healthcare costs. However, there are also potential disadvantages, such as developing complications in both eyes. Also, in ISBCS, outcomes of the first eye cannot be used when performing second‐eye surgery, which may result in worse refractive outcomes (increased spectacle dependence). 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if cataract surgery on both eyes on the same day is as safe, effective, and cost‐effective as having surgery on both eyes on different days. 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that looked at outcomes of ISBCS compared to DSBCS. We also searched for studies that looked at the balance between costs and outcomes for ISBCS compared to DSBCS (cost‐effectiveness). We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 14 studies that involved 276,260 people (7384 who had ISBCS and 268,876 who had DSBCS). The studies were conducted in Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, (South) Korea, Spain (Canary Islands), Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Most studies lasted for around three months. 
Main results  
‐ Endophthalmitis: the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may make little to no difference in the occurrence of endophthalmitis in one eye (up to six weeks after surgery). None of the studies reported endophthalmitis in both eyes, but this event is most likely too rare to be detected by these studies. 
‐ Refractive outcomes: there is probably little to no difference in refractive outcomes at one to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS. 
‐ Other complications: there may be little to no difference in other complications up to three months after surgery with ISBCS compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ Costs: the economic studies in this review reported lower costs for ISBCS compared to DSBCS. One study reported that ISBCS is cost‐effective compared to DSBCS, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ Best‐corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA; vision with spectacle correction if needed): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) may have little to no effect on BCDVA at one to three months after surgery, but we are very uncertain about the results. 
‐ PROMs (measured in questionnaires): the type of surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS) probably makes little to no difference in PROMs at one to three months after surgery. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Overall, we had moderate to very little confidence in the evidence (endophthalmitis: little confidence, refractive outcomes: little to moderate confidence, complications: not confident, costs: little to no confidence, BCDVA: not confident, and PROMs: moderate confidence).  
Our confidence is limited because:
‐ the evidence on endophthalmitis was based on few cases of endophthalmitis;
‐ the studies assessed complications in different ways;
‐ there were not enough studies to be certain about refractive outcomes and complications;
‐ studies on costs reported costs for only one hospital and included different funding sources; 
‐ the studies assessed BCDVA in different ways and there were not enough studies to be certain about the results; 
‐ there were concerns regarding the possibility that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were getting, and not all studies provided data about everything that we were interested in (most outcomes).  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 11 May 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013207.pub2,"Background
The standard method of diagnosing HIV in infants and children less than 18 months is with a nucleic acid amplification test reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test (NAT RT‐PCR) detecting viral ribonucleic acid (RNA). Laboratory testing using the RT‐PCR platform for HIV infection is limited by poor access, logistical support, and delays in relaying test results and initiating therapy in low‐resource settings. The use of rapid diagnostic tests at or near the point‐of‐care (POC) can increase access to early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants and children less than 18 months of age and timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). 
Objectives
To summarize the diagnostic accuracy of point‐of‐care nucleic acid‐based testing (POC NAT) to detect HIV‐1/HIV‐2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less exposed to HIV infection. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (until 2 February 2021), MEDLINE and Embase (until 1 February 2021), and LILACS and Web of Science (until 2 February 2021) with no language or publication status restriction. We also searched conference websites and clinical trial registries, tracked reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and consulted experts for potentially eligible studies. 
Selection criteria
We defined POC tests as rapid diagnostic tests conducted at or near the patient site. We included any primary study that compared the results of a POC NAT to a reference standard of laboratory NAT RT‐PCR or total nucleic acid testing to detect the presence or absence of HIV infection denoted by HIV viral nucleic acids in infants and children aged 18 months or less who were exposed to HIV‐1/HIV‐2 infection. We included cross‐sectional, prospective, and retrospective study designs and those that provided sufficient data to create the 2 × 2 table to calculate sensitivity and specificity. We excluded diagnostic case control studies with healthy controls. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted information on study characteristics using a pretested standardized data extraction form. We used the QUADAS‐2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool to assess the risk of bias and applicability concerns of the included studies. Two review authors independently selected and assessed the included studies, resolving any disagreements by consensus. The unit of analysis was the participant. We first conducted preliminary exploratory analyses by plotting estimates of sensitivity and specificity from each study on forest plots and in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space. For the overall meta‐analyses, we pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity using the bivariate meta‐analysis model at a common threshold (presence or absence of infection). 
Main results
We identified a total of 12 studies (15 evaluations, 15,120 participants). All studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa. The ages of included infants and children in the evaluations were as follows: at birth (n = 6), ≤ 12 months (n = 3), ≤ 18 months (n = 5), and ≤ 24 months (n = 1). Ten evaluations were field evaluations of the POC NAT test at the point of care, and five were laboratory evaluations of the POC NAT tests.The POC NAT tests evaluated included Alere q HIV‐1/2 Detect qualitative test (recently renamed m‐PIMA q HIV‐1/2 Detect qualitative test) (n = 6), Xpert HIV‐1 qualitative test (n = 6), and SAMBA HIV‐1 qualitative test (n = 3). 
POC NAT pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval (CI)) against laboratory reference standard tests were 98.6% (96.1 to 99.5) (15 evaluations, 1728 participants) and 99.9% (99.7 to 99.9) (15 evaluations, 13,392 participants) in infants and children ≤ 18 months. 
Risk of bias in the included studies was mostly low or unclear due to poor reporting. Five evaluations had some concerns for applicability for the index test, as they were POC tests evaluated in a laboratory setting, but there was no difference detected between settings in sensitivity (−1.3% (95% CI −4.1 to 1.5)); and specificity results were similar. 
Authors' conclusions
For the diagnosis of HIV‐1/HIV‐2 infection, we found the sensitivity and specificity of POC NAT tests to be high in infants and children aged 18 months or less who were exposed to HIV infection.

Fast HIV tests for babies: how well do they work?

Rationale
HIV is a virus that can pass from a mother to her baby.
Babies can get it during pregnancy, birth, or breast milk.
If a baby has HIV, fast care helps the baby live and grow.
But the usual lab test can be slow and hard to reach in many places.

Doctors can test for the virus itself in the blood.
This type of test can find HIV in very young babies.
Small rapid tests can run near the clinic or bedside.
These tests may help start HIV drugs sooner.

This study asked a clear question.
Do rapid tests near the clinic find HIV in babies well?
The team thought they would work well.
They also asked if results were as good as lab tests.

Trial Design
This was not one new trial.
The team looked at many past studies on this topic.
They searched large medical libraries for reports.
They also asked experts and checked meeting sites.

They looked at studies of babies and small children.
All were 18 months of age or younger and had HIV exposure.
That means their mothers had HIV or were at risk.
The babies were tested for HIV with two kinds of tests.

One test was a rapid test near the clinic.
It looks for the virus in the blood.
The other was a lab test used as the gold standard.
The team compared how often the rapid test was right.

They found 12 studies with 15 test checks.
There were 15,120 babies in total.
All studies took place in sub-Saharan Africa.
Some tests were done in the clinic, some in the lab.

The rapid tests had brand names you may know.
They were Alere q or m-PIMA, Xpert, and SAMBA.
Some babies were tested at birth.
Others were tested up to 12 or 18 months of age.

Each study looked at one visit or more.
Each baby had both a rapid test and a lab test.
The rapid test gave a result near the point of care.
The lab test result came from a central site.

Results
The rapid tests did very well overall.
They found almost all babies who had HIV.
About 99 out of 100 babies with HIV were found.
This means very few sick babies were missed.

The tests were also very good at saying who was clear.
About 999 out of 1000 babies without HIV were called clear.
This means very few healthy babies were told they had HIV.
So there was little harm from wrong alarms.

The place of testing did not change the results much.
Some tests ran in the clinic and some in a lab.
The level of right answers was about the same.
Most study reports were fair to good in quality.

These results matter for families and care teams.
Rapid tests can help start HIV drugs without long waits.
Faster care may help babies grow and stay well.
This is key in places far from big labs.

What does this mean for you and your baby?
If your baby was born to a mother with HIV, test early.
A rapid test near the clinic is a strong choice.
It gives a quick and very good result.
Your care team can act on it with confidence.

The study team drew a clear end point.
Rapid tests near the clinic work very well in young babies.
They are almost as good as the best lab tests.
They can help get fast care to those who need it most.","Point‐of‐care tests for detecting HIV viral molecules in infants and children aged 18 months or less 
Why is improving the diagnosis of HIV infection important? 
It is estimated that 1.5 million infants are still exposed to HIV every year. If left untreated, about 50% to 60% of HIV‐infected infants will die by the age of two years. Children infected before birth are especially at high risk of death. HIV is incurable; however, there are medications that suppress HIV, known as antiretroviral drugs (ART). When HIV is detected early, severe illness and death from HIV‐related infections can be prevented by taking this medication. A test that detects HIV viral genetic molecules quickly and accurately at or near the patient's side (point‐of‐care) therefore can increase access to early appropriate treatment and minimize missing treatments in those whose HIV remains undetected. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of molecular point‐of‐care tests for detecting the main types of HIV infection (HIV‐1/HIV‐2) in infants and children aged 18 months or less. 
What was studied in this review? 
Published reports of molecular point‐of‐care tests with results measured against laboratory viral‐based tests (benchmark). 
What are the main results of this review? 
Twelve studies which completed 15 evaluations involving 15,120 participants compared molecular point‐of‐care tests for diagnosing HIV infection. 
What are the strengths and limitations of this review? 
The review included sufficient studies and participants. All studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa, making the results highly applicable for use in communities where the disease is regularly found and where disease control programmes are often targeted. However, one in three included evaluations of the molecular point‐of‐care tests were conducted in a laboratory setting and not near the patient but there was no difference in the test accuracy between settings. 
To whom do the results of this review apply? 
Infants and children aged 18 months or less who were exposed to HIV infection.
What are the implications of this review? 
In theory, for a population of 1000 children aged 18 months or less where 100 have HIV infection, 100 children will be positive with the molecular point‐of‐care test, of which one will not have the infection (false‐positive result), and 900 will be negative with the molecular point‐of‐care test, of which one will indeed have the infection (false‐negative result). 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 2 February 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013870.pub2,"Background
Atopic eczema (AE), also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that causes significant burden. Phototherapy is sometimes used to treat AE when topical treatments, such as corticosteroids, are insufficient or poorly tolerated. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of phototherapy for treating AE. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov to January 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials in adults or children with any subtype or severity of clinically diagnosed AE. Eligible comparisons were any type of phototherapy versus other forms of phototherapy or any other treatment, including placebo or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology. For key findings, we used RoB 2.0 to assess bias, and GRADE to assess certainty of the evidence. Primary outcomes were physician‐assessed signs and patient‐reported symptoms. Secondary outcomes were Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), safety (measured as withdrawals due to adverse events), and long‐term control. 
Main results
We included 32 trials with 1219 randomised participants, aged 5 to 83 years (mean: 28 years), with an equal number of males and females. Participants were recruited mainly from secondary care dermatology clinics, and study duration was, on average, 13 weeks (range: 10 days to one year). We assessed risk of bias for all key outcomes as having some concerns or high risk, due to missing data, inappropriate analysis, or insufficient information to assess selective reporting. 
Assessed interventions included: narrowband ultraviolet B (NB‐UVB; 13 trials), ultraviolet A1 (UVA1; 6 trials), broadband ultraviolet B (BB‐UVB; 5 trials), ultraviolet AB (UVAB; 2 trials), psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA; 2 trials), ultraviolet A (UVA; 1 trial), unspecified ultraviolet B (UVB; 1 trial), full spectrum light (1 trial), Saalmann selective ultraviolet phototherapy (SUP) cabin (1 trial), saltwater bath plus UVB (balneophototherapy; 1 trial), and excimer laser (1 trial). Comparators included placebo, no treatment, another phototherapy, topical treatment, or alternative doses of the same treatment. 
Results for key comparisons are summarised (for scales, lower scores are better):
NB‐UVB versus placebo/no treatment 
There may be a larger reduction in physician‐assessed signs with NB‐UVB compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment (mean difference (MD) ‐9.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.62 to ‐15.18; 1 trial, 41 participants; scale: 0 to 90). Two trials reported little difference between NB‐UVB and no treatment (37 participants, four to six weeks of treatment); another reported improved signs with NB‐UVB versus no treatment (11 participants, nine weeks of treatment). 
NB‐UVB may increase the number of people reporting reduced itch after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.72, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.69; 1 trial, 40 participants). Another trial reported very little difference in itch severity with NB‐UVB (25 participants, four weeks of treatment). 
The number of participants with moderate to greater global improvement may be higher with NB‐UVB than placebo after 12 weeks of treatment (RR 2.81, 95% CI 1.10 to 7.17; 1 trial, 41 participants). 
NB‐UVB may not affect rates of withdrawal due to adverse events. No withdrawals were reported in one trial of NB‐UVB versus placebo (18 participants, nine weeks of treatment). In two trials of NB‐UVB versus no treatment, each reported one withdrawal per group (71 participants, 8 to 12 weeks of treatment). 
We judged that all reported outcomes were supported with low‐certainty evidence, due to risk of bias and imprecision. No trials reported HRQoL. 
NB‐UVB versus UVA1 
We judged the evidence for NB‐UVB compared to UVA1 to be very low certainty for all outcomes, due to risk of bias and imprecision. There was no evidence of a difference in physician‐assessed signs after six weeks (MD ‐2.00, 95% CI ‐8.41 to 4.41; 1 trial, 46 participants; scale: 0 to 108), or patient‐reported itch after six weeks (MD 0.3, 95% CI ‐1.07 to 1.67; 1 trial, 46 participants; scale: 0 to 10). Two split‐body trials (20 participants, 40 sides) also measured these outcomes, using different scales at seven to eight weeks; they reported lower scores with NB‐UVB. One trial reported HRQoL at six weeks (MD 2.9, 95% CI ‐9.57 to 15.37; 1 trial, 46 participants; scale: 30 to 150). One split‐body trial reported no withdrawals due to adverse events over 12 weeks (13 participants). No trials reported IGA. 
NB‐UVB versus PUVA 
We judged the evidence for NB‐UVB compared to PUVA (8‐methoxypsoralen in bath plus UVA) to be very low certainty for all reported outcomes, due to risk of bias and imprecision. There was no evidence of a difference in physician‐assessed signs after six weeks (64.1% reduction with NB‐UVB versus 65.7% reduction with PUVA; 1 trial, 10 participants, 20 sides). There was no evidence of a difference in marked improvement or complete remission after six weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 7.89; 1 trial, 9/10 participants with both treatments). One split‐body trial reported no withdrawals due to adverse events in 10 participants over six weeks. The trials did not report patient‐reported symptoms or HRQoL. 
UVA1 versus PUVA 
There was very low‐certainty evidence, due to serious risk of bias and imprecision, that PUVA (oral 5‐methoxypsoralen plus UVA) reduced physician‐assessed signs more than UVA1 after three weeks (MD 11.3, 95% CI ‐0.21 to 22.81; 1 trial, 40 participants; scale: 0 to 103). The trial did not report patient‐reported symptoms, IGA, HRQoL, or withdrawals due to adverse events. 
There were no eligible trials for the key comparisons of UVA1 or PUVA compared with no treatment. 
Adverse events 
Reported adverse events included low rates of phototoxic reaction, severe irritation, UV burn, bacterial superinfection, disease exacerbation, and eczema herpeticum. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared to placebo or no treatment, NB‐UVB may improve physician‐rated signs, patient‐reported symptoms, and IGA after 12 weeks, without a difference in withdrawal due to adverse events. Evidence for UVA1 compared to NB‐UVB or PUVA, and NB‐UVB compared to PUVA was very low certainty. More information is needed on the safety and effectiveness of all aspects of phototherapy for treating AE.

Light treatment for eczema: what 32 studies found

Rationale
Eczema, also called atopic eczema, is a long-term skin rash. The skin can itch, burn, crack, and leak. Sleep and mood can get worse. Life can feel hard.

Skin creams help many people. But some people do not get enough help. Some do not like side effects. Doctors can use light on the skin when creams are not enough.

This is called light therapy, or phototherapy. It uses safe doses of UV light in a clinic. UV light can calm skin swell and itch. It may help the rash to heal.

We need to know which light type helps most. We also need to know how safe it is. This review looked at past trials to find clear answers.

Trial Design
The team looked for clinical trials in kids and adults with eczema. They used many large health study lists up to January 2021. They only used trials that put people into groups by chance. This is called random.

They found 32 trials. In all, 1,219 people took part. Ages were 5 to 83 years, with a mean age of 28 years. About half were men and half were women. Most people came from skin clinics. Most trials lasted about 13 weeks. Some were as short as 10 days. One lasted a year.

The trials tested many kinds of light. The most common was narrow band UVB light. Some used UVA1 light. Some used PUVA. PUVA uses a drug called psoralen with UVA light. People may take psoralen by pill or bath. A few small trials used other light tools or a laser.

Trials compared light to fake light or no light. Some compared one light type to another. Some compared different doses of the same light. Some compared light to skin creams.

The main things they checked were rash signs and how people felt. Doctors scored the rash on a skin scale. People rated itch and other symptoms. Other goals were an “overall change” skin score, daily life impact, and safety. Safety meant if people had to stop due to bad effects. Some looked at how long the skin stayed calm.

The team used set methods to rate study quality. Many results had problems. Some trials were small. Some had missing data. Some did not report all results. So some proof is not strong.

Results
Narrow band UVB versus fake light or no light:
After about 12 weeks, one trial with 41 people found better doctor skin scores with UVB. One trial with 40 people found more people said their itch was less. One trial with 41 people found more people had at least a moderate overall gain. Two small trials over 4 to 6 weeks found little to no gain. One small trial over 9 weeks found better doctor skin scores with UVB. Trials did not report daily life impact for this match-up. The number of people who had to stop due to bad effects was about the same. These results have low strength. Small size and study limits make the proof less sure.

Narrow band UVB versus UVA1:
One trial with 46 people found no clear gap in doctor skin scores at 6 weeks. It also found no clear gap in itch. Two small “split body” trials found lower scores with UVB at 7 to 8 weeks. In a split body trial, one side of the body gets one light. The other side gets a different light. One trial found no clear gap in daily life impact. One small split body trial found no people had to stop due to bad effects. The proof here is very weak. The trials were small and had limits.

Narrow band UVB versus PUVA:
One small split body trial found no clear gap in doctor skin scores at 6 weeks. One small trial found no clear gap in “marked change” or clear skin. No one had to stop due to bad effects in a small split body trial. Trials did not report itch or daily life impact. The proof here is very weak.

UVA1 versus PUVA:
One trial found that PUVA lowered doctor skin scores more than UVA1 after 3 weeks. It did not report itch, overall change, daily life impact, or people who had to stop. The proof is very weak.

There were no trials that compared UVA1 or PUVA to no light.

Side effects:
Side effects were noted at low rates. These included light burn like a sun burn. Some had bad skin sting. Some had germ skin infection. Some had a flare of the rash. A few had “eczema herpeticum.” That is a skin rash with the cold sore virus. Most trials were small, so we need more safety data.

What this means
Light therapy may help when creams are not enough. Narrow band UVB may help rash signs and itch over about 12 weeks. It may also give a clear overall gain. We did not see more people stop due to bad effects.

We do not know if narrow band UVB works better than UVA1 or PUVA. Some small trials hint it may help as much or more. But the proof is weak. We need larger, high quality trials to be sure.

We also need to learn more on daily life impact. Few trials looked at that. We need to know how long the calm lasts after light. We need more clear safety data.

In short: UVB narrow band light may help. We do not yet know the best light type or dose. More and better trials are needed.","What are the benefits and risks of light therapy for treating atopic eczema (also known as eczema or atopic dermatitis)? 
Key messages 
Narrowband (NB) ultraviolet B (UVB), compared to placebo (a sham treatment), may improve eczema severity (including itch) and may not affect the number of people leaving a study because of unwanted effects. 
We were unable to confidently draw conclusions for other phototherapy (light therapy) treatments. 
Future research needs to assess longer term effectiveness and safety of NB‐UVB and other forms of phototherapy for eczema. 
What is eczema? 
Eczema is a condition that results in dry, itchy patches of inflamed skin. Eczema typically starts in childhood, but can improve with age. Eczema is caused by a combination of genetics and environmental factors, which lead to skin barrier dysfunction. Eczema can negatively impact quality of life, and the societal cost is significant. 
How is eczema treated? 
Eczema treatments are often creams or ointments that reduce itch and redness, applied directly to the skin. If these are unsuccessful, systemic medicines that affect the whole body, or phototherapy are options. Phototherapy can be UVB, ultraviolet A (UVA), or photochemotherapy (PUVA), where phototherapy is given alongside substances that increase sensitivity to UV light. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out whether phototherapy was better than no treatment or other types of treatment for treating eczema, and whether it caused unwanted effects. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated phototherapy compared with no treatment, placebo, other forms of phototherapy, or another type of eczema treatment. Studies could include people of all ages, who had eczema diagnosed by a healthcare professional. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies, and rated our confidence in the evidence. 
What did we find? 
We found 32 studies, involving 1219 people with eczema (average age: 28 years), who were recruited from dermatology clinics. Most studies assessed people with skin type II to III (which is classed as white to medium skin colour), and moderate to severe eczema, with which they had lived for many years. Studies included similar numbers of males and females. 
The studies were conducted in Europe, Asia, and Egypt (setting was not reported by seven studies), and lasted, on average, for 13 weeks. Almost half of the studies reported their source of funding; two were linked to commercial sponsors. 
Our included studies mostly assessed NB‐UVB, followed by UVA1, then broadband ultraviolet B; fewer studies investigated other types of phototherapy. The studies compared these treatments to placebo, or no treatment, another type of phototherapy, different doses of the same sort of phototherapy, or other eczema treatments applied to the skin or taken by tablet. 
None of the studies investigated excimer lamp (a source of UV radiation) or heliotherapy (the use of natural sunlight), that were other light therapies in which we were interested. 
What are the main results of our review? 
When compared to placebo, NB‐UVB may:
‐ improve signs of eczema assessed by a healthcare professional (1 study, 41 people);
‐ increase the number of people reporting less severe itching (1 study, 41 people);
‐ increase the number of people reporting moderate or greater improvement of eczema, measured by the Investigator Global Assessment scale (IGA), a 5‐point scale that measures improvement in eczema symptoms (1 study, 40 people); and 
‐ have no effect on the rate of people withdrawing from treatment due to unwanted effects (3 studies, 89 people). 
None of the studies assessing NB‐UVB against placebo measured health‐related quality of life. 
We do not know if NB‐UVB (compared with UVA1 or PUVA) or UVA1 (compared with PUVA) has an effect on the following: 
‐ signs of eczema assessed by a healthcare professional;
‐ patient‐reported eczema symptoms;
‐ IGA;
‐ health‐related quality of life; and
‐ withdrawals due to unwanted effects.
This is because either we are not confident in the evidence, or they were not reported.
We did not identify any studies that investigated UVA1 or PUVA compared with no treatment.
Some studies reported that phototherapy caused some unwanted effects, including skin reactions or irritation, UV burn, worsening of eczema, and skin infections. However, these did not occur in most people. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited, mainly because only a few studies could be included in each comparison, and the studies generally involved only small numbers of people. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to January 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013446,"Background
Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight. In a previous Cochrane Review we found that supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone compared to no vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and low birthweight and may increase the risk of preterm births if it is combined with calcium. However the effects of different vitamin D regimens are not yet clear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety of different regimens of vitamin D supplementation alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins, minerals or nutrients during pregnancy, specifically doses of 601 international units per day (IU/d) or more versus 600 IU/d or less; and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (12 July 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (dose, frequency, duration, and time of commencement of supplementation during pregnancy), alone or in combination with other nutrients on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. We only included trials that compared 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less. We did not include in the analysis groups that received no vitamin D, as that comparison is assessed in another Cochrane Review. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently: i) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria; ii) extracted data from included studies, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Our primary maternal outcomes were: pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and any adverse effects; our primary infant outcomes were preterm birth and low birthweight. Data were checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
In this review, we included data from 30 trials involving 7289 women. We excluded 11 trials, identified 16 ongoing/unpublished trials and two trials are awaiting classification. Overall risk of bias for the trials was mixed. 
Comparison 1. 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient (19 trials; 5214 participants) 
Supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.42); 5 trials; 1553 participants,low‐certainty evidence), may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86; 5 trials; 1846 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), may make little or no difference to the risk of preterm birth (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.69; 4 trials; 2294 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference to the risk of low birthweight (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 4 trials; 1550 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. 
Comparison 2. 4000 IU or more versus 3999 IU or less of vitamin D alone (15 trials; 4763 participants) 
Supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of: pre‐eclampsia (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.22; 4 trials, 1903 participants, low‐certainty evidence); gestational diabetes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.42; 5 trials, 2276 participants; low‐certainty evidence); preterm birth (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.12; 6 trials, 2948 participants, low‐certainty evidence); and low birthweight (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.70; 2 trials; 1099 participants; low‐certainty evidence) compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. 
Adverse events (such as hypercalcaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypercalciuria, and hypovitaminosis D) were reported differently in most trials; however, in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. 
Authors' conclusions
Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, preterm birth and low birthweight. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. In general, the GRADE was considered low certainty for most of the primary outcomes due to serious risk of bias and imprecision of results. With respect to safety, it appears that vitamin D supplementation is a safe intervention during pregnancy, although the parameters used to determine this were either not reported or not consistent between trials. Future trials should be consistent in their reports of adverse events. There are 16 ongoing trials that when published, will increase the body of knowledge. 
","1. Plain Title
Do higher daily doses of vitamin D in pregnancy help and are they safe?

2. Rationale
Vitamin D helps build strong bones. It may also support the immune system. During pregnancy, low vitamin D is common. Low levels link to health problems for mother and baby.

These problems can include:
- Pre-eclampsia. This means high blood pressure in pregnancy that can harm organs.
- Gestational diabetes. This means diabetes that starts during pregnancy.
- Preterm birth. This means the baby is born too early.
- Low birthweight. This means the baby is small at birth.

Past studies suggest that vitamin D may help some of these risks. But the best dose is not clear. This study asked two main questions. First, does taking more than 600 IU a day help more than 600 IU or less? Second, does taking 4000 IU or more a day help more than 3999 IU or less? IU means “international units.” This is a simple way to measure vitamins. The study also asked if higher doses are safe in pregnancy.

3. Trial Design
This study was a review of many clinical trials. Researchers looked for trials that gave vitamin D in pregnancy. They grouped the results to get a clearer picture.

The review included 30 trials with 7289 pregnant women. In some trials, people took vitamin D alone. In others, they took vitamin D with other vitamins or minerals. The women took vitamin D during pregnancy. The time on vitamin D lasted through part or all of the pregnancy.

The review compared two dose groups. The first group compared more than 600 IU a day versus 600 IU a day or less. The second group compared 4000 IU a day or more versus 3999 IU a day or less. The researchers looked at the same main health results across trials.

For mothers, the team looked at:
- Pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure with organ stress).
- Gestational diabetes (diabetes that starts in pregnancy).
- Any side effects.

For babies, the team looked at:
- Preterm birth (birth too early).
- Low birthweight (small size at birth).

4. Results
What did the review find for doses above 600 IU a day?
- Pre-eclampsia: Taking more than 600 IU a day may make little or no difference.
- Gestational diabetes: Taking more than 600 IU a day may lower the risk.
- Preterm birth: Taking more than 600 IU a day may make little or no difference.
- Low birthweight: Taking more than 600 IU a day may make little or no difference.

These results came from 19 trials with 5214 women. The strength of the evidence differed by outcome. For gestational diabetes, the evidence was stronger than for the other outcomes. Still, not all trials were strong. So these findings could change with better trials.

What did the review find for doses of 4000 IU a day or more?
- Pre-eclampsia: 4000 IU or more a day may make little or no difference.
- Gestational diabetes: 4000 IU or more a day may make little or no difference.
- Preterm birth: 4000 IU or more a day may make little or no difference.
- Low birthweight: 4000 IU or more a day may make little or no difference.

These results came from 15 trials with 4763 women. The evidence for these results was also not very strong. Many trials had limits. This lowers confidence in the size of any effect.

What about safety?
The trials did not report side effects in the same way. This makes safety hard to judge with full confidence. In general, the trials reported few or no side effects. Side effects were similar between higher and lower dose groups. Reported issues included blood calcium checks. The reports did not show clear harm from higher vitamin D doses in the outcomes studied.

What does this mean for patients?
- Taking more than 600 IU a day may help lower the chance of diabetes in pregnancy. It may not change the chance of pre-eclampsia, early birth, or low birthweight.
- Taking 4000 IU a day or more did not show extra benefit for the main outcomes studied. It also did not show more harm in these outcomes.
- Overall, vitamin D in pregnancy appeared safe in these trials. But safety reports were not consistent. This means we need better safety data.

How is this study relevant?
Many pregnant women take vitamin D. Doctors and patients want to know the right dose. This review brings together data from many trials. It suggests a possible benefit for diabetes in pregnancy with doses above 600 IU a day. It suggests little or no effect on other main outcomes. It also does not show clear harm with higher doses for the outcomes studied.

What did the investigators conclude?
- Doses above current standard advice may lower the risk of gestational diabetes.
- Doses above the current upper limit did not show more harm in these outcomes.
- The certainty of the evidence was often low. This is due to trial limits and small sample sizes for some outcomes.
- Better trials are on the way. Sixteen ongoing trials may give clearer answers.

What should you do?
Do not change your vitamin D dose on your own. Talk with your prenatal care team. They can guide you on vitamin D testing and dosing. Your dose may depend on your diet, sun exposure, and health history.","Regimens of vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy
What is the issue? 
This review evaluated if there are beneficial effects of supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation (200 international units/day (IU/d) to 600 IU/d) on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes and to evaluate if there are negative health effects when using more than the current upper limit recommendation (4000 IU/d). 
Why is this important? 
Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy compared to no supplementation appears to decrease the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight and may reduce the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage. However, it is not clear if doses greater than the currently recommended level are needed to observe these health benefits, and if giving more than the upper limit is related to adverse events. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review included trials evaluating the effect of different vitamin D regimens (doses, frequencies, duration, and times of commencement) to compare the effects of 601 IU/d or more versus 600 IU/d or less and 4000 IU/d or more versus 3999 IU/d or less, of vitamin D alone or with any other nutrient on pregnancy and neonatal health outcomes. 
What evidence did we find? 
Evidence from 19 trials involving 5214 women suggest that supplementation with 601 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes but may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 600 IU/d or less. 
Evidence from 15 trials involving 4763 women suggests that supplementation with 4000 IU/d or more of vitamin D during pregnancy may make little or no difference to the risk of pre‐eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or low birthweight compared to women receiving 3999 IU/d or less. 
Adverse events were reported differently in most trials; in general, there was little to no side effects reported or similar cases between groups. 
What does this mean? 
Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes; however, it may make little or no difference in the risk of the other outcomes. Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current upper limit for vitamin D seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated. Vitamin D supplementation appears to be safe.

10.1002-14651858.CD000371.pub7,"Deworming school children in low‐ and middle‐income countries
Cochrane researchers examined the effects of deworming children in areas where intestinal worm infection is common. After searching for relevant trials up to 19 September 2018, we included 50 trials with a total of 84,336 participants, and an additional trial of one million children. 
What is deworming and why might it be important 
Soil‐transmitted worms, including roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms, are common in tropical and subtropical areas, and particularly affect children living in poverty where there is inadequate sanitation. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends that school children in many areas are regularly treated with drugs which kill these worms. Some advocates claim such programmes improve child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and survival. 
What the research says 
In populations of children living in endemic areas, the effect of the first, single dose of deworming drugs on weight is unclear. There was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya, reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago in a school where children were heavily infected with worms. This causes uncertainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight. For height, most studies showed little or no effect, with the exception of the site in Kenya. A single dose of deworming medicine probably has no effect on haemoglobin and cognition. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on school attendance, school performance, or physical fitness or mortality. 
In studies where children were regularly treated with deworming medicine there was little or no effect on weight in all but two trials, irrespective of whether children were heavily infected with worms or not. The two trials with large average weight gains included the Kenya study carried out over 30 years ago, and one study from India carried out over 20 years ago in a low worm burden area where later studies in the same area did not show an effect. In trials from 2000 onwards, which are more relevant given the global reduction in worm burden, there is little or no effect. This causes uncertainty and means we do not know if regularly treating children with deworming medicine improves their weight. Regularly deworming children probably has no effect on height, haemoglobin, cognition, and mortality. We do not know if there is an impact on school attendance, since the evidence is inconsistent and at high risk of bias. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on physical fitness. 
Authors' conclusions 
For public health programmes to regularly treat all children in endemic areas with deworming drugs, there is quite substantial evidence of no benefit in terms of haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, and mortality. For weight, contemporary studies do not show an effect, but unusually large effects were seen in studies over 20 years ago.

Do deworming pills help school children grow and learn?

Rationale
Intestinal worms are common in warm, wet places. They spread where toilets are poor. Kids get worms from soil that has tiny eggs. Worms can cause belly pain and blood loss. Kids can feel weak and tired.

These worms include roundworm, hookworm, and whipworm. They live in the gut. They use up food from the child. They can slow growth and learning. They may also lower blood levels.

Many groups give deworming pills at school. The pills kill the worms in the gut. People hope this will help weight and height. They also hope it will help blood, thinking, and school work. The World Health Organization advises this in many places.

We need good proof to guide care. Some reports said the gains were big. Other reports did not. This review asked a clear question. Do these pills help most school children in places with many worms?

Trial Design
This study was a review of trials. A review looks at all good trials on a topic. The team searched for trials to 19 September 2018. They found 50 trials. These trials had about 84,336 children.

They also found one very large trial. That trial had one million children. The trials took place in places where worms are common. Many were in low and middle income lands. The trials looked at school children.

Some trials gave one dose of pills. Some gave pills on a set plan over time. The drugs aimed to kill roundworm, hookworm, and whipworm. The trials then measured health and school results.

The team looked at many outcomes. These included weight and height. They also looked at hemoglobin, which is the red part of blood. Hemoglobin carries oxygen in the body. They also looked at thinking, school days, school work, fitness, and death.

The review compared pills to no pills or later pills. It judged how well each trial was done. It looked for flaws that can skew results. This is called risk of bias. This helps us judge how much to trust the findings.

Results
First, the team looked at a first, single dose of pills. The effect on weight was not clear. Most trials showed little or no change. One site in Kenya showed large weight gains long ago. That school had many children with heavy worm infection.

For height, most trials showed little or no change. The Kenya site again showed gains. A single dose likely did not change hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the part of blood that carries oxygen. A single dose likely did not change thinking and learning.

There was not enough good data on school days. School days means how often kids came to school. There was also not enough data on school work or fitness. Fitness means how well a child can run and play. There was not enough data on death.

Next, the team looked at regular pills over time. Most trials showed little or no gain in weight. Two trials did show large gains. One was the old Kenya work. One was an older trial from India with few worms.

Later trials in that same area in India did not show gains. Trials done from 2000 and later also showed little or no gain. Worm levels are lower in many places now. So the older gains may not apply today. We do not know if regular pills help weight for most children now.

Regular pills likely did not change height. They also likely did not change hemoglobin. They likely did not change thinking or learning. They likely did not change death.

The results for school days were mixed. Some trials had flaws in how they ran. Flaws can make results look better than they are. So we cannot say the pills helped school days. We also do not know if they helped fitness.

What does this mean for care? For mass school programs, the gains were small or none. The review found strong signs of no gain in blood, thinking, school work, and life. Weight gains showed up in some old trials. Newer trials did not show this.

This review does not say that no child should get pills. A child with worms may still need care. A doctor may still treat a sick child. But giving pills to all school children may not give broad gains.

This review helps leaders plan. It used many trials and many children. It checked for bias and mixed results. The main finding was clear. Routine school deworming did not help most outcomes.

In short, deworming pills do kill worms. But in these trials, they did not help most measures. This was true for weight in newer trials. It was true for height, blood, thinking, school work, and death. More high quality trials could help fill the gaps on school days and fitness.","Deworming school children in low‐ and middle‐income countries
Cochrane researchers examined the effects of deworming children in areas where intestinal worm infection is common. After searching for relevant trials up to 19 September 2018, we included 50 trials with a total of 84,336 participants, and an additional trial of one million children. 
What is deworming and why might it be important 
Soil‐transmitted worms, including roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms, are common in tropical and subtropical areas, and particularly affect children living in poverty where there is inadequate sanitation. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends that school children in many areas are regularly treated with drugs which kill these worms. Some advocates claim such programmes improve child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and survival. 
What the research says 
In populations of children living in endemic areas, the effect of the first, single dose of deworming drugs on weight is unclear. There was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya, reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago in a school where children were heavily infected with worms. This causes uncertainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight. For height, most studies showed little or no effect, with the exception of the site in Kenya. A single dose of deworming medicine probably has no effect on haemoglobin and cognition. There is insufficient data to know if there is an effect on school attendance, school performance, or physical fitness or mortality.

10.1002-14651858.CD013230,"Background
Oral poisoning is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide, with estimates of over 100,000 deaths due to unintentional poisoning each year and an overrepresentation of children below five years of age. Any effective intervention that laypeople can apply to limit or delay uptake or to evacuate, dilute or neutralize the poison before professional help arrives may limit toxicity and save lives. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of pre‐hospital interventions (alone or in combination) for treating acute oral poisoning, available to and feasible for laypeople before the arrival of professional help. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and three clinical trials registries to 4 December 2018, and we also carried out reference checking and citation searching. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials comparing interventions (alone or in combination) that are feasible in a pre‐hospital setting for treating acute oral poisoning patients, including but potentially not limited to activated charcoal (AC), emetics, cathartics, diluents, neutralizing agents and body positioning. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, data collection and assessment. Primary outcomes of this review were incidence of mortality and adverse events, plus incidence and severity of symptoms of poisoning. Secondary outcomes were duration of symptoms of poisoning, drug absorption, and incidence of hospitalization and ICU admission. 
Main results
We included 24 trials involving 7099 participants. Using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, we assessed no study as being at low risk of bias for all domains. Many studies were poorly reported, so the risk of selection and detection biases were often unclear. Most studies reported important outcomes incompletely, and we judged them to be at high risk of reporting bias. 
All but one study enrolled oral poisoning patients in an emergency department; the remaining study was conducted in a pre‐hospital setting. Fourteen studies included multiple toxic syndromes or did not specify, while the other studies specifically investigated paracetamol (2 studies), carbamazepine (2 studies), tricyclic antidepressant (2 studies), yellow oleander (2 studies), benzodiazepine (1 study), or toxic berry intoxication (1 study). Twenty‐one trials investigated the effects of activated charcoal (AC), administered as a single dose (SDAC) or in multiple doses (MDAC), alone or in combination with other first aid interventions (a cathartic) and/or hospital treatments. Six studies investigated syrup of ipecac plus other first aid interventions (SDAC + cathartic) versus ipecac alone. The collected evidence was mostly of low to very low certainty, often downgraded for indirectness, risk of bias or imprecision due to low numbers of events. 
First aid interventions that limit or delay the absorption of the poison in the body 
We are uncertain about the effect of SDAC compared to no intervention on the incidence of adverse events in general (zero events in both treatment groups; 1 study, 451 participants) or vomiting specifically (Peto odds ratio (OR) 4.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 57.26, 1 study, 25 participants), ICU admission (Peto OR 7.77, 95% CI 0.15 to 391.93, 1 study, 451 participants) and clinical deterioration (zero events in both treatment groups; 1 study, 451 participants) in participants with mixed types or paracetamol poisoning, as all evidence for these outcomes was of very low certainty. No studies assessed SDAC for mortality, duration of symptoms, drug absorption or hospitalization. 
Only one study compared SDAC to syrup of ipecac in participants with mixed types of poisoning, providing very low‐certainty evidence. Therefore we are uncertain about the effects on Glasgow Coma Scale scores (mean difference (MD) −0.15, 95% CI −0.43 to 0.13, 1 study, 34 participants) or incidence of adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% CI 0.26 to 5.83, 1 study, 34 participants). No information was available concerning mortality, duration of symptoms, drug absorption, hospitalization or ICU admission. 
This review also considered the added value of SDAC or MDAC to hospital interventions, which mostly included gastric lavage. No included studies investigated the use of body positioning in oral poisoning patients. 
First aid interventions that evacuate the poison from the gastrointestinal tract 
We found one study comparing ipecac versus no intervention in toxic berry ingestion in a pre‐hospital setting. Low‐certainty evidence suggests there may be an increase in the incidence of adverse events, but the study did not report incidence of mortality, incidence or duration of symptoms of poisoning, drug absorption, hospitalization or ICU admission (103 participants). 
In addition, we also considered the added value of syrup of ipecac to SDAC plus a cathartic and the added value of a cathartic to SDAC. 
No studies used cathartics as an individual intervention.
First aid interventions that neutralize or dilute the poison 
No included studies investigated the neutralization or dilution of the poison in oral poisoning patients. 
Authors' conclusions
The studies included in this review provided mostly low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence about the use of first aid interventions for acute oral poisoning. A key limitation was the fact that only one included study actually took place in a pre‐hospital setting, which undermines our confidence in the applicability of these results to this setting. Thus, the amount of evidence collected was insufficient to draw any conclusions. 
","1. Plain Title
What helps before help arrives after a swallowed poison?

2. Rationale
Swallowed poisons can cause harm or death. This is a large problem worldwide. Young kids are at high risk. Many poisonings happen at home.

Fast action may limit harm. The goal is to slow or block the poison from the gut. Or to get it out before it is absorbed. This may save lives.

People at home can try some steps. These include activated charcoal, syrup of ipecac, and cathartics. Activated charcoal is a black powder. It can bind some poisons in the gut. Ipecac is a syrup that makes a person vomit. A cathartic is a strong laxative. It makes bowel movements fast.

Other ideas include diluting or neutralizing the poison. Some also suggest body position. For example, lying on one side. But we do not know if these work.

This study looked for proof that these steps help. The main hope was to find safe and simple actions. These would be things a layperson can do before help arrives.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team searched many research lists up to late 2018. They looked for randomized trials. A randomized trial puts people into groups by chance. This helps test what works best.

The team found 24 trials. These trials had 7099 people in total. Almost all trials took place in hospital emergency rooms. Only one trial took place before the person got to the hospital. The people in the trials had just swallowed a poison.

Some trials mixed many types of poisons. Some looked at one type. These included:
- acetaminophen (a pain drug)
- carbamazepine (a seizure drug)
- tricyclic antidepressants (mood drugs)
- yellow oleander seeds (a plant poison that can harm the heart)
- benzodiazepines (sleep or anxiety drugs)
- toxic berries

The trials tested first aid steps that a layperson might use. Most trials tested activated charcoal. Some used one dose. Some used more than one dose. Some also used a cathartic. Some trials tested syrup of ipecac. No trials tested body position. No trials tested diluting or neutralizing the poison.

The trials looked at key results. These included death, side effects, and how sick people felt. They also looked at time in symptoms, drug levels in the body, hospital stay, and ICU stay. ICU stands for intensive care unit. It is a hospital unit for very sick people.

The trials did not give the ages or genders of the people in this summary. The time a person stayed in each trial was not clear in this summary.

4. Results
The team found that the proof was weak. Many trials had poor reports. Many did not give full results. The team saw risks of bias in many trials. So, the certainty of the proof was low or very low.

Activated charcoal:
- One trial looked at one dose of charcoal vs no first aid. It did not show clear help or harm. It did not show clear change in vomiting. It did not show clear change in ICU use. It did not show clear change in bad turn of health. It did not report on deaths. It did not report on time in symptoms, drug levels, or hospital stay.
- One small trial compared one dose of charcoal to syrup of ipecac. It did not show clear help or harm for either choice. It did not report on deaths, time in symptoms, drug levels, or hospital stay.
- Some trials looked at charcoal along with hospital care. Many of these used stomach wash. Stomach wash means a tube to wash out the stomach. The results still did not show clear help or harm.

Syrup of ipecac:
- One trial took place before the hospital. It looked at ipecac vs no first aid for toxic berries. It found more side effects in the ipecac group. It did not report on deaths. It did not report on symptoms, drug levels, hospital stay, or ICU stay.
- Other trials used ipecac with charcoal and a cathartic. The results did not show clear extra help.

Cathartics:
- No trial tested a cathartic by itself. So we cannot tell if a cathartic alone helps or harms.

Diluting or neutralizing the poison:
- No trials tested these steps. So we have no proof to share.

Body position:
- No trials tested this step. So we have no proof to share.

What this means for patients and families:
- We do not have strong proof that any one first aid step helps after a swallowed poison.
- We saw hints that ipecac may cause more side effects in one setting.
- We do not know if charcoal helps when used at home before the hospital.
- Most trials took place in the emergency room, not at home. This limits what we can say about home use.
- Many trials had weak design or reports. This lowers our trust in the results.

Why this matters:
Swallowed poison is a big burden. We need safe, simple steps that people can use fast. But this review could not find clear proof. We need better trials. These trials should take place before the hospital. They should report full and clear results. They should study steps that people can use at home.

What the investigators concluded:
The proof was not enough to guide first aid for swallowed poisons. We cannot say if these steps help or harm. We need more and better research in the pre-hospital setting.","First aid treatments for oral poisoning
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of first aid treatments for poisoning that could be feasibly given by people who are not health professionals. 
Background 
Many first aid treatments are recommended for treating people who have ingested poisonous substances. Some treatments, such as activated charcoal (AC), bind to the poison, limiting the body's absorption of it. Others may induce vomiting (such as syrup of ipecac) or dilute or neutralize the poison (such as drinking water, milk or juices). Adjusting the person's body position may also have an effect. 
Study characteristics 
In December 2018 we searched for high‐quality studies (randomly dividing participants into different treatment groups) investigating treatments for poisoning that laypeople can perform. We found 24 studies with 7099 participants. All but one study took place in hospitals; the remaining one was in a home setting. 
Fourteen studies either did not specify the type of poison or studied different kinds. The others investigated overdoses of specific medicines (paracetamol, carbamazepine, antidepressant, benzodiazepine) or poisonous plants (yellow oleander or poisonous berries). 
Twenty‐one trials studied different treatments with activated charcoal: as a single dose or multiple doses, with or without other first aid treatments (a substance to speed up bowel transit), and with or without hospital treatments. Six studies compared syrup of ipecac, with or without other first aid treatments (single‐dose activated charcoal plus bowel transit enhancing substance) versus no treatment. We found no studies that investigated the neutralization or dilution of the poison or the use of certain body positions. 
Key results 
Two studies compared a single dose of activated charcoal to no treatment following poisoning with paracetamol or different kinds of poisoning. We are uncertain about the treatment's side effects, admission to intensive care or worsening of the patient, and there was no information about effects on death, symptom duration, poison uptake or hospitalization. 
One study compared a single dose of activated charcoal to ipecac in mixed types of poisoning. We are uncertain about the effect of activated charcoal compared to ipecac, on the patient's level of coma or the number of unwanted effects. There was no information about effects on death, symptom duration, poison uptake, hospitalization or intensive care admission. 
One study compared ipecac to no treatment in children who ate poisonous berries at home. There may be an increase in the number of unwanted effects for ipecac. There was no information about effects on death, poisoning symptoms, symptoms duration, poison uptake, hospitalization or intensive care admission. 
We also investigated the use of single‐dose or multi‐dose activated charcoal, with or without hospital treatment, compared to each other or no treatment. Furthermore, we investigated the added value of ipecac to single‐dose activated charcoal and the added value of adding bowel transit enhancing substances to AC. 
Certainty of the evidence 
All but one study took place in a hospital setting, which means that the results cannot be directly applied to the lay setting. Because studies did not always report the methods they used, we are uncertain about the quality of the research conduct for many. Outcomes important to patients and pre‐specified by us as important outcomes for this review were often absent or incompletely reported. Our certainty about the results of this review is mostly low to very low. Therefore future research is highly likely to change the findings. 
Conclusion 
Based on the identified evidence, we cannot draw any conclusions about the effects of any of the investigated first aid treatments in a lay setting.

Preterm infants are susceptible to hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, which may lead to adverse neurodevelopment. The use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices might help in keeping glucose levels in the normal range, and reduce the need for blood sampling. However, the use of CGM might be associated with harms in the preterm infant. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of CGM versus intermittent modalities to measure glycaemia in preterm infants 1. at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia; 2. with proven hypoglycaemia; or 3. with proven hyperglycaemia. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2021, Issue 4); PubMed; Embase; and CINAHL in April 2021. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs and quasi‐RCTs comparing the use of CGM versus intermittent modalities to measure glycaemia in preterm infants at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia; with proven hypoglycaemia; or with proven hyperglycaemia. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed the methodological quality of included trials using Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) criteria (assessing randomization, blinding, loss to follow‐up, and handling of outcome data). We evaluated treatment effects using a fixed‐effect model with risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical data and mean, standard deviation (SD), and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included four trials enrolling 300 infants in our updated review. We included one new study and excluded another previously included study (because the inclusion criteria of the review have been narrowed). We compared the use of CGM to intermittent modalities in preterm infants at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia; however, one of these trials was analyzed separately because CGM was used as a standalone device, without being coupled to a control algorithm as in the other trials. We identified no studies in preterm infants with proven hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia.  
None of the four included trials reported the neurodevelopmental outcome (i.e. the primary outcome of this review), or seizures. The effect of the use of CGM on mortality during hospitalization is uncertain (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.13; RD −0.02, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.03; 230 participants; 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes because of limitations in study design, and imprecision of estimates. One study is ongoing (estimated sample size 60 infants) and planned to be completed in 2022. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to determine if CGM affects preterm infant mortality or morbidities.  We are very uncertain of the safety of CGM and the available management algorithms, and many morbidities remain unreported. Preterm infants at risk of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia were enrolled in all four included studies. No studies have been conducted in preterm infants with proven hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. Long‐term outcomes were not reported. Events of necrotizing enterocolitis, reported in the study published in 2021, were lower in the CGM group. However, the effect of CGM on this outcome remains very uncertain. Clinical trials are required to determine the most effective CGM and glycaemic management regimens in preterm infants before larger studies can be performed to assess the efficacy of CGM for reducing mortality, morbidity, and long‐term neurodevelopmental impairments.

Do round‑the‑clock blood sugar monitors help babies born early?

Rationale
Some babies are born early. These babies can have blood sugar that is too low or too high. Swings in blood sugar can harm brain growth and learning. Doctors try to keep blood sugar in a safe range.

To check blood sugar, staff often take blood many times each day. That can be hard on small babies. A different tool is a continuous glucose monitor, or CGM. A CGM is a small sensor on the skin. It tracks blood sugar all day and night.

CGM may help keep sugar steady. It may also lower the need for many blood draws. But CGM may have risks. We do not yet know if it helps or harms babies born early.

This study looked at what we know so far. The main question was clear. Does CGM help babies born early more than off‑and‑on blood tests?

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team looked for strong studies. In these studies, babies were put into groups by chance. One group used CGM. The other group had off‑and‑on blood sugar checks.

The team searched medical libraries in April 2021. They used many sources to find trials. They looked at four trials. These four trials had 300 babies in total.

All babies were born early. They were at risk for low or high blood sugar. None had proven low or high sugar at the start. Some trials used CGM with a computer rule set to guide care. One trial used CGM alone, with no computer rule set.

The trials planned to look at death in the hospital. They also planned to look at brain and learning over time. They planned to look at seizures and other illness. But not all trials reported on these plans.

The trials did not report how long each baby stayed in the study. Ages and sex were not listed. One more trial, with 60 babies, was still going on. It was planned to end in 2022.

Results
This review did not find proof that CGM helps babies live longer. The chance of death in the hospital was not clear. The data were small in size. The results could be due to chance.

The trials did not report brain and learning results. They did not report on seizures. This means we do not know the long‑term effects of CGM in these babies. We also do not know if CGM changes how the brain grows.

Many health problems were not reported at all. One new trial from 2021 did report a gut problem. This gut problem is very serious in babies born early. It is called necrotizing enterocolitis. Fewer babies had this gut problem in the CGM group in that trial. But the team is not sure if CGM caused this. The result may not hold up in larger studies.

We also do not know how safe CGM is in this group. The trials were small. Some had design limits. This makes the results less sure. The team rated the data as very unsure.

No trial looked at babies with proven low blood sugar at the start. No trial looked at babies with proven high blood sugar at the start. So we cannot say if CGM helps those babies.

What does this mean for care today? CGM may help some babies. It may also help nurses and doctors track sugar in real time. It could reduce blood draws. But we do not have solid proof yet.

The key message is simple. We need more good trials. These trials should be larger and well planned. They should test CGM and the best ways to use it. They should track brain and learning over time. They should report safety and all key health problems.

Until we have that proof, we cannot say that CGM helps or harms. Parents and care teams should talk about the possible pros and cons. They should make choices based on each baby’s needs. As new trials finish, we will learn more. This can guide safer and better care for babies born early.","Devices to continuously monitor sugar (glucose) levels in the blood in newborns born preterm 
Review questions 
What are the benefits and harms of the use of subcutaneous (under the skin) sensors for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with or without an algorithm (a set of mathematical rules) to correct too high or too low ​​​​​ levels of blood glucose versus intermittent modalities to measure blood glucose with or without an algorithm to guide the correction of too high or too low blood glucose in preterm infants 1. at risk of too high or too low ​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose; 2. with proven too low ​​​​​​levels of blood glucose; and 3. with proven too high​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose? 
Background 
Newborns born too early ('preterm') are susceptible to levels of blood glucose that are too high or too low. Most preterm babies with these abnormal concentrations  have a full recovery, or only mild problems. For some preterm babies with extremely high or low (or more prolonged) blood glucose, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. 
The aim of this updated review was to assess whether the use of CGM could improve the long‐term development or reduce deaths in preterm newborns. CGM devices are inserted subcutaneously, and provide data on blood glucose in real time. The standard method of measuring blood glucose consists of measuring blood glucose concentrations intermittently by  withdrawing small amounts of blood, often by heel pricks.  
Study characteristicsWe collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer the review question, and found four studies enrolling 300 babies. These studies compared the use of CGM to intermittent measurements in infants at risk of too high or too low ​​​​​​ levels of blood glucose. 
Key results 
None of the four included studies reported on the long‐term neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants. The studies were too small to determine if CGM has an effect on survival. One study is ongoing. Although one study published in 2021 reported the incidence of serious intestinal injury (necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious inflammation of the intestines that can be life threatening) was lower in the CGM group, this finding is very uncertain because the results were very imprecise.  Further research is needed. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was very low due to the overall limited number of studies, with few babies enrolled. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies that were available up to 1 April 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013357.pub2,"Background
Each year, in high‐income countries alone, approximately 100 million people develop scars. Excessive scarring can cause pruritus, pain, contractures, and cosmetic disfigurement, and can dramatically affect people's quality of life, both physically and psychologically. Hypertrophic scars are visible and elevated scars that do not spread into surrounding tissues and that often regress spontaneously. Silicone gel sheeting (SGS) is made from medical‐grade silicone reinforced with a silicone membrane backing and is one of the most commonly used treatments for hypertrophic scars. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of silicone gel sheeting for the treatment of hypertrophic scars in any care setting. 
Search methods
In April 2021 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with any hypertrophic scars and assessed the use of SGS. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, data extraction and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. We resolved initial disagreements by discussion, or by consulting a third review author when necessary. 
Main results
Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 10 to 60 participants. The trials were clinically heterogeneous with differences in duration of follow‐up, and scar site. We report 10 comparisons, SGS compared with no SGS treatment and SGS compared with the following treatments: pressure garments; silicone gel; topical onion extract; polyurethane; propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting; Kenalog injection; flashlamp‐pumped pulsed‐dye laser; intense pulsed light  and Gecko Nanoplast (a silicone gel bandage). Six trials had a split‐site design and three trials had an unclear design (resulting in a mix of paired and clustered data). 
Included studies reported limited outcome data for the primary review outcomes of severity of scarring measured by health professionals and adverse events (limited data reported by some included studies, but further analyses of these data was not possible) and no data were reported for severity of scarring reported by patients. For secondary outcomes some pain data were reported, but health‐related quality of life and cost effectiveness were not reported. Many trials had poorly‐reported methodology, meaning the risk of bias was unclear. We rated all evidence as being either of low or very low certainty, often because of imprecision resulting from few participants, low event rates, or both, all in single studies. 
SGS compared with no SGS 
Seven studies with 177 participants compared SGS with no SGS for hypertrophic scars. Two studies with 31 participants (32 scars) reported severity of scarring assessed by health professionals, and it is uncertain whether there is a difference in severity of scarring between the two groups (mean difference (MD) ‐1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.77 to 0.12; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and twice for serious imprecision). One study with 34 participants suggests SGS may result in a slight reduction in pain level compared with no SGS treatment (MD −1.26, 95% CI −2.26 to −0.26; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
SGS compared with pressure garments 
One study with 54 participants was included in this comparison. The study reported that SGS may reduce pain levels compared with pressure garments (MD −1.90, 95% CI −2.99 to −0.81;  low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
SGS compared with silicone gel 
One study with 32 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on severity of scarring assessed by health professionals compared with silicone gel (MD 0.40, 95% CI −0.88 to 1.68; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, twice for imprecision). 
SGS compared with topical onion extract 
One trial (32 participants) was included in this comparison. SGS may slightly reduce severity of scarring compared with topical onion extract (MD ‐1.30, 95% CI ‐2.58 to ‐0.02; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and once for imprecision). 
SGS compared with polyurethane 
One study with 60 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on the severity of scarring assessed by health professionals compared with polyurethane (MD 0.50, 95% CI ‐2.96 to 3.96; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and twice for imprecision). 
SGS compared with self‐adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting 
One study with 38 participants was included in this comparison. It is uncertain if SGS reduces pain compared with self‐adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting (MD −0.12, 95% CI −0.18 to −0.06). This is very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for imprecision and once for indirectness. 
SGS compared with Gecko Nanoplast 
One study with 60 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on pain compared with Gecko Nanoplast (MD 0.70, 95% CI  ‐0.28 to 1.68; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. 
There was a lack of reportable data from the other three comparisons of SGS with Kenalog injection, flashlamp‐pumped pulsed‐dye laser or intense pulsed light. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently limited rigorous RCT evidence available about the clinical effectiveness of SGS in the treatment of hypertrophic scars. None of the included studies provided evidence on severity of scarring validated by participants, health‐related quality of life, or cost effectiveness. Reporting was poor, to the extent that we are not confident that most trials are free from risk of bias. The limitations in current RCT evidence suggest that further trials are required to reduce uncertainty around decision‐making in the use of SGS to treat hypertrophic scars.

Do silicone gel sheets help raised scars heal and feel better?

Rationale
Many people get scars each year. Some scars grow thick and raised. Doctors call these hypertrophic scars. These scars can itch. They can hurt. They can pull the skin tight. They can also change how a person looks and feels.

Raised scars can make daily life hard. Clothes may rub and hurt the skin. Joints may feel stiff. People may feel shy or sad. Because of this, safe care that helps is very important.

One common care is silicone gel sheeting. These are soft pads made of medical silicone. You place them on the scar. Many people use them for new or old raised scars.

This study asked a clear question. Do silicone gel sheets help raised scars look and feel better than other care? The team hoped to find proof that the sheets work. They also looked for any harms.

Trial Design
This was a review of clinical trials. In these trials, people were put into groups by chance. Some used silicone gel sheets. Others used no sheet or used a different care. The team looked for all trials up to April 2021.

The review found 13 trials. Each trial had 10 to 60 people. All people had raised scars. The scar sites were not the same across trials. How long people stayed in a trial was not always clear.

Some trials used a split design. This means one person tried two types of care. For example, one area used a sheet. Another area did not. This helps compare care within the same person.

The trials looked at how scars looked to a health worker. Some asked about pain. No trial asked patients to rate how the scar looked. No trial looked at life quality. No trial looked at cost. Few trials wrote much about side effects.

Results
What do the results show? The proof was weak or very weak. Many trials were small. How they ran the trials was not always clear. This makes us less sure about the results.

Sheets vs no sheets: Seven trials with 177 people looked at this. Two small trials asked a health worker to rate the scar look. We cannot tell if sheets made the scar look better. One trial with 34 people found less pain with sheets. The drop in pain was small.

Sheets vs pressure clothes: One trial with 54 people looked at this. The sheet group had less pain. The drop in pain was larger than with pressure clothes. We do not know about scar look in this trial.

Sheets vs silicone gel (no sheet): One trial with 32 people looked at this. We do not know if sheets helped the scar look more than gel. The results did not show a clear win for either care.

Sheets vs onion extract gel: One trial with 32 people looked at this. Sheets may help the scar look a bit better than onion gel. The size of the gain was small.

Sheets vs polyurethane: One trial with 60 people looked at this. We do not know if sheets helped more than this other sheet. The results were not clear.

Sheets vs propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheets: One trial with 38 people looked at this. We are not sure if pain was lower with silicone sheets. The results were not clear.

Sheets vs a silicone bandage called Gecko Nanoplast: One trial with 60 people looked at this. We are not sure if pain was better with sheets. The results were not clear.

Some trials tried other care. These were steroid shots, dye laser light, and intense pulsed light. The trials did not report enough to compare these with sheets.

Side effects were not well reported. We cannot say if sheets cause harm. No trial asked people to rate how the scar looks. No trial looked at life quality. No trial looked at cost. These are big gaps.

What does this mean for you? We cannot be sure if silicone sheets make raised scars look better. Some small trials found less pain with sheets. The pain drop was small to modest. Sheets may help more than onion gel for how a scar looks. Sheets did not show a clear edge over plain silicone gel.

These results matter. Many people live with raised scars. They want care that helps and is easy to use. But we need better proof to guide care.

The study team had a clear view. The current proof is weak. Trials were small and not well reported. We need more and better trials. These trials should ask patients to rate the scar. They should track pain, life quality, and cost. They should also report side effects well.

In short, silicone gel sheets may help pain for some people. They might help a little with how scars look in some cases. But we still do not know for sure. Talk with your care team about what may work best for you.","Silicone gel sheeting for treating hypertrophic scars
Background 
A scar is a mark left on the skin after a wound or injury has healed, for example, after surgery or after a burn. Most scars will fade and become paler over time, but some scars may become red and raised (called hypertrophic scars). Hypertrophic scars may take several years to flatten and fade. 
Scars can be itchy, painful or unsightly, and may restrict movement. Scarring can affect people physically and emotionally, and can affect a person's well‐being. 
Treatments aim to improve a scar’s appearance and help to make it less visible. They include: wearing clothing that fits tightly around the skin (pressure garments); treatments applied to the scar; laser therapy and silicone gel sheets. 
Silicone gel sheets are soft wound dressings containing an elastic form of silicone. They have a soft, rubbery texture and stick to the skin. They are commonly used on healing skin to help soften and flatten a hypertrophic scar. 
What did we want to find out? 
In this Cochrane Review, we wanted to find out how well silicone gel sheets worked in treating hypertrophic scars. 
Our methods 
We searched for studies that investigated the use of silicone gel sheets to treat hypertrophic scars. We searched for randomised controlled trials only, in which the treatment each person receives is chosen at random. These studies give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
What we found 
We found 13 studies with 468 people (425 of them completed the study) with hypertrophic scars caused by surgery, injury, burns or scalding. The studies compared the effects of silicone gel sheets with: giving no treatment with silicone gel sheets; wearing pressure garments; applying silicone gel or onion extract; polyurethane dressings; steroid injections;  laser therapy; intense pulsed light or Gecko Nanoplast (a silicone gel bandage). 
All studies were conducted in hospitals, in Europe (6 studies), China (2), the USA (1), Canada (1), Iran (1), Turkey (1) and India (1). They lasted for different lengths of time: from 3 months to 12 months. 
Four studies reported assessments of scars by healthcare professionals in way that was usable for this review. No studies reported useful results for the person's own assessment of their scar after treatment. 
No studies reported useful results for people's well‐being (quality of life): for whether people stayed on the treatment (adherence), whether the treatments had any unwanted effects; or whether the treatments were cost‐effective (the benefits of treatment outweighed any extra costs). 
The studies did not give enough information to compare silicone gel sheets with steroid injections, laser therapy or pulsed light. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Silicone gel sheets may slightly improve the appearance of hypertrophic scars compared with onion extract.  We are uncertain whether silicone gel sheets improve a scar's appearance better than no treatment with silicone gel sheets, or silicone gel, or polyurethane.  
Silicone gel sheets may reduce pain levels compared with pressure garments. Silicone gel sheets may also result in a slight reduction in pain levels compared with no treatment with silicone gel sheets. We are uncertain whether silicone gel sheets decrease pain compared with self‐adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting.  The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of silicone gel sheets on pain compared with Gecko Nanoplast. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence was low, or very low. The evidence we found comes from a few studies (sometimes only one), often in small numbers of people, with poorly reported results, so we are not sure how reliable the results are. We therefore think our conclusions would be likely to change if results from further studies become available. 
Conclusions 
We are uncertain about whether silicone gel sheets work better than most other treatments for hypertrophic scars. Silicone gel sheets may improve the appearance of scars slightly compared with applying onion extract, and may reduce pain compared with no treatment with silicone gel sheets or pressure garments.

10.1002-14651858.CD011716.pub2,"Use of oxygen during activities for people with lung scarring conditions
Review question 
Should oxygen be used for people with lung scarring conditions, known as interstitial lung disease (ILD), whose oxygen levels drop when they exercise? 
Background 
Many people with ILD have a drop in their oxygen levels when they are moving about. This is because of their lung scarring. Oxygen can be given, to be used only when people are moving about, to prevent this drop. This is called ambulatory oxygen. This may help to improve symptoms of breathlessness and their ability to exercise. It may also improve their quality of life. This Cochrane review examined the evidence for any effect of ambulatory oxygen on the ability to exercise, breathlessness and quality of life. Cochrane researchers searched the available evidence up to 4th May 2016. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We included only three studies, which had a total of 98 participants with ILD. All three studies compared the effects of both oxygen and air in all participants while they did an exercise test, while preventing them from knowing which treatment they were being given. Two studies showed no helpful effects on the ability to exercise or on symptoms of breathlessness. One study showed that participants could exercise for longer with oxygen. None of these studies looked at the effect of oxygen on quality of life, survival, the cost of oxygen treatment or its effects on hospital admissions. No adverse events were reported in any of the studies. 
We also looked for studies of oxygen given after exercise in people with ILD (""short burst oxygen""), but did not find any studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
There were some problems with the way these studies were conducted. The included studies were small. Also, two studies did not make sure that the amount of oxygen given was enough to prevent a drop in oxygen levels when the participants were exercising. This could mean that they were not given enough oxygen. The overall quality of evidence in this review was low. 
Conclusions 
We cannot tell from these studies if ambulatory oxygen is helpful in people with ILD. More research is needed, which should look at the effect of ambulatory oxygen on exercise, breathlessness and also on quality of life in people with ILD.

Using oxygen while moving for people with lung scarring

Rationale
Lung scarring disease can make it hard to breathe. Doctors call this interstitial lung disease, or ILD. With ILD, the lungs get stiff and thick. This makes it hard for oxygen to get into the blood.

Many people with ILD feel more short of breath when they move. When they walk or climb, their blood oxygen level can drop. Low oxygen can cause breathlessness and tired legs. It can make daily tasks hard.

Oxygen used only while moving may help. This is called ambulatory oxygen. It means you use oxygen when you walk or do other tasks. The goal is to keep your oxygen level from falling during effort.

The team asked a clear question. Does oxygen used during activity help people with ILD? They wanted to learn if it helps people walk longer or feel less breathless. They also hoped to learn if it helps daily life.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team looked for all good trials on this topic. The search covered studies up to early May of 2016. They looked for tests of oxygen used during activity.

They found three small trials. In total, 98 adults with ILD took part. All people had a drop in oxygen when they moved. Each trial tested people during exercise in a clinic.

In all three trials, people tried two things during an exercise test. They used oxygen on one test. They used room air on another test. They did not know which one they got at each test. This helps make fair tests.

The trials checked short term effects only. They looked at how far or how long people could exercise. They also asked about breathlessness during the test. The trials did not follow people over months or years.

Results
The review found mixed results. Two trials did not find a clear benefit. In those two trials, oxygen did not help people exercise longer. It also did not ease breathlessness during the test.

One trial did find a benefit. In that trial, people could exercise longer when they used oxygen. This means some people may feel or do better with oxygen during effort. But we cannot be sure for all people with ILD.

No trial looked at daily life. So we do not know if oxygen used during activity helps people feel or live better day to day. No trial looked at life span. No trial looked at cost. No trial looked at stays in the hospital.

No trial reported harm from oxygen used this way. People did not have side effects in these tests. But the trials were small. Rare harms could be missed in small groups.

The team also looked at oxygen used after exercise. This is “short burst oxygen.” They did not find any trials on that. So we do not know if oxygen used after effort can help people with ILD.

The quality of the proof was low. The trials were small. Two trials may not have given enough oxygen to stop the drop in oxygen level. If not enough oxygen was used, the oxygen could not show a benefit. This makes it hard to judge the true effect.

What does this mean for patients?
Oxygen used when you move may help some people. One small trial showed longer exercise time with oxygen. But two other trials did not show a clear gain. We do not yet know who is most likely to benefit.

We also do not know the long term effects. These trials did not test daily life, mood, or sleep. They did not test if oxygen used this way helps people stay out of the hospital. They did not test if it helps people live longer.

More and better trials are needed. Future trials should make sure people get enough oxygen during effort. They should test results that matter day to day. These include how people feel, how far they can walk at home, and how easy it is to do chores. They should also look at cost and any harms.

In short, we cannot say for sure if oxygen used during activity helps people with lung scarring. It may help some people exercise longer. But we need stronger proof. If you have ILD, talk with your care team. Ask if a test on oxygen during a walk could help guide your plan. A simple walk test with and without oxygen may show what is right for you.","Use of oxygen during activities for people with lung scarring conditions

10.1002-14651858.CD011636.pub2,"The use of the anticoagulant antithrombin to reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain) in very preterm infants 
Review question: Does antithrombin reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain) and mortality in very preterm infants? 
Background: Antithrombin is a drug that modulates blood coagulation together with other factors. Very low birth weight newborn infants (i.e. those neonates with a gestational age less than 32 weeks) have low level of antithrombin in the blood. On the basis of an observational study in very preterm infants, it has been suggested that the administration of drugs that prevent clotting (anticoagulants) such as antithrombin may reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage and progression of intraventricular hemorrhage, a frequent complication of preterm neonates. This systematic review synthesizes the available evidence on the effectiveness of antithrombin in preventing intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm neonates. 
Study characteristics: We included two trials for a total of 182 newborn infants comparing antithrombin with placebo (sugar or albumin solution). 
Results: The use of antithrombin does not reduce the risks of bleeding in the brain, mortality or any other relevant outcomes in very preterm neonates when compared to placebo. However, the data collected are too limited to draw definitive conclusions on the use of antithrombin in the prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain). 
Conclusions: The results of this systematic review are consistent with either a benefit or a detrimental effect of antithrombin and do not provide a definitive answer to the review question.

Can the drug antithrombin lower brain bleeds in very early babies?

Rationale
Some babies are born very early. This is before 32 weeks of the pregnancy. These babies are small and very frail. They face many health risks.

One big risk is a brain bleed. Doctors call this an intraventricular hemorrhage. A brain bleed can harm the baby’s brain. It can lead to long term problems.

Blood has parts that help it clot and stop leaks. In very early babies, these parts can be low. One of these parts is called antithrombin. Low antithrombin may raise the chance of clots in tiny brain blood tubes. Clots can then lead to a bleed.

Antithrombin is also the name of a drug. It acts like a blood thinner. It may help stop clots from forming. Some think this could help lower brain bleeds.

Past notes on babies gave a hint of benefit. But notes like that can be hard to trust. We need trials that test the drug in a fair way. We need to know if the drug helps or harms.

This study asks a clear question. Does antithrombin lower brain bleeds or deaths in very early babies? It also asks if it helps other key health results. The team looked for the best proof to date.

Trial Design
This is a review of trials. A review pulls and sums up past trial results. It looks at all the trials it can find. It checks how the drug worked across them.

The team found two trials. They looked at a total of 182 babies. All babies were very preterm. They were born before 32 weeks. They had very low birth weight.

In these trials, some babies got antithrombin. Other babies got a dummy drug. The dummy drug was sugar water or a protein fluid. This is called a placebo.

The trials then watched the babies. They looked for brain bleeds. They also looked at death and other health results. They asked if the drug helped or hurt.

The abstract did not list how long each baby stayed in the trial. It did not list the sex of the babies. It did not give more study site or time line facts. The review still summed up the main results.

Results
The review found no clear help from antithrombin. It did not lower brain bleeds. It did not lower deaths. It did not help other key health results.

This means the drug did not show a clear gain. The results were close in both groups. The babies who got the drug did no better than those who did not. The drug also had no clear harm shown. But the proof is not strong.

Why is the proof not strong? The trials were few and small. Only two trials were found. They had 182 babies in all. Small trials can miss real help or real harm.

So, what does this mean for your baby? Right now, antithrombin is not shown to help. It did not cut brain bleeds in these trials. It did not cut deaths. We cannot say it helps other results. We also cannot rule out harm.

This review is key for care teams. It sums up the best proof to date. It shows that this drug does not have clear benefit. It warns that we do not yet have a sure answer. Care teams should use care with this drug.

What should come next? Larger and better trials may help. They should enroll more babies. They should track clear health results. They should watch for side effects. This can give a sure answer.

In the meantime, talk with your care team. Ask how they plan to lower brain bleeds. Many steps can help. These may include gentle care in the NICU. They may include careful fluids and blood checks. Your team can guide you.

In short, here is the take home point. Two small trials in very early babies tested antithrombin. The drug did not lower brain bleeds or deaths. It did not help other key results. The proof is too small to be sure. The drug could help or harm. We need more and larger trials.

This review gives a fair view of what we know now. It helps families and teams weigh choices. It shows where we need more study. For now, antithrombin is not a proven way to stop brain bleeds in very early babies.","The use of the anticoagulant antithrombin to reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (i.e. bleeding in the brain) in very preterm infants

10.1002-14651858.CD013424.pub2,"Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis and is more prevalent among people with CKD than among people who do not have CKD. Although several drugs have been used to effectively treat osteoporosis in the general population, it is unclear whether they are also effective and safe for people with CKD, who have altered systemic mineral and bone metabolism. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for osteoporosis in patients with CKD stages 3‐5, and those undergoing dialysis (5D). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 January 2021 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing any anti‐osteoporotic drugs with a placebo, no treatment or usual care in patients with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3 to 5D were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed their quality using the risk of bias tool, and extracted data. The main outcomes were the incidence of fracture at any sites; mean change in the bone mineral density (BMD; measured using dual‐energy radiographic absorptiometry (DXA)) of the femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine, and distal radius; death from all causes; incidence of adverse events; and quality of life (QoL). Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
Main results
Seven studies involving 9164 randomised participants with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3 to 5D met the inclusion criteria; all participants were postmenopausal women. Five studies included patients with CKD stages 3‐4, and two studies included patients with CKD stages 5 or 5D. Five pharmacological interventions were identified (abaloparatide, alendronate, denosumab, raloxifene, and teriparatide). All studies were judged to be at an overall high risk of bias. 
Among patients with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.69; low certainty evidence). Anti‐osteoporotic drugs probably makes little or no difference to the risk of clinical fracture (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.05; moderate certainty evidence) and adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00; moderate certainty evidence). We were unable to incorporate studies into the meta‐analyses for BMD at the femoral neck, lumbar spine and total hip as they only reported the percentage change in the BMD in the intervention group. 
Among patients with severe CKD stages 5 or 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.87; very low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improves the BMD at the femoral neck because the certainty of this evidence is very low (MD 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.02). Anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve the BMD at the lumbar spine (MD 0.03, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.04, low certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported in the included studies. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of death (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.56; very low certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Among patients with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture in low certainty evidence. Anti‐osteoporotic drugs make little or no difference to the risk of clinical fracture and adverse events in moderate certainty evidence. Among patients with CKD stages 5 and 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture and death because the certainty of this evidence is very low. Anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve the BMD at the lumbar spine in low certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improves the BMD at the femoral neck because the certainty of this evidence is very low. Larger studies including men, paediatric patients or individuals with unstable CKD‐mineral and bone disorder are required to assess the effect of each anti‐osteoporotic drug at each stage of CKD.

Do bone drugs help people with long-term kidney disease?

Rationale
Long-term kidney disease can weaken bones. Weak bones can break more easily. A break can cause pain, loss of movement, and worry. It can also harm day to day life.

Many bone drugs help people without kidney disease. But kidney disease changes minerals in the body. These changes may affect how bone drugs work and how safe they are. Doctors want to know if these drugs help people with kidney disease.

This study looked at people with kidney disease and thin bones. Thin bones are also called osteoporosis. The goal was to learn if bone drugs lower breaks and make bones stronger. The team also checked if the drugs are safe.

Bone drugs in this review work in two ways. Some slow bone loss. Some help the body build new bone. This can raise bone strength on a bone scan.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. It pulled together seven strong studies. In these studies, people got a drug or no drug by chance. This type of study is called a randomized study. This helps give fair results.

All seven studies looked at adults with kidney disease and thin bones. All were women after menopause. No men or children were in these studies. People had kidney disease stages 3 to 5. Some were on dialysis.

The review looked at five drugs: abaloparatide, alendronate, denosumab, raloxifene, and teriparatide. The team looked for bone breaks. They also looked at bone strength on a scan. They checked for side effects and deaths.

The time in each study was not clear in this summary. The review did not say how long each person stayed in a study. The review used careful search steps to find studies. Even so, study methods had limits.

Results
The seven studies had 9,164 women in total. Many had kidney disease in stages 3 or 4. A smaller number had very bad kidney disease, stage 5, or were on dialysis.

For stages 3 and 4, bone drugs may lower the chance of spine bone breaks. They did not seem to change the chance of other breaks you feel in daily life. Side effects were about the same with a drug or no drug. We are somewhat sure of these points.

The review could not join the results for hip or spine bone scans in these stages. Some studies only gave percent change within one group. This means we cannot tell how much stronger the bones got compared to no drug. We need clearer reports.

For stage 5 or for people on dialysis, the picture is not clear. We do not know if bone drugs cut the chance of breaks that you feel. We also do not know if the drugs change the chance of death. There were few people in these groups.

In stage 5 or on dialysis, spine bone strength on a scan may rise a small amount. Hip bone strength did not show a clear change. No side effects were reported in the studies for these groups. But the data were small, so we are not sure.

What does this mean for patients?
If you have kidney disease in stages 3 or 4, a bone drug may help the spine. It may not lower other breaks that happen in daily life. Side effects may be similar to no drug. Talk with your kidney and bone care teams about your risks and goals.

If you have stage 5 disease or are on dialysis, we do not know enough yet. The drugs may help spine bone scans a little. But we do not know if they lower breaks or help you live longer. Your care team can help weigh choices for you.

Why is this study important?
Bone breaks are a big problem in kidney disease. They can cause pain and harm your life. This review brings together the best data we have so far. It shows where bone drugs may help and where we still lack proof.

What are the limits?
All the people in these studies were women after menopause. We need studies in men and in children. We also need larger and longer studies. We need studies in people with more complex bone and mineral issues from kidney disease.

Conclusions from the investigators
For stages 3 and 4, bone drugs may lower spine breaks. They may not change other breaks or side effects. For stage 5 and for dialysis, we do not know if these drugs prevent breaks or death. Spine bone scans may improve a little. Better and larger studies are needed to guide care for all people with kidney disease.","Pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis in patients with chronic kidney disease
What is the issue?Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of osteoporosis (weakened bone strength), which can often lead to bone fracture. Several drugs are available for the treatment of osteoporosis; however, it is unknown whether these drugs are equally effective and safe in patients with CKD because bone strength impairment in these patients occurs via a different mechanism. 
What did we do?Data were collected from studies including patients with osteoporosis and CKD stages 3‐5, and those undergoing dialysis (stage 5D) with data available on fracture, change in the bone mineral density (BMD; a bone strength index), and adverse events. We included seven studies with available evidence up to 25 January 2021, comparing anti‐osteoporotic drugs (abaloparatide, alendronate, denosumab, raloxifene, and teriparatide) with placebo (a dummy drug), in 9,164 postmenopausal women. We performed a meta‐analysis to assess the effects of these anti‐osteoporotic drugs. 
What did we find?In postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce vertebral fracture in low certainty evidence. Anti‐osteoporotic drugs probably make little or no difference to clinical fracture and adverse events in moderate certainty evidence. In postmenopausal with CKD stages 5 or 5D, it is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug reduces the risk of clinical fracture and death, and anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve BMD at the lumbar spine in low certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether anti‐osteoporotic drug improve BMD at the femoral neck. 
ConclusionsAmong postmenopausal women with CKD stages 3‐4, anti‐osteoporotic drugs may reduce the risk of vertebral fracture. Among patients with CKD stages 5 and 5D, anti‐osteoporotic drug may slightly improve bone strength. However, these conclusions are based on limited data and therefore uncertain.

10.1002-14651858.CD011749.pub2,"Medicines to treat delirium in critically ill adult patients
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence from randomized controlled trials for the benefits and safety of all prescription medicines used to treat critically ill adult patients with delirium in the intensive care units (ICUs) of hospitals. 
Background 
Delirium is commonly associated with surgery, infection, or critical illness. It is experienced as new‐onset, generally short‐term inability to think clearly. Patients with delirium shift between periods of clear thinking and periods of agitation and/or great sleepiness and confusion. Lack of sleep, pain, a noisy environment, physical restraint, and the use of sedatives and strong analgesics are some of the contributing factors. Delirium affects both immediate and longer‐term health outcomes of critically ill patients as it can increase the length of time a breathing machine is required, time spent in the ICU and in hospital, and the chance of functional weakening and death. The odds of a poor outcome with delirium are increased with frail patients and those of advanced age and already present cognitive difficulties. Frequently, delirious ICU patients are given medicines to help treat symptoms such as agitation. 
Study characteristics 
This review is current to 21 March 2019. We found 14 randomized controlled studies that enrolled a total of 1844 adult participants. Six different classes of medicines were tested. These were antipsychotic drugs used as tranquillizers in ten studies; the sedative alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine in three studies; statins that reduce cholesterol in two studies; opioids as part of pain management in one study; serotonin antagonists for nausea and vomiting in one study; and cholinesterase inhibitors, which are medicines for Alzheimer's disease, in one study. Ten studies compared medicine to placebo ‐ an inactive medicine also known as a sugar pill; four studies compared different drugs. Eleven studies with 1153 participants reported on the main outcome of this review ‐ duration of delirium. 
Key findings 
When drug classes were directly compared with placebo, only the alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine was found to reduce the duration of delirium, and the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine was found to prolong the duration of delirium. Each of these results is based on findings from a single small study. The other drugs when compared to placebo did not change delirium duration. The Review authors used the statistical method of network meta‐analysis to compare the six different drug classes. Dexmedetomidine was ranked most effective in reducing delirium duration, followed by atypical antipsychotics. However, network meta‐analysis of delirium duration failed to rule out the possibility of no difference for all six drug classes compared to placebo. Using this method, we did not find that any drug improved the duration of coma, length of stay, long‐term cognitive outcomes, or death. The alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine shortened time spent on a breathing machine. Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or were rare when reported. An analysis of reported events showed that events were similar to those reported with placebo. We found 10 ongoing studies and six studies awaiting classification that, once published and assessed, may change the conclusions of this review. 
Quality of the evidence 
Most of the included studies were small but of good design. Nine of the 14 studies were considered to have low risk of bias.

Which medicines help treat sudden confusion in very sick adults in the ICU?

Rationale
Many very sick adults in the ICU can get delirium. Delirium is a sudden change in thinking. It can come and go. People may feel very sleepy, very upset, or very confused.

Delirium can follow surgery, infection, or severe illness. Noise, poor sleep, pain, and some drugs can add to it. These include sleep drugs and strong pain drugs. Restraints can also add to it.

Delirium can lead to worse health. People may need a breathing machine for longer. They may stay longer in the ICU and hospital. They may get weak. The risk of death can rise.

Many ICU teams use drugs to calm delirium. But we do not know which drugs truly help. We wanted to see which drugs shorten delirium. We also wanted to learn about side effects. This review may guide care and help avoid harm.

Trial Design
We reviewed randomized trials. These trials compare a drug to a dummy pill or to another drug. We looked for all trials up to March 21, 2019. We found 14 trials. They enrolled 1,844 adults with delirium in ICUs.

The trials tested six types of drugs. One type was antipsychotic drugs. These drugs treat severe agitation and some mental illness. Ten trials tested these drugs. A sedative drug called dexmedetomidine was in three trials. It helps ease anxiety and pain.

Two trials tested statins. These drugs lower cholesterol. One trial tested opioids. These are pain drugs. One trial tested serotonin blockers. These drugs treat nausea and vomiting. One trial tested rivastigmine. It is a drug for memory loss.

Ten trials compared a drug with a placebo. A placebo is a dummy pill with no drug. Four trials compared one drug to another. Eleven trials, with 1,153 people, reported how long delirium lasted.

Other outcomes also mattered. These included time in coma. A coma is a deep sleep you cannot wake from. They also tracked time on a breathing machine. They tracked time in the ICU and the hospital. They looked at thinking later on and death.

Each trial had its own schedule. Most tracked people during their ICU and hospital stay. The exact time in each trial was not the same. All trials were in adult ICU patients with delirium.

Results
Only one drug, dexmedetomidine, reduced how long delirium lasted. This was seen when compared to a placebo. This finding came from one small trial. One drug made delirium last longer. That drug was rivastigmine. It is a drug for memory loss. This also came from one small trial.

The other drugs did not change delirium length when compared to placebo. We also used a method to compare all drugs at once. In that view, dexmedetomidine ranked best. Atypical antipsychotic drugs ranked next. But this method could not rule out no real drug benefit.

No drug made coma time shorter. No drug cut ICU days or hospital days. No drug improved later thinking. No drug reduced the chance of death.

Dexmedetomidine helped in one more way. It cut time on a breathing machine. This may help some ICU patients. But we still need more, larger trials to be sure.

Side effects were rare or not well reported. When reported, they were about the same as with placebo. Better side effect tracking is needed.

Most trials were small. But the trial design was good in many. Nine of the 14 trials had a low chance of bias. That means the methods were sound.

More data are on the way. We found 10 trials still in progress. We also found six trials not yet fully rated. These new results may change what we know.

What does this mean for patients and families? Today, no drug clearly cures delirium. One sedative, dexmedetomidine, may help shorten delirium. It may also shorten time on a breathing machine. One memory drug, rivastigmine, may make delirium last longer. For now, care teams should use care when they choose drugs.

Delirium is complex. Many things can add to it, like pain, noise, and poor sleep. Calm care and close watch still matter. New trials will help guide better care. We will update these findings when those trials report.","Medicines to treat delirium in critically ill adult patients

10.1002-14651858.CD013458.pub2,"An overview of systematic reviews on mental health interventions for involuntary migrants
Refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons are involuntary migrants, who have often experienced distress when forced to leave their home, on the journey, and in the process of settling in a host country or new environment. Mental health promotion, prevention, and treatments for mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and post‐traumatic stress disorder may work differently in these groups of people than for the general population. This overview of systematic reviews summarises the characteristics of reviews available on this topic, to help us determine which research questions are the most important to address in future Cochrane reviews. 
We searched for systematic reviews and protocols of systematic reviews on mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental health problems for refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Mental health promotion may, for example, involve a classroom‐based well‐being intervention for children. An example of prevention is trauma‐focused therapy to prevent post‐traumatic stress disorder. Treatment may, for example, include psychological therapy for depression. We found 23 systematic reviews and 15 protocols of reviews in progress. Together the 23 published systematic reviews included 336 references, 175 of which were unique studies. Reviews more commonly included refugees and asylum seekers than internally displaced persons, and were more frequently focused on adults than children. There was more attention on the treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder than there was for mental health promotion or prevention, or for the treatment of depression or anxiety. Studies of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, and integrative and interpersonal therapies were most likely to be included in reviews. 
The quality of reviews was limited by a range of issues, many of which related to poor reporting of the review methodology. 
The evidence available from systematic reviews may not match the need for evidence‐based interventions for the mental health of involuntary migrants. Review authors should consider relevant groups such as internally displaced persons, children, and people with depression or anxiety, and relevant interventions such as those for mental health promotion or prevention, and treatments other than psychological therapy.

Mental health help for people forced to flee: what we know

Rationale
Many people must leave home due to war, hate, or disaster. These people include refugees, asylum seekers, and people forced to move inside their own country. They face stress at home, on the road, and in a new place. This stress can harm the mind and body.

Common mental health problems include low mood, fear, and stress after trauma. Low mood is also called depression. Ongoing fear is also called anxiety. Post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is a strong stress reaction after a scary event.

Usual care may not work the same for these groups. They may have many losses and new stress. They may face money and legal issues. They may also face harm or bias in a new land. We need to know what help works best for them.

This project summed up what past studies have found. It looked at three kinds of help. Mental health promotion builds well-being. Prevention tries to stop problems before they start. Treatment helps when a problem is there.

Promotion can include school well-being classes for kids. Prevention can include help that deals with trauma, so PTSD does not form. Treatment can include talk therapy for low mood or fear. These kinds of help may fit this group’s needs.

Trial Design
This was not a new test with patients. It was an “overview of reviews.” A review sums up many studies using set rules. A “systematic review” is a review that follows strict steps. A “protocol” is a plan for a review that is not done yet.

The team looked for reviews on care for refugees, asylum seekers, and people who moved inside their own land. They searched for promotion, prevention, and treatment for the mind. They looked for reviews and for review plans.

They found 23 systematic reviews and 15 review plans. The 23 reviews listed 336 study reports. Of these, 175 were unique studies. This means some reports were repeat items across reviews.

Most reviews looked at refugees and asylum seekers. Fewer looked at people who moved inside their own land. Most reviews focused on adults. Fewer focused on children.

Many reviews looked at talk therapy for PTSD. These included Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT. CBT is a kind of talk therapy. It helps people spot and change hurtful thoughts and acts.

Some reviews looked at Narrative Exposure Therapy, or NET. NET helps people tell and make sense of their life story. Some looked at integrative therapy. This blends tools from more than one therapy. Some looked at interpersonal therapy. This helps people with mood and relationships.

People did not take part in this project. The team did not give care or treatments. There were no study visits. There was no time in the study for patients.

Results
The reviews focused more on PTSD than on low mood or fear. Reviews on promotion and prevention were also fewer. Far fewer reviews looked at people who moved inside their own land. Fewer reviews looked at kids.

Many reviews had limits in how they wrote about their methods. Some did not report steps in full. When methods are not clear, results are hard to trust. This lowers the strength of what we can say.

From what we have, some talk therapies for PTSD look helpful. CBT and NET show promise for people who had trauma. Some other therapies also may help. But we still lack strong and clear proof for many groups and settings.

This work maps what we know and what we do not know. It shows where we have many studies. It also shows big gaps. We need more work on kids and on people who moved inside their own land. We need more work on low mood and fear, not just PTSD.

We also need more work on promotion and prevention. It may be best to build health and stop harm early. That may help many people at once. Schools, homes, and camps may be good sites for this work.

We should also look at more kinds of help. Many reviews only looked at talk therapy. Other help may also work. This can include group support, social aid, work aid, or ways to ease sleep. A mix of help may be best for many people.

Better methods are key. Future reviews should use clear, strong steps. They should report all steps in full. They should also include people from the groups we aim to help. This will build trust and fit with real life needs.

What does this mean for patients and families now? Some talk therapies for trauma can help. But we cannot yet say which help is best for all groups. Your care team should tailor care to your story, needs, and goals. They should also think about safety, culture, and language.

This project did not test a drug or a device. It did not give care. It summed up other work. The goal was to guide future high quality reviews. With better and broader reviews, care can be more fair and more fit for all.","An overview of systematic reviews on mental health interventions for involuntary migrants

10.1002-14651858.CD013235.pub2,"Background
Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility tests are expected to reduce the time to clinically important results of a blood culture. This might enable clinicians to better target therapy to a person's needs, and thereby, improve health outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay), and reduce unnecessary prescribing of broad‐spectrum antibiotics; thereby reducing antimicrobial resistance rates. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of rapid susceptibility testing versus standard susceptibility testing for bloodstream infections (BSIs). 
Search methods
To identify studies with selected outcomes, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, and two trials registries, between 1987 and October 2020. We used 'bloodstream infection' and 'antimicrobial susceptibility tests' as search terms. We had no language or publication status limitations. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (with a time‐to‐result of ≤ 8 hours) versus conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in people with a BSI caused by any bacteria, as identified by a positive blood culture. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references, full‐text reports of potentially relevant studies, extracted data from the studies, and assessed risk of bias. Any disagreement was discussed and resolved with a third review author. For mortality, a dichotomous outcome, we extracted the number of events in each arm, and presented a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare rapid susceptibility testing to conventional methods. We used Review Manager 5.4 to meta‐analyse the data. For other outcomes, which are time‐to‐event outcomes (time‐to‐discharge from hospital, time‐to‐first appropriate antibiotic change), we conducted qualitative narrative synthesis, due to heterogeneity of outcome measures.  
Main results
We included six trials, with 1638 participants. For rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.46; 6 RCTs, 1638 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, for rapid genotypic or molecular antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.49; 4 RCTs, 1074 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For phenotypic rapid susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups  (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.35; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
In qualitative analysis, rapid susceptibility testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐discharge (4 RCTs, 1165 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In qualitative analysis, rapid genotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (3 RCTs, 929 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, rapid phenotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may improve time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (RR ‐17.29, CI ‐45.05 to 10.47; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
Authors' conclusions
The theoretical benefits of rapid susceptibility testing have not been demonstrated to directly improve mortality, time‐to‐discharge, or time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic in these randomized studies. Future large prospective studies should be designed to focus on the most clinically meaningful outcomes, and aim to optimize blood culture pathways.

Do fast lab tests help pick the right antibiotic for blood infections?

2. Rationale
A blood stream infection means germs are in the blood. It can make people very sick. Some people die. Doctors need the right antibiotic fast.

Antibiotics are drugs that kill germs. If the drug is wrong, harm can occur. Some doctors use broad drugs at first. These kill many kinds of germs.

Broad drugs can cause other problems. They can help germs learn to resist drugs. That is called drug resistance. Then drugs may stop working in the future.

A lab test can find which drugs work. Standard tests can take more than one day. Fast tests can give results in eight hours or less. Fast tests may help start the right drug sooner.

This could save lives and shorten stays. It could also cut use of broad drugs. Less use of broad drugs may slow drug resistance. This study checked if these hopes are true.

This study asked a clear set of questions. Do fast tests help people with blood germs? Do they help doctors pick the right drug sooner? Do they help people leave the hospital sooner? Do they lower deaths?

3. Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team looked for the best type of trial. These are called randomized trials. It means people join one of two care plans by chance. One plan used fast lab tests. The other plan used standard tests.

People had a positive blood culture. That means the lab found germs in blood. The germ could be any kind of bacteria. The fast tests gave results in eight hours or less. Ages and sexes were not stated.

The team searched many sources from 1987 to 2020. They had no limits on language or where it was published. Two people checked the trials. A third person helped if they did not agree.

They found six trials. These trials had 1,638 people in total. The trials tracked death and hospital stay length. They also tracked the time to the first right drug change.

The team put the death numbers together. For the time outcomes, measures were not the same. So they told the story of those results. How long each person stayed in a trial was not clear.

Fast tests were of two kinds. Some used germ DNA. DNA is the code inside the germ. Some used how the germ grew when near drugs.

4. Results
Death rates were about the same in both groups. Fast tests did not lower deaths. This held across all six trials. We are not very sure of this, but it is the best proof we have.

The team also split the fast tests into two types. Four trials used DNA based fast tests. These DNA tests did not change deaths. Two trials used growth based fast tests. These growth tests also did not change deaths.

Time in the hospital was about the same. Four trials with 1,165 people looked at this. Fast tests may make little or no change. The proof here is weak.

Time to the first right drug change had mixed results. Three trials with 929 people looked at DNA based tests. DNA based fast tests may not help. Two trials with 564 people looked at growth based tests. Growth based fast tests may help doctors switch sooner. But we are not sure. The proof is weak and small.

What do these results mean for patients? Fast tests sound good. But the gains are not clear yet. They did not show clear help with deaths. They did not show clear help with hospital days. They did not show clear help with the first drug change.

Why might that be? Fast test results must link to smart care steps. Hospitals need good plans to act on the results. If teams do not act fast, test speed may not help. The whole care path must work well.

The review has some limits. The trials were few and small. The proof was not strong. The trials used different ways to measure time. That makes it hard to mix the results.

Here is the bottom line. Fast lab tests for blood germs did not show clear gains. In these trials, standard tests did about the same. The hoped-for help on deaths was not seen. The hoped-for help on hospital days was not seen. The hoped-for help on the first right drug change was not clear.

What should come next? New trials should be large and well run. They should test full care paths, not just the lab test. They should track the outcomes that matter most. These include death, days in the hospital, and time to the right drug. They should also look at safe use of broad drugs. This can help slow drug resistance.

For now, doctors should use careful care for each case. They should act fast on any lab result. They should avoid broad drugs when not needed. This can help people today and in the future.","Tests for identifying the most suitable antibiotics for a bacterial blood infection: are rapid tests better than standard tests? 
What is the aim of this Cochrane Review? 
People with blood infections need urgent treatment with antibiotics. Identifying the bacteria causing the infection helps ensure the right antibiotic is given. Rapid susceptibility tests are a technology to do this quickly, and aim to improve care. We sought to evaluate whether their use reduce deaths or shortens the illness. 
Key messages 
Rapid susceptibility tests to identify an appropriate antibiotic quickly for people with blood sepsis may make little to no difference to: 
· how many people die within 30 days of diagnosis of blood sepsis;
· how long people stay in hospital; 
· whether given a suitable antibiotic. 
Larger studies will help determine if using rapid susceptibility tests improves these outcomes. 
What was studied in this review? 
Susceptibility tests are done in a laboratory, and measure whether bacteria can grow when exposed to a variety of antibiotics, to assure that the antibiotics given are active against the organism causing the infection. The standard approach is to culture the blood samples, but this takes up to 36 hours to obtain a result. Rapid tests to identify bacteria causing blood infections, and their susceptibilities to antibiotics, provide results in eight hours or less. These rapid susceptibility tests include: 
· tests that look at the direct effect of antibiotics on bacteria (called phenotypic tests); and 
· tests that look for particular genes in the bacteria to see if they are susceptible, or resistant, to an antibiotic (called genotypic tests). 
What are the main results of this review? 
We found six studies that involved 1638 adults with blood infections. All studies took place in specialized medical centres in high‐income countries in Europe, the USA, and East Asia. 
Compared with standard tests, rapid susceptibility tests may make little to no difference to 
· how many people died within 30 days (evidence from six studies in 1638 people);
· how long people stayed in hospital (4 studies in 1165 people); or
· how long it took for people to be given the right antibiotic to treat the infection (5 studies in 1493 people). 
Phenotypic rapid susceptibility tests may reduce the time it takes to receive the right antibiotic; but this is uncertain (evidence from 2 studies in 564 people). 
Genotypic rapid susceptibility tests may make little or no difference to the time it takes to receive the right antibiotic (evidence from 4 studies in 1074 people). 
Our confidence in the results is limited because:
· the numbers of deaths reported in the studies were too low to show an important difference; 
· the tests used and the results from the studies varied widely;
· the studies did not include enough participants to enable firm conclusions.
Further research is likely to change these results.

Demodex blepharitis is a chronic condition commonly associated with recalcitrant dry eye symptoms though many people with Demodex mites are asymptomatic. The primary cause of this condition in humans is two types of Demodex mites: Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis. There are varying reports of the prevalence of Demodex blepharitis among adults, and it affects both men and women equally. While Demodex mites are commonly treated with tea tree oil, the effectiveness of tea tree oil for treating Demodex blepharitis is not well documented. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of tea tree oil on ocular Demodex infestation in people with Demodex blepharitis. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2019, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; LILACS; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the databases on 18 June 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared treatment with tea tree oil (or its components) versus another treatment or no treatment for people with Demodex blepharitis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts and then full text of records to determine their eligibility. The review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using Covidence. A third review author resolved any conflicts at all stages. 
Main results
We included six RCTs (1124 eyes of 562 participants; 17 to 281 participants per study) from the US, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey. The RCTs compared some formulation of tea tree oil to another treatment or no treatment. Included participants were both men and women, ranging from 39 to 55 years of age. All RCTs were assessed at unclear or high risk of bias in one or more domains. We also identified two RCTs that are ongoing or awaiting publications. 
Data from three RCTs that reported a short‐term mean change in the number of Demodex mites per eight eyelashes contributed to a meta‐analysis. We are uncertain about the mean reduction for the groups that received the tea tree oil intervention (mean difference [MD] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24 to 1.16) at four to six weeks as compared to other interventions. Only one RCT reported data for long‐term changes, which found that the group that received intense pulse light as the treatment had complete eradication of Demodex mites at three months. We graded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as very low. 
Three RCTs reported no evidence of a difference for participant reported symptoms measured on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) between the tea tree oil group and the group receiving other forms of intervention. Mean differences in these studies ranged from ‐10.54 (95% CI – 24.19, 3.11) to 3.40 (95% CI ‐0.70 7.50). We did not conduct a meta‐analysis for this outcome given substantial statistical heterogeneity and graded the certainty of the evidence as low. 
One RCT provided information concerning visual acuity but did not provide sufficient data for between‐group comparisons. The authors noted that mean habitual LogMAR visual acuity for all study participants improved post‐treatment (mean LogMAR 1.16, standard deviation 0.26 at 4 weeks). We graded the certainty of evidence for this outcome as low. No RCTs provided data on mean change in number of cylindrical dandruff or the proportion of participants experiencing conjunctival injection or experiencing meibomian gland dysfunction. 
Three RCTs provided information on adverse events. One reported no adverse events. The other two described a total of six participants randomized to treatment with tea tree oil who experienced ocular irritation or discomfort that resolved with re‐educating the patient on application techniques and continuing use of the tea tree oil. We graded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as very low. 
Authors' conclusions
The current review suggests that there is uncertainty related to the effectiveness of 5% to 50% tea tree oil for the short‐term treatment of Demodex blepharitis; however, if used, lower concentrations may be preferable in the eye care arena to avoid induced ocular irritation. Future studies should be better controlled, assess outcomes at long term (e.g. 10 to 12 weeks or beyond), account for patient compliance, and study the effects of different tea tree oil concentrations.

Tea tree oil for eyelid mites: what the research shows so far

Rationale
Some people have tiny mites that live in the eyelids. Doctors call this an eyelid mite problem, or Demodex blepharitis. It can last a long time. It may cause red, itchy lids, sore eyes, and dry eye. Many people have these mites and feel fine. But for others, they are a burden.

Many eye doctors use tea tree oil to treat these mites. Tea tree oil comes from a plant leaf. People hope it kills mites and eases symptoms. But we still need good proof that it works and is safe for the eyes. This study set out to test that.

The main idea was simple. If tea tree oil helps, people should have fewer mites. They should also feel better. Their eyes should not get worse. The study also looked at side effects. This is key, since the skin on the eyelids is thin and can sting.

Trial Design
This was a review of clinical trials. A clinical trial is a study that puts people into groups by chance. One group gets one care. The other group gets another care or no care. This helps us see what works best. Two team members checked each trial. A third person helped when they did not agree.

The team searched many health databases. They set no limits on year or language. The last search was on June 18, 2019. They found six trials from six places: the United States, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey. Two more trials were not done yet or had not shared results.

In all, 562 adults took part. The trials looked at 1,124 eyes. Men and women were both in the trials. Most people were between 39 and 55 years old. All had eyelid mites. The trials used tea tree oil in many forms and strengths. They compared it to other care or to no care.

How long were people in the trials? Most trials checked results after about four to six weeks. One trial checked again at three months. Not all trials were run the same way. Some had weak spots in how they were done. This means the results are less sure.

Results
Did tea tree oil lower the number of mites? Three trials let the team combine results. They counted the mites in eight lashes on each eye. After four to six weeks, the results were not clear. People who used tea tree oil did not have a clear drop in mites, when compared to other care. We cannot say for sure that tea tree oil helped in the short term.

Only one trial looked at the longer term. At three months, people who got a light based lid treatment had no mites. This was one small trial. So we must be careful with this finding. We cannot say this treatment works for all people.

Did people feel better? Three trials used a dry eye symptom survey. It asked about pain, light glare, and blur. People who used tea tree oil did not feel clearly better than those in other groups. The scores were close across groups. The team did not combine these data because the trials were too different.

Did vision change? One trial gave some details. On average, vision got a bit better after four weeks for all people in that trial. But the trial did not give enough data to compare groups. So we cannot say if tea tree oil helped vision.

What about other signs on the eyelid? No trial gave data on lash debris, red eye, or oil gland block. So we do not know how tea tree oil affects these signs.

What about safety? Three trials talked about side effects. One trial saw none. Two trials said a total of six people felt eye sting or discomfort. These people got tips on how to use the product. They kept using it, and the sting went away. Still, eye skin is very sensitive. Stronger forms of tea tree oil may sting more. Lower strength may be better near the eyes.

What does all this mean? The main point is this: we are not sure that tea tree oil helps eyelid mites in the short term. We are also not sure it eases symptoms more than other care. The signs of benefit were small and not clear. Safety was fair in the short term, but eye sting can occur.

Why is this study important? Many people use tea tree oil on the lids. Yet the proof that it works is weak. The trials were small and had design limits. We need better trials. They should last at least ten to twelve weeks or more. They should test different strengths. They should check how well people follow the plan. They should use the same ways to measure mites and symptoms.

In short, tea tree oil may or may not help with eyelid mites. If used, milder forms may be safer on the lids. Talk with your eye doctor about what is best for you. More high quality research will help guide care in the future.","Tea tree oil for Demodex blepharitis
What was the aim of this review?To examine the effects of tea tree oil, an essential oil derived from an Australian tree, which can be applied in many different forms (eyelid wipes, eyelid shampoo, oil massages, etc.) on Demodex blepharitis. Demodex blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid caused by Demodex mites (frequently referred to as eyelash mites). 
Key messagesWe are uncertain if tea tree oil is better compared to other treatments. Other factors such as dosage, ocular hygiene, and patient compliance likely affect treatment outcomes; however, more and better‐designed studies are needed to confirm these findings. 
What did we study in this review?Blepharitis causes symptoms such as eye itching, burning, dryness, irritation, watering, or blurry vision, which lead people to seek medical attention. This study aimed to understand the ability of tea tree oil to improve symptoms or to treat Demodex blepharitis (or both) in comparison to no treatment or other forms of treatment containing no tea tree oil. 
What were the main results of this review?This review included six studies with 562 participants (1124 eyes). They were men and women between the ages of 39 and 55 years. The included studies were conducted in the US, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey. Trial designs greatly varied, which limited analyses and the confidence in the results. Most studies included in this report had a high degree of bias. It is uncertain if tea tree oil (concentration ranging from 5% to 50%) is helpful for reducing the number of Demodex mites in people with Demodex blepharitis in short‐term cases. While not fully addressed in the reviewed literature, people should be educated on how to properly apply tea tree oil products because patient compliance and method of application likely affects efficacy. None of the studies in this review reported any side effects directly related to the treatment; however, one study did report irritation around the eyes on using tea tree oil, which was resolved on re‐educating the person on the application technique.

10.1002-14651858.CD003737.pub4,"What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia (an eye co‐ordination problem that starts in childhood)? 
Key messages 
· Covering one eye with a patch improves the eye co‐ordination of children with intermittent exotropia more effectively than regular monitoring by an eye specialist. 
· Few studies have compared other treatments for intermittent exotropia, and those that have do not provide clear answers about their benefits and risks. 
· Well‐conducted studies are needed in this area to improve the management of intermittent exotropia. 
What is intermittent exotropia? 
Intermittent exotropia is an eye condition that develops in the first year of life. It causes one or both eyes to turn out toward the ear, typically when a child looks into the distance, daydreams, is tired, or is in bright sunlight. Only one eye turns out at a time, while the other eye points straight forwards. This can happen infrequently, or regularly throughout the day. 
What treatments are available for intermittent exotropia? 
Regular monitoring (observation) by an eye specialist may be all that is needed when a child’s eyes point in the same direction most of the time, or when intermittent exotropia does not affect vision. 
For children with more severe intermittent exotropia, several treatments are available, including: 
· eye exercises, to improve a child’s control over their eye movements;
· glasses, to encourage the eyes to work together;
· eye muscle surgery, to adjust the position of the eyes; and
· covering one eye with a patch, to strengthen the other eye.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out:
· which treatment works best for intermittent exotropia; and
· whether treatments cause any unwanted (adverse) effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared different treatments for intermittent exotropia against each other. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 6 studies that involved a total of 890 people who were mostly children aged 12 months to 10 years. The studies followed people for between six months and three years, and took place in the USA (four studies), India (one study), and Turkey (one study). The studies compared: 
· patching against observation (two studies); and
· different treatments involving surgery (four studies).
Patching compared to observation 
The evidence:
· shows that patching is better than observation for improving eye co‐ordination; and 
· suggests that patching and observation may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision. 
Different surgical procedures 
The evidence suggests that:
· surgery on the muscles that control the outward movement of both eyes is probably better for improving eye co‐ordination than surgery on the muscles that control both inward and outward movement in one eye; 
· these two procedures may have similar effects on sharpness of near vision and quality of life, and may lead to similar numbers of adverse effects (such as small lumps under the skin); and 
· there may be little to no difference in effect on eye co‐ordination when looking at distant objects between surgical procedures on the inside of the eye (‘plication’ and ‘resection’) when combined with surgery on the outside of the eye. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The evidence is based on a small number of studies, and several studies may have used methods likely to introduce errors in their results. In general, the studies provided limited information about the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia. For example, they often did not investigate adverse effects or effects on sharpness of vision at a distance and quality of life. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence?

Treating eyes that drift out in children: what we know now

Rationale
Some children have eyes that drift out at times. Doctors call this intermittent exotropia. It often starts in the first year of life. One eye points out toward the ear. The other eye points straight ahead.

This drift can show up when a child is tired. It can also show up in bright light. It can happen when a child looks far away or daydreams. It may be rare or happen many times a day.

Many treatments may help. These include patching one eye. They also include eye exercises, glasses, and surgery. Each one aims to help the eyes work as a team.

We need to know which treatment works best. We also need to know the risks of each one. This study looked for answers. It compared treatments for this eye drift in head‑to‑head tests.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team searched for studies that compared treatments. They then summed up what those studies found. They also judged how sure the results are.

They found six studies. These studies had 890 people in total. Most were children ages 12 months to 10 years. The studies took place in the USA, India, and Turkey.

People were followed for six months to three years. Two studies compared patching to watch and wait care. Four studies compared types of eye muscle surgery.

This review asked two main questions. Which treatment works best? Do any treatments cause unwanted effects? Unwanted effects are harms due to treatment.

Results
About patching versus watch and wait
Patching means you cover one eye with a patch. This may help the other eye work harder. In the studies, patching helped more than watch and wait care. It helped the eyes act more like a team.

Patching and watch and wait had a similar effect on near sight. Near sight means how clear things look up close. The studies did not show a clear edge for either one here.

About surgery choices
Some children need surgery on eye muscles. The goal is to help the eyes point the same way. The studies looked at a few surgery plans. They compared work on one eye versus both eyes.

Doing surgery on both eyes that move the eyes out probably helped more. It helped the eyes act more like a team. This was better than doing two muscles on one eye. That means one eye had work on an in muscle and an out muscle.

The two surgery plans had a similar effect on near sight. They also had a similar effect on daily life. Daily life means how one feels and functions day to day.

The number of unwanted effects was also alike. A few people had small lumps under the skin. These lumps were near the surgery site.

The studies also compared two inside muscle methods. These are called plication and resection. Both were done with surgery on the outside muscle too. For looking far away, both inside methods seemed about the same.

What this means for patients and families
Patching can help many children. It may do more than just watch and wait care. It helps the eyes work as a team. It does not seem to change near sight more than watch and wait care.

If surgery is needed, doing both eyes may help team work more. Doing two muscles on one eye may help less with team work. Near sight, daily life, and unwanted effects looked alike for these two plans. Small skin lumps sometimes happened after surgery.

Limits of what we know
These results come from only six studies. Some studies used methods that may add error. Not all studies checked for all harms. Not all checked far sight or daily life.

So, we still have gaps. We need more good studies. We need larger groups and longer follow‑up. We also need the same tests across studies. This will help us compare results with more trust.

How current is this review?
The team searched for studies up to January 2021. New research may be out now. Ask your eye doctor about the latest data. Care plans should fit your child’s needs.

Bottom line
For many children, patching helps more than watch and wait care. It helps the eyes work together. Some surgery plans may help team work more than others. But many questions remain.

Talk with your child’s eye doctor. Ask about patching, glasses, exercises, and surgery. Ask what might help your child most. Ask about benefits, risks, and time in care. More strong studies will guide us to better care.","What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for intermittent exotropia (an eye co‐ordination problem that starts in childhood)?

10.1002-14651858.CD009961.pub2,"Preventing bleeding in people with congenital bleeding disorders during and after surgery 
In haemophilia and other congenital bleeding disorders blood does not clot properly, which can cause excessive bleeding. This is particularly relevant during surgery, when the risk of bleeding depends on the type and severity of the clotting disorder and on the type of surgery. Therefore, during and after surgery, these individuals should receive treatment to improve the ability of their blood to clot and so prevent bleeding. Clotting factor concentrates (when available and appropriate in those individuals missing specific clotting proteins) or other non‐specific drugs for clotting, or a combination of both, are administered. It is not known what is the optimal dose or duration or method of administration of these treatments in these circumstances. 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy (mortality, blood loss, need for re‐intervention, subjective assessment of efficacy, duration and dose of therapy) and the safety of any type of treatment given to people with congenital bleeding disorders during any type of surgery. We found four trials to be included in this review. Two trials evaluated 59 people with haemophilia A or B receiving antifibrinolytic drugs (agents that reduce the breakdown of clots) or placebo in addition to the initial standard treatment before dental extractions. The remaining two trials evaluated 53 people with haemophilia A or B and inhibitors (antibodies that act against the factor concentrate therapy) receiving an different clotting concentrate, recombinant activated factor VII, both during and after surgery. These two trials evaluated different treatment options: high‐dose compared with low‐dose and a single large (bolus) infusion compared with continuous infusion. 
The trials included in this review provide some information in two specific situations in people with congenital bleeding disorders undergoing surgery. However, on the whole, there is not enough evidence from trials to define the best treatments for the various types of disease and types of surgery. Further trials would be useful to improve our knowledge but are difficult to carry out and currently do not appear to be a clinical priority. Indeed, both major and minor surgery are safely performed in clinical practice in these individuals based on local experience and data from uncontrolled studies.

Safer surgery for people born with bleeding problems

2. Rationale
Some people are born with bleeding problems. Their blood does not clot well. This can lead to heavy bleeding. Surgery can raise that risk even more.

Doctors give drugs to help the blood clot. One common plan adds the missing clotting protein. Another plan adds drugs that help a clot stay. These drugs can work alone or together.

We still do not know the best plan. We do not know the best dose or how long to treat. We also do not know the best way to give each drug. This study review asked what plan works best and is safe.

Some drug names can sound hard. Antifibrinolytic drugs help a clot stay in place. A placebo is a dummy pill with no drug. Inhibitors are proteins that block factor treatment. Recombinant activated factor seven is a lab-made clotting protein.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of trials. The team looked for strong trials. In these trials, chance picked the treatment. That means people were put into groups by chance. This helps make fair tests.

The review looked at care during surgery. It also looked at care after surgery. It included people with bleeding problems from birth. Many had hemophilia A or B. These are types of hemophilia.

A hemophilia patient lacks a clotting protein. This makes it hard to stop a bleed. Some patients also have inhibitors. These can block the factor they get. That makes care more complex.

The review found four trials. Two trials had 59 people. These people had hemophilia A or B. They were having dental pulls. Everyone got the usual care first.

In these two trials, some also got an extra drug. The extra drug was an antifibrinolytic drug. It helps a clot stay longer. Others got a placebo, which is a dummy pill. This let the team compare care.

Two more trials had 53 people. They had hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. They got a lab-made clotting protein. It is called activated factor seven. It helps blood form clots.

These trials looked at dose and method. One compared a high dose to a low dose. One compared a single large dose to a steady drip. A single large dose is a bolus. A steady drip is a continuous infusion through a vein.

The trials watched people during and after surgery. They looked at key results. These include death, blood loss, and need for more surgery. They also checked how well bleeding control worked. They tracked how much drug was used and safety.

Ages and gender were not shared in the abstract. The types of surgery varied. Dental pulls were one type. The review did not give other surgery details. It did not share how long each person stayed in a trial.

4. Results
The review found only four trials. They were small. They give some useful facts. But they do not give clear answers. We still cannot pick the best plan.

Two trials looked at dental pulls. They added antifibrinolytic drugs to usual care. They compared this to a placebo. These trials add to our knowledge. But they were small in size.

Two trials looked at care for people with inhibitors. They used activated factor seven. They tested dose and how to give it. They compared high and low dose. They also compared one large dose to a steady drip.

The review checked many outcomes. These include blood loss and the need for more surgery. They also checked if people lived through surgery. They looked at how well bleeding was controlled. They watched for drug harms.

From these trials, we cannot choose one best dose. We also cannot choose one best way to give the drug. We also cannot choose the best length of care. The data were not strong enough.

What does this mean for you? Doctors still treat to prevent bleeds. They may give a missing factor if you lack it. They may add a drug that helps a clot stay. If you have inhibitors, they may use factor seven.

The review says more trials would help. But these trials are hard to do. They may not be a top need now. Teams still do safe surgery for people with these problems.

Your care team will plan your surgery with care. They will use local skill and past reports. They will watch you during and after surgery. They will adjust your drug plan as needed. The goal is to keep you safe and well.

In short, treatments can help prevent bleeding. But we do not yet know the best plan. Ask your team about your options. They can explain the risks and benefits for you. They will tailor care to your needs.","Preventing bleeding in people with congenital bleeding disorders during and after surgery

10.1002-14651858.CD006171.pub4,"Prenatal education for congenital toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis infection is caused by a parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Eating or handling raw or insufficiently‐cooked meat, not washing hands thoroughly after gardening, handling contaminated soil or water, or contact with cats' faeces can cause infection. Usually it is asymptomatic and self‐limiting. Primary prevention involves educating the general public, filtering water and improving farm hygiene to reduce animal infection. 
If pregnant women have not previously been exposed to the parasite and develop antibodies while pregnant, the infection can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus (congenital toxoplasmosis). This is rare but potentially has serious consequences such as malformation, mental retardation, deafness and blindness of the infected infant, intrauterine death or stillbirth. The probability of infection is greater during the third trimester but the risk of the fetus developing major clinical signs is greater early in pregnancy. Pregnant women are often unaware of risk factors for congenital toxoplasmosis. Offering prenatal education could mean that women adopt simple behavioral measures to avoid toxoplasmosis. 
This review included two randomized controlled trials (involving 5455 women). Data could not be combined because each trial measured effectiveness in different ways. One study was from Canada and involved 432 women randomly assigned to a 10‐minute presentation during a prenatal class about toxoplasmosis prevention or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 285 completed the post‐test questionnaire in the third trimester. Only 5% of the intervention women recalled having obtained information on toxoplasmosis prevention during prenatal classes. However, the authors concluded that prenatal education can effectively change pregnant women's behavior as it increased pet, personal and food hygiene. The other trial conducted in France involved 5023 pregnant women with no evidence of toxoplasmosis infection (seronegative) who were randomly assigned to receive a brochure and an audiotape containing information for toxoplasmosis prevention, or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 2790 completed both pre‐test and post‐test questionnaire on behavior (44.5% loss to follow‐up), whereas 3949 women were tested for blood antibodies (22.4% loss to follow‐up). Women's behavior did not change after the intervention. Similarly, the seroconversion rate did not differ between groups (13 out of 2591 women seroconverted in the intervention and four out of 1358 in the control group). 
Both trials were judged as having low methodological quality as assessed by the GRADE approach. This limits our confidence in the results. Evidence supporting prenatal education to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis is therefore limited.

Toxoplasmosis is an illness from a tiny germ called a parasite. It can live in raw or undercooked meat. It can be in soil and water. It can also be in cat poop.

Most people feel fine or have mild flu like signs. But in pregnancy, the germ can pass to the baby. This is called congenital toxoplasmosis. It can cause brain and eye harm in the baby.

Some babies can have hearing loss or loss of sight. Some can have birth defects. In rare cases, the baby can die before birth. This is hard for families and care teams.

Many pregnant women do not know these risks. Simple steps may lower risk. These steps include safe food and hand care. They also include care with cats, soil, and water.

The idea in this review was clear. If we teach women, they may change habits. Then fewer new infections may happen in pregnancy. The team wanted to test this idea.

Trial Design
This review looked at two trials. In each trial, women joined while pregnant. The team put women by chance into two groups. One group got teaching on how to avoid the germ.

The other group got usual prenatal class. No drug was used in these trials. The first trial was in Canada. It had 432 pregnant women.

Women in Canada got a short, ten minute talk in class. The talk covered ways to avoid the germ. Women later filled a survey in late pregnancy. Many did not finish the follow up.

The second trial was in France. It had 5,023 pregnant women. These women had not had the germ before, based on a blood test. They got a brochure and an audio tape with tips.

Women in the France trial also had usual care. They filled a survey before and after. Many women did not finish both surveys. Many had blood tests during pregnancy to check for new infection.

Follow up in both trials took place during pregnancy. In Canada, it went to the third trimester. In France, it covered the rest of the pregnancy. The main checks were surveys and blood tests.

Results
The Canada trial had mixed signs. Few women even recalled the talk. The authors still saw some change in habits. They saw better pet, hand, and food care.

But many women did not finish the surveys. This makes the results less sure. We cannot tell how large the change was. We also do not know if new infections fell.

The France trial found no clear change in habits. The surveys before and after looked the same. Blood tests also looked the same. New infection rates did not change between groups.

In France, 13 of 2,591 women in the teaching group got a new infection. In the usual care group, 4 of 1,358 women got a new infection. These numbers were small in both groups. This shows no clear effect.

Both trials had weak methods. Many women did not finish all parts. This lowers our trust in the results. The review judged the proof as low.

What does this mean for patients? Teaching may help some habits. But we do not know if it prevents this germ in pregnancy. We need better and larger trials to be sure.

This review still matters. It shows that harm to babies is a real worry. It also shows that simple tips alone may not be enough. We may need new ways to teach and support women.

For now, pregnant women can still use safe steps. Cook meat well before you eat it. Wash hands after you handle raw meat. Wash hands after you garden or touch soil.

Avoid contact with cat poop. Try not to drink dirty water. Rinse fruits and vegetables well. These steps match the risks we know.

In summary, the trials tested teaching during pregnancy. One trial saw some change in habits. The other saw no change in habits or new infections. Overall, the proof that teaching alone works is limited.

The investigators drew a careful view. They said the current proof is weak. They called for stronger trials. Better studies can show what helps most to protect mothers and babies.","Prenatal education for congenital toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis infection is caused by a parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Eating or handling raw or insufficiently‐cooked meat, not washing hands thoroughly after gardening, handling contaminated soil or water, or contact with cats' faeces can cause infection. Usually it is asymptomatic and self‐limiting. Primary prevention involves educating the general public, filtering water and improving farm hygiene to reduce animal infection. 
If pregnant women have not previously been exposed to the parasite and develop antibodies while pregnant, the infection can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus (congenital toxoplasmosis). This is rare but potentially has serious consequences such as malformation, mental retardation, deafness and blindness of the infected infant, intrauterine death or stillbirth. The probability of infection is greater during the third trimester but the risk of the fetus developing major clinical signs is greater early in pregnancy. Pregnant women are often unaware of risk factors for congenital toxoplasmosis. Offering prenatal education could mean that women adopt simple behavioral measures to avoid toxoplasmosis. 
This review included two randomized controlled trials (involving 5455 women). Data could not be combined because each trial measured effectiveness in different ways. One study was from Canada and involved 432 women randomly assigned to a 10‐minute presentation during a prenatal class about toxoplasmosis prevention or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 285 completed the post‐test questionnaire in the third trimester. Only 5% of the intervention women recalled having obtained information on toxoplasmosis prevention during prenatal classes. However, the authors concluded that prenatal education can effectively change pregnant women's behavior as it increased pet, personal and food hygiene. The other trial conducted in France involved 5023 pregnant women with no evidence of toxoplasmosis infection (seronegative) who were randomly assigned to receive a brochure and an audiotape containing information for toxoplasmosis prevention, or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow‐up were high and 2790 completed both pre‐test and post‐test questionnaire on behavior (44.5% loss to follow‐up), whereas 3949 women were tested for blood antibodies (22.4% loss to follow‐up). Women's behavior did not change after the intervention. Similarly, the seroconversion rate did not differ between groups (13 out of 2591 women seroconverted in the intervention and four out of 1358 in the control group). 
Both trials were judged as having low methodological quality as assessed by the GRADE approach. This limits our confidence in the results. Evidence supporting prenatal education to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis is therefore limited.

Review Question 
What are the risks and benefits of eating food early, versus delaying food for at least 24 hours after abdominal gynaecologic surgery? 
Background 
Physicians often delay giving food and drink to women after abdominal gynaecologic surgery (uterine fibroids, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, uterine and ovarian cancer) until bowel function recommences (typically 24 hours after surgery). This is to reduce the risk of complications such as vomiting, gastrointestinal disruptions and wound rupturing or leakage. However, it has been suggested that some women may recover more quickly if food is introduced earlier. We reviewed evidence from randomised controlled trials of early and delayed feeding after abdominal gynaecologic surgery. 
Study Characteristics 
We assessed evidence on the following outcomes:
1. Nausea, vomiting, cramping abdominal pain, bloating, abdominal distension, wound complication, deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia. 
2. Time to first: bowel sound, gas, stool, start of regular diet.
3. Length of hospital stay
Early feeding was defined as having fluids or food within 24 hours of surgery. Delayed feeding was defined as having fluids or food 24 hours after surgery, and only if there are bowel sounds, passage of gas or stool, and a feeling of hunger. 
The evidence is current to April 2014
Key Results 
We included five published studies of 631 women, mainly with gynaecologic cancer.
Recovery of bowel function was faster in those with early feeding. There was no difference in rates of nausea or vomiting, abdominal distension, need for a postoperative nasogastric tube or time to first bowel movement, but early feeding was associated with a shorter time to bowel sounds and onset of gas. The early feeding group resumed a solid diet 1½ days sooner than those having delayed feeding and the hospital stay was one day shorter. Also, the early feeding group were more satisfied with the feeding schedule, although only one study reported this. 
Early feeding appeared safe, without increased postoperative complications and with fewer infectious complications overall. 
Quality of the Evidence 
Most of the evidence was moderate quality. The main limitation was lack of blinding, which could influence the findings for subjective outcomes such as self‐reported symptoms, hospital stay, patients' satisfaction and quality of life. 
Conclusions 
The evidence suggests that eating and drinking on the first day after abdominal gynaecologic surgery is safe and could reduce the length of hospital stay.

Eating Soon After Women’s Belly Surgery: Is It Safe and Helpful?

2. Rationale
Many women need belly surgery for womb or ovary problems. These can be fibroids, endometriosis, cysts, or cancer. The womb is the uterus. The ovaries make eggs. These problems can cause pain, bleed, or other hard signs.

After surgery, the gut can slow down or “sleep.” Food and drink can feel hard to keep down. Doctors often wait to give food or drink for one day. They hope to lower throw up, belly swell, and harm to the cut.

Some teams think early food may help. Eating may wake the gut sooner. It may help women feel calm and strong. It may also help women leave the hospital sooner. But it could raise sick feelings or pain.

This review asked a clear question. Is it safe and helpful to eat within one day? Or is it better to wait at least one day? The plan tested when to start food, not a drug. We wanted to weigh risks and gains.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. Trials put people into groups by chance. We call this random. This helps make fair and equal groups. It lowers bias in the results.

The team looked at five trials they could find. These trials had 631 women in all. Most women had cancer of the womb or the ovary. Some had fibroids, cysts, or endometriosis. The papers did not list ages in this summary.

All women had belly surgery on the womb or ovaries. The early food plan meant food or drink within one day after surgery. The late food plan meant food after one day. Late food started only when gut signs came back. Gut signs are gas, stool, or belly sounds, and feeling hungry.

The team checked many things that matter to patients. They looked at sick stomach and throw up. They checked belly cramp, pain, and swell. They noted cut (wound) leaks or other cut problems. They tracked blood clots in the leg, urine (bladder) infection, and lung infection.

They also timed how the gut woke up. They tracked time to first belly sound, first gas, and first stool. They timed when women could start a regular diet. They also looked at how long women stayed in the hospital. One study asked how happy women felt with the food plan.

The search was current to April of 2014. Most of the proof was of moderate quality. People could not be blinded to their food plan. Blinded means people do not know which group they are in. That can change how they rate signs like nausea.

4. Results
Early food helped the gut wake up sooner. Belly sounds came back sooner with early food. Passing gas started sooner as well. Time to the first stool was about the same. Women began solid food one and a half days sooner.

Women left the hospital sooner with early food. Their stay was one day shorter on average. Many liked eating sooner. One study asked about this. Those women were more happy with early food.

Early food did not raise sick feelings. Nausea and throw up were about the same. Belly swell was about the same. Belly cramp and pain were not worse. The need for a nose tube was about the same.

A nose tube is a thin tube that goes in the nose. It goes down into the stomach. It can drain fluid and air after surgery. The early food plan did not raise the need for this tube.

Early food seemed safe in these trials. It did not raise cut leaks or other cut harms. It did not raise blood clots, lung infection, or urine infection. In fact, total infections were fewer with early food. The trials did not show more harm with early food.

What do these results mean for care? Eating and drinking on the first day looks safe. It can help the gut wake up sooner. It can help women start solid food sooner. It can also help women go home sooner.

These results can guide talks with your care team. Not all people are the same. Your doctor may still advise a plan that fits you. But this proof supports early food for many women after belly surgery.

There were limits in the proof. People knew which food plan they had. That can change how they report how they feel. The trials mainly tracked the hospital stay. We do not know longer term effects from these trials. New trials could add more facts.

In sum, the review found clear gains and no extra risks. Early food within one day after belly surgery for women seems safe. It may help you feel better and leave the hospital sooner. Talk with your team to see if this plan is right for you.","Early versus delayed feeding for reducing complications after gynaecologic surgery

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect and safety of bisphosphonates in increasing bone mineral density, reducing fractures and improving clinical function in people with osteogenesis imperfecta. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Background 
Osteogenesis imperfecta is also known as brittle bone disease. It is a genetic condition which can be passed on from a parent to child or occur in the child without any other family history. An affected person is at risk for frequent breaks of the long bones or collapse of the bones of the spine. There is no cure for osteogenesis imperfecta and treatment is mostly supportive. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 28 April 2016.
Study characteristics 
This review looked at trials studying one of the groups of medications known as bisphosphonates which are more typically used to treat osteoporosis. They are used in osteogenesis imperfecta to try and reduce the number of bone fractures in affected individuals. 
We included 14 trials, and most of these did not show a major reduction in fractures in affected individuals when treated with bisphosphonates. 
Key results 
Each trial independently showed significant improvements in bone mineral density after treatment with oral or intravenous bisphosphonates. Bone pain, growth and quality of life indicators were not reported in enough detail and the effects of this treatment need further investigation. The long‐term effectiveness and safety of bisphosphates, as well as dose and duration of therapy, require extended evaluation 
Quality of the evidence 
The majority of trials analysed were small and not powered to show a statistically significant difference in many outcome measures.

Do bone strength drugs help people with brittle bone disease?

2. Rationale
Brittle bone disease is the common name for osteogenesis imperfecta. It is a life long, genetic bone problem. It can be passed from a parent, or start in a child with no family history. People with this disease can have many broken bones. Bones in the spine can also crush down.

There is no cure right now. Care is mostly to prevent falls and help with pain and daily needs. Some doctors use drugs that slow bone loss. These drugs are called bisphosphonates. They help treat weak bones in older adults.

Doctors hope these drugs can help brittle bones too. The goals are fewer breaks and stronger bones. The drugs might also help people move and live with less harm. We also need to know if the drugs are safe. This review updates the proof we have, up to April 28, 2016.

3. Trial Design
This was a careful check of past trials. A research team looked for all trials that used these drugs in this disease. They used clear methods to find, sort, and judge the trials. This type of work is called a systematic review.

The team found 14 trials. All trials tested a bisphosphonate drug. Some trials gave the drug by mouth. Some gave it by vein. All trials looked at people with brittle bone disease.

The trials looked at broken bone counts and bone strength. Bone strength is also called bone mineral density. This is a scan that shows how solid a bone is. From this abstract, we do not know the ages or sex of the people in the trials. The abstract also did not say how long people were in each trial. Many trials were small.

4. Results
All trials found that bone strength went up with the drug. This was true for pills and for drugs by vein. More dense bone may be more strong. This shows the drugs act on bone.

Most trials did not find fewer broken bones. So we cannot say these drugs cut breaks. These trials may have been too small to see a small change. We need bigger trials to be sure.

The trials did not give good details on pain, growth, or daily life. So we do not know if people felt better or grew more. We also do not know if daily life got easier. The review found gaps in those facts.

We do not yet know the best dose or how long to treat. We also do not know the long term safety. These points need time and more study. Future work should track harms and gains for many years.

What does this mean for you? These drugs can make bones more dense. But we do not yet see clear proof of fewer breaks. You and your doctor can talk about your goals. You can weigh bone gains with the unknowns we still have.

This work matters to the field. It points to what we still must learn. Big, long trials should track broken bones, pain, growth, and how people live. Trials should use the same tests, so we can compare results.

The review also shows a need to study dose and timing. We must learn who gains most. We must learn who may face harm. This will help set clear care plans.

In sum, the drugs raise bone density in this disease. Most trials did not show fewer breaks. Many trials were small, so results are unsure. We need more and better trials to guide care.

Until then, care should fit each person. Talk with your care team about choices. Ask how the drug may help you. Ask what we still do not know. This can help you decide what is right for you.","Bisphosphonate therapy for osteogenesis imperfecta

10.1002-14651858.CD013399.pub2,"Background
The risk of venous thromboembolism is increased in adults and enhanced by asparaginase‐based chemotherapy, and venous thromboembolism introduces a secondary risk of treatment delay and premature discontinuation of key anti‐leukaemic agents, potentially compromising survival. Yet, the trade‐off between benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated according to asparaginase‐based regimens is uncertain.  
Objectives
The primary objectives were to assess the benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis for first‐time symptomatic venous thromboembolism in adults with ALL receiving asparaginase‐based therapy compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis. 
The secondary objectives were to compare the benefits and harms of different groups of primary systemic thromboprophylaxis by stratifying the main results per type of drug (heparins, vitamin K antagonists, synthetic pentasaccharides, parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors, direct oral anticoagulants, and blood‐derived products for antithrombin substitution). 
Search methods
We conducted a comprehensive literature search on 02 June 2020, with no language restrictions, including (1) electronic searches of Pubmed/MEDLINE; Embase/Ovid; Scopus/Elsevier; Web of Science Core Collection/Clarivate Analytics; and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and (2) handsearches of (i) reference lists of identified studies and related reviews; (ii) clinical trials registries (ClinicalTrials.gov registry; the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry; the World Health Organisation's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP); and pharmaceutical manufacturers of asparaginase including Servier, Takeda, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Ohara Pharmaceuticals, and Kyowa Pharmaceuticals), and (iii) conference proceedings (from the annual meetings of the American Society of Hematology (ASH); the European Haematology Association (EHA); the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO); and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)). We conducted all searches from 1970 (the time of introduction of asparaginase in ALL treatment). We contacted the authors of relevant studies to identify any unpublished material, missing data, or information regarding ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs); including quasi‐randomised, controlled clinical, cross‐over, and cluster‐randomised trial designs) comparing any parenteral/oral preemptive anticoagulant or mechanical intervention with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, or comparing two different pre‐emptive anticoagulant interventions in adults aged at least 18 years with ALL treated according to asparaginase‐based chemotherapy regimens. For the description of harms, non‐randomised observational studies with a control group were eligible for inclusion.  
Data collection and analysis
Using a standardised data collection form, two review authors independently screened and selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias for each outcome using standardised tools (RoB 2.0 tool for RCTs and ROBINS‐I tool for non‐randomised studies) and the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes included first‐time symptomatic venous thromboembolism, all‐cause mortality, and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included asymptomatic venous thromboembolism, venous thromboembolism‐related mortality, adverse events (i.e. clinically relevant non‐major bleeding and heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia for trials using heparins), and quality of life. Analyses were performed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For non‐randomised studies, we evaluated all studies (including studies judged to be at critical risk of bias in at least one of the ROBINS‐I domains) in a sensitivity analysis exploring confounding.  
Main results
We identified 23 non‐randomised studies that met the inclusion criteria of this review, of which 10 studies provided no outcome data for adults with ALL. We included the remaining 13 studies in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, in which we identified invalid control group definition in two studies and judged outcomes of nine studies to be at critical risk of bias in at least one of the ROBINS‐I domains and outcomes of two studies at serious risk of bias. 
We did not assess the benefits of thromboprophylaxis, as no RCTs were included. In the main descriptive analysis of harms, we included two retrospective non‐randomised studies with outcomes judged to be at serious risk of bias. One study evaluated antithrombin concentrates compared to no antithrombin concentrates. We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on all‐cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.19 (intention‐to‐treat analysis); one study, 40 participants; very low certainty of evidence). We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on venous thromboembolism‐related mortality (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.94 (intention‐to‐treat analysis); one study, 40 participants; very low certainty of evidence). We do not know whether antithrombin concentrates have an effect on major bleeding, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, and quality of life in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy, as data were insufficient. The remaining study (224 participants) evaluated prophylaxis with low‐molecular‐weight heparin versus no prophylaxis. However, this study reported insufficient data regarding harms including all‐cause mortality, major bleeding, venous thromboembolism‐related mortality, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia, and quality of life. 
In the sensitivity analysis of harms, exploring the effect of confounding, we also included nine non‐randomised studies with outcomes judged to be at critical risk of bias primarily due to uncontrolled confounding. Three studies (179 participants) evaluated the effect of antithrombin concentrates and six studies (1224 participants) evaluated the effect of prophylaxis with different types of heparins. When analysing all‐cause mortality; venous thromboembolism‐related mortality; and major bleeding (studies of heparin only) including all studies with extractable outcomes for each comparison (antithrombin and low‐molecular‐weight heparin), we observed small study sizes; few events; wide CIs crossing the line of no effect; and substantial heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots. Although the observed heterogeneity could arise through the inclusion of a small number of studies with differences in participants; interventions; and outcome assessments, the likelihood that bias due to uncontrolled confounding was the cause of heterogeneity is inevitable. Subgroup analyses were not possible due to insufficient data.  
Authors' conclusions
We do not know from the currently available evidence, if thromboprophylaxis used for adults with ALL treated according to asparaginase‐based regimens is associated with clinically appreciable benefits and acceptable harms. The existing research on this question is solely of non‐randomised design, seriously to critically confounded, and underpowered with substantial imprecision. Any estimates of effect based on the existing insufficient evidence is very uncertain and is likely to change with future research.

Do blood clot drugs help adults with ALL who get asparaginase?

Rationale
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, is a blood cancer. People with ALL get many chemo drugs. One drug is called asparaginase. This drug can raise the chance of blood clots.

A blood clot in a vein is called venous thromboembolism, or VTE. A clot can block blood flow in a leg or lung. This can cause pain, harm, or even death. Clots can also delay chemo or stop key drugs. Missed chemo can lower the chance to beat cancer.

Doctors use drugs to help stop clots before they start. We call this clot prevention. Some of these drugs thin the blood. One group is called heparins. One is a body blood part called antithrombin. These may lower clot risk. But they may also raise the chance to bleed.

We need to know the trade off of help and harm. We also need to know if one drug group is best. This study set out to check that.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team looked for all good studies up to June 2020. They looked in many large health study lists. They also checked trial sites and meeting books. They looked back to 1970, when asparaginase began use for ALL.

They wanted fair test trials. In fair tests, chance picks who gets which care. That helps make the groups the same. They also allowed other study types with a control group. A control group means a group that did not get the clot drug.

They focused on adults age 18 or more with ALL. All had care plans that used asparaginase. They looked at drugs that aim to stop a first clot. These drugs were heparins, drugs like warfarin, new oral blood thinners, and antithrombin. They also looked for any non-drug ways to stop clots.

The main things they looked at were first clot with signs, death from any cause, and big bleeds. They also looked at silent clots found on scans, death from clots, other side effects, and life quality. Time in each study was not the same. Many reports did not say how long each person was in the study.

Results
The team found no fair test trials. They found twenty three studies with a control group. Ten did not give results for adults with ALL. Thirteen had some adult data. Most of these had major study flaws.

The team could not test if clot drugs cut first clots. This is because there were no fair test trials. So we do not know if clot drugs help adults with ALL on asparaginase.

They looked at harm in two small, past studies. One study had forty people. It looked at antithrombin versus no antithrombin. We do not know if antithrombin helped people live longer. We also do not know if it cut deaths from clots. There was not enough good data on big bleeds, other bleeds, or life quality.

The other study had two hundred twenty four people. It looked at low molecular weight heparin versus no clot drug. The study did not report enough on harms. It did not give clear numbers for deaths or big bleeds. It gave no clear data on clot deaths, other bleeds, or low platelets from heparin. It gave no life quality data.

The team also ran a check that used more weak studies. These nine studies had high risk of study flaws. Three more studies of antithrombin had one hundred seventy nine people. Six more studies of heparins had one thousand two hundred twenty four people.

Across these added studies, the numbers were small. Few bad events took place. Results were not the same across studies. Groups in the studies were not the same at the start. That means it was not a fair compare. So the results may be off.

What does this mean for patients? Right now, we do not know if starting clot drugs in all adults with ALL on asparaginase helps more than it harms. We also do not know which drug group works best. We lack fair and strong trials.

What are the take home points for care? Clots are a real risk with asparaginase. Clots can delay chemo and harm health. Blood thinners may help, but they can also cause bleeds. Each person’s clot and bleed risk can differ. You and your care team should weigh your own risks and needs.

How is this work key for the field? It shows a large gap in proof. We need fair test trials that use chance to pick care. We need clear and full reports of clots, bleeds, and life quality. We need to know how long people stay on the drug and in care.

What do the study team conclude? The proof we have now is not strong. It is too small and has too many flaws. Any claim of help or harm could change with new trials. More and better trials are needed to guide care.","Prevention of blood clots in adults diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether currently available medications for prevention of blood clots have an appreciable balance between benefits and harms in adults with a subtype of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated with asparaginase‐containing chemotherapy.  
Key messages 
We are uncertain whether blood‐derived products such as antithrombin concentrates for the prevention of blood clots in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy are associated with unacceptable harms such as death. Our confidence in the identified studies is limited because of their non‐randomised design with few participants and no control for underlying factors that could influence the outcome. 
Harms regarding other types of blood clot prevention such as low‐molecular‐weight heparin could not be evaluated, because death and bleeding were not reported.  We did not look at benefits such as reduction in risk of blot clots, given the low quality of identified evidence (no randomised studies). We need high‐quality randomised studies, as the conduct of such studies minimises the risk of underlying factors influencing the outcomes.  
What was studied in this review?  
ALL is a subtype of blood cancer arising from malignant transformation of immature white blood cells of lymphoid origin. Over the last 20 years, the historically poor survival in adults with this disease has markedly improved, primarily due to the introduction of more intensive anti‐leukaemic treatment inspired by that used in children with ALL. One of the hallmarks of this treatment is the intensive use of the anti‐leukaemic agent called asparaginase. However, nothing comes without a price. Both older age and asparaginase treatment increase the risk of blood clots, which can either block the blood vessels (predominantly in those called veins) and change the normal blood flow or shower fractions of the clot into other veins located in important organs, resulting in serious health problems. Additionally, doctors are prone to stop asparaginase treatment, if blood clots occur—potentially compromising survival in these people.  
We do not know if the existing types of blood clot prevention protect against the clots and do not cause bleeding and death in adults with this disease. The medications include heparins, vitamin K antagonists, synthetic pentasaccharides, direct thrombin inhibitors, direct oral anticoagulants, or blood‐derived products for antithrombin substitution (decreased production in the body of this anti‐blood clotting protein during asparaginase), and mechanical prevention such as graduated elastic stockings.  
Therefore, we looked at all currently available research in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐containing chemotherapy who received blood clot prevention compared to placebo or no prevention. We looked at the following outcomes: first‐time symptomatic venous blood clot, all‐cause death, major bleeding, blood clot‐related death, asymptomatic venous blood clot, clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, heparin‐induced lowering of blood platelet counts, and quality of life. 
What are the results of this review? 
We found 23 studies, of which we included two studies in our main analyses to help answer the question and nine studies in an additional analysis to help describe the limitations of the evidence. The remaining 12 studies could not be included due to missing outcomes or critical risk of bias, as people in the control group were not 'real' controls.  
The two studies from our main analysis were conducted in UK/Canada and compared antithrombin with no antithrombin concentrates and low‐molecular‐weight heparin with no low‐molecular‐weight heparin, respectively, for people with ALL. We are uncertain whether antithrombin concentrates in adults with ALL treated with asparaginase‐based chemotherapy improve/reduce all‐cause/blood clot‐related death, because our confidence in the evidence was very low (one study, 40 adults). Harms in relation to the use of low‐molecular‐weight heparin could not be evaluated, because all‐cause/blood clot‐related death, major/clinically relevant non‐major bleeding, or heparin‐induced lowering of platelets were not reported. None of the studies looked at quality of life.  
No studies were found that evaluated any of the other prevention types. We did not look at benefits such as reduction in risk of blood clots, given the low certainty of evidence.

10.1002-14651858.CD013359.pub2,"Background
Every year, at least one million children become ill with tuberculosis and around 200,000 children die. Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended rapid molecular tests that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and children with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, at lower health system levels. To inform updated WHO guidelines on molecular assays, we performed a systematic review on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests in children presumed to have active tuberculosis. 
Objectives
Primary objectives 
• To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for (a) pulmonary tuberculosis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; (b) tuberculous meningitis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; (c) lymph node tuberculosis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; and (d) rifampicin resistance in children presumed to have tuberculosis 
‐ For tuberculosis detection, index tests were used as the initial test, replacing standard practice (i.e. smear microscopy or culture) 
‐ For detection of rifampicin resistance, index tests replaced culture‐based drug susceptibility testing as the initial test 
Secondary objectives 
• To compare the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for each of the four target conditions 
• To investigate potential sources of heterogeneity in accuracy estimates
‐ For tuberculosis detection, we considered age, disease severity, smear‐test status, HIV status, clinical setting, specimen type, high tuberculosis burden, and high tuberculosis/HIV burden 
‐ For detection of rifampicin resistance, we considered multi‐drug‐resistant tuberculosis burden 
• To compare multiple Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra results (repeated testing) with the initial Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra result 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) Registry up to 29 April 2019, without language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomized trials, cross‐sectional trials, and cohort studies evaluating Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra in HIV‐positive and HIV‐negative children younger than 15 years. Reference standards comprised culture or a composite reference standard for tuberculosis and drug susceptibility testing or MTBDRplus (molecular assay for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and drug resistance) for rifampicin resistance. We included studies evaluating sputum, gastric aspirate, stool, nasopharyngeal or bronchial lavage specimens (pulmonary tuberculosis), cerebrospinal fluid (tuberculous meningitis), fine needle aspirates, or surgical biopsy tissue (lymph node tuberculosis). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy ‐ Revised (QUADAS‐2). For each target condition, we used the bivariate model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We stratified all analyses by type of reference standard. We assessed certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
For pulmonary tuberculosis, 299 data sets (68,544 participants) were available for analysis; for tuberculous meningitis, 10 data sets (423 participants) were available; for lymph node tuberculosis, 10 data sets (318 participants) were available; and for rifampicin resistance, 14 data sets (326 participants) were available. Thirty‐nine studies (80%) took place in countries with high tuberculosis burden. Risk of bias was low except for the reference standard domain, for which risk of bias was unclear because many studies collected only one specimen for culture. 
Detection of pulmonary tuberculosis 
For sputum specimens, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) verified by culture were 64.6% (55.3% to 72.9%) (23 studies, 493 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and 99.0% (98.1% to 99.5%) (23 studies, 6119 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). For other specimen types (nasopharyngeal aspirate, 4 studies; gastric aspirate, 14 studies; stool, 11 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity ranged between 45.7% and 73.0%, and pooled specificity ranged between 98.1% and 99.6%. 
For sputum specimens, Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) verified by culture were 72.8% (64.7% to 79.6%) (3 studies, 136 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and 97.5% (95.8% to 98.5%) (3 studies, 551 participants; high‐certainty evidence). For nasopharyngeal specimens, Xpert Ultra sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) were 45.7% (28.9% to 63.3%) and 97.5% (93.7% to 99.3%) (1 study, 195 participants). 
For all specimen types, Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra sensitivity were lower against a composite reference standard than against culture. 
Detection of tuberculous meningitis 
For cerebrospinal fluid, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity, verified by culture, were 54.0% (95% CI 27.8% to 78.2%) (6 studies, 28 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 93.8% (95% CI 84.5% to 97.6%) (6 studies, 213 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Detection of lymph node tuberculosis 
For lymph node aspirates or biopsies, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity, verified by culture, were 90.4% (95% CI 55.7% to 98.6%) (6 studies, 68 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 89.8% (95% CI 71.5% to 96.8%) (6 studies, 142 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Detection of rifampicin resistance 
Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 90.0% (67.6% to 97.5%) (6 studies, 20 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and 98.3% (87.7% to 99.8%) (6 studies, 203 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We found Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity to vary by specimen type, with gastric aspirate specimens having the highest sensitivity followed by sputum and stool, and nasopharyngeal specimens the lowest; specificity in all specimens was > 98%. Compared with Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra sensitivity in sputum was higher and specificity slightly lower. Xpert MTB/RIF was accurate for detection of rifampicin resistance. Xpert MTB/RIF was sensitive for diagnosing lymph node tuberculosis. For children with presumed tuberculous meningitis, treatment decisions should be based on the entirety of clinical information and treatment should not be withheld based solely on an Xpert MTB/RIF result. The small numbers of studies and participants, particularly for Xpert Ultra, limits our confidence in the precision of these estimates.

How well do rapid gene tests find TB in children?

Rationale
TB is a germ that can attack the lungs, brain, and other parts of the body. Each year, at least one million children get sick with TB. About two hundred thousand children die. TB in kids is hard to spot. Many kids cannot cough up spit. Their samples can have few germs.

Doctors need fast and clear tests. The Xpert tests look for TB genes in a sample. There are two kinds: Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. They also check if a key TB drug, rifampicin, will work. If the germ resists this drug, care must change fast.

This review asked: How well do these tests find TB in children? It also asked: How well do they find rifampicin resistance? The World Health Organization backs these tests. Clear data can help set the best rules for care.

Trial Design
This was not a new trial. The team did a review of many past studies. They searched many medical lists up to April 29, 2019. They did not limit by language.

The review looked at studies of children under age 15. It included both children with HIV and without HIV. Most studies took place in countries with a high TB burden.

Doctors used many sample types:
- Lungs: spit (sputum), stomach fluid (gastric aspirate), stool, nose or throat swab, or lung wash.
- Brain and spine: spinal fluid (for TB meningitis).
- Lymph nodes: a thin needle draw or a small piece of tissue.

To check if the result was right, most studies used “culture.” Culture means the lab grows the germ from the sample. Some studies used a set of rules made by the study team. No new patients joined this review. So there was no time in the study for each person.

Results
What the numbers mean:
- “Found TB in X of 100” means how often the test caught TB when TB was there.
- “Said no TB in X of 100” means how often the test was clear when TB was not there.

Lung TB (pulmonary TB)
Xpert MTB/RIF on spit (sputum):
- It found TB in about 65 of 100 children who had TB.
- It said “no TB” in about 99 of 100 children who did not have TB.
- These data came from many studies and many children.

Xpert MTB/RIF on other lung samples:
- Across stool, nose or throat swab, and stomach fluid, it found TB in about 5 to 7 of 10 children who had TB.
- It said “no TB” in about 98 to 100 of 100 children who did not have TB.
- Gastric aspirate did best. Next came spit and stool. Nose or throat swab did worst.

Xpert Ultra on spit (sputum):
- It found TB in about 73 of 100 children who had TB.
- It said “no TB” in about 98 of 100 children who did not have TB.
- These data came from few studies. So we are less sure.

Xpert Ultra on nose or throat swab:
- It found TB in about 46 of 100 children who had TB.
- It said “no TB” in about 98 of 100 children who did not have TB.
- This came from one study.

For both tests, when checked against a broader set of rules, they found fewer cases. This likely reflects how the rules define TB, not just test skill.

TB of the brain and spine (TB meningitis)
Xpert MTB/RIF on spinal fluid:
- It found TB in about 54 of 100 children who had TB.
- It said “no TB” in about 94 of 100 children who did not have TB.
- Few children were in these studies. So we are not very sure.
- The authors say: Do not hold back care based only on this test. Use all the facts from exam, scans, and labs.

Lymph node TB
Xpert MTB/RIF on node draws or tissue:
- It found TB in about 90 of 100 children who had TB.
- It said “no TB” in about 90 of 100 children who did not have TB.
- These results came from small studies. So we are not very sure.

Rifampicin resistance
Xpert MTB/RIF:
- It found rifampicin resistance in about 90 of 100 children who had resistant TB.
- It said “no resistance” in about 98 of 100 children who did not have resistant TB.
- These studies were small. But the results were good.

What this means for families and care teams
- These gene tests are fast and can guide care early.
- For lung TB, both tests rarely say “TB” when it is not there. This helps avoid wrong care.
- Xpert Ultra found more TB on spit than Xpert MTB/RIF. But it had a few more “false alarms.”
- On samples from the nose or throat, both tests missed many cases. Spit or gastric aspirate did better when possible.
- For TB meningitis, the test can miss many cases. Doctors should treat based on the whole picture.
- For lymph node TB, the test did well, but the data were small.
- Xpert MTB/RIF did well in finding rifampicin resistance. This can speed the right drug plan.

Limits
- Many results came from small groups, most for Xpert Ultra.
- Many studies used only one sample for culture. That can miss TB. This may affect the numbers.

Bottom line
These tests help find TB in children, most of all with the right sample. Xpert Ultra on spit finds more cases than Xpert MTB/RIF. Both are very good at saying “no TB” when it is not there. Xpert MTB/RIF can also spot rifampicin resistance well. For TB of the brain and spine, doctors should not wait for these tests to treat. These results can guide care and help set global rules.","Xpert tests for active tuberculosis in children
Why is improving the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis important? 
In 2018, at least one million children became ill with tuberculosis and around 200,000 died. When detected early and effectively treated, tuberculosis is largely curable. Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are World Health Organization‐recommended tests that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and children with tuberculosis symptoms. Rifampicin is an important anti‐tuberculosis drug. Not recognizing tuberculosis early may result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, severe illness, and death. A false tuberculosis diagnosis may result in anxiety and unnecessary treatment. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of tests in symptomatic children for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance. 
What was studied in this review? 
Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra, with results measured against culture and a composite reference standard (benchmarks), recognizing that neither reference is perfect in children. 
What are the main results in this review? 
A total of 49 studies were included. For pulmonary tuberculosis, we analysed 299 data sets including information describing nearly 70,000 children. 
For a population of 1000 children:
Xpert MTB/RIF 
‐ where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum (by culture), 74 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 (12%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 926 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 35 (4%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 have tuberculous meningitis (by culture), 86 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 59 (69%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 914 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 23 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 people have lymph node tuberculosis (by culture), 142 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 97 (68%) would not have lymph node tuberculosis (false‐positives); 858 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; and 5 (1%) would have lymph node TB (false‐negatives) 
‐ where 100 have rifampicin resistance, 108 would have Xpert MTB/RIF‐rifampicin resistance detected, of whom 18 (17%) would not have rifampicin resistance (false‐positives); 892 would have Xpert MTB/RIF‐rifampicin resistance NOT detected; and 10 (1%) would have rifampicin resistance (false‐negatives) 
Xpert Ultra 
‐ where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum (by culture), 100 would be Xpert Ultra‐positive, of whom 27 (27%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); 900 would be Xpert Ultra‐negative; and 27 (3%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives) 
How confident are we in the results of this review? 
We are confident. We included many studies from different countries and settings and used two reference standards. Some studies included only children at referral centres or did not report the setting. Therefore, we could not assess how the tests would work in a primary care setting. 
What children do the results of this review apply to? 
Children with presumed pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, or rifampicin resistance. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The results of the review suggest Xpert tests have the potential to be used to detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. 
‐ The risk of missing a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis confirmed by culture with Xpert MTB/RIF (in sputum) is low (4% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF suggests they do not have tuberculosis) suggesting that only a small number of children with tuberculosis confirmed by culture will not receive treatment. The risk of wrongly diagnosing a child as having tuberculosis is slightly higher (12% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF test suggests they do have tuberculosis). This may result in some of these children receiving unnecessary treatment. 
‐ The risk of missing a diagnosis of rifampicin resistance with Xpert MTB/RIF is low (1% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF suggests they do not have rifampicin resistance) suggesting that only a small number of children with tuberculosis will not receive the appropriate treatment. The risk of wrongly diagnosing a child as rifampicin resistance tuberculosis is higher (17% of those whose Xpert MTB/RIF test suggests they do have rifampicin resistance). This may result in some of these children receiving unnecessary treatment.

10.1002-14651858.CD014641,"Background
Tuberculosis is the primary cause of hospital admission in people living with HIV, and the likelihood of death in the hospital is unacceptably high. The Alere Determine TB LAM Ag test (AlereLAM) is a point‐of‐care test and the only lateral flow lipoarabinomannan assay (LF‐LAM) assay currently commercially available and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). A 2019 Cochrane Review summarised the diagnostic accuracy of LF‐LAM for tuberculosis in people living with HIV. This systematic review assesses the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on mortality and other patient‐important outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on mortality in adults living with HIV in inpatient and outpatient settings. 
To assess the impact of the use of LF‐LAM (AlereLAM) on other patient‐important outcomes in adults living with HIV, including time to diagnosis of tuberculosis, and time to initiation of tuberculosis treatment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (Ovid); Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), BIOSIS Previews, Scopus, LILACS; ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the WHO ICTRP up to 12 March 2021. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials that compared a diagnostic intervention including LF‐LAM with diagnostic strategies that used smear microscopy, mycobacterial culture, a nucleic acid amplification test such as Xpert MTB/RIF, or a combination of these tests. We included adults (≥ 15 years) living with HIV. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility, extracted data, and analysed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized studies. We contacted study authors for clarification as needed. We used risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a fixed‐effect model except in the presence of clinical or statistical heterogeneity, in which case we used a random‐effects model. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included three trials, two in inpatient settings and one in outpatient settings. All trials were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa and assessed the impact of diagnostic strategies that included LF‐LAM on mortality when the test was used in conjunction with other tuberculosis diagnostic tests or clinical assessment for clinical decision‐making in adults living with HIV. 
Inpatient settings  
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy likely reduces mortality in people living with HIV at eight weeks compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (pooled RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.94; 5102 participants, 2 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence). That is, people living with HIV who received LF‐LAM had 15% lower risk of mortality. The absolute effect was 34 fewer deaths per 1000 (from 14 fewer to 55 fewer). 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy probably results in a slight increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (pooled RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.69; 5102 participants, 2 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Outpatient settings 
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality in people living with HIV at six months compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11; 2972 participants, 1 trial; low‐certainty evidence). Although this trial did not detect a difference in mortality, the direction of effect was towards a mortality reduction, and the effect size was similar to that in inpatient settings.  
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may result in a large increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (RR 5.44, 95% CI 4.70 to 6.29, 3022 participants, 1 trial; low‐certainty evidence). 
Other patient‐important outcomes 
Assessment of other patient‐important and implementation outcomes in the trials varied. The included trials demonstrated that a higher proportion of people living with HIV were able to produce urine compared to sputum for tuberculosis diagnostic testing; a higher proportion of people living with HIV were diagnosed with tuberculosis in the group that received LF‐LAM; and the incremental diagnostic yield was higher for LF‐LAM than for urine or sputum Xpert MTB/RIF. 
Authors' conclusions
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic testing strategy likely reduces mortality and probably results in a slight increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. The reduction in mortality may be due to earlier diagnosis, which facilitates prompt treatment initiation. In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality and may result in a large increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. Our results support the implementation of LF‐LAM to be used in conjunction with other WHO‐recommended tuberculosis diagnostic tests to assist in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis in people living with HIV. 
","1. Plain Title
A quick urine test for TB may help save adults with HIV

2. Rationale
TB is a germ that can harm the lungs and other parts. It spreads through the air. Adults with HIV get very sick from TB. Many go to the hospital. Too many die soon after they arrive.

Doctors need fast tests to spot TB in these adults. A quick urine test may help. It is called the LAM urine test (AlereLAM). It looks for a small TB sign in urine. Staff can do it at the bedside and get a fast read.

This review asked a clear question. Does using the LAM urine test help adults with HIV live longer? It also asked if it helps start TB care sooner. The hope is that fast answers lead to fast care.

The test may help for one more reason. Many very sick adults cannot cough up spit for tests. But most can give urine. A test that uses urine can be done right away.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of three trials. Trials are studies that test ideas in people. In these trials, people joined by chance. This is called random. Two trials took place in hospital wards. One took place in clinics.

All the trials were in sub‑Saharan Africa. They all enrolled adults age 15 and up who had HIV. Both men and women took part. All had signs that TB could be the cause. The study teams used the urine LAM test with other TB tests.

The urine LAM test was part of a care plan. Doctors still used other tests as well. These other tests included smear, culture, or a DNA test for TB. The teams then made care choices based on the results. Usual care did not use the urine LAM test.

The main thing they measured was death. They also looked at how fast people got a TB result. They looked at how fast people started TB care. They noted how many people could give urine or spit. They also tracked how many TB cases the tests found.

Time in the trials was short. In the hospital trials, they checked death at eight weeks. In the clinic trial, they checked death at six months. This fit the time when risk is high. It also fits when fast care can help most.

4. Results
In the hospital trials, the urine LAM test helped. Fewer people died by eight weeks. There were 34 fewer deaths for each 1000 people tested. Over five thousand people took part in these two trials. The proof for this is of moderate strength.

In the hospital trials, more people started TB care. The rise was small. Still, even a small rise can help. Fast care can lead to better odds. This supports the use of the test with other tests.

In the clinic trial, the test may also help. Fewer people died by six months, but the trial could not be sure. The number of people was almost three thousand. The trend was in the same helpful direction. The proof here is not as strong.

In the clinic trial, many more people started TB care. It was about five times as many. This is a large rise. It means the test can move care forward. That can save time and lives.

Other results also matter. More people could give urine than spit. That makes testing easier and faster. The urine LAM test also found more TB cases. It picked up some that other tests missed.

What does this mean for care? Use the urine LAM test along with other TB tests. Do this in hospitals and clinics that care for adults with HIV. Expect faster answers. Expect more people to start TB care.

Why might deaths drop with this test? It likely helps find TB sooner. When care starts fast, people do better. Time matters a lot with TB. This is true for adults with HIV, who can get sick fast.

Here is the bottom line from the study team. In hospitals, the urine LAM test likely helps people live. It also likely helps a few more start TB care. In clinics, it may help people live and helps many more start TB care. Health teams should add this test to other WHO‑advised TB tests for adults with HIV.

These results fit real life needs. The test is quick. It uses urine, which most people can give. It can be done at the bedside. It can guide care right away. This can help save lives in places with high TB and HIV.","Impact of diagnostic strategies for tuberculosis using lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan test in people living with HIV 
What was the aim of this review? 
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in people living with HIV. The disease is particularly difficult to diagnose in people living with HIV, in part because it is often challenging to produce sputum for diagnosis. The lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan test (LF‐LAM) is a World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended rapid test to assist in the detection of active tuberculosis in people living with HIV. This review is limited to studies that used the Alere Determine TB LAM Ag test (AlereLAM), which is the only LF‐LAM test currently recommended by the WHO; thus LF‐LAM refers only to AlereLAM in this review. Rapid and early tuberculosis diagnosis may allow for prompt treatment and prevent severe illness and death. The aim of this review was to determine whether the use of LF‐LAM testing had an effect on death and other patient‐important outcomes in people living with HIV. 
Key messages 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic testing strategy likely reduces deaths and probably results in a slight increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV.  
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce deaths and may result in a large increase in tuberculosis treatment initiation in people living with HIV. 
What was studied in the review? 
We searched for trials in adults (15 years and older) that evaluated the effect of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy that included the LF‐LAM test compared to standard care using other WHO‐recommended diagnostic tests in adults living with HIV. 
What were the main results of the review? 
We identified three trials, two in inpatient settings and one in outpatient settings.
Inpatient settings 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy likely reduces mortality in people living with HIV at eight weeks compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (2 trials, 5102 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In inpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy probably results in a slight increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (2 trials, 5102 participants moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Outpatient settings 
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may reduce mortality in people living with HIV at six months compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (1 trial, 2972 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
In outpatient settings, the use of LF‐LAM testing as part of a tuberculosis diagnostic strategy may result in a large increase in the proportion of people living with HIV who were started on tuberculosis treatment compared to routine tuberculosis diagnostic testing without LF‐LAM (1 trial, 3022 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
Other patient‐important outcomes 
The included studies assessed other patient‐important outcomes in different ways. The studies demonstrated that more people living with HIV were able to produce urine compared to sputum for tuberculosis diagnostic testing, and more people living with HIV were diagnosed with tuberculosis in the group that received LF‐LAM. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
We searched for relevant trials up to 12 March 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013739.pub2,"Background
The primary manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is respiratory insufficiency that can also be related to diffuse pulmonary microthrombosis and thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or arterial thrombosis. People with COVID‐19 who develop thromboembolism have a worse prognosis. 
Anticoagulants such as heparinoids (heparins or pentasaccharides), vitamin K antagonists and direct anticoagulants are used for the prevention and treatment of venous or arterial thromboembolism. Besides their anticoagulant properties, heparinoids have an additional anti‐inflammatory potential. However, the benefit of anticoagulants for people with COVID‐19 is still under debate. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention in people hospitalised with COVID‐19. 
Search methods
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and IBECS databases, the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and medRxiv preprint database from their inception to 14 April 2021. We also checked the reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews identified, and contacted specialists in the field for additional references to trials. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs and cohort studies that compared prophylactic anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention for the management of people hospitalised with COVID‐19. We excluded studies without a comparator group and with a retrospective design (all previously included studies) as we were able to include better study designs. Primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality and necessity for additional respiratory support. Secondary outcomes were mortality related to COVID‐19, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, adverse events, length of hospital stay and quality of life. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used Cochrane RoB 1 to assess the risk of bias for RCTs, ROBINS‐I to assess risk of bias for non‐randomised studies (NRS) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We meta‐analysed data when appropriate. 
Main results
We included seven studies (16,185 participants) with participants hospitalised with COVID‐19, in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. Studies were from Brazil (2), Iran (1), Italy (1), and the USA (1), and two involved more than country. The mean age of participants was 55 to 68 years and the follow‐up period ranged from 15 to 90 days. The studies assessed the effects of heparinoids, direct anticoagulants or vitamin K antagonists, and reported sparse data or did not report some of our outcomes of interest: necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, and quality of life. 
Higher‐dose versus lower‐dose anticoagulants (4 RCTs, 4647 participants) 
Higher‐dose anticoagulants result in little or no difference in all‐cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.16, 4489 participants; 4 RCTs) and increase minor bleeding (RR 3.28, 95% CI 1.75 to 6.14, 1196 participants; 3 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (high‐certainty evidence). Higher‐dose anticoagulants probably reduce pulmonary embolism (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.70, 4360 participants; 4 RCTs), and slightly increase major bleeding (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.80, 4400 participants; 4 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (moderate‐certainty evidence). Higher‐dose anticoagulants may result in little or no difference in deep vein thrombosis (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.03, 3422 participants; 4 RCTs), stroke (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.03, 4349 participants; 3 RCTs), major adverse limb events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.99, 1176 participants; 2 RCTs), myocardial infarction (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.55, 4349 participants; 3 RCTs), atrial fibrillation (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.70, 562 participants; 1 study), or thrombocytopenia (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.24, 2789 participants; 2 RCTs) compared to lower‐dose anticoagulants up to 30 days (low‐certainty evidence). It is unclear whether higher‐dose anticoagulants have any effect on necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, and quality of life (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). 
Anticoagulants versus no treatment (3 prospective NRS, 11,538 participants) 
Anticoagulants may reduce all‐cause mortality but the evidence is very uncertain due to two study results being at critical and serious risk of bias (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.74, 8395 participants; 3 NRS; very low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain if anticoagulants have any effect on necessity for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID‐19, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, stroke, myocardial infarction and quality of life (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). 
Ongoing studies 
We found 62 ongoing studies in hospital settings (60 RCTs, 35,470 participants; 2 prospective NRS, 120 participants) in 20 different countries. Thirty‐five ongoing studies plan to report mortality and 26 plan to report necessity for additional respiratory support. We expect 58 studies to be completed in December 2021, and four in July 2022. From 60 RCTs, 28 are comparing different doses of anticoagulants, 24 are comparing anticoagulants versus no anticoagulants, seven are comparing different types of anticoagulants, and one did not report detail of the comparator group. 
Authors' conclusions
When compared to a lower‐dose regimen, higher‐dose anticoagulants result in little to no difference in all‐cause mortality and increase minor bleeding in people hospitalised with COVID‐19 up to 30 days. Higher‐dose anticoagulants possibly reduce pulmonary embolism, slightly increase major bleeding, may result in little to no difference in hospitalisation time, and may result in little to no difference in deep vein thrombosis, stroke, major adverse limb events, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, or thrombocytopenia.  
Compared with no treatment, anticoagulants may reduce all‐cause mortality but the evidence comes from non‐randomised studies and is very uncertain. It is unclear whether anticoagulants have any effect on the remaining outcomes compared to no anticoagulants (very low‐certainty evidence or no data). 
Although we are very confident that new RCTs will not change the effects of different doses of anticoagulants on mortality and minor bleeding, high‐quality RCTs are still needed, mainly for the other primary outcome (necessity for additional respiratory support), the comparison with no anticoagulation, when comparing the types of anticoagulants and giving anticoagulants for a prolonged period of time.

Do blood thinners help people in the hospital with COVID-19?

Rationale
COVID-19 harms the lungs. It can also cause small blood clots. These clots can form in the lungs or legs. Clots can make people very sick.

Doctors use drugs called anticoagulants. We call them blood thinners. Blood thinners help stop clots. Some types may also calm swelling in the body.

But it was not clear if blood thinners help people with COVID-19. We needed to test the benefits and harms. We wanted to see if they lower death. We also asked if they cut the need for extra help to breathe.

Trial Design
This was a review of studies. The team searched many large health databases. They looked for the best study types. These were trials with people put into groups by chance. They also used some planned (not by chance) studies.

Seven studies met the rules. They had 16,185 people in the hospital with COVID-19. People were in the ICU, on a ward, or in the ER. The average age was 55 to 68 years. Follow up was 15 to 90 days.

The drugs were three kinds of blood thinners. These were heparins (also called heparinoids), vitamin K blockers, and direct blood thinners. Four trials (4,647 people) tested a higher dose versus a lower dose. Three planned studies (11,538 people) tested blood thinners versus no blood thinners.

The team looked at key health results. These were death from any cause. They also looked at the need for more breathing help. That means oxygen or a breathing machine. They checked for lung clots and leg clots. They checked for bleeding, stroke, and heart attack. They also looked at time in the hospital and quality of life.

Results
Higher dose versus lower dose blood thinners
Four trials tested a higher dose versus a lower dose. These trials followed people for up to 30 days. A higher dose did not change deaths. Death rates were about the same.

A higher dose did cut the number of lung clots. A lung clot is a clot in the lung. Doctors call this a pulmonary embolism. But a higher dose also caused more bleeding. It caused more small bleeds. It also caused a slight rise in big bleeds.

A higher dose did not change some other results. It did not change leg clots. A leg clot is called deep vein thrombosis. It did not change stroke or heart attack. It did not change heart rhythm problems. It did not change low platelets. Platelets help blood to clot.

We do not know if dose changed the need for more breathing help. We also do not know if it changed death due to COVID-19. We do not know the change in quality of life. The trials did not give clear data on these points.

Any blood thinner versus no blood thinner
Three planned studies tested blood thinners versus no blood thinners. These were not by chance studies. The data suggest fewer deaths with blood thinners. But the proof is weak. The way the studies were done may bias the results. So we cannot be sure.

For other health results, we do not know the effect. This includes the need for more breathing help. It also includes lung clots, leg clots, and bleeding. The studies did not give clear data on these points.

Ongoing studies
There were many ongoing studies in hospitals. Sixty were trials by chance. Two were planned, not by chance. They took place in 20 countries. Most planned to share data on death and breathing help. Many were due to end in late 2021 or mid 2022.

What this means for patients
Blood thinners can help stop clots. In these trials, a higher dose did not cut deaths. It did reduce lung clots. But it raised the chance of bleeding. Some bleeds were small. Some were big. A lower dose had fewer bleeds.

Blood thinners may help when compared to no drug at all. But the proof for that point is not strong. We need better trials to know for sure.

This review helps guide care now. It shows that more is not always better. A higher dose did not save more lives. It did raise harms like bleeding. Doctors can use this when they pick a dose.

Conclusions from the investigators
A higher dose and a lower dose led to about the same number of deaths. A higher dose led to fewer lung clots. But it also led to more bleeding, and a slight rise in big bleeds. It likely made little or no change in many other health results.

We still need high quality trials. We need data on breathing support needs. We need data on blood thinners versus no drug. We need to compare types of blood thinners. We also need to test longer use. This will help us know who should get what dose, and when.","Do blood thinners prevent people who are hospitalised with COVID‐19 from developing blood clots? 
Key messages 
‐ High‐dose blood thinners result in little or no difference in death rate and increase minor bleeding compared to low‐dose blood thinners for people hospitalised with COVID‐19. Giving blood thinners compared to not giving blood thinners might reduce the death rate. 
‐ It is very likely that new studies will not change the evidence about the effects of different doses of blood thinners on death rate and minor bleeding. High‐quality studies are still needed to analyse the need for additional respiratory support, giving blood thinners compared to no blood thinners, comparing different blood thinners, and giving blood thinners for extended periods. 
What is COVID‐19? 
COVID‐19 typically affects the lungs and airways; however, in addition to respiratory problems, about 16% of people hospitalised with COVID‐19 experience problems with their blood vessels, leading to blood clots forming in the arteries, veins and lungs. Nearly half of all people with severe COVID‐19 in intensive care units develop clots in their veins or arteries. 
What are blood thinners? 
Blood thinners are medicines that prevent harmful blood clots from forming (deep vein thrombosis). However, they can cause unwanted effects such as bleeding. Some guidelines recommend giving blood thinners when people are first admitted to hospital with COVID‐19 to prevent blood clots from developing, rather than waiting to see whether blood clots develop and then treating them with blood thinners. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether giving blood thinners to people hospitalised with COVID‐19 as a preventive measure reduced the number of deaths compared to people who received no treatment or those who received a placebo treatment (an identical‐seeming treatment but with no active ingredient). We also wanted to determine whether these individuals needed less support with breathing, whether they still developed harmful blood clots, whether they experienced bleeding and whether they experienced any other unwanted events. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed blood thinners given to people hospitalised with COVID‐19 to prevent blood clots. Studies could be of any design as long as they compared a blood thinner with another blood thinner, no treatment or a placebo. Studies could take place anywhere in the world and participants could be any age as long as they were in hospital with confirmed COVID‐19 disease. We pooled the results when appropriate. 
What did we find? 
We included seven studies with 16,185 people hospitalised with COVID‐19 in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. Studies were from Brazil (2), Iran (1), Italy (1), and the USA (1), and two involved more than country. People in the studies were aged from 55 to 68 years on average. Studies lasted from 15 to 90 days and provided evidence on deaths, bleeding, blood clotting, length of hospital stay and unwanted effects. There was little or no evidence on need for respiratory support (help with breathing), deaths related to COVID‐19, and quality of life. 
Higher‐dose of blood thinners compared with lower‐dose (4 studies, 4647 people)  In people who received higher compared to lower doses of blood thinners there was little to no difference in death rate. However, people on higher doses were more likely to experience minor bleeding compared to in those on lower doses. People who received higher doses of blood thinners likely had reduced pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung or blood vessel leading to the lung), slightly increased major (more severe) bleeding, and probably had little to no difference in time spent in hospital compared to those who received the lower doses of blood thinners. In people who received higher doses of blood thinners, there was little to no difference in the rate of deep vein thrombosis, and other unwanted events compared to those who received the lower dose of blood thinners. 
Blood thinners compared with no treatment (3 studies, 11,538 people)  People who received blood thinners had a reduced death rate compared to those who did not receive blood thinners, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are very confident that higher doses of blood thinners do not change the risk of death but do increase the risk of bleeding in people hospitalised with COVID‐19. 
Although our confidence in the evidence is very limited, people who receive blood thinners may have a lower death rate compared to those who did not receive any blood thinners. 
What happens next? 
Our searches found 62 ongoing studies with 35,470 people. We plan to add the results of these studies to our review when they are published. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 14 April 2021.

Delayed recovery of urinary continence is a major adverse effect of robotic‐assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in men undergoing prostate cancer treatment. To address this issue, a number of surgical techniques have been designed to reconstruct the posterior aspect of the rhabdosphincter, which is responsible for urinary continence after removal of the prostate; however, it is unclear how well they work.  
Objectives
To assess the effects of posterior musculofascial reconstruction RALP compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, trials registries, other sources of the grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to 12 March 2021. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which participants were randomized to undergo variations of posterior musculofascial reconstruction RALP versus no posterior reconstruction during RALP for clinically localized prostate cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. Primary outcomes were: urinary continence recovery within one week after catheter removal, at three months after surgery, and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: urinary continence recovery at six and twelve months after surgery, potency recovery twelve months after surgery, positive surgical margins (PSM), and biochemical recurrence‐free survival (BCRFS). We performed statistical analyses using a random‐effects model. We rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Our search identified 13 records of eight unique RCTs, of which six were published studies and two were abstract proceedings. We included 1085 randomized participants, of whom 963 completed the trials (88.8%). All participants had either cT1c or cT2 or cT3a disease, with a mean prostate‐specific antigen level of 8.15 ng/mL. 
Primary outcomes 
Posterior reconstruction RALP (PR‐RALP) may improve urinary continence one week after catheter removal compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.73; I2 = 42%; studies = 5, participants = 498; low CoE) although the CI also includes the possibility of no effect. Assuming 335 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 84 more men per 1000 (33 fewer to 244 more) reporting urinary continence recovery.  
Posterior reconstruction may have little to no effect on urinary continence three months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.14; I2 = 67%; studies = 6, participants = 842; low CoE). Assuming 701 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 14 fewer men per 1000 (112 fewer to 98 more) reporting urinary continence after three months. 
PR‐RALP probably results in little to no difference in serious adverse events compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.92; I2 = 0%; studies = 6, participants = 835; moderate CoE). Assuming 25 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP experience a serious adverse event at this time point, this corresponds to six fewer men per 1000 (17 fewer to 23 more) reporting serious adverse events.  
Secondary outcomes 
PR‐RALP may result in little to no difference in recovery of continence 12 months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.07; I2 = 25%; studies = 3, participants = 602; low CoE). Assuming 918 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 18 more men per 1000 (18 fewer to 64 more) reporting urinary continence recovery.  
We are very uncertain about the effects of PR‐RALP on recovery of potency 12 months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26; I2 = 3%; studies = 2, participants = 308; very low CoE). Assuming 433 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are potent at this time point, this corresponds to nine more men per 1000 (78 fewer to 113 more) reporting potency recovery.  
PR‐RALP may result in little to no difference in positive surgical margins compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.33; I2 = 50%; studies = 3, participants = 517; low CoE). Assuming 130 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP have a positive surgical margin, this corresponds to 31 more men per 1000 (46 fewer to 173 more) reporting positive surgical margins.  
PR‐RALP may result in little to no difference in biochemical recurrence compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.52; I2 = 0%; studies = 2, participants = 468; low CoE). Assuming 70 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP have experienced biochemical recurrence at this time point, this corresponds to 25 more men per 1000 (18 fewer to 107 more) reporting biochemical recurrence.  
Authors' conclusions
This review found evidence that PR‐RALP may improve early continence one week after catheter removal but not thereafter. Meanwhile, adverse event rates are probably not impacted and surgical margins rates are likely similar. This review was unable to determine if or how these findings may be impacted by the person's age, nerve‐sparing status, or clinical stage. Study limitations, imprecision, and inconsistency lowered the certainty of evidence for the outcomes assessed.

Stitch repair during robot prostate surgery: does it help bladder control?

Rationale
Prostate cancer starts in the prostate. The prostate is a small gland in men that helps make semen. Many men with this cancer have surgery to remove the prostate. A common way is robot keyhole surgery. Doctors call it RALP.

After this surgery, some men leak urine. They may need pads. This can harm daily life and mood. Leaking happens because the muscle that holds urine can weaken. This muscle sits behind the prostate.

Surgeons made a new step in the surgery. They place stitches to rebuild the back wall behind this muscle. Doctors call this step “posterior reconstruction.” The goal is to support the urine muscle. The hope is to help men get dry sooner.

We need to know if this stitch repair works. We also need to know if it is safe. This review looked at fair tests that put men into two groups by chance. One group had the repair. The other group did not. The review asked: Does this repair help men get dry faster? Does it cause harm? Does it affect cancer control or sex life?

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. It looked for trials in large medical libraries up to March 12, 2021. It found eight fair trials. These are called randomized trials. In these trials, men went into groups by chance. Some had the stitch repair during RALP. Others had RALP without it.

The trials had 1,085 men in total. Of these, 963 men finished the trials. All men had cancer in the prostate that had not spread far. Doctors call this localized cancer. The cancer stages were cT1c, cT2, or cT3a. The average PSA blood test before surgery was about 8.

All the men were adults. All were male. The trials checked bladder control one week after the urine tube came out. The urine tube is a soft tube used to drain urine after surgery. The trials also checked control at three, six, and twelve months. They looked at serious harms from surgery. They checked sex function at twelve months. They looked at lab signs that cancer came back. That lab sign is a rise in the PSA blood test.

Most men stayed in the trials for up to a year. Some cancer checks were later, but reports varied.

Results
Early bladder control
The stitch repair may help men get dry sooner. One week after the urine tube came out, more men with the repair were dry. Out of 1,000 men, about 335 were dry without the repair. With the repair, about 84 more men per 1,000 were dry. The true number could be a bit lower or higher. It could also be close to no change. So, the repair may help in the first week, but we are not fully sure.

Bladder control at three months
At three months, the repair did not make a clear difference. Results across trials did not match well. The best read is that the repair made little to no change in dryness at this time.

Bladder control at six and twelve months
By six and twelve months, most men were dry in both groups. The repair made little to no difference at one year. Out of 1,000 men, about 918 were dry without the repair at one year. With the repair, about 18 more men per 1,000 were dry. The true number could be a bit lower or higher. This small change may not matter to most men.

Serious harms
Serious harms were rare and were similar with or without the repair. Out of 1,000 men, about 25 had a serious harm without the repair. With the repair, about six fewer men per 1,000 had a serious harm. This small change could be due to chance. The repair likely does not raise the risk of serious harm.

Sex function
Men care about sex life after surgery. The trials looked at erections one year after surgery. We do not know if the repair helps. The results were very unsure. Out of 1,000 men, about 433 had sex function without the repair. With the repair, about nine more men per 1,000 had sex function. The true number could be lower or higher. We need better trials to know.

Cancer control
Cancer control looked the same with or without the repair. The number of men with cancer cells at the edge of the removed tissue was alike. Doctors call this a “positive margin.” Lab signs that cancer came back were also alike. Doctors call this a rise in PSA, or “biochemical recurrence.”

How sure are these results?
The review judged how sure we are about each result. For early bladder control and later bladder control, we are only somewhat sure. This means the results may change with more data. For serious harms, we are more sure. For sex function, we are not sure at all. Trial limits lower our certainty. The trials did not all agree. Some were small. Some had missing data.

Who benefits most?
The review could not tell if age made a difference. It also could not tell if keeping the nerves made a difference. Nerve-sparing means the surgeon keeps the tiny nerves that help with sex and urine control. The review could not tell if the cancer stage made a difference either.

What this means
Adding the stitch repair to robot prostate surgery may help men get dry a bit sooner in the first week. After that, the benefit fades. By one year, dryness is high in both groups. The repair likely does not change serious harms. It likely does not change cancer results. We do not know if it helps sex function.

Men and doctors can use this info when they plan surgery. The repair seems safe. It may help right after surgery. It is not likely to change long-term control. Better and larger trials can help give clearer answers.","Should we perform posterior reconstruction RALP or standard RALP for clinically localized prostate cancer? 
Review question 
In men with prostate cancer who are having their prostate removed using surgery assisted by a robotic device (called robotic‐assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, or RALP), how does connecting the tissue behind the urethra (so‐called posterior reconstruction) compare to surgery where these connections are not made (standard RALP)? 
Background 
Urologists often use a robot to remove the prostate in men with prostate cancer. After surgery, most men leak urine for some time. This problem is called incontinence and usually improves six to 12 months after surgery in most men. However, it can be very bothersome during this time. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies in which chance determined whether men had posterior reconstruction RALP or standard RALP. These studies included 1085 men with an average age ranging from 60 to 67 years. The average prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) level in the men was 8.15 ng/mL. Higher levels of PSA may indicate worse prostate cancer. 
Key results 
We found that posterior reconstruction RALP may result in better continence one week after the catheter comes out compared to standard RALP (although it is also possible that it is no better), but it may make little to no difference at either three or 12 months after surgery. Posterior reconstruction RALP probably results in little to no difference in serious unwanted effects compared with the standard way of doing the surgery. There may also be little to no difference in positive surgical margins, meaning the risk of there being cancer cells right at the cut edge of the prostate when viewed under the microscope. There may also be no difference between the two techniques in terms of the risk of a PSA level that goes up within 12 months of surgery, which often signals that there is cancer left behind. We are very uncertain how posterior reconstruction RALP effects the ability to achieve an erection, compared to standard RALP. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low depending on the outcome, meaning that we have moderate to very little confidence in the results.

10.1002-14651858.CD013491.pub2,"Background
Relapse (the re‐emergence of depressive symptoms after some level of improvement but preceding recovery) and recurrence (onset of a new depressive episode after recovery) are common in depression, lead to worse outcomes and quality of life for patients and exert a high economic cost on society. Outcomes can be predicted by using multivariable prognostic models, which use information about several predictors to produce an individualised risk estimate. The ability to accurately predict relapse or recurrence while patients are well (in remission) would allow the identification of high‐risk individuals and may improve overall treatment outcomes for patients by enabling more efficient allocation of interventions to prevent relapse and recurrence. 
Objectives
To summarise the predictive performance of prognostic models developed to predict the risk of relapse, recurrence, sustained remission or recovery in adults with major depressive disorder who meet criteria for remission or recovery. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (current issue); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 onwards); Ovid Embase (1980 onwards); Ovid PsycINFO (1806 onwards); and Web of Science (1900 onwards) up to May 2020. We also searched sources of grey literature, screened the reference lists of included studies and performed a forward citation search. There were no restrictions applied to the searches by date, language or publication status . 
Selection criteria
We included development and external validation (testing model performance in data separate from the development data) studies of any multivariable prognostic models (including two or more predictors) to predict relapse, recurrence, sustained remission, or recovery in adults (aged 18 years and over) with remitted depression, in any clinical setting. We included all study designs and accepted all definitions of relapse, recurrence and other related outcomes. We did not specify a comparator prognostic model. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references; extracted data (using a template based on the CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS)); and assessed risks of bias of included studies (using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST)). We referred any disagreements to a third independent review author. Where we found sufficient (10 or more) external validation studies of an individual model, we planned to perform a meta‐analysis of its predictive performance, specifically with respect to its calibration (how well the predicted probabilities match the observed proportions of individuals that experience the outcome) and discrimination (the ability of the model to differentiate between those with and without the outcome). Recommendations could not be qualified using the GRADE system, as guidance is not yet available for prognostic model reviews. 
Main results
We identified 11 eligible prognostic model studies (10 unique prognostic models). Seven were model development studies; three were model development and external validation studies; and one was an external validation‐only study. Multiple estimates of performance measures were not available for any of the models and, meta‐analysis was therefore not possible. Ten out of the 11 included studies were assessed as being at high overall risk of bias. Common weaknesses included insufficient sample size, inappropriate handling of missing data and lack of information about discrimination and calibration. One paper (Klein 2018) was at low overall risk of bias and presented a prognostic model including the following predictors: number of previous depressive episodes, residual depressive symptoms and severity of the last depressive episode. The external predictive performance of this model was poor (C‐statistic 0.59; calibration slope 0.56; confidence intervals not reported). None of the identified studies examined the clinical utility (net benefit) of the developed model. 
Authors' conclusions
Of the 10 prognostic models identified (across 11 studies), only four underwent external validation. Most of the studies (n = 10) were assessed as being at high overall risk of bias, and the one study that was at low risk of bias presented a model with poor predictive performance. There is a need for improved prognostic research in this clinical area, with future studies conforming to current best practice recommendations for prognostic model development/validation and reporting findings in line with the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement.

Can risk tools tell if depression will come back?

2. Rationale
Depression is common. Many people get better with care. But for some, low mood comes back. This can happen soon after they feel a bit better. That is called relapse. It can also happen after they feel well for a time. That is called recurrence.

When depression returns, life gets hard again. Work, school, and home life can suffer. People may need more care. This can take time and money. It can also cause fear and stress.

Doctors want to know who is most at risk. If we can tell who is at high risk, we can act early. Extra visits, talk care, or other steps may help. One idea is to use a risk tool. A risk tool uses more than one fact about a person. It may use past number of episodes and current mood signs. It then gives a person’s chance of relapse or recurrence.

This review asked a clear question. How well do these risk tools work in adults who feel well now? The hope was to find tools that work in real life. If a tool works, doctors could use it to guide care. This study did not test a drug. It looked at tools that try to predict risk.

3. Trial Design
This was a research review, not a single trial. The team looked for all studies of risk tools. They searched many research libraries. They also looked at other sources. They searched up to May of 2020. They did not limit by date, language, or if the study was in print.

The team set clear rules. They included studies of adults age 18 or more. Each person had major depression before but was now in remission or recovery. The studies had to test tools with two or more facts as inputs. The tools had to try to predict relapse, recurrence, staying well, or full recovery. The care setting did not matter.

Two team members checked each study. They took out the key facts. They also rated how strong and fair each study was. They used set checklists to do this. A third person helped if they did not agree.

The team planned to pool results for a tool if they could. To do that, they needed at least ten tests of the same tool in new groups. That did not happen. Time in each study varied and was not the focus here. This review did not enroll new patients. So, there was no study visit time for patients.

4. Results
The team found 11 studies. These studies made or tested 10 unique risk tools. Seven studies built a new tool. Three studies built a tool and also tried it in a new group. One study only tried a tool made by others.

Most studies were not strong. Ten of the 11 had high risk of bias. This means there were problems in how the study ran. Many had too few people. Many did not handle missing data well. Many gave little on how well the tool worked. They did not show if the tool could sort high and low risk. They also did not show if the tool’s risk score matched real life.

Only one study had low risk of bias. It was by Klein in 2018. That tool used three facts. It used the number of past episodes. It used how strong the last episode was. It used any leftover mood signs after care. But this tool did not work well when tried in a new group. It was only a bit better than chance.

No study asked a key real life question. Would use of the tool help people feel better? Would it cut relapse? Would it help doctors use time and care better? None of the studies checked this.

What does this mean for patients? At this time, risk tools for return of depression are not ready to use. They do not give a clear and true risk score. They have not shown they help you stay well. Doctors should still use known good care. This may include follow up visits, talk care, and healthy habits. You and your doctor can also watch for early signs. You should ask for help right away if signs return.

What does this mean for research? We need better tools and better tests. Future studies need more people and good data steps. They should test the tools in new groups. They should also test if use of the tool helps real people. Reports should be clear and full. This will help doctors and patients trust and use the results.

In sum, the idea of risk tools is good. But the tools we have do not work well yet. We need stronger work so that care can be smarter and more timely. Until then, close care and fast action if signs return may help most.","Predicting relapse or recurrence of depression
What is the aim of this review? 
Relapse and recurrence (becoming unwell again after making an improvement) are common in depression and lead to increased disability and decreased quality of life for patients. Relapse is a re‐emergence of the initial episode of depression after some initial improvement, whereas recurrence is the onset of a new episode of depression after recovery. Outcomes, such as relapse and recurrence, can sometimes be predicted while people are well, using information available at the time. A mathematical calculation can be performed to assess an individual person's risk; this calculation is known as a 'prognostic model' or a prediction tool. In most health services, including the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, resources such as doctors and therapists need to be used in the best way possible, for the people who will gain the most benefit from them. If accurate prediction tools are available, the information can be used to identify the most 'high risk' patients and make sure they receive additional support to try to prevent a relapse or a recurrence. 
The aim of this review was to identify studies that have attempted to develop a prediction tool for relapse or recurrence of depression in adults. We were interested in studies that had attempted to make this prediction while patients were well. We also included tools that predicted the chance of patients staying well. If we had found multiple studies that tested the same prediction tool, we planned to combine these to work out a better summary of how well that tool worked. 
Key messages 
We identified 10 prediction tools (over 11 studies) for relapse or recurrence. These were either not proven to be good at predicting relapse/recurrence, or the studies had problems with how they were carried out, meaning that none of the prediction tools were at a stage where they could be used in the real world. Further work is needed to improve prediction of relapse or recurrence of depression. 
What was studied in the review? 
We collected and analysed the results of 11 relevant studies. We were interested in several things: how researchers had defined relapse and recurrence (for example, whether they had used clinical interviews or self‐report questionnaires to diagnose depressive symptoms); what information was gathered to help make predictions; the techniques used by the researchers to help develop the tools; and how well the tools predicted. We were also interested in whether the tools were tested in a separate group of participants, which is essential to ensure that the model can predict accurately in patients in the real world. 
Finally, we assessed the studies to determine how confident we could be in the results, given the approaches taken by researchers (this is called 'risk of bias') and how relevant the studies were to our review (this is called 'applicability'). 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 11 studies. Ten of these developed different models and one study tested one of the models developed in a previous study. It was not possible to combine results for any particular tool. 
Ten of the 11 studies were rated at high risk of bias. This means that we cannot be confident in the results that were presented, due to some issues with the way the studies were conducted. The most common issue was that there were not enough participants included in the studies. Other common problems involved the statistical approaches used by the researchers. 
One study was at low overall risk of bias, which means that we can be more confident in trusting the results. However, this tool did not make accurate predictions about relapse or recurrence. 
We found no studies that could be used in clinical practice; further work is needed to develop tools for predicting relapse or recurrence of depression. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
The literature search for this review was completed in May 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD009949.pub2,"Aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fractures
What is a radial head fracture? 
The radial head is the topmost part of the radius, which is one of the two forearm bones. The radial head is part of the elbow joint. Fracture or breaking of the radial head is the most common elbow fracture. This injury usually results from a fall onto an outstretched arm. The symptoms of a radial head fracture are pain, swelling and bruising around the elbow, as well as restricted movement. 
What is aspiration? 
One treatment for radial head fracture is aspiration. This is a procedure where a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain excess fluid and blood from the elbow joint to relieve pressure and thus, in theory, relieve pain and improve clinical outcome. However, aspiration is an invasive procedure that puts the patient at further risk of complications, such as infection and injury to nerves and vessels. The procedure is typically done in the first few days after injury. 
Aim of the review 
We aimed to assess the effects (benefits and harms) of aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fracture in adults. 
Description of the studies included in the review  We searched the medical literature up to April 2014 and found two relevant studies that reported results for a total of 108 people with radial head fractures. Most participants were adults, aged 30 or over. They generally had less serious fractures and were all treated without surgery. The two studies were small, poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Neither study used reliable measures to assess function or pain. Consequently, we are very unsure of the findings of these trials. 
Summary of the evidence 
Very low quality evidence showed little difference between those who had joint aspiration and those who did not in being unable to carry heavy loads or having discomfort when carrying loads using their previously injured arm at one year after injury. Very low quality evidence shows that aspiration often provides immediate pain relief and may still provide pain relief at three weeks. Neither trial reported on adverse events from the procedure, but aspiration was reported as being unsuccessful in three participants of one study. Very low quality evidence shows little effect of aspiration on being able to extend the elbow at either six weeks or one year. The reporting of adverse events was incomplete, but one trial reported the absence of three common complications of radial head fractures. 
Conclusions 
Overall, there is not enough evidence to say whether aspiration gives better short‐term or longer‐term results than no aspiration in treating radial head fractures or how safe it is. We suggest that further research is needed to examine the use of aspiration for the initial treatment of radial head fractures.

Should your elbow be drained after a radial head break?

Rationale
A radial head break is a crack in a forearm bone near the elbow. It often happens after a fall on an outstretched arm. It can cause pain, swelling, and bruising. It can make the elbow hard to move. This injury is the most common elbow break.

Some care plans use rest, a sling, and early gentle move. Some people may need surgery, but many do not. Another option is to drain the elbow joint. Doctors call this “aspiration.” They use a clean needle and syringe to draw out extra blood and fluid.

Draining the joint may lower pressure in the elbow. That may ease pain right away. It may also help with move and daily use. This is why some doctors offer it in the first few days. But we need to know if it truly helps.

There are risks with a needle in a joint. These may include infection. There is also a small risk to nearby nerves and blood vessels. We must weigh these risks and any gain in pain or use. We need strong studies to guide care.

Trial Design
We looked at past studies on this topic. We searched medical reports up to April of 2014. We found two small studies that fit our plan. They included 108 people with a radial head break. Most people were age 30 or more.

The breaks in these people were not severe. None of the people had surgery. The studies compared a drain of the joint with no drain. Each person was followed for a set time. Some were checked at weeks, and some at one year.

The study reports did not give gender details. The reports did not explain methods well. They did not use good, clear ways to rate pain or arm use. This makes the data weak. So the results are hard to trust.

Results
We found signs that a drain can help pain right away. Many people felt less pain soon after the drain. Some still felt less pain at three weeks. But this proof was very weak. The methods in the studies were not strong.

At one year, the two groups were much the same. People who had a drain and people who did not had similar arm use. They were alike in lifting and carrying heavy things. They were also alike in comfort when they carried things. Any small gaps were not clear or sure.

We also looked at how straight the elbow could get. At six weeks, the groups were much the same. At one year, the groups were still much the same. A drain did not seem to help elbow straightening. Again, the proof here was very weak.

Safety is key for any joint needle use. The studies did not report harms in detail. One study said the drain did not work in three people. One study said three common elbow problems did not occur. But we still do not know the full risk.

What does this mean for you? A drain may give quick pain relief. That may help in the first days or weeks. But we do not know if it helps in the long term. We also do not know the true risk of harms.

This review helps show what we know and do not know. It can guide a talk with your doctor. You can weigh fast pain relief against unknown risks. You can also ask about other safe pain care. Rest, ice, and gentle move may help.

We need better research in this area. Future studies should enroll more people. They should use clear, good ways to rate pain and arm use. They should track harms in a careful way. They should follow people for at least one year.

In short, we can not say a drain is better than no drain. We can not say it is safer. We can only say it may help pain soon after the break. If you face this choice, ask about goals, risks, and other care. Your care plan should fit your needs and values.","Aspiration of the elbow joint for treating radial head fractures

10.1002-14651858.CD013724.pub2,"Background
Remote cognitive assessments are increasingly needed to assist in the detection of cognitive disorders, but the diagnostic accuracy of telephone‐ and video‐based cognitive screening remains unclear. 
Objectives
To assess the test accuracy of any multidomain cognitive test delivered remotely for the diagnosis of any form of dementia. 
To assess for potential differences in cognitive test scoring when using a remote platform, and where a remote screener was compared to the equivalent face‐to‐face test. 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov/) databases on 2 June 2021. We performed forward and backward searching of included citations. 
Selection criteria
We included cross‐sectional studies, where a remote, multidomain assessment was administered alongside a clinical diagnosis of dementia or equivalent face‐to‐face test. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data; a third review author moderated disagreements. Our primary analysis was the accuracy of remote assessments against a clinical diagnosis of dementia. Where data were available, we reported test accuracy as sensitivity and specificity. We did not perform quantitative meta‐analysis as there were too few studies at individual test level. 
For those studies comparing remote versus in‐person use of an equivalent screening test, if data allowed, we described correlations, reliability, differences in scores and the proportion classified as having cognitive impairment for each test. 
Main results
The review contains 31 studies (19 differing tests, 3075 participants), of which seven studies (six telephone, one video call, 756 participants) were relevant to our primary objective of describing test accuracy against a clinical diagnosis of dementia. All studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain, but were low risk in applicability to the review question. Overall, sensitivity of remote tools varied with values between 26% and 100%, and specificity between 65% and 100%, with no clearly superior test. 
Across the 24 papers comparing equivalent remote and in‐person tests (14 telephone, 10 video call), agreement between tests was good, but rarely perfect (correlation coefficient range: 0.48 to 0.98). 
Authors' conclusions
Despite the common and increasing use of remote cognitive assessment, supporting evidence on test accuracy is limited. Available data do not allow us to suggest a preferred test. Remote testing is complex, and this is reflected in the heterogeneity seen in tests used, their application, and their analysis. More research is needed to describe accuracy of contemporary approaches to remote cognitive assessment. While data comparing remote and in‐person use of a test were reassuring, thresholds and scoring rules derived from in‐person testing may not be applicable when the equivalent test is adapted for remote use.

How well do phone or video memory tests find dementia?

Rationale
Dementia harms memory, thinking, and daily life. It can make work and home life hard. It also adds stress for family and care teams. Early find and care can help.

Doctors use short tests to check thinking and memory. Many people cannot go to a clinic for these tests. Phone and video tests can help fill that gap. Use of these tests is on the rise.

But we do not know how well these remote tests work. Some may miss people who have dementia. Some may say there is a problem when there is not. We need facts to guide care.

This study had two main goals. First, to learn how well remote tests find dementia. Second, to see if remote test scores match in‑person scores. No drugs were tested in this study.

Trial Design
This was a review of past research. The team looked for all the good studies on this topic. They searched many data banks on June 2, 2021. They also checked the lists of papers in those studies.

They picked cross‑sectional studies. That means each person took the test once. The test was by phone or by video. The tests checked more than one thinking skill, like memory and speech.

Some studies also used a clinic visit. A doctor gave a face‑to‑face test. Or a doctor gave a diagnosis of dementia. This gave a standard to judge the remote test.

Two team members took notes on each study. A third member helped when they did not agree. They checked each study for limits that could sway results. They did not pool the data in one big math mix, as tests differed a lot.

The team planned two main checks. First, how well remote tests spot dementia. Second, how remote scores match the same test done in person. They also noted how many people each test marked as “low.”

In all, they found 31 studies. These used 19 different tests. There were 3075 people in all. Fourteen studies used phone forms and ten used video forms for score match checks.

Results
Seven studies fit the main goal on accuracy. Six used phone tests. One used a video call. In these, 756 people took part.

How well tests found dementia was not the same. Some tests found most people who had it. Some missed many people who had it. No test stood out as the best.

Some tests also gave wrong alarms. That means they said a person had a problem when they did not. The rate of wrong calls was not the same across tests. Again, no clear best test.

Many studies had limits that may sway results. So, trust in the numbers is not very strong. But the kinds of tests and people did match the review goal. The topic fit the real world need.

The team also looked at remote and in‑person forms of the same test. They found the scores tended to match well. But the match was not perfect. This was true for phone and for video.

Fourteen studies used phone forms for this match check. Ten studies used video forms for this. These also showed a good, but not perfect, match. So, how we give the test can change the score.

The tests were not all the same. They checked different skills. People took them in different ways and places. The rules to score them also varied.

This makes it hard to sum up the data. It also makes it hard to pick one top test. For this reason, the team did not pool results into one number. They told a clear story instead.

What does this mean for care? Remote tests can help when a visit is hard. They may serve as a first step. But we should take care in how we use the scores.

Cut‑off rules from clinic tests may not work for remote tests. A score that flags a problem in person may not flag the same by phone. Or it may flag too many. Doctors should keep this in mind.

We need more and better studies. New work should use clear ways to judge accuracy. It should test newer tools as well. It should look at both phone and video ways.

For patients, here is the key point. A phone or video test can be useful. It may show a need for more checks. It should not be the only step to judge brain health.

In sum, remote tests show promise. But proof on accuracy is still thin. No one test is best yet. Care teams should use them with care and follow up as needed.","How accurate are remote, virtual assessments at diagnosing dementia?
Why is this question important? 
Dementia is a chronic and progressive condition that affects peoples' memory and ability to function day‐to‐day. A clinical diagnosis of dementia usually involves brain scans, physical examinations and history taking. As a first step, we often use memory and thinking tests to identify people who need further assessment. Traditionally these tests are performed in‐person, but modifications of the tests allow them to be used over the telephone or via video calls – sometimes called 'remote assessment'. 
The need for remote assessment has become particularly urgent due to COVID‐19. However, there are potential benefits of remote assessment beyond the COVID‐19 pandemic. Physically attending appointments can be difficult for some people and remote assessments offer greater convenience. Remote assessments are also useful in research, as a large number of people can be reached in a fairly short amount of time. 
A test delivered by telephone may not be as good as the in‐person equivalent, and getting these tests right is important. One the one hand, If a test suggests someone has dementia when they do not (called a false positive), this can have an emotional impact on the person and their family. On the other hand, not identifying memory and thinking problems when they are present (called a false negative), mean that the person does not get the treatment and support that they need. 
What was the aim of this review? 
We aimed to assess whether memory and thinking tests carried out by telephone or video call can detect dementia. 
What was studied in this review? 
We looked at various memory and thinking tests. Many tests have been developed over time and they differ in their content and application, but most are based on a modification of a traditional in‐person test. 
What were the main results of this review? 
The review included 31 studies, using 19 different memory tests, with a total of 3075 participants. 
Only seven tests were relevant to our question regarding accuracy of remote testing. With the limited number of studies, estimates on the accuracy of these tests are imprecise. Our review suggests that remote tests could correctly identify people with dementia between 26% and 100% of the time, and could correctly rule out dementia 65% to 100% of the time. 
The remaining 24 studies compared a remote test with the face‐to‐face equivalent. These studies suggested that remote test scores usually agreed with in‐person testing, but this was not perfect. 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
In these studies, a clinical diagnosis of dementia was used as the reference (gold) standard. We identified a number of issues in the design, conduct and reporting of the studies. A particular issue was around the selection of participants for the studies. Studies often did not include people with hearing or language impairments that may have complicated remote testing. 
Who do the results of this study apply to? 
Most studies investigated older adults (over 65 years). The findings may not be representative of all older adults with dementia, as some studies only examined specific groups of people, for example, after stroke. The studies were usually performed in specialist centres by experts. So, we do not know how well these tests identify dementia in routine community practice. 
What are the implications of this review? 
The review highlights the lack of high‐quality research describing accuracy of telephone‐ and video call‐based memory and thinking tests. There were many differences between the studies included in this review such as the type of test used, participants included, the setting in which the study is carried out and language studied. This made comparisons between studies difficult. Our review suggests that remote assessments and in‐person assessments are not always equivalent. In situations where access to in‐person assessment is difficult, remote testing could be used as a useful first step. Ideally, this should be followed up with an in‐person assessment before a diagnosis is made. Due to limited studies, and differences in the way studies were carried out, we cannot recommend one particular remote test for the assessment of dementia.

10.1002-14651858.CD012129.pub3,"Aspirin (single dose) for relief of perineal pain after childbirth
What is the issue? 
Can aspirin be given to women who experience perineal pain following childbirth to relieve the pain, without causing side effects for either the women or their babies? 
Why is this important? 
Many women experience pain in the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus) following childbirth. The perineum may be bruised or torn during childbirth, or have a cut made to help the baby to be born (an episiotomy). After childbirth, perineal pain can interfere with women's ability to care for their newborns and establish breastfeeding. If perineal pain is not relieved effectively, longer‐term problems for women may include painful sexual intercourse, pelvic floor problems resulting in incontinence, prolapse, or chronic perineal pain. Aspirin may be given to women who have perineal pain after childbirth, but its effectiveness and safety had not been assessed in a systematic review. This is an update of a review last published in 2017. This is part of a series of reviews looking at drugs to help relieve perineal pain in first few weeks after childbirth. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in October 2019, and included 17 randomised controlled studies, involving 1132 women, published between 1967 and 1997. All women had perineal pain following an episiotomy (usually within 48 hours after birth), and were not breastfeeding. The women received either aspirin (doses ranging from 300 mg to 1200 mg) or fake pills (placebo), by mouth. The methodological quality of the studies was often unclear. Two studies did not contribute any data for analyses. 
Aspirin compared with placebo may increase adequate pain relief for mothers four to eight hours after administration (low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether aspirin compared with placebo has an effect on the need for additional pain relief, or on adverse effects for mothers, in the four to eight hours after administration (both very low‐certainty evidence). 
The effects of administering 300 mg versus 600 mg aspirin (1 study), 600 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (2 studies), or 300 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (1 study) are uncertain for adequate pain relief, the need for additional pain relief, or adverse effects for the mother. 
No studies reported on adverse effects of aspirin for the baby, or other outcomes we planned to assess: prolonged hospital stay, or readmission to hospital due to perineal pain; perineal pain six weeks after childbirth, women's views, or postpartum depression. 
What does this mean? 
A single dose of aspirin may help with perineal pain following episiotomy for women who are not breastfeeding, when measured four to eight hours after administration. 
We found no information to assess the effects of aspirin for women who are breastfeeding.

Can one dose of aspirin help pain after birth?

Rationale
Many women have pain after birth in the perineum. The perineum is the area between the vagina and the anus. It can bruise, tear, or be cut to help the baby be born. This cut is called an episiotomy.

This pain can make care of the baby hard. It can make breast milk start slow. It can make sex hurt later on. It can also lead to pee or bowel leaks, or long term pain.

We need safe and fast pain relief. Aspirin is a common pain pill. It can help with mild to medium pain. But we did not know if one dose helps this kind of pain.

The team set out to look at this. They asked if one dose of aspirin helps pain. They also asked if it caused harms to moms or babies. They checked past trials to find the facts.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. The team looked for trials where women were put in groups by chance. One group got aspirin by mouth. The other group got a fake pill. A fake pill is also called a placebo.

The search was done in October 2019. The review found 17 trials. These trials were done from 1967 to 1997. The trials had 1132 women in all.

All women had perineal pain after an episiotomy. Most had the pain in the first two days after birth. None of the women were breast feeding. That means they were not giving milk from the breast.

Women got only one dose of aspirin. The dose range was 300 to 1200 milligrams. A milligram is a small unit to measure drug amount. The pills were taken by mouth.

The trials then checked pain relief. They checked it four to eight hours after the dose. Some trials also checked if women needed extra pain help. Some checked if the women had side effects.

The trials did not give ages for the women. They did not say how long each woman stayed in a trial. But the check on pain was in the first eight hours. So, time in a trial was short.

Results
The team found that one dose of aspirin may help. More women had enough pain relief with aspirin than with a fake pill. This was seen four to eight hours after the dose. So, aspirin may bring short term relief.

But the proof was not strong. Many trials did not give clear details. So we cannot be sure how well aspirin worked. We can say it may help in the short term.

We do not know if aspirin cut the need for more pain pills. The trials did not prove this either way. So we cannot say if women needed fewer extra pills. The proof there was also weak.

We also do not know much about side effects for moms. The trials did not show clear harm in the first eight hours. But the data were not strong. So we cannot say if aspirin did or did not cause side effects.

No trial told us about side effects in babies. No trial told us about a longer stay in the hospital. No trial told us about a new hospital visit due to pain. No trial told us about pain at six weeks, mood after birth, or what women thought.

We also do not know the best dose. Some trials tried 300 vs 600 milligrams. Some tried 600 vs 1200 milligrams. Some tried 300 vs 1200 milligrams. None could show a clear best dose.

All women in these trials were not breast feeding. So we do not know if aspirin helps women who do breast feed. We also do not know if it is safe for them or their babies.

What does this mean? A single aspirin dose may help pain after an episiotomy. The help may last for four to eight hours. This may make it easier to care for the baby. It may help women move and sit with less pain.

But we need better trials. We need clear data on side effects in moms and babies. We need to know if women need fewer extra pills. We need to know if pain stays less in the weeks after birth.

This review is an update of a 2017 review. It is part of a set of reviews on drugs for this pain. It pulls many trials into one place. It helps us see what we know and what we do not know.

In short, one dose of aspirin may help some women who are not breast feeding. It may ease pain after a birth cut. But we still need strong proof on safety and dose. And we need data for women who do breast feed.","Aspirin (single dose) for relief of perineal pain after childbirth
What is the issue? 
Can aspirin be given to women who experience perineal pain following childbirth to relieve the pain, without causing side effects for either the women or their babies? 
Why is this important? 
Many women experience pain in the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus) following childbirth. The perineum may be bruised or torn during childbirth, or have a cut made to help the baby to be born (an episiotomy). After childbirth, perineal pain can interfere with women's ability to care for their newborns and establish breastfeeding. If perineal pain is not relieved effectively, longer‐term problems for women may include painful sexual intercourse, pelvic floor problems resulting in incontinence, prolapse, or chronic perineal pain. Aspirin may be given to women who have perineal pain after childbirth, but its effectiveness and safety had not been assessed in a systematic review. This is an update of a review last published in 2017. This is part of a series of reviews looking at drugs to help relieve perineal pain in first few weeks after childbirth. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in October 2019, and included 17 randomised controlled studies, involving 1132 women, published between 1967 and 1997. All women had perineal pain following an episiotomy (usually within 48 hours after birth), and were not breastfeeding. The women received either aspirin (doses ranging from 300 mg to 1200 mg) or fake pills (placebo), by mouth. The methodological quality of the studies was often unclear. Two studies did not contribute any data for analyses. 
Aspirin compared with placebo may increase adequate pain relief for mothers four to eight hours after administration (low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether aspirin compared with placebo has an effect on the need for additional pain relief, or on adverse effects for mothers, in the four to eight hours after administration (both very low‐certainty evidence). 
The effects of administering 300 mg versus 600 mg aspirin (1 study), 600 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (2 studies), or 300 mg versus 1200 mg aspirin (1 study) are uncertain for adequate pain relief, the need for additional pain relief, or adverse effects for the mother. 
No studies reported on adverse effects of aspirin for the baby, or other outcomes we planned to assess: prolonged hospital stay, or readmission to hospital due to perineal pain; perineal pain six weeks after childbirth, women's views, or postpartum depression. 
What does this mean? 
A single dose of aspirin may help with perineal pain following episiotomy for women who are not breastfeeding, when measured four to eight hours after administration. 
We found no information to assess the effects of aspirin for women who are breastfeeding.

An arteriovenous access consists of a direct surgical connection between an artery and a vein in the arm (fistula) or a plastic conduit connecting an artery and a vein (graft). If these forms of access become dysfunctional the delivery of dialysis therapy becomes suboptimal. The most common cause of access dysfunction is the development of a restriction or conduit narrowing called 'stenosis'. Because early correction of stenosis is considered critical to maintain the patency (openness) of the access and prolong its use, guidelines recommend regular surveillance of the access (i.e. screening based on diagnostic tests) in addition to or instead of a physical exam (clinical monitoring) to identify and treat early lesions. 
In this review we included 14 studies, randomising 1390 participants to either a pre‐emptive correction of an access stenosis (i.e. before the access became dysfunctional) or a deferred correction of an access stenosis (i.e. if and when the access became dysfunctional). This review shows that pre‐emptive correction of an arteriovenous access stenosis does not improve longevity of the access overall. In people using grafts pre‐emptive correction does not reduce the risk of thrombosis or access loss. In people using fistulas pre‐emptive stenosis correction reduces the risk of thrombosis and may prolong the longevity of the access. However, this surveillance and pre‐emptive correction strategy may increase the number of access‐related procedures and procedure‐related adverse events. 
This systematic review presents, to clinicians and patients, evidence‐based data that do not support the use of access surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of stenosis in grafts. Although surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of stenosis reduce the risk of thrombosis and may reduce the risk of access loss in fistulas, they may also increase the risk of procedure‐related adverse events and health‐care cost. Large multicentre clinical trials are necessary in this patient population to better clarify potential harms and expected benefits of routine surveillance and pre‐emptive correction of fistula stenosis.

Fixing narrow spots in dialysis access: is early repair worth it?

Rationale
People on dialysis need a good blood access in the arm. This access can be a fistula or a graft. A fistula joins an artery and a vein by surgery. A graft is a soft tube that links an artery and a vein.

Over time, the access can grow narrow. Doctors call this a stenosis. A narrow spot can slow blood flow. It can lead to a clot. A clot is a block in the access. A clot can cause the access to fail.

Many teams use regular tests to look for narrow spots. This is called “surveillance.” They may fix a narrow spot early, before trouble starts. This is called “pre‑emptive repair.” Others wait and fix the access only when it fails. This is called “deferred repair.”

This review asked a clear question. Does early repair help the access last longer? Does it lower clots or loss of the access? The team also looked for harms from more tests and more fixes. This study is needed to guide day to day care.

Trial Design
This was a review of past research. It pooled results from many trials. It looked only at trials that used chance to assign care. In each trial, people went by chance to early repair or to wait‑and‑repair.

The review found 14 trials. In all, they included 1,390 people. All had a dialysis access in the arm. Some had fistulas. Some had grafts.

The trials studied people on hemodialysis. They looked at how long the access lasted. They also tracked clots and loss of the access. The abstract did not list ages or gender. It did not list how long each person was in a trial.

The trials used two care paths. One path used check‑ups and early repair of narrow spots. The other path fixed the access only when it failed. The review compared these two paths.

Results
Across all people, early repair did not make the access last longer. In short, early repair did not help everyone. The benefit was not the same for fistulas and grafts. The type of access mattered a lot.

For people with grafts, early repair did not help. It did not lower clots. It did not lower the chance of losing the access. The review does not support routine check‑ups and early repair for grafts.

For people with fistulas, the story was different. Early repair lowered the chance of a clot. It may also help the fistula last longer. So, early repair may help some people with fistulas.

But early repair also had costs and harms. It led to more tests and more procedures. More procedures can bring more problems. These are called procedure‑related harms. Examples include pain, bleed, or infection. The review found more procedure‑related problems with early repair.

What do these results mean for you? If you have a graft, routine check‑ups and early repair do not seem to help. They add tests and steps with no clear gain. If you have a fistula, early repair may cut clots. It may help the access last. But it also means more tests and more fixes. Each fix can bring some risk.

These results matter to the field. They guide teams on when to act. They suggest we should not treat all access types the same. Care should match the type of access you have.

The review also looked at costs. More tests and more fixes can raise costs. This may strain you and the health system. We must weigh gains against harms and costs. That is key to good care.

The authors drew clear conclusions. They do not support routine check‑ups and early repair for grafts. For fistulas, early repair may help, but it has trade‑offs. Teams and patients should talk about these trade‑offs.

The authors also saw gaps in knowledge. We still need large, well run trials. These trials should follow people for long enough. They should track benefits and harms that matter to you. This will help us choose the best plan.

What should you do now? Ask your care team about your access type. Ask how they check for narrow spots. Ask how they decide to fix them. Share what matters most to you. This can include fewer clots, fewer steps, less pain, or lower cost.

In sum, one size does not fit all. Early repair did not help everyone. It did not help people with grafts. It may help some with fistulas. But it also brings more steps and some risk. More research will help us make better choices.","Pre‐emptive correction of stenosis of the arteriovenous access for haemodialysis

Can hypnosis help start labor? A review of what we know now

2. Rationale
Some women need help to start labor. This is called induction of labor. Doctors may use drugs or tools to start labor. These methods can work well. But they can also cause harm.

The womb may squeeze too hard or too often. There can be heavy bleeding. Some women may need surgery to deliver the baby. The mother or baby may get an infection. Because of these risks, people want safer options.

Hypnosis may be one such option. Hypnosis is deep calm and focus. A guide helps you tune out noise. You focus on a picture, a thought, or a feeling. Many women already use hypnosis to ease pain in labor.

Hypnosis may help lower fear. It may raise mood and trust in one’s body. Calm can help the body work well. If hypnosis can start labor, it may also save money for the health system. But we must test this idea.

This study asked a clear question. Can hypnosis help start labor? Can it do so in a safe way? We also need to know how long a session should be. We need to know who should guide it. We need to hear what women and staff think about it.

3. Trial Design
This was not a single trial. It was a review of trials. The team looked for fair tests. Fair tests are studies that compare groups by chance. This means chance picks who gets which care. That way, the groups are alike at the start.

The team searched for these fair tests of hypnosis to start labor. They wanted to find studies in women near the end of pregnancy. They looked for studies that tried to start labor. They looked for studies that used hypnosis as the method.

The plan was to compare hypnosis to usual care. Or to drugs or tools that start labor. The team also hoped to see if hypnosis helps women who feel very scared. They wanted to learn about safety and side effects.

No one took part in this review. It only summarized past work. It did not give any woman a study plan or care plan. There is no time in a study to report. The team could not describe how long a session should be. They could not describe how many sessions to try. That is because they did not find any trials.

4. Results
The main finding is simple. The team found no fair tests. They found no trials that used hypnosis to start labor. So we do not know if hypnosis helps start labor. We do not know if it is safe for this use.

We do know some things. Hypnosis can help some women cope with labor pain. It can help with fear and stress. It may help women feel in control. These facts are about pain and stress, not about starting labor. They do not prove that hypnosis can start labor.

This review shows a clear gap. We need fair tests of hypnosis for this use. These tests should compare hypnosis to usual care. They should also compare it to drugs and tools that start labor. The tests should include women who feel very scared. We need to plan how long each session should be. We need to plan when to use it. We need to train staff well. We should ask women and staff what they think of it.

There is also a key point on safety. Hypnosis should not delay needed care. If doctors wait while hypnosis is tried, that could cause harm. Any use of hypnosis should be case by case. The care team and the woman should discuss the plan. They should agree on a time limit. If labor does not start, they should move to standard care.

What does this mean for you? Hypnosis may help you feel calm. It may help with pain or fear in birth. But we do not know if it can start labor. No fair tests have shown that it works for that goal. We also do not know if it is safe for that goal.

This review helps the field by setting a path. It calls for good, fair trials. It lists what those trials should measure. It notes the need to hear from women and staff. It also warns to avoid delays in care.

The bottom line is clear. Hypnosis is a tool for calm and focus. It may help with fear and pain. But we do not know if it can start labor. More and better studies must test this. Until then, talk with your care team. Ask about your choices. Ask about risks and benefits. Make a plan that is right for you.","Hypnosis for induction of labour

10.1002-14651858.CD003147.pub5,"Using positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effect of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Background 
CF affects approximately one in 3000 live births in white populations and causes frequent lung infection, due to mucus blocking the airways. Chest physiotherapy is often used to try to clear the mucus from the lungs. We wanted to discover whether using a PEP device (a form of chest physiotherapy) was better or worse than other other forms of chest physiotherapy for clearing the mucus from the lungs in people with CF. A PEP device provides positive pressure behind the mucus to try to push it out of the lungs. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 20 February 2019.
Study characteristics 
The review includes 28 studies with 788 people (from infants to adults) with CF with mild to severe lung disease. The studies compared PEP to other methods of chest physiotherapy; the length of treatment ranged from a single session to two years of treatment. 
Key results 
Generally, the efficacy of PEP is similar to other methods of chest physiotherapy such as postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, oscillatory PEP devices such as the flutter and acapella, thoracic oscillating devices such as the 'Vest', and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) (typically used for ventilatory support, but by changing the inspiratory and expiratory pressures on the device and combining it with huffing, BiPaP has been used for airway clearance). We found no difference between PEP and other forms of chest physiotherapy in lung function, the amount of mucus cleared from the airways or its related effects on the health of people with CF. However, the rate of flare ups of respiratory symptoms decreased in people using PEP compared to other forms of physiotherapy such as a vibrating PEP device or a vibrating vest. There was some evidence that people with CF may prefer PEP to other chest physiotherapy methods. There was no evidence of PEP causing harm, except in one study where infants performing either PEP or percussion in various positions which use gravity to help drain secretions, experienced some gastro‐oesophageal reflux (regurgitation of food) in head‐down positions; this was more severe in the group using postural drainage with percussion. In all the other trials PEP was performed in a sitting position. 
In 10 of the 28 studies studied single PEP treatment sessions. The results from these studies are very limited as they could not report on the number of respiratory infections and lung function did not change with just one treatment. Two one‐year studies compared PEP to postural drainage and percussion; in the study with children, PEP improved their lung function, while in the adult study, lung function declined slightly with both PEP and postural drainage and percussion. Also, the method of performing PEP was different in the two age groups. 
Although PEP seems to have an advantage in reducing flare ups (based on the combined results of a few studies), different physiotherapy techniques and devices may be more or less effective at varying times and in different individuals during baseline function and chest flare ups. Each person should talk to their clinician to help choose which method of airway clearance is best for them and which they will adhere to, so as to provide the best quality of life and long‐term outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
Some studies were of low quality. These studies highlight the difficulty in comparing studies using PEP compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy. Factors such as age and severity of lung disease in the participants may affect the results as well as the method of performing each treatment. Overall, the evidence provided by this review for whether PEP reduces flare ups compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy was moderate to high quality, but evidence for other outcomes was of very low to moderate quality, as results were limited.

Can a PEP breathing device help people with cystic fibrosis clear mucus?

Rationale
Cystic fibrosis is a life‑long disease. It makes thick, sticky mucus in the lungs. This mucus blocks air flow and traps germs. People can get chest pain, cough, and lung infections.

Chest therapy can help move mucus out. One kind is PEP, or positive expiratory pressure. You blow out through a small device. It makes gentle back pressure in your airways.

That back pressure can push behind the mucus. Then you can huff and cough it out. PEP is easy to use while sitting. Many people can do it at home.

The main question was simple. Does PEP work better, worse, or the same as other chest therapy? The team also asked if PEP is safe. They looked for any harm or side effects.

This review was needed to guide care. Many chest tools and methods exist. People and clinics need clear facts to choose a plan. The goal was to help reduce flare ups and keep lungs as strong as they can be.

Trial Design
This was a review of many studies. The team searched for all good trials. They used studies up to 20 February 2019. They did not test a new drug.

They found 28 studies. These studies had 788 people with cystic fibrosis. People ranged from infants to adults. Lung disease ranged from mild to severe.

All studies compared PEP to other chest therapy. Other methods included chest clapping with head down. That is also called postural drainage and percussion.

They also compared PEP to other ways to breathe and clear. These were active cycle of breathing, which is a set of slow, deep, and huff breaths. They also studied autogenic drainage, a slow breath plan to move mucus. They looked at buzzing tools like the flutter and acapella that vibrate as you breathe out. They looked at a shaking chest vest. They also looked at a breathing machine with two pressure levels. With special settings and huffing, that machine can aid mucus move.

Time in the studies varied a lot. Ten studies tested a single PEP session. Two studies lasted one year. Other studies ranged up to two years.

Most people did PEP while sitting. One infant study used head‑down positions. That study also used chest clapping. That is important for safety notes.

Results
Overall, PEP worked as well as other chest therapy. Lung function was the same over time. Lung function means how well your lungs move air in and out. The amount of mucus cleared was also about the same.

PEP showed one clear edge in some trials. People had fewer chest flare ups while using PEP. A flare up means a spell when breathing gets worse. You may cough more and need extra care.

This benefit showed up when PEP was compared to some tools. These tools were a buzzing PEP device or a shaking vest. Fewer flare ups may mean fewer clinic trips. It may also mean a better day‑to‑day life.

Taste and fit also matter in long term care. Some people liked PEP more than other methods. A method you like is one you will use. That can help over the long run.

Safety was good in almost all studies. There was one concern in infants. In the head‑down position, some babies spit up more food or milk. This was worse with head‑down clapping than with PEP. In the other trials, people did PEP while sitting. No harm was seen in those sitting groups.

Results from single‑session studies were few. One PEP session did not change lung function. That makes sense, as chest care helps over time. You need regular care to get the most gain.

Two studies looked at a full year of care. One study in children found PEP led to better lung function. One study in adults found that lung function went down a little in both groups. In those two studies, people used PEP in different ways. This may explain some of the change.

Not all proof was strong. Ages and disease levels were mixed. People did the methods in different ways. These things can change results. The proof that PEP may cut flare ups was fairly strong. The proof for lung function and mucus amount was weaker.

What does this mean for you? PEP is one good choice for chest care. It seems to work as well as other ways. It may help cut the number of flare ups. It seems safe when used while sitting.

But no one method is best for all people at all times. Your needs can change with your health and age. A tool that helps today may not help as much in a flare. Your plan should fit your life and what you can keep doing.

Talk with your care team to choose a plan. Ask about PEP and other methods. Pick one you can and will use. That can help you feel better and stay well longer.","Using positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis

10.1002-14651858.CD009379.pub3,"Amniotic membrane transplantation for the treatment of ocular burns
How an ocular burn damages the eye 
The cornea is the transparent window of the eye that helps focus light to form an image of the outside world. For the cornea to remain transparent, it must have a healthy surface layer of epithelium, a stable tear film, and an absence of blood vessels. The epithelium is the moist cellular layer that covers the cornea, the white part of the eye, and the inside of the eyelids. The epithelium that covers the cornea is different from the epithelium of the conjunctiva. It is maintained in this state by a population of specialised stem cells found at the margin of the cornea (the limbus). In the normal eye, corneal epithelial cells slowly migrate from the limbus towards the centre of the cornea. 
A burn to the eye initially damages the surface epithelial layer, but it can also damage the deeper structures of the eye and the eyelids. A characteristic of an acute burn is an epithelial defect. This defect can fully recover after a minor burn. However, if the burn damages the stem cells of a segment of the limbus, the normal epithelium central to that area may not recover. The cornea is then covered by a functionally different type of epithelium derived from the peripheral conjunctiva, which may take weeks or months, and the cornea can become hazy and vascularised. In the absence of any epithelial covering, an additional risk is that the deeper tissues of the exposed cornea (stroma) may become progressively thinner and eventually perforate. The more extensive the damage to the limbus (measured in clock hours), the worse the outcome. The abnormal surface of the cornea, as well as haze and damage to structures within the eye (iris, lens, retina, optic nerve), can all lead to loss of vision. 
Treatments for ocular burns 
A burn to the surface of the eye is an emergency, and the eye must be washed immediately with water or saline to remove any chemical agents. The amount of damage to the epithelium (an epithelial defect) and the blood vessels at the edge of the cornea are measured, estimating the risk of future complications. The eye is then treated with medicines to reduce the risk of further complications and help the epithelial layer recover. Some doctors also use an amniotic tissue membrane placed over the surface of the eye. The amniotic membrane is the sac that surrounds a baby as it develops inside its mother. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to know whether using an amniotic membrane with medicines is better than just medicines. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies in which an amniotic membrane was used to treat eyes that had been burned. We then looked for studies comparing eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane patch with eyes treated using only medicines. We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which the treatment that people received was decided at random because these studies give the most reliable evidence about the effect of treatment. We assessed the treatment of moderate burns and severe burns separately, because they have different outcomes. We measured whether the treatment worked by comparing the proportion of eyes in which the epithelium over the cornea had failed to recover 21 days after the injury, visual function at the end of treatment, the presence of abnormal new blood vessels on the cornea, scarring between the cornea and the lids, the time taken for the epithelium to heal and adverse events in the intervention and control groups. We assessed the risk of bias in the randomised controlled study findings across pre‐specified domains. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to evaluate certainty of evidence include risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias.  
What we found 
We found two randomised controlled studies comparing the effect of medicines with the addition of an amniotic membrane patch inserted within seven days of the injury against medicines alone. One study suggested that treatment with amnion may be beneficial in moderate burns, but we found the certainty of the evidence to be low due to a high risk of bias and serious imprecision. For severe burns, there were no important differences between eyes that received an amniotic membrane and eyes that did not.  
Conclusions 
There is only uncertain evidence from randomised controlled studies of an important difference in healing between eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane within seven days of an ocular burn and eyes that are treated only with medicines. Further research is needed to identify the best treatment for acute burns to the eye to reduce the risk of potentially devastating consequences and visual loss.

","Plain Title:
Do birth sac membrane patches help heal burned eyes?

Rationale:
An eye burn is a medical emergency. It can cause pain and vision loss. The front window of the eye is the cornea. It must stay clear and smooth to see well.

The cornea has a thin, skin-like layer on top. This layer is the surface “skin” of the eye. Special cells at the rim of the cornea make new surface cells. These cells move in to keep the surface healthy.

A burn can harm this surface layer. It can also harm deeper parts of the eye and lids. If the special cells at the rim are hurt, the surface may not heal. New blood vessels may grow into the cornea. The cornea can turn hazy. In bad cases, the cornea can thin and form a hole.

Doctors rinse the eye right away. They use water or saline to wash out the burn. They then use medicines to protect the eye and help healing. Some doctors also place a patch on the eye from a birth sac. This is called an amniotic membrane. It is a thin layer from the sac around a baby before birth.

Experts wanted to test this patch. They asked a simple question. Does adding the patch to medicines help more than medicines alone? They hoped the patch could help the surface heal and protect sight. This study looked at the proof behind that hope.

Trial Design:
This was a careful review of past trials. The team looked for trials where people had an eye burn. They compared two groups. One group got the patch plus medicines. The other group got medicines alone. In these trials, the patch went on within seven days of the burn.

People got one of the two care plans by chance. This is called a random choice, like a coin toss. This type of trial helps give fair results. The review looked at moderate burns and severe burns on their own.

The teams checked key results. They checked if the eye surface healed by day 21. They checked vision at the end of care. They also checked for new blood vessels, scar tissue to the lid, and time to heal. They looked for side effects as well.

The reviewers also judged how strong the proof was. Small trials and weak methods can blur results. The search for trials ran through September 2021. People were in a trial at least 21 days. Some checks came later, at the end of care.

Results:
The review found two trials to compare. Both tested a patch plus medicines against medicines alone. The patch went on within seven days. Usual burn care went on in both groups.

The trials used clear goals to judge healing. The main check was the eye surface at day 21. The teams also looked at vision and other eye changes. They listed any bad effects seen.

For moderate burns, one study hinted at a gain. The patch might help healing in these eyes. But the proof was not strong. The groups were small. The trial plans had limits. So we cannot be sure the patch helps in moderate burns.

For severe burns, the results were alike between groups. Healing looked much the same. Vision and other signs also looked much the same. In these small trials, the patch did not show an edge. This means no clear added gain was seen for severe burns.

What do these results mean for patients? The patch might help in some moderate burns. But we do not know for sure. The current proof is not strong. For severe burns, the patch did not change results in these trials. Doctors should still rinse fast and give good burn care right away.

This review helps guide care today. It also shows where we need more data. Future trials should be larger and clearer. They should track healing, sight, and side effects over time. They should use fair and simple trial plans.

The bottom line is this. We do not have firm proof that the patch helps more than medicines alone. This is true for care in the first week after a burn. It is true for the two trials found. We need more good trials to be sure.

The search for trials went through September 2021. New studies may have come out since then. Ask your eye doctor what is best for you. Care can differ by burn type and how soon care starts. Fast rinse and early care still matter most.","Amniotic membrane transplantation for the treatment of ocular burns
How an ocular burn damages the eye 
The cornea is the transparent window of the eye that helps focus light to form an image of the outside world. For the cornea to remain transparent, it must have a healthy surface layer of epithelium, a stable tear film, and an absence of blood vessels. The epithelium is the moist cellular layer that covers the cornea, the white part of the eye, and the inside of the eyelids. The epithelium that covers the cornea is different from the epithelium of the conjunctiva. It is maintained in this state by a population of specialised stem cells found at the margin of the cornea (the limbus). In the normal eye, corneal epithelial cells slowly migrate from the limbus towards the centre of the cornea. 
A burn to the eye initially damages the surface epithelial layer, but it can also damage the deeper structures of the eye and the eyelids. A characteristic of an acute burn is an epithelial defect. This defect can fully recover after a minor burn. However, if the burn damages the stem cells of a segment of the limbus, the normal epithelium central to that area may not recover. The cornea is then covered by a functionally different type of epithelium derived from the peripheral conjunctiva, which may take weeks or months, and the cornea can become hazy and vascularised. In the absence of any epithelial covering, an additional risk is that the deeper tissues of the exposed cornea (stroma) may become progressively thinner and eventually perforate. The more extensive the damage to the limbus (measured in clock hours), the worse the outcome. The abnormal surface of the cornea, as well as haze and damage to structures within the eye (iris, lens, retina, optic nerve), can all lead to loss of vision. 
Treatments for ocular burns 
A burn to the surface of the eye is an emergency, and the eye must be washed immediately with water or saline to remove any chemical agents. The amount of damage to the epithelium (an epithelial defect) and the blood vessels at the edge of the cornea are measured, estimating the risk of future complications. The eye is then treated with medicines to reduce the risk of further complications and help the epithelial layer recover. Some doctors also use an amniotic tissue membrane placed over the surface of the eye. The amniotic membrane is the sac that surrounds a baby as it develops inside its mother. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to know whether using an amniotic membrane with medicines is better than just medicines. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies in which an amniotic membrane was used to treat eyes that had been burned. We then looked for studies comparing eyes treated with medicines and an amniotic membrane patch with eyes treated using only medicines. We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which the treatment that people received was decided at random because these studies give the most reliable evidence about the effect of treatment. We assessed the treatment of moderate burns and severe burns separately, because they have different outcomes. We measured whether the treatment worked by comparing the proportion of eyes in which the epithelium over the cornea had failed to recover 21 days after the injury, visual function at the end of treatment, the presence of abnormal new blood vessels on the cornea, scarring between the cornea and the lids, the time taken for the epithelium to heal and adverse events in the intervention and control groups. We assessed the risk of bias in the randomised controlled study findings across pre‐specified domains. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to evaluate certainty of evidence include risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias.

10.1002-14651858.CD013225.pub3,"Background
This is an updated version of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2019.
Catamenial epilepsy describes worsening seizures in relation to the menstrual cycle and may affect around 40% of women with epilepsy. Vulnerable days of the menstrual cycle for seizures are perimenstrually (C1 pattern), at ovulation (C2 pattern), and during the luteal phase (C3 pattern). A reduction in progesterone levels premenstrually and reduced secretion during the luteal phase is implicated in catamenial C1 and C3 patterns. A reduction in progesterone has been demonstrated to reduce sensitivity to the inhibitory neurotransmitter in preclinical studies, hence increasing risk of seizures. A pre‐ovulatory surge in oestrogen has been implicated in the C2 pattern of seizure exacerbation, although the exact mechanism by which this surge increases risk is uncertain. Current treatment practices include the use of pulsed hormonal (e.g. progesterone) and non‐hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) in women with regular menses, and complete cessation of menstruation using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone (Depo‐Provera) or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (triptorelin and goserelin)) in women with irregular menses. 
Catamenial epilepsy and seizure exacerbation is common in women with epilepsy. Women may not receive appropriate treatment for their seizures because of uncertainty regarding which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatment should be taken, as well as the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health. This review aims to address these issues to inform clinical practice and future research. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments for seizures exacerbated by the menstrual cycle in women with regular or irregular menses. We synthesised the evidence from randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments in women with catamenial epilepsy of any pattern. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases on 20 July 2021 for the latest update: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 19 July 2021). CRS Web includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the specialised registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Cochrane Epilepsy. We used no language restrictions. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional reports of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs and quasi‐RCTs of blinded or open‐label design that randomised participants individually (i.e. cluster‐randomised trials were excluded). We included cross‐over trials if each treatment period was at least 12 weeks in length and the trial had a suitable wash‐out period. We included the following types of interventions: women with any pattern of catamenial epilepsy who received a hormonal or non‐hormonal drug intervention in addition to an existing antiepileptic drug regimen for a minimum treatment duration of 12 weeks. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on study design factors and participant demographics for the included studies. The primary outcomes of interest were: proportion seizure‐free, proportion of responders (at least 50% decrease in seizure frequency from baseline), and change in seizure frequency. Secondary outcomes included: number of withdrawals, number of women experiencing adverse events of interest (seizure exacerbation, cardiac events, thromboembolic events, osteoporosis and bone health, mood disorders, sedation, menstrual cycle disorders, and fertility issues), and quality of life outcomes. 
Main results
Following title, abstract, and full‐text screening, we included eight full‐text articles reporting on four double‐blind, placebo‐controlled RCTs. We included two cross‐over RCTs of pulsed norethisterone, and two parallel RCTs of pulsed progesterone recruiting a total of 192 women aged between 13 and 45 years with catamenial epilepsy. We found no RCTs for non‐hormonal treatments of catamenial epilepsy or for women with irregular menses. 
Meta‐analysis was not possible for the primary outcomes, therefore we undertook a narrative synthesis. For the two RCTs evaluating norethisterone versus placebo (24 participants), there were no reported treatment differences for change in seizure frequency. Outcomes for the proportion seizure‐free and 50% responders were not reported. For the two RCTs evaluating progesterone versus placebo (168 participants), the studies reported conflicting results for the primary outcomes. One progesterone RCT reported no significant difference between progesterone 600 mg/day taken on day 14 to 28 and placebo with respect to 50% responders, seizure freedom rates, and change in seizure frequency for any seizure type. The other progesterone RCT reported a decrease in seizure frequency from baseline in the progesterone group that was significantly higher than the decrease in seizure frequency from baseline in the placebo group. 
The results of secondary efficacy outcomes showed no significant difference between groups in the pooled progesterone RCTs in terms of treatment withdrawal for any reason (pooled risk ratio (RR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 3.00, P = 0.18, I2 = 0%) or treatment withdrawals due to adverse events (pooled RR 2.91, 95% CI 0.53 to 16.17, P = 0.22, I2 = 0%). No treatment withdrawals were reported from the norethisterone RCTs. The RCTs reported limited information on adverse events, although one progesterone RCT reported no significant difference in the number of women experiencing adverse events (diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, headache, and depression). No studies reported on quality of life. 
We judged the evidence for outcomes related to the included progesterone RCTs to be of low to moderate certainty due to risk of bias, and for outcomes related to the included norethisterone RCTs to be of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and risk of bias. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides very low‐certainty evidence of no treatment difference between norethisterone and placebo, and moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence of no treatment difference between progesterone and placebo for catamenial epilepsy. However, as all the included studies were underpowered, important clinical effects cannot be ruled out. 
Our review highlights an overall deficiency in the literature base on the effectiveness of a wide range of other hormonal and non‐hormonal interventions currently being used in practice, particularly for those women who do not have regular menses. Further clinical trials are needed in this area.

Do hormone pills help seizures that get worse around a period?

Rationale
Some women have more seizures at certain times in their month. This is called catamenial epilepsy. It can happen near a period, mid cycle when the egg is released, or later in the cycle. About 4 in 10 women with epilepsy may have this pattern.

Body hormones may play a role. Progesterone is a hormone that can calm brain cells. When it drops before a period or stays low late in the cycle, seizures may rise. Oestrogen is a hormone that can make brain cells more active. A rise in oestrogen mid cycle may also link to more seizures. These shifts may help explain why seizures rise at those times.

Many people try hormone drugs to help. Some take extra progesterone for part of the month. Others take a pill like norethisterone, which is a lab-made form of a hormone. Some take other drugs for short times in the cycle. If periods are not regular, some use shots or other drugs to stop periods for a time. But we do not know what works best.

This study set out to test a key idea. If hormone shifts make seizures worse, can a hormone pill help? The goal was to see if these pills lower seizures, are safe, and when in the cycle to use them. This review aimed to give clear facts to guide care now and plan good studies next.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team looked for strong trials in many large study lists. They searched up to July 2021. They looked for trials where people were put into groups by chance. In these trials, some took a study pill and some took a dummy pill with no drug. This dummy pill is called a placebo. In “double‑blind” trials, the patient and the care team did not know which pill was which.

The review found four trials that fit the plan. Two trials tested a pill called norethisterone. Two trials tested progesterone. The trials used “pulsed” doses. That means women took the pills for part of each month. One trial gave progesterone from day 14 to day 28 of the cycle. In all trials, women kept taking their usual seizure drugs.

In total, 192 women took part. They were 13 to 45 years old. All had seizures that got worse with their cycle. These women had regular periods. The review did not find trials for women with irregular periods. It also did not find trials of non‑hormone drugs for this problem.

Each trial ran at least 12 weeks, or about 3 months. The review looked at key results. These were seizure‑free days, women who had at least half fewer seizures, and change in seizure count. The review also looked at people who stopped the study, side effects, and quality of life.

Results
The review could not pool the main results into one number. The trials were small and not all used the same measures.

For norethisterone, there were two small trials with 24 women in all. There was no clear gap between norethisterone and placebo in seizure counts. The trials did not report how many women were seizure‑free. They did not report how many had half fewer seizures.

For progesterone, there were two trials with 168 women in all. The two trials did not agree. One trial found no clear gap between progesterone and placebo. It saw no clear gap in seizure‑free days, in women with half fewer seizures, or in seizure counts. The other trial found a bigger drop in seizure counts from the start in the progesterone group than in the placebo group.

Side effects were much the same between groups in the progesterone trials. Few people stopped any study because of side effects. The norethisterone trials did not report people stopping early. One progesterone trial listed side effects like tummy upset, tiredness, cough and cold, dizzy spells, head pain, and low mood. It found no clear gap between groups. No trial reported on quality of life.

The strength of the proof was not high. For norethisterone, the proof was very weak. The trials were small and had risks that could skew results. For progesterone, the proof was low to moderate. There were some risks of bias. The trials were also small. This means we may have missed a true effect. Bigger and better trials could still show a clear benefit or harm.

What does this mean for patients? Right now, we do not know if pulsed progesterone helps most women with this problem. We also do not know if pulsed norethisterone helps. Some women in one progesterone trial did see fewer seizures. But another trial did not show a clear gain. So, the true effect is still not clear.

There are gaps in the proof. The review did not find good trials of other drugs often used in clinics. This includes short‑term use of drugs like clobazam or acetazolamide. It also includes shots like medroxyprogesterone or drugs that block hormones from the brain. The review found no trials for women with irregular periods.

In sum, this review found no clear win for norethisterone or progesterone over placebo. The trials were too small to be sure. More and larger trials are needed. Future work should test the best time in the month to take these drugs. It should also track side effects that matter in real life. These include mood, bone health, heart health, periods, and plans for a baby. This will help women and their care teams choose the best and safest care.","Treatments for seizures in catamenial (menstrual‐related) epilepsy
Background 
Catamenial (menstrual) epilepsy describes a worsening of seizures in relation to the menstrual cycle and may affect around 40% of women with epilepsy. There are specific times within the menstrual cycle when women are most at risk: in the days leading up to a menstrual period and during a menstrual period (perimenstrual or catamenial type 1 pattern); at the time of ovulation (catamenial type 2 pattern); and in the second half of their cycle (luteal phase, or catamenial type 3 pattern). The reason for this increased risk may relate to changes in the levels of progesterone (a hormone released by the ovaries) around the time of a menstrual period and oestrogen (a female sex hormone) surge around ovulation. Studies in animals have demonstrated that lower progesterone may affect how the brain reacts to the brain chemical gamma‐Aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is important in preventing seizures. The link between high levels of oestrogen and risk of seizures remains unclear. 
Current treatment of catamenial epilepsy depends on whether a woman has regular or irregular menstrual periods. If a woman has regular periods, hormonal (e.g. progesterone supplements) and non‐hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) taken prior to and during a period may be used. In women who do not have regular periods, and who therefore cannot predict their period days, stopping periods using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone (Depo‐Provera) or gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (triptorelin and goserelin)) are treatment options. 
Catamenial epilepsy is common in women with epilepsy, and may have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Women may not receive appropriate treatment for their catamenial seizures. There is uncertainty regarding which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatments should be taken. There are also concerns about the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health. This review aimed to address these issues in order to inform clinical practice and future research. 
Objectives 
The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments in stopping seizures in women with catamenial epilepsy. 
Methods 
We searched electronic databases to find relevant studies in which treatment was continued for at least 12 weeks. Our outcomes of interest were: average change in seizures, percentage of women achieving a reduction in seizures by at least 50%, and percentage of women who became seizure‐free. We also examined the reasons why women dropped out of the studies and any reported side effects. 
Results 
We included four randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of hormonal treatments in the review, two trials evaluating progesterone and two evaluating norethisterone. In all of these studies, the treatment was compared to a placebo (a harmless sugar pill). We did not find any studies testing non‐hormonal treatments or any studies in women with irregular periods. The four included studies involved a total of 192 women aged between 13 and 45 years experiencing catamenial epilepsy. The included studies did not demonstrate any significant differences between groups when comparing progesterone or norethisterone to placebo for seizure outcomes. The included studies reported limited information on side effects, but women taking progesterone were no more likely to withdraw from the study due to side effects than those receiving placebo. 
The evidence is current to July 2021.
Certainty of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low to moderate, as the included studies provided unclear information on methods of blinding, recruited small numbers of participants, and were inconsistent in reporting treatment outcomes. 
Conclusions 
We found very limited, mostly low‐certainty evidence, of no difference in seizure outcomes for norethisterone and progesterone versus placebo in women with catamenial epilepsy. Our review highlights an overall lack of information on the effectiveness of a wide range of other hormonal and non‐hormonal treatments currently being used. Further studies in women with catamenial epilepsy are needed in this area.

10.1002-14651858.CD013173.pub2,"Background
Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is an increasingly recognised neurodevelopmental condition; that is, a neurologically‐based condition which interferes with the acquisition, retention or application of specific skills. ASD is characterised by challenges with socialisation and communication, and by stereotyped and repetitive behaviours. A stereotyped behaviour is one which is repeated over and over again and which seems not to have any useful function. ASD often co‐occurs with mental health disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). People with ASD may show certain cognitive differences (i.e. differences in ways of thinking) which influence their response to therapies. Thus, there is a need for evidence‐based guidelines to treat mental health issues in this group. 
OCD, a common condition characterised by repeated obsessional thoughts and compulsive acts, occurs with greater frequency in persons with ASD than in the general population. Genetic, anatomic, neurobiological and psychological factors have been proposed to explain this co‐occurrence. However, care should be taken to distinguish stereotyped and repetitive behaviours characteristic of ASD from obsessive compulsive acts in OCD. 
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the recommended treatment for OCD, but studies have suggested that this treatment may be less effective in those with OCD co‐occurring with ASD. Hence, modifications to CBT treatment may be helpful when treating OCD co‐occurring with ASD to optimise outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 
Search methods
We searched for studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, five other bibliographic databases, international trial registries and other sources of grey literature (to 24 August 2020). We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies missed from the original electronic searches. We contacted subject experts for further information when needed. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross‐over, cluster‐ and quasi‐randomised controlled trials involving both adults and children with diagnoses of OCD and ASD. We included studies of participants with co‐occurring conditions (i.e. those experiencing other mental illnesses or neurodevelopmental conditions at the same time), but we did not include individuals who had a co‐occurring global learning difficulty. Treatment could be in any setting or format and include behavioural therapy (BT) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which may have been adapted for those with ASD. Comparator interventions included no treatment, waiting list, attention placebo (where the control group receives non‐specific aspects of therapy, but not the active ingredient) and treatment as usual (TAU, where the control group receives the usual treatment, according to accepted standards). 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently screened studies for inclusion. The authors extracted relevant data from the one eligible study, assessed the risk of bias and certainty of evidence (GRADE). Outcomes of interest were changes in OCD symptoms and treatment completion (primary outcome), and severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and behavioural difficulties, as well as degree of family accommodation (secondary outcomes). We did not conduct meta‐analyses as only one study met the selection criteria. 
Main results
We included only one RCT of 46 participants in our analysis. This study compared CBT for OCD in persons with high‐functioning ASD with a control group who received anxiety management only. There were no differences in rates of treatment completion between the CBT (87%) and anxiety management (87%) groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.25; low‐certainty evidence). Behavioural difficulties were not included as an outcome measure in the study. This study showed that there may be a benefit at the end of treatment favouring CBT compared with anxiety management in OCD symptoms (mean difference (MD) ‐3.00, 95% CI ‐8.02 to 2.02), depression symptoms (MD ‐1.80, 95% CI ‐11.50 to 7.90), anxiety symptoms (MD ‐3.20, 95% CI ‐11.38 to 4.98), and quality of life (MD 5.20, 95% CI ‐1.41 to 11.81), but the evidence was of low certainty.  
Authors' conclusions
Evidence is limited regarding the efficacy of CBT for treatment of OCD in ASD. There is much scope for future study, not only examining the efficacy of CBT for OCD in ASD, but also the particular ways that OCD manifests in and affects people with ASD and the role of the family in treatment response.

Can talk therapy help people with autism who also have OCD?

Rationale
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a brain‑based condition. People with autism may find talk, friends, or change hard. They may also repeat acts or words many times. These acts may not seem to have a clear use.

Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a different condition. People with OCD have strong, stuck thoughts. They may feel they must do certain acts to ease fear or worry. OCD can occur in people with autism more often than in others.

It can be hard to tell OCD acts from autism repeat acts. OCD acts come from fear or a bad thought. The act aims to cut that fear. Repeat acts in autism may not link to fear. This makes care more complex.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk care. It helps people notice and change thoughts and acts. CBT is a top care for OCD in the general group. But it may not work as well for people with both autism and OCD. Small changes to CBT may help it fit autism needs. We need proof to know if CBT helps this group.

Trial Design
This report is a careful review of trials. The team looked for strong studies. These include randomised controlled trials. In these trials, people get care by chance. The team also looked for cross‑over and cluster trials.

They searched many medical lists and trial logs. The date of the last search was late August 2020. They also asked experts and checked study lists. They aimed to find work in both kids and adults. All must have both autism and OCD. People with a broad learning problem were not in the trials.

They planned to study two types of care. One was behavioral therapy. The other was CBT. These might be adapted for autism. They compared these with no care, wait list, usual care, or a control talk time. Control talk time gives support, but not the main CBT steps.

In the end, they found only one trial that fit. It had 46 people with autism and OCD. The study called the group “high‑functioning.” The trial compared CBT for OCD with “anxiety management.” Anxiety management teaches skills to handle worry. The abstract did not share the age or gender of the group. It did not tell how long the care or follow‑up was.

The main things they looked at were OCD signs and if people could finish care. They also looked at mood, worry, and daily life quality. They wanted to see change in family strain, too. But the one trial did not report on behavior issues or family strain.

Results
About 9 in 10 people in each group finished treatment. This was true for the CBT group and the anxiety management group. So, people with autism and OCD could stick with either type of care. This is good to know for clinics and families.

At the end of care, the CBT group may have had fewer OCD signs. Their scores for low mood and worry may also have been better. Their quality of life score may have been a bit higher. These changes were small to modest. The proof for these gains was weak. We call this “low certainty” evidence. It means the true effect could be small, none, or larger. We need more and better trials to be sure.

The trial did not report on behavior problems. It did not report on changes in family help for OCD acts. These are key gaps. Many families help with or give in to OCD acts to cut stress at home. We need to know if CBT can ease that load.

What do these results mean for care? CBT may help some people with autism who have OCD. It may lower OCD signs a bit. It may also help mood, worry, and life quality. But we do not know how long gains last. We do not know who will gain the most. We also do not know the best way to adapt CBT for autism.

This review shows a big need for more research. We need more trials with more people. We need clear reports on age and other traits. We need to test CBT that is made to fit autism. We need to track family strain and daily life. We also need to learn how OCD shows up in autism. That can help set the right care steps.

If you or your child has both autism and OCD, ask about CBT. Share what helps you learn and feel safe. Ask if the clinic can adapt the steps to your needs. This may include clear words, visuals, slow pace, and more practice. It may also include family time in session. These changes may help you use skills day to day.

Conclusion from the investigators
There is not much solid proof yet. One small trial suggests CBT may help. But the proof is not strong. More high‑quality trials are needed to guide care.","Behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
Aim of the review 
The aim of the review is to see if cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help people who have OCD who also have ASD. 
Background 
People who have been given a diagnosis of ASD tend to have certain things in common. They often understand social interactions and communication differently to other people. People with ASD may also be less flexible in their thinking than other people, which may make it more difficult for them to use psychological therapies in the way that they are usually presented. The opinions of people with ASD are valuable in helping clinicians decide which research areas related to ASD should take priority. 
Someone who has been diagnosed with OCD has certain symptoms which, to some extent, affect how they are able to get on with their lives. Someone with OCD has persistent thoughts, although they don't want the thoughts and often think that the thoughts are unreasonable. These thoughts are often worries about themselves or someone else being harmed or about something not being perfect or just right. Sometimes the person with OCD feels as if they have to think thoughts or do actions repeatedly to 'make things right', even though they often really know that they don't need to. The repeated actions might be something like washing their hands. 
Research has shown that people with ASD are more likely to develop OCD. People may have certain genes that make them more likely to develop both ASD and OCD, or it may be that the way people with ASD tend to think makes them more likely to have OCD. 
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been used for a long time to treat OCD. CBT is usually carried out by visiting a therapist, but it can be delivered in different ways, such as online. CBT involves talking about the repeated thoughts that occur and helping the person manage and reduce them, and also involves trying to carry out compulsive actions less often. Because people with ASD sometimes have a different way of thinking and communicating, clinicians have wondered if CBT would be as useful to treat OCD in people with ASD as it is in people who have OCD but don't have ASD. Other researchers have devised ways to change the way that CBT is delivered to people with ASD to help them to get the most out of the treatment, and this is called 'adapted CBT'. Studies have shown that adapted CBT is useful for some anxiety disorders that occur in ASD. However, not as many studies have looked at how adapted CBT might be useful for OCD in people with ASD. 
Search 
We searched for randomised controlled trials of delivery of CBT to people with OCD who also had ASD. A randomised controlled trial is a trial where the participants are randomly allocated to CBT or another treatment group so that the people running the trial have no say about and do not know to which group the participants belong. The other treatment group is called the control group. In these studies, the people in the control group do not receive CBT, but they may have sessions with their therapists that do not include CBT, or they may be on a waiting list. If meeting with your therapist or waiting for time to pass were just as helpful as CBT, for example, then the results would be less likely to show a difference between the outcomes of the treatment group and the control group. Conversely, if CBT was more effective, then we might expect to see the CBT group doing better than the control group. Therefore, at the end of each trial, when the results in the treatment group are compared to the results in the control group, it gives information about how effective CBT might be for people with OCD and ASD. The evidence in this review is current to August 2020. 
Conclusion 
We found that there was only one published randomised controlled trial of delivery of CBT to people with OCD and ASD that met our search criteria. The control group in this trial was given a treatment called 'anxiety management' which helped the participants to manage anxiety but did not help them to deal specifically with repeated thoughts and actions, as CBT does. This study aimed to see if either anxiety management or CBT was better at treating OCD in people with ASD, but the study did not find a difference in response between the two treatments.

10.1002-14651858.CD013438,"Background
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of beta‐blockers to influence perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus routine prescription of these drugs in an unselected population remains a controversial issue. A previous version of this review assessing the effectiveness of perioperative beta‐blockers in cardiac and non‐cardiac surgery was last published in 2018. The previous review has now been split into two reviews according to type of surgery. This is an update, and assesses the evidence in non‐cardiac surgery only. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of perioperatively administered beta‐blockers for the prevention of surgery‐related mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing non‐cardiac surgery. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis Previews and Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science on 28 June 2019. We searched clinical trials registers and grey literature, and conducted backward‐ and forward‐citation searching of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs and quasi‐randomized studies comparing beta‐blockers with a control (placebo or standard care) administered during the perioperative period to adults undergoing non‐cardiac surgery. If studies included surgery with different types of anaesthesia, we included them if 70% participants, or at least 100 participants, received general anaesthesia. We excluded studies in which all participants in the standard care control group were given a pharmacological agent that was not given to participants in the intervention group, studies in which all participants in the control group were given a beta‐blocker, and studies in which beta‐blockers were given with an additional agent (e.g. magnesium). We excluded studies that did not measure or report review outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. 
Main results
We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 participants; we found no quasi‐randomized studies. All participants were undergoing non‐cardiac surgery, and types of surgery ranged from low to high risk. Types of beta‐blockers were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. In nine studies, beta‐blockers were titrated according to heart rate or blood pressure. Duration of administration varied between studies, as did the time at which drugs were administered; in most studies, it was intraoperatively, but in 18 studies it was before surgery, in six postoperatively, one multi‐arm study included groups of different timings, and one study did not report timing of drug administration. Overall, we found that more than half of the studies did not sufficiently report methods used for randomization. All studies in which the control was standard care were at high risk of performance bias because of the open‐label study design. Only two studies were prospectively registered with clinical trials registers, which limited the assessment of reporting bias. In six studies, participants in the control group were given beta‐blockers as rescue therapy during the study period. 
The evidence for all‐cause mortality at 30 days was uncertain; based on the risk of death in the control group of 25 per 1000, the effect with beta‐blockers was between two fewer and 13 more per 1000 (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.54; 16 studies, 11,446 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Beta‐blockers may reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction by 13 fewer incidences per 1000 (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.87; 12 studies, 10,520 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found no evidence of a difference in cerebrovascular events (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.81; 6 studies, 9460 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or in ventricular arrhythmias (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.47; 5 studies, 476 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation or flutter by 26 fewer incidences per 1000 (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; 9 studies, 9080 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, beta‐blockers may increase bradycardia by 55 more incidences per 1000 (RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.74 to 3.56; 49 studies, 12,239 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and hypotension by 44 more per 1000 (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.51; 49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
We downgraded the certainty of the evidence owing to study limitations; some studies had high risks of bias, and the effects were sometimes altered when we excluded studies with a standard care control group (including only placebo‐controlled trials showed an increase in early mortality and cerebrovascular events with beta‐blockers). We also downgraded for inconsistency; one large, well‐conducted, international study found a reduction in myocardial infarction, and an increase in cerebrovascular events and all‐cause mortality, when beta‐blockers were used, but other studies showed no evidence of a difference. We could not explain the reason for the inconsistency in the evidence for ventricular arrhythmias, and we also downgraded this outcome for imprecision because we found few studies with few participants. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence for early all‐cause mortality with perioperative beta‐blockers was uncertain. We found no evidence of a difference in cerebrovascular events or ventricular arrhythmias, and the certainty of the evidence for these outcomes was low and very low. We found low‐certainty evidence that beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarctions. However, beta‐blockers may increase bradycardia (low‐certainty evidence) and probably increase hypotension (moderate‐certainty evidence). Further evidence from large placebo‐controlled trials is likely to increase the certainty of these findings, and we recommend the assessment of impact on quality of life. We found 18 studies awaiting classification; inclusion of these studies in future updates may also increase the certainty of the evidence.

Do heart‑slowing drugs help adults having surgery that is not on the heart?

Rationale
Surgery is hard on the body. It can strain the heart and blood flow. This strain can lead to a heart attack or a stroke. It can also cause an odd heart beat.

Beta‑blockers are drugs that slow the heart and lower blood pressure. They may help the heart during stress. Doctors use them for many heart cases. But they can also make the heart too slow or the pressure too low.

Past tests did not agree on their value around surgery. Some showed help, some showed harm, and some showed no clear change. We need clear facts for adults having surgery not on the heart. This study set out to update those facts.

Trial Design
This was a review of many clinical trials. In these trials, people were put into groups by chance. They got a beta‑blocker or they got usual care or a dummy pill. A dummy pill looks the same but has no drug.

All people were adults having surgery not on the heart. The types of surgery ranged from small to big risk. The team looked at 83 trials with 14,967 people. The search went up to late June 2019.

The drugs were of many types in this one class. Examples include metoprolol, atenolol, and propranolol. The time the drug was given also varied. Some got it before, during, or after surgery.

Most trials checked on people for the first month after surgery. Many looked at death in the first 30 days. They also looked at heart attack and stroke. They checked for odd heart beats and drug side effects.

Results
This review found mixed results. For death in the first month, we are not sure. Out of 1000 people, the drug could mean two fewer deaths. Or it could mean up to 13 more deaths.

The drug may lower the chance of a heart attack. For every 1000 people, 13 fewer had a heart attack. This is a heart muscle injury. It can cause chest pain and harm the heart.

The drug may also lower one type of odd heart beat. This is called atrial fibrillation or flutter. It is a fast, uneven beat in the top heart rooms. For every 1000 people, 26 fewer had this issue.

For stroke, there was no clear change. A stroke is when blood flow to the brain stops. Some signs pointed to more strokes in some trials. But across all trials, we cannot say for sure.

For fast beats from the bottom heart rooms, results were not clear. These beats can be more dangerous. There were not many good data here. So we cannot draw a firm line.

The drug raised some risks that matter. More people had a heart rate that was too slow. For every 1000 people, 55 more had this side effect. Doctors call this bradycardia.

More people also had blood pressure that was too low. For every 1000 people, 44 more had this issue. Doctors call this hypotension. Low pressure can cause fainting or harm to organs.

Some trials were stronger than others. In trials with a dummy pill, some harms stood out. One large trial saw fewer heart attacks. But it saw more strokes and more deaths.

Many trials had weak methods. Some did not hide which drug people got. Some in the no‑drug group still got the drug as a rescue. These issues can cloud the true effect.

What does this mean for patients? Beta‑blockers may help some people by cutting heart attack risk. They may also reduce some odd heart beats. But they can slow the heart too much and drop pressure. They may also raise the risk of harm in some cases.

Doctors should weigh the pros and cons for each person. These drugs may fit people who already use them. They may also fit some high‑risk heart cases. They may not be right for all people having surgery.

The study team says we need better trials. These should use dummy pills and strong methods. They should track what matters to patients, like how they feel and live. New trials may change what we know.

In short, we do not have a one‑size‑fits‑all rule. Beta‑blockers around surgery can help and can harm. Talk with your care team about your own risks and needs. Together, you can choose what is best for you.","Beta‐blockers to prevent death or serious events after surgery not involving the heart
This review assessed evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on whether beta‐blockers reduce deaths or other serious events when given to people undergoing surgery other than heart surgery. The findings for heart surgery are covered in another review. 
Background 
Surgery increases stress in the body, which responds by releasing the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. Stress from surgery can lead to death or other serious events such as heart attacks, stroke, or an irregular heartbeat. For surgery that does not involve the heart, an estimated 8% of people may have injury to their heart around the time of surgery. Beta‐blockers are drugs that block the action of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart. Beta‐blockers can slow down the heart, and reduce blood pressure, and this may reduce the risk of serious events. However, beta‐blockers may lead to a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure which could increase the risk of death or a stroke. Prevention of early complications after surgery is important, but using beta‐blockers to prevent these complications is controversial. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 28 June 2019. We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 adults who were undergoing different types of surgery other than heart surgery. Eighteen studies are awaiting classification (because we did not have enough details to assess them), and three studies are ongoing. The types of beta‐blockers used in the studies were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. Studies compared these beta‐blockers with either a placebo (disguised to look like a beta‐blocker but containing no medicine) or with standard care. 
Key results 
Beta‐blockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days of surgery (16 studies, 11,446 participants; low‐certainty evidence), have a stroke (6 studies, 9460 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or experience ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat rhythms, starting in the main chambers of the heart, that are potentially life‐threatening and may need immediate medical treatment; 5 studies, 476 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We found that beta‐blockers may reduce atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat, starting in the atrial chambers of the heart, that increases the risk of stroke if untreated; 9 studies, 9080 participants; low certainty‐evidence), and the number of people who have a heart attack (12 studies, 10,520 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, taking beta‐blockers may increase the number of people who experience a very low heart rate (49 studies, 12,239 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or very low blood pressure (49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), around the time of surgery. 
In a few studies, we also found little or no difference in the number of people who died after 30 days, who died because of a heart problem, or had heart failure. We found no evidence of whether beta‐blockers alter the length of time in hospital. 
No studies assessed whether people who were given beta‐blockers had a better quality of life after heart surgery. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence in this review was limited by including some studies that were at high risk of bias, and we noticed that some of our findings were different if we only included placebo‐controlled studies or studies that reported how participants were randomized. We also found one large, well‐conducted, international study that had different findings to the smaller studies. It showed a reduction in heart attacks and an increase in stroke and all‐cause mortality when beta‐blockers were used, whilst the other studies did not show a clear effect. We were also less certain of the findings for outcomes with few studies, such as for ventricular arrhythmias. 
Conclusion 
Although beta‐blockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days, have a stroke, or have ventricular arrhythmias, they may reduce atrial fibrillation and heart attacks. Taking beta‐blockers may increase the number of people with a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure around the time of surgery. Further evidence from large, placebo‐controlled trials is likely to increase the certainty of these findings, and we recommend the assessment of impact on quality of life.

10.1002-14651858.CD003315.pub3,"Feeding interventions for growth and development in infants with cleft lip, cleft palate or cleft lip and palate 
Cleft lip and cleft palate (the roof of the mouth) are common defects. The severity of the cleft (opening) varies and it can occur on one (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral). It can be difficult to feed babies enough nutritious food when they have this condition, and there is evidence of delayed development in children born with cleft. 
This review aimed to compare the effects of different feeding interventions such as maternal advice and support, modified bottles and/or teats, obturating or maxillary plates (plates placed in the roof of the mouth to artificially close the cleft palate) and supplemental breastfeeding in babies with cleft lip and/or palate prior to, or following, closure. Interventions in the first 6 months from term and used with breast milk or formula feeding only were considered, but outcomes (measures of growth, development and parental satisfaction) may have been measured at any time including adulthood. 
Maternal advice and support on feeding techniques and breastfeeding positions are often provided, but no studies evaluated the effectiveness of this intervention. Squeezable rather than rigid bottles may be easier to use for feeding babies with cleft lip and/or palate, and breastfeeding may have growth advantages over spoon‐feeding following cleft lip surgery. Only five studies (including 292 babies) compared the effects of feeding interventions in babies with cleft lip and/or palate on growth, development or parental satisfaction. Evidence for breastfeeding rather than spoon‐feeding following surgery was weak and there was a suggestion that squeezable bottles may be more manageable than rigid ones. No evidence was found to support the use of maxillary plates in babies with unilateral clefts and no studies assessed the effects of maternal advice or support. Further research is required to assess the most effective feeding interventions to prevent developmental delays in infants with cleft lip and/or palate.

Feeding help for babies born with a cleft lip or cleft palate

Rationale
Some babies are born with a split in the lip.
Some have a split in the roof of the mouth.
Doctors call this a cleft.
It can be on one side or both sides.

These babies may have trouble feeding.
Milk can leak into the nose or out of the mouth.
They may not take in enough food.
This can slow growth and delay skills.

Parents want to help their baby grow and thrive.
But it is hard to know what works best.
Many tools and tips exist for feeding these babies.
We need clear facts on which ones help.

This review looked at ways to make feeding work better.
It asked which tools or methods help a baby grow.
It also asked what parents like and can manage.
The goal was to guide care and prevent delay.

The review focused on simple feeding help.
These included special bottles you can squeeze.
It also looked at a hard plate that covers the gap.
It looked at breastfeeding and spoon feeding after surgery.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies.
The team searched for studies on feeding help.
They included babies with a cleft lip or palate.
They looked at care given in the first six months.

Both breast milk and formula feeding were allowed.
Some babies had care before surgery.
Some had care after surgery to close the split.
The babies could be boys or girls.

The review looked at growth and development.
It also looked at what parents thought of each method.
Some studies checked results soon after care.
Some checked results later, even in adult years.

Five studies met the rules for this review.
They included a total of 292 babies.
The time in each study was not the same.
But each study started help in the first six months.

Results
The review found only a few good studies.
So the proof we have is not strong.
Still, some points can guide parents and teams.
Below are the main points.

Special bottles may help.
Bottles you can squeeze may be easier to use.
They may help babies drink more with less work.
Rigid bottles may be harder to use.

Breastfeeding may help after cleft lip surgery.
One study found better growth than with spoon feeding.
This was after the lip repair.
But the proof was weak and needs more study.

Hard plates did not show clear help.
These plates fit on the roof of the mouth.
They cover the gap to guide feeding.
In babies with a split on one side, they did not help growth.

Advice and support are common in care.
Nurses and feeding teams often teach latch and holds.
They teach positions and tips to help milk flow.
But no study tested if this advice alone worked.

Parents also want to know what feels best.
Some said squeezable bottles were easier to manage.
They can time drops with the baby’s suck.
This may give parents more control at home.

What does this mean for families today?
You can try a squeezable bottle.
You can ask to try breastfeeding after lip repair.
You can ask if a hard plate is needed for your child.

But please note the limits of the proof.
Only five small studies were in this review.
The babies and methods were not all the same.
So we need more and better studies.

We also need to test the value of advice.
Feeding teaching is common but not well studied.
Simple teaching may still help many families.
We should test which tips work best.

In short, feeding support matters a lot.
Some tools may make feeding smoother and safer.
Growth may improve when feeding is easier.
This can help babies reach key skills on time.

The review shows promise, but not final answers.
More trials can show what works best and for whom.
New research should track growth and skills over time.
It should also ask parents what works in daily life.

For now, ask your care team for a plan.
Bring your baby’s bottle and show how you feed.
Ask to try a squeezable bottle if you have trouble.
Ask about breastfeeding after lip repair, when safe.

Your team can guide you step by step.
They can tailor tools to your baby’s needs.
With the right help, feeding can get easier.
Your baby can grow, learn, and thrive.","Feeding interventions for growth and development in infants with cleft lip, cleft palate or cleft lip and palate

10.1002-14651858.CD011931.pub2,"Preventing pain after brain surgery
The problem 
There is increasing evidence that people who have undergone brain surgery experience significant pain. This pain can have serious consequences including raised blood pressure, agitation, prolonged recovery time and an increased risk of long‐term headaches. Research studies have looked at different drugs in an attempt to reduce the risk of pain for these people. There is now more evidence about pain reduction options for adults undergoing brain surgery but there remains uncertainty as to which options work best. 
The question 
This review aimed to determine which drugs provide the best chance of reducing pain for adults undergoing brain surgery, by collecting and combining the results of studies that looked at pain‐relieving drugs for this patient group. To provide an accurate answer to this question, only studies conducted in accordance with an approved high standard were included. Studies published in different languages and countries were included in order to obtain as much information as possible. 
In addition to determining which drugs were best at preventing or reducing pain after brain surgery, this review attempted to determine additional information such as how much additional pain‐relieving treatment was required in addition to the treatment under study; whether participants' pain was adequately controlled or not; how drowsy the participants were; what side effects they experienced; and how long they needed to stay in intensive care and in hospital. This review also considered whether some treatments worked better when given before or after surgery or for people undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. 
The results 
A total of 43 eligible studies, (42 complete and one still in progress), were found. Of the 42 completed studies (3548 participants), 10 studied injections of local anaesthetic into the scalp, 12 studied injection of local anaesthetic around specific scalp nerves, 8 studied nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 4 studied dexmedetomidine, 4 studied acetaminophen aka paracetamol), 2 studied opioid drugs, 3 studied gabapentin or pregabalin (anti‐seizure drugs that can also be used for pain relief) together with 1 study each of local anaesthetic injected into the veins, local anaesthetic injected into the jaw and the drug flupirtine. 
Sufficient information was abstracted to calculate the overall pain‐preventing effects of the following: local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound, local anaesthetic injections around specific scalp nerves, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, dexmedetomidine and pregabalin or gabapentin. When only high‐quality studies were examined: NSAIDs reduced pain up to 24 hours after surgery, dexmedetomidine and local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves reduced pain in the first 12 hours after surgery, pregabalin or gabapentin reduced pain in the first 6 hours after surgery and local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound significantly reduced pain 48 hours after surgery, but did not affect pain at earlier time points. 
When the timing of injection of local anaesthetics was examined, local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves provided better early pain relief (first 6 hours) when injected after surgery and better late pain relief (12 and 24 hours) when injected before surgery. 
The following interventions were also found to reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs: local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and dexmedetomidine. Gabapentin or pregabalin was found to reduce the risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery. 
Acetaminophen was not found to prevent pain after brain surgery or reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs. 
Insufficient evidence was found to determine whether any of these drugs made the participants more or less drowsy, affected how long they needed to stay in intensive care or whether different drugs worked better for adults undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. 
The overall quality of the evidence that contributed to the results of this review was assessed and judged to be 'high' for pain‐reducing effects of NSAIDs, 'moderate' to 'low' for pain‐reducing effects of dexmedetomidine, acetaminophen, pregabalin and gabapentin and local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and ' low' to ' very low' for pain‐reducing effects of local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound, additional pain relief requirements and risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery .

Which medicines help ease pain after brain surgery?

Rationale
Brain surgery can cause strong pain. This pain can raise blood pressure. It can cause restlessness. It can slow recovery. It may lead to long‑term headaches.

Doctors use many kinds of pain drugs. But we do not yet know the best plan. This review set out to compare these options. The goal was to find which drugs help most after brain surgery in adults.

Some drugs numb the skin on the head. We call these numbing shots. Doctors can place them near the cut, or near scalp nerves. Scalp nerves are the nerves in the skin of the head. Other drugs are anti‑swelling pain drugs. Some are calming drugs used in surgery. Some are nerve pain drugs. One common drug is acetaminophen, also called paracetamol.

This review was needed to guide care. Better pain control can help people heal. It may also lower bad effects after this big surgery.

Trial Design
This was a review of many clinical trials. The team set high standards before they chose studies. They included studies from many countries and in many languages. All studies looked at adults who had brain surgery.

The review found 43 studies. Of these, 42 were complete. One was still in progress. The 42 complete studies had 3,548 people in total.

The studies tested many options. These included:
- Numbing shots in the scalp near the cut.
- Numbing shots near scalp nerves.
- Anti‑swelling pain drugs. Doctors use these to treat pain and swelling.
- A calming drug called dexmedetomidine. Doctors may give it during surgery.
- Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol.
- Strong pain drugs called opioids.
- Nerve pain drugs called gabapentin and pregabalin.

The review looked at pain in the hours and days after surgery. Many studies checked pain at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. The team also looked at other things. These were the need for extra pain drugs, how sleepy people felt, nausea and vomiting, and time in intensive care and in the hospital. Some studies also tested when to give numbing shots. They gave them before surgery in some groups and after surgery in others.

A person in a given study was often followed for hours to two days. Some studies also tracked time in the intensive care unit, called the ICU, and hospital stay.

Results
Several options helped ease pain, but not at the same times. No single drug helped for every time point.

Anti‑swelling pain drugs lowered pain for up to one day. The team judged the proof for this to be high in quality. This means we can trust this result.

The calming drug dexmedetomidine helped in the first half day. Numbing shots placed near scalp nerves also helped in the first half day. Both of these options also cut the need for extra pain drugs. The proof for these results was moderate to low in quality.

Nerve pain drugs, gabapentin or pregabalin, eased pain in the first six hours. They also seemed to lower the chance of nausea and vomiting. The proof for pain relief was moderate to low in quality. The proof for less nausea and vomiting was low to very low.

Numbing shots placed around the cut helped at two days after surgery. They did not help earlier than that. The proof for this finding was low to very low in quality.

The timing of scalp nerve numbing shots mattered. Shots given after surgery worked better for early pain. Early pain means the first six hours. Shots given before surgery worked better for later pain. Later pain means 12 and 24 hours.

Acetaminophen did not prevent pain after brain surgery. It also did not lower the need for extra pain drugs in these studies.

The review could not answer some other questions. There was not enough proof to show if any drug made people more or less sleepy. There was not enough proof to show if these drugs changed time in the ICU. There was also not enough proof to match drugs to different kinds of brain surgery.

What does this mean for patients? There are helpful choices for pain after brain surgery. Anti‑swelling pain drugs stand out for the first day. Numbing shots near scalp nerves and dexmedetomidine help in the first hours. Nerve pain drugs may help very early after surgery. They may also reduce sickness. Numbing shots at the cut may help at two days.

Still, some proof is not strong. Many results have moderate, low, or very low proof. This means doctors should weigh risks and benefits for each person. It also means we need more high‑quality trials.

In short, this review offers a guide for care. It helps doctors plan pain control after brain surgery. It shows which options help, and when they help most. More strong studies can build on this and improve care.","Preventing pain after brain surgery
The problem 
There is increasing evidence that people who have undergone brain surgery experience significant pain. This pain can have serious consequences including raised blood pressure, agitation, prolonged recovery time and an increased risk of long‐term headaches. Research studies have looked at different drugs in an attempt to reduce the risk of pain for these people. There is now more evidence about pain reduction options for adults undergoing brain surgery but there remains uncertainty as to which options work best. 
The question 
This review aimed to determine which drugs provide the best chance of reducing pain for adults undergoing brain surgery, by collecting and combining the results of studies that looked at pain‐relieving drugs for this patient group. To provide an accurate answer to this question, only studies conducted in accordance with an approved high standard were included. Studies published in different languages and countries were included in order to obtain as much information as possible. 
In addition to determining which drugs were best at preventing or reducing pain after brain surgery, this review attempted to determine additional information such as how much additional pain‐relieving treatment was required in addition to the treatment under study; whether participants' pain was adequately controlled or not; how drowsy the participants were; what side effects they experienced; and how long they needed to stay in intensive care and in hospital. This review also considered whether some treatments worked better when given before or after surgery or for people undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. 
The results 
A total of 43 eligible studies, (42 complete and one still in progress), were found. Of the 42 completed studies (3548 participants), 10 studied injections of local anaesthetic into the scalp, 12 studied injection of local anaesthetic around specific scalp nerves, 8 studied nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 4 studied dexmedetomidine, 4 studied acetaminophen aka paracetamol), 2 studied opioid drugs, 3 studied gabapentin or pregabalin (anti‐seizure drugs that can also be used for pain relief) together with 1 study each of local anaesthetic injected into the veins, local anaesthetic injected into the jaw and the drug flupirtine. 
Sufficient information was abstracted to calculate the overall pain‐preventing effects of the following: local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound, local anaesthetic injections around specific scalp nerves, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, dexmedetomidine and pregabalin or gabapentin. When only high‐quality studies were examined: NSAIDs reduced pain up to 24 hours after surgery, dexmedetomidine and local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves reduced pain in the first 12 hours after surgery, pregabalin or gabapentin reduced pain in the first 6 hours after surgery and local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound significantly reduced pain 48 hours after surgery, but did not affect pain at earlier time points. 
When the timing of injection of local anaesthetics was examined, local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves provided better early pain relief (first 6 hours) when injected after surgery and better late pain relief (12 and 24 hours) when injected before surgery. 
The following interventions were also found to reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs: local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and dexmedetomidine. Gabapentin or pregabalin was found to reduce the risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery. 
Acetaminophen was not found to prevent pain after brain surgery or reduce the need for additional pain‐relieving drugs. 
Insufficient evidence was found to determine whether any of these drugs made the participants more or less drowsy, affected how long they needed to stay in intensive care or whether different drugs worked better for adults undergoing different approaches to brain surgery. 
The overall quality of the evidence that contributed to the results of this review was assessed and judged to be 'high' for pain‐reducing effects of NSAIDs, 'moderate' to 'low' for pain‐reducing effects of dexmedetomidine, acetaminophen, pregabalin and gabapentin and local anaesthetics injected around specific scalp nerves and ' low' to ' very low' for pain‐reducing effects of local anaesthetic injections around the surgical wound, additional pain relief requirements and risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery .

Review question  Is corneal collagen cross‐linking (CXL) a good treatment for slowing down the progression of keratoconus? 
Background  Keratoconus is a condition where the transparent front of the eye (cornea) gets thinner and begins to bulge. This leads to vision problems, usually short‐sightedness (distant objects appear blurred). The condition is more common in children and young adults and can deteriorate over time. Initially glasses and contact lenses can help. If the disease progresses, the only option may be a corneal transplant. 
CXL is a new treatment for keratoconus. The eye doctor removes the outer layer of the cornea, puts in vitamin B2 eye drops, and then treats the eye with ultraviolet A light radiation. This can be done in outpatients and takes about an hour. 
Study characteristics  The searches are current to August 2014. We found three randomised controlled trials, which were done in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A total of 219 eyes were randomly allocated to treatment with CXL or no treatment. In all three studies the surgery was done in the same way. None of the studies included children. 
Key results  Eyes treated with CXL were less likely to have problems with progression of bulging compared to eyes that were not treated. However, the studies were small and there were some concerns about the way they were done. It is therefore difficult to say exactly how much the treatment helped. None of the studies reported the risk of eyesight getting worse but, on average, treated eyes had better vision (about 10 letters better) compared to untreated eyes. None of the studies reported on a change in quality of life for the participant. The main adverse effects were inflammation and swelling; this occurred in approximately one in 10 participants. 
Quality of the evidence  We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low because of problems in the way the studies were done and reported and the small number of eyes included.

Can a light and vitamin eye drop treatment slow keratoconus?

Rationale
Keratoconus is a disease of the clear front of the eye. This clear front is the cornea. In keratoconus, the cornea gets thin and starts to bulge out. This can make far things look blurry.

This disease often starts in teens or young adults. It can get worse over time. At first, glasses or contact lenses may help sight. If it keeps on, some people may need a cornea transplant.

Doctors want a way to slow or stop this bulge. One new option is called corneal cross‑linking, or CXL. In CXL, the doctor takes off the thin outer cornea layer. Then they put in vitamin B2 eye drops and shine a type of light on the eye.

The visit in the clinic takes about an hour. The goal is to slow the bulge and hold sight steady. If it works, fewer people may need a transplant. This review asked if CXL can slow the disease.

Trial Design
This was a review of prior studies. The team looked for fair tests of CXL. In these tests, people were put by chance in one of two groups. One group had CXL. The other group had no treatment.

The search was up to August 2014. The team found three such trials. They took place in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. In all three, the CXL method was done the same way.

The trials looked at adults with keratoconus. No children took part in these trials. The reports did not give details on gender. In total, the trials assigned 219 eyes to CXL or no treatment.

The clinic part of CXL took about an hour. How long people stayed in each trial was not in this summary. The trials did not all measure the same things. Some key outcomes were not reported.

Results
Eyes that had CXL were less likely to get worse bulging. So, on the main goal, CXL seemed to help. But each trial was small. Some parts of how they were done raised concern.

Sight on the eye chart was, on average, better after CXL. People who had CXL could read about ten more letters. This was better than the group with no treatment. No trial told how many people had worse sight.

No trial looked at daily life or well‑being. This is often called quality of life. So we do not know if people felt or did better day to day. We also do not know if they could do more tasks.

Side effects did occur. The main ones were redness and swelling of the eye. About one in ten people had these side effects. The trials did not list rare or long‑term harms.

The review team judged the proof as very weak. This was due to small trial size. It was also due to limits in how the trials were run and reported. Because of this, we cannot say how big the benefit is.

What does this mean for patients? CXL may slow keratoconus in adults. It may also help sight on an eye chart. But we do not know how it affects life day to day. We also do not know the long‑term safety.

What does this mean for the eye care field? The results are a hopeful sign. But better trials are still needed. Trials should include more people and include children. Trials should also track daily life and harms.

In short, CXL may help some adults with keratoconus. It may slow the bulge and help sight. The most common harms were redness and swelling. But the proof we have now is very weak.

We need more and better tests of CXL. These tests should be done with clear plans. They should measure what matters most to patients. Then we can be more sure about the true benefits and risks.","Corneal collagen cross‐linking for thinning of the transparent front part of the eye ('keratoconus')

Intestinal dysbiosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in very preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Dietary supplementation with synbiotics (probiotic micro‐organisms combined with prebiotic oligosaccharides) to modulate the intestinal microbiome has been proposed as a strategy to reduce the risk of NEC and associated mortality and morbidity. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of enteral supplementation with synbiotics (versus placebo or no treatment, or versus probiotics or prebiotics alone) for preventing NEC and associated morbidity and mortality in very preterm or VLBW infants. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, the Maternity and Infant Care database and CINAHL, from earliest records to 17 June 2021. We searched clinical trials databases and conference proceedings, and examined the reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing prophylactic synbiotics supplementation with placebo or no synbiotics in very preterm (< 32 weeks' gestation) or very low birth weight (< 1500 g) infants. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors separately performed the screening and selection process,  evaluated risk of bias of the trials, extracted data, and synthesised effect estimates using risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), and mean difference, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the level of certainty for effects on NEC, all‐cause mortality, late‐onset invasive infection, and neurodevelopmental impairment. 
Main results
We included six trials in which a total of 925 infants participated. Most trials were small (median sample size 200). Lack of clarity on methods used to conceal allocation and mask caregivers or investigators were potential sources of bias in four of the trials. The studied synbiotics preparations contained lactobacilli or bifidobacteria (or both) combined with fructo‐ or galacto‐oligosaccharides (or both).  
Meta‐analyses suggested that synbiotics may reduce the risk of NEC (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.40; RD 70 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 100 fewer to 40 fewer; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 14, 95% CI 10 to 25; six trials (907 infants); low certainty evidence); and all‐cause mortality prior to hospital discharge (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.85; RD 50 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 120 fewer to 100 fewer; NNTB 20, 95% CI 8 to 100; six trials (925 infants); low‐certainty evidence). Synbiotics may have little or no effect on late‐onset invasive infection, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.21; RD 20 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 70 fewer to 30 more; five trials (707 infants); very low‐certainty evidence). None of the trials assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes. In the absence of high levels of heterogeneity, we did not undertake any subgroup analysis (including the type of feeding). 
Authors' conclusions
The available trial data provide only low‐certainty evidence about the effects of synbiotics on the risk of NEC and associated morbidity and mortality for very preterm or very low birth weight infants. Our confidence in the effect estimates is limited; the true effects may be substantially different from these estimates. Large, high‐quality trials would be needed to provide evidence of sufficient validity and applicability to inform policy and practice.

Can a mix of good gut germs help protect tiny preterm babies from a bad gut disease?

Rationale
Some very early babies get a harsh gut illness called NEC. NEC hurts the bowel wall. It can cause a tear and blood infection. It can lead to death. It is very hard for babies and families.

Germs in the gut may play a big role in NEC. Synbiotics may help. Synbiotics are a mix of probiotics and prebiotics. Probiotics are live “good” germs. Prebiotics are plant sugars that feed these good germs.

Doctors hope synbiotics can build a healthy gut in these small babies. A strong gut may fight bad germs. It may cut the risk of NEC and death. This review asked if synbiotics help do that. It also asked about blood infection and later health.

Trial Design
This study is a review of past trials. The team searched many study lists and trial sites. They looked from the first records up to mid 2021. They also checked meeting reports and paper reference lists. They set rules for which trials to include.

The review only included trials that used chance to pick groups. In these trials, some babies got synbiotics. Other babies got a fake product or no synbiotics. The team then compared health results between the groups. This helps give fair results.

They found six trials with 925 babies. These babies were very early or very small at birth. They were born before 32 weeks. Or they weighed under 1500 grams at birth. Doctors gave synbiotics by mouth with feeds.

The synbiotics had lactobacillus or bifido germs. They also had plant sugars called fructo‑ or galacto‑oligosaccharides. Most trials were small, with about 200 babies each. Some trial steps were not clear. That can raise the risk of bias.

The babies stayed in a trial until they left the hospital. The team looked at NEC, death before going home, and late blood infection. They also planned to look at long term brain growth or learning. But none of the trials reported that.

Results
Main finding one: NEC. Synbiotics may lower the chance of NEC. Across these trials, about 70 fewer babies out of 1000 got NEC. This is an estimate from the data. The proof is low in strength. The true effect could be different.

Main finding two: death before going home. Synbiotics may lower deaths in the hospital. About 50 fewer babies out of 1000 died before discharge. This is also an estimate. The proof is low in strength. The true effect may be more or less.

Main finding three: late blood infection. Synbiotics may have little or no clear effect. We are very unsure about this result. The data could fit fewer, the same, or more cases. We need better trials to know.

No trial looked at brain growth, movement, or learning later on. So we do not know if synbiotics help or harm those areas. This is a key gap. Families and doctors need this type of result. Future trials should plan to measure it.

What do these results mean for care? Synbiotics look promising for NEC and death in these small babies. But the proof is not strong. Some trials were small. Some trial methods were not clear. These limits lower our trust in the size of the benefit.

Doctors need large, high‑quality trials in this area. Such trials should use clear steps. They should follow babies long term. They should tell us about safety and brain and learning. Only then can we guide care and policy with confidence.

For now, the review suggests a possible benefit. It points to fewer cases of NEC and fewer deaths. But we should use care in how we act on this. Families should talk with their care team. Each baby’s needs are not the same.","Do synbiotics prevent necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm or very low birth weight infants? 
Background 
Very preterm (born more than eight weeks early) and very low birth weight (less than 1.5 kg) infants are at risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis, a severe condition where some of the lining of the infant's bowel becomes inflamed, and the cells of this tissue die. This condition is associated with death, serious infection, and long‐term disability, as well as developmental problems. 
What did we want to find out? 
One way to help prevent necrotising enterocolitis may be to add synbiotics (combinations of probiotic bacteria or yeasts plus non‐digestible sugars to support probiotic growth and colonisation) to milk feeds. We wanted to find out whether synbiotics might benefit very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Our outcomes of interest included necrotising enterocolitis, death from any cause, serious infection, duration of hospitalisation since birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
What did we do? 
For our Cochrane Review, we searched several important databases to identify randomized controlled trials that investigated the use of synbiotics for preventing necrotising enterocolitis in very preterm and very low birth weight infants. We used standard Cochrane methods to conduct our review and perform our analyses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. 
What did we find? 
We found six trials with a total of 925 infant participants. Trials were mostly small, and most had design flaws that might have biased their findings. 
Main results 
Combined analyses showed that giving synbiotics to very preterm or very low birth weight infants may reduce the risk of necrotising enterocolitis and death. Synbiotics may have little or no effect in reducing the risk of serious infection, but the evidence is very uncertain. None of the studies that we identified assessed the effect of synbiotics on disability or developmental outcomes. 
What are the limitations of this evidence? 
Although the evidence from randomised controlled trials can potentially be of high certainty, the methods used in our review's included trials may have introduced biases that exaggerated the benefits of giving synbiotics to very preterm and very low birth weight infants. Also, because most of the trials were small, the effect estimates for some outcomes were imprecise. For these reasons, we graded down the certainty of the evidence. All evidence in our review is of low or very low certainty. 
There is low‐certainty evidence that synbiotics prevent necrotising enterocolitis and death from any cause. There is very low‐certainty evidence that synbiotics may have little or no effect in preventing serious infection. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
We conducted our database searches on 17 June 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013667.pub2,"Background
Self‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury regardless of degree of suicidal intent or other types of motivation) is a growing problem in most countries, often repeated, and associated with suicide. Evidence assessing the effectiveness of interventions in the treatment of SH in children and adolescents is lacking, especially when compared with the evidence for psychosocial interventions in adults. This review therefore updates a previous Cochrane Review (last published in 2015) on the role of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychosocial interventions or pharmacological agents or natural products for SH compared to comparison types of care (e.g. treatment‐as‐usual, routine psychiatric care, enhanced usual care, active comparator, placebo, alternative pharmacological treatment, or a combination of these) for children and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) who engage in SH. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialized Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL] and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [CDSR]), together with MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PsycINFO (to 4 July 2020). 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing specific psychosocial interventions or pharmacological agents or natural products with treatment‐as‐usual (TAU), routine psychiatric care, enhanced usual care (EUC), active comparator, placebo, alternative pharmacological treatment, or a combination of these, in children and adolescents with a recent (within six months of trial entry) episode of SH resulting in presentation to hospital or clinical services. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a repeated episode of SH over a maximum follow‐up period of two years. Secondary outcomes included treatment adherence, depression, hopelessness, general functioning, social functioning, suicidal ideation, and suicide. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised trial quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence internals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CIs. The overall quality of evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. repetition of SH at post‐intervention) was appraised for each intervention using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included data from 17 trials with a total of 2280 participants. Participants in these trials were predominately female (87.6%) with a mean age of 14.7 years (standard deviation (SD) 1.5 years). The trials included in this review investigated the effectiveness of various forms of psychosocial interventions. None of the included trials evaluated the effectiveness of pharmacological agents in this clinical population. There was a lower rate of SH repetition for DBT‐A (30%) as compared to TAU, EUC, or alternative psychotherapy (43%) on repetition of SH at post‐intervention in four trials (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.82; N = 270; k = 4; high‐certainty evidence). There may be no evidence of a difference for individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy and TAU for repetition of SH at post‐intervention (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.12 to 7.24; N = 51; k = 2; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether mentalisation based therapy for adolescents (MBT‐A) reduces repetition of SH at post‐intervention as compared to TAU (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.06 to 8.46; N = 85; k = 2; very low‐certainty evidence). Heterogeneity for this outcome was substantial ( I² = 68%). There is probably no evidence of a difference between family therapy and either TAU or EUC on repetition of SH at post‐intervention (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.07; N = 191; k = 2; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, there was no evidence of a difference for compliance enhancement approaches on repetition of SH by the six‐month follow‐up assessment, for group‐based psychotherapy at the six‐ or 12‐month follow‐up assessments, for a remote contact intervention (emergency cards) at the 12‐month assessment, or for therapeutic assessment at the 12‐ or 24‐month follow‐up assessments. 
Authors' conclusions
Given the moderate or very low quality of the available evidence, and the small number of trials identified, there is only uncertain evidence regarding a number of psychosocial interventions in children and adolescents who engage in SH. Further evaluation of DBT‐A is warranted. Given the evidence for its benefit in adults who engage in SH, individual CBT‐based psychotherapy should also be further developed and evaluated in children and adolescents.

Which talking treatments help teens who self-harm?

Rationale
Self-harm means a person hurts or poisons themself on purpose. It can happen once or many times. It can raise the risk of death by suicide. It causes pain for the person and their family.

Many teens who self-harm will do so again. Care that works can lower this risk. But we do not yet know what care helps teens most. Most past studies looked at adults, not teens.

This study looked for which talking treatments help teens. These are treatments that teach skills and give support. One such care is DBT-A. It teaches ways to handle big feelings and urges. Another is CBT. It helps a person spot and change unhelpful thoughts.

Trial Design
Experts did a careful review of past studies. They looked at high quality trials up to July 2020. These trials put people into care groups by chance. This helps make fair tests.

The teens were up to 18 years old. All had self-harmed in the last six months. They had gone to a clinic or a hospital. Most were girls. The average age was about 15 years.

The review found 17 trials. These trials had 2,280 young people in total. The trials tested talking treatments. No trials in this group tested medicine for self-harm.

The main thing the studies checked was this: did the teen self-harm again. The studies checked this by the end of care, and for up to two years. Some studies also looked at mood and daily life. But this review focused on repeat self-harm.

The care groups were different types. Some got Dialectical Behavior Therapy for teens, or DBT-A. Some got one-on-one CBT with a therapist. Some got Mentalization Based Therapy for teens, or MBT-A. Some got family therapy, group therapy, or extra contact after a visit. Some got the usual care a clinic gives.

Results
DBT-A helped lower repeat self-harm by the end of care. About 3 out of 10 teens in DBT-A self-harmed again. About 4 out of 10 teens in the other care groups did. This finding came from four trials with 270 teens. The evidence for this was strong and reliable.

For one-on-one CBT, the picture was not clear. It did not show a clear drop in repeat self-harm by the end of care. This came from two small trials with 51 teens. We need more and larger studies in teens.

For MBT-A, we also cannot tell yet. The data was too mixed and small. Two trials with 85 teens did not give a clear answer. We are very unsure if it helps or not.

For family therapy, the results did not show a change. Family therapy and usual or enhanced care led to similar repeat self-harm rates. This came from two trials with 191 teens. The evidence here was fairly strong.

Some other ideas did not seem to help. These include group therapy at six or 12 months. A plan to boost visit follow-through at six months. Extra contact like emergency cards at 12 months. A special type of first visit called therapeutic assessment at 12 and 24 months. These did not lower repeat self-harm in the studies found.

No studies in this review tested medicine to help with self-harm in teens. So we cannot say if any medicine helps with repeat self-harm in this age group.

What does this mean for care? DBT-A looks helpful for teens who self-harm. It teaches skills to cope, stay safe, and handle stress. The support in DBT-A may help teens get through hard moments. This can cut the chance of self-harm during care.

CBT helps adults who self-harm. It may help teens too. But we do not have enough teen data yet. We need more well-run teen trials of CBT.

The review has limits. Many trials were small. Some gave only short follow-up. Most teens in the studies were girls. So we do not know if the results fit boys as well. We also need more data on mood, school, and family life.

In short, DBT-A can help lower repeat self-harm in teens during care. Other talking treatments did not show clear gains yet in teens. Experts should test DBT-A more. They should also build and test teen-focused CBT.

If you or your teen needs help now, please reach out. Call your local crisis line or go to the nearest emergency room. Help is available.","Interventions for children and adolescents who self‐harm
We have reviewed the international literature regarding psychosocial interventions, pharmacological (drug), and natural product (dietary supplementation) treatment trials in the field. A total of 17 trials meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. There is little evidence of beneficial effects for individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy, mentalisation‐based therapy for adolescents (MBT‐A), group‐based psychotherapy, enhanced assessment approaches, compliance enhancement approaches, family interventions, or remote contact interventions. There is some evidence of effectiveness for dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT‐A) for adolescents. However, few trials have been conducted and those that have are generally small, meaning that possible beneficial effects of some of these therapies cannot be ruled out. 
Why is this review important? 
Self‐harm (SH), which includes intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is strongly linked with suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed. There has been an increase in the use of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. It is therefore important to assess the evidence for their effectiveness. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Hospital administrators (e.g. service providers), health policy officers and third party payers (e.g. health insurers), clinicians working with patients who engage in SH, patients themselves, and their relatives. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review is an update of a previous Cochrane Review from 2015 which found little evidence of beneficial effects of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. This updated review aims to further evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of interventions for children and adolescents with SH with a broader range of outcomes. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of either psychosocial or drug treatments for children and adolescents up to 18 years of age who had recently engaged in SH. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There have been surprisingly few investigations of treatments for SH in children and adolescents, despite the size of this problem in many countries. We found positive effects of DBT‐A on repetition of SH. There is currently no clear evidence for the effectiveness of individual CBT‐based psychotherapy, MBT‐A, group‐based psychotherapy, enhanced assessment approaches, compliance enhancement approaches, family interventions, or remote contact interventions in preventing repetition of SH. 
What should happen next? 
We recommend further trials of DBT‐A. Given the evidence for its benefit for adults who engage in SH, individual CBT‐based psychotherapy should also be further developed and evaluated in children and adolescents. Given the extent of SH in children and adolescents, greater attention should be paid to the development and evaluation of specific therapies for this population.

What is the aim of this review? 
We wanted to find out if stress management programmes at work had a different effect if they were given via a computer, compared to being given in person. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. We found two studies that studied the effect of the delivery method on stress reduction in workers. 
Key messages 
The effects of the delivery method on stress reduction were unclear. More research should be conducted to directly compare equivalent stress management programmes delivered via a computer and in‐person. Any future studies will likely affect the conclusions of this review. 
What was studied in the review?  Many employers wish to reduce stress in their employees and are willing to invest in stress management programmes. It has been shown that workplace stress management programmes can reduce stress in employees, either when delivered by a computer or mobile device, or by a live person. However, it is unclear if the delivery method itself impacts how effective the programme is. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the intervention delivery method (computer or in person) to reduce stress in workers. 
What are the results of the review? 
We found two studies, involving 159 employees, that looked at stress levels in workers after completing stress management programmes on a computer, compared to workers receiving that same programme content from a live person. Both studies taught participants, individually or in small groups, how to recognise and reduce stress, but had conflicting results. 
How up to date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to February 2017.

Do stress classes on a computer work as well as in‑person ones at work?

Rationale
Work stress is common. It can hurt sleep, mood, and health. It can also lower job joy and work output. Many jobs now try to help staff with stress classes.

These classes teach ways to spot stress and calm the mind and body. Some classes are on a computer or phone. Some are led by a live person. Both kinds can help lower stress.

But we do not know if how you get the class matters. Does a computer class help as much as a live class? The idea of this study was simple. If both teach the same skills, will one way work better?

This question matters to workers and bosses. A computer class may be easy to use. You can join it any time. A live class may feel more warm and social. It may help people stick with it. Jobs need to choose what to offer. This review tried to give clear guidance.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team looked for all studies that made a direct head‑to‑head check. They wanted studies that used the same class content in both ways. One group got the class on a computer. The other group got the same class from a live person.

The team searched for studies up to February 2017. They found two studies. In total, these studies had 159 workers. The jobs were not all the same. The studies taught people how to spot stress and use skills to bring it down.

The studies taught people on their own or in small groups. The review did not give the ages of the workers. It did not say how many were men or women. It also did not say how long each class ran. So we do not know how much time a person spent in each study.

The review asked: After the class, were people less stressed? It looked at stress scores after the class. It then compared the computer group to the live class group. The goal was to see if one way worked better than the other.

Results
The two studies did not agree. Both used the same class content in both groups. But one study found one way worked better. The other study found the other way worked better. So the results did not match.

Because of this, the review could not say which way is best. The total number of people across the two studies was small. This makes it hard to be sure. When studies are few and small, it is easy to get mixed results.

Still, both types of classes can help some people. Past work shows that stress classes at work can lower stress. This is true for computer classes and live classes. So, if you can join either, both are worth a try.

But the key question here was about how the class is given. On that point, the answer is not clear yet. We need more studies that do a fair, side‑by‑side test. They should use the same class content, with one group on a screen and one with a live guide.

Good future studies should also report who joins. They should list ages, jobs, and sex. They should state how long the class lasts. They should show if people stay in the class. They should measure stress in the same way and at the same times. This would help us compare results.

What does this mean for workers now? If you like to learn on your own time, a computer class may fit you. If you like group talk and live support, an in‑person class may fit you. Pick the way that you can and will use. The skills you learn may matter more than the way you get them.

What does this mean for employers now? It may be wise to offer both options. That way, staff can choose what works for them. Make sure the content is sound. Teach skills like deep breath, muscle relax, and thought reframing. Give time to practice. Check in on how staff feel after the class.

What do the study team and reviewers say in the end? The effect of the way the class is given is not clear. The two studies had mixed results. More and better studies may change this view. New work in this area will likely shape the final answer.

In short, stress classes help many people at work. But we do not yet know if a screen or a live guide is best. If you have stress, seek help in the form you can use now. The most important step is to start.","Computer‐based versus in‐person stress management programmes for workers

Misoprostol given orally is a commonly used labour induction method. Our Cochrane Review is restricted to studies with low‐dose misoprostol (initially ≤ 50 µg), as higher doses pose unacceptably high risks of uterine hyperstimulation. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of low‐dose oral misoprostol for labour induction in women with a viable fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov,  the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (14 February 2021) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing low‐dose oral misoprostol (initial dose ≤ 50 µg) versus placebo, vaginal dinoprostone, vaginal misoprostol, oxytocin, or mechanical methods; or comparing oral misoprostol protocols (one‐ to two‐hourly versus four‐ to six‐hourly; 20 µg to 25 µg versus 50 µg; or 20 µg hourly titrated versus 25 µg two‐hourly static). 
Data collection and analysis
Using Covidence, two review authors independently screened reports, extracted trial data, and performed quality assessments. Our primary outcomes were vaginal birth within 24 hours, caesarean section, and hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes. 
Main results
We included 61 trials involving 20,026 women. GRADE assessments ranged from moderate‐ to very low‐certainty evidence, with downgrading decisions based on imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations. 
Oral misoprostol versus placebo/no treatment (four trials; 594 women) 
Oral misoprostol may make little to no difference in the rate of caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.11; 4 trials; 594 women; moderate‐certainty evidence), while its effect on uterine hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes is uncertain (RR 5.15, 95% CI 0.25 to 105.31; 3 trials; 495 women; very low‐certainty evidence). Vaginal births within 24 hours was not reported. In all trials, oxytocin could be commenced after 12 to 24 hours and all women had pre‐labour ruptured membranes. 
Oral misoprostol versus vaginal dinoprostone (13 trials; 9676 women) 
Oral misoprostol probably results in fewer caesarean sections (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.90; 13 trials, 9676 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis indicated that 10 µg to 25 µg (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.87; 9 trials; 8652 women) may differ from 50 µg (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.34; 4 trials; 1024 women) for caesarean section. Oral misoprostol may decrease vaginal births within 24 hours (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; 10 trials; 8983 women; low‐certainty evidence) and hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.59; 11 trials; 9084 women; low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol versus vaginal misoprostol (33 trials; 6110 women) 
Oral use may result in fewer vaginal births within 24 hours (average RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95; 16 trials, 3451 women; low‐certainty evidence), and less hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.92, 25 trials, 4857 women, low‐certainty evidence), with subgroup analysis suggesting that 10 µg to 25 µg orally (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.57; 6 trials, 957 women) may be superior to 50 µg orally (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.11; 19 trials; 3900 women). Oral misoprostol probably does not increase caesarean sections overall (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; 32 trials; 5914 women; low‐certainty evidence) but likely results in fewer caesareans for foetal distress (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; 24 trials, 4775 women). 
Oral misoprostol versus intravenous oxytocin (6 trials; 737 women, 200 with ruptured membranes) 
Misoprostol may make little or no difference to vaginal births within 24 hours (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33; 3 trials; 466 women; low‐certainty evidence), but probably results in fewer caesarean sections (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 6 trials; 737 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). The effect on hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes is uncertain (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.26; 3 trials, 331 women; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol versus mechanical methods (6 trials; 2993 women) 
Six trials compared oral misoprostol to transcervical Foley catheter. Misoprostol may increase vaginal birth within 24 hours (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.79; 4 trials; 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence), and probably reduces the risk of caesarean section (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95; 6 trials; 2993 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.21; 4 trials; 2828 women; low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol one‐ to two‐hourly versus four‐ to six‐hourly (1 trial; 64 women) 
The evidence on hourly titration was very uncertain due to the low numbers reported.
Oral misoprostol 20 µg hourly titrated versus 25 µg two‐hourly static (2 trials; 296 women) 
The difference in regimen may have little or no effect on the rate of vaginal births in 24 hours (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is of very low certainty for all other reported outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Low‐dose oral misoprostol is probably associated with fewer caesarean sections (and therefore more vaginal births) than vaginal dinoprostone, and lower rates of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes. However, time to birth may be increased, as seen by a reduced number of vaginal births within 24 hours. 
Compared to transcervical Foley catheter, low‐dose oral misoprostol is associated with fewer caesarean sections, but equivalent rates of hyperstimulation. 
Low‐dose misoprostol given orally rather than vaginally is probably associated with similar rates of vaginal birth, although rates may be lower within the first 24 hours. However, there is likely less hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes, and fewer caesarean sections performed due to foetal distress. 
The best available evidence suggests that low‐dose oral misoprostol probably has many benefits over other methods for labour induction. This review supports the use of low‐dose oral misoprostol for induction of labour, and demonstrates the lower risks of hyperstimulation than when misoprostol is given vaginally. More trials are needed to establish the optimum oral misoprostol regimen, but these findings suggest that a starting dose of 25 µg may offer a good balance of efficacy and safety.

Low‑dose misoprostol by mouth to start labor: what we learned

Rationale
Some births need help to start. Doctors call this “induction of labor.” Induction can help when going past due dates. It can also help with some health risks for parent or baby.

Misoprostol is a medicine that can start labor. A pill by mouth is one way to give it. High doses can cause very strong, fast contractions. Those can stress the baby. So, this review looked at low doses only.

The goal was clear. Does low‑dose misoprostol by mouth work well and stay safe? The team thought a small dose by mouth may work. They also thought it may lower harms from too‑strong contractions. They wanted to compare it to other common methods.

We need good proof to guide care. Many hospitals use this pill. But dose and timing vary. This review tests if the pill helps more than other ways. It also checks how it affects C‑section rates and baby well‑being.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. It pooled results to get clearer answers. The team looked at 61 trials. They included 20,026 pregnant women.

All women were in the third trimester. All had a live baby in the womb. The trials tested low‑dose misoprostol by mouth. The first dose was 50 micrograms or less. (A microgram is a tiny amount.)

The pill was compared to several methods. These were: no medicine or a dummy pill, a vaginal medicine called dinoprostone, misoprostol placed in the vagina, oxytocin by IV drip, and a small tube called a Foley catheter placed in the cervix.

Some trials also compared dose plans. These looked at small doses every one to two hours. They also looked at doses every four to six hours. Some looked at 20 to 25 micrograms versus 50 micrograms. Some women in a few trials could start oxytocin after 12 to 24 hours. In one group, all women had broken water before labor.

Women stayed in a trial until they gave birth. The main things measured were: birth through the vagina within one day, C‑section, and very strong contractions that affect the baby’s heart rate.

The strength of the proof was mixed. Some results were solid. Some were weak. That was due to small numbers, mixed methods, or limits in the trials.

Results
First, misoprostol by mouth versus no treatment or a dummy pill. C‑section rates were about the same. It was not clear if very strong contractions were more or less common. Birth within one day was not reported in those trials.

Next, misoprostol by mouth versus vaginal dinoprostone. Misoprostol by mouth likely led to fewer C‑sections. It also likely led to fewer very strong contractions that affected the baby’s heart. Fewer births happened within one day. This means labor may have taken longer with the pill by mouth.

Dose size mattered here. Lower doses by mouth, around 10 to 25 micrograms, seemed better than 50 micrograms for lowering C‑sections.

Next, misoprostol by mouth versus misoprostol placed in the vagina. Fewer births happened within one day with the pill by mouth. So, labor may have been slower. But the pill by mouth led to fewer very strong contractions that affected the baby’s heart. Total C‑sections were about the same. Fewer C‑sections were done for baby distress with the pill by mouth. Lower oral doses, around 10 to 25 micrograms, seemed to lower the chance of very strong contractions more than 50 micrograms.

Next, misoprostol by mouth versus oxytocin by IV. Birth within one day was about the same. Misoprostol by mouth likely led to fewer C‑sections. It was not clear if very strong contractions were more or less common.

Next, misoprostol by mouth versus a Foley catheter. More women may have given birth within one day with the pill. The pill also likely led to fewer C‑sections. Very strong contractions were about the same between the two groups.

Next, dose plans for the pill by mouth. One study tested very small doses each hour or two versus every four to six hours. The proof was too weak to know which is best. Two studies tested a plan that raised the dose each hour (20 micrograms) versus a steady dose every two hours (25 micrograms). Birth within one day was about the same. Proof for other results was very weak.

What does this all mean? Low‑dose misoprostol by mouth likely has real benefits. It likely lowers C‑section rates when compared with vaginal dinoprostone, oxytocin, and the Foley catheter. It likely lowers very strong, fast contractions when compared with misoprostol placed in the vagina. But birth may take longer with the pill by mouth. This is shown by fewer births within one day in several match‑ups.

The proof strength ranged from moderate to very low. That means some results are more sure than others. Still, the best current proof supports using low‑dose misoprostol by mouth to start labor.

The review team thinks a starting dose of 25 micrograms may balance effect and safety. But we still need more trials to find the best dose and timing plan.

In short: the pill by mouth at low dose is a sound option. It can help avoid C‑sections in some match‑ups. It also may lower the risk of very strong contractions that can stress the baby. It may take longer to give birth, but the trade‑offs can be worth it. Your care team can help choose the best method for you.","Low‐dose misoprostol given by mouth for induction of labour
We looked at the evidence from randomised controlled trials to see if low‐dose misoprostol given by mouth is effective in starting labour in women in their third trimester with a live baby. We compared misoprostol with other commonly used methods of inducing labour. 
What is the issue? 
Artificially starting labour, or induction, is common in pregnancy. Reasons include the mother having high blood pressure in pregnancy or the baby being past the due date. Misoprostol is a type of prostaglandin that can be taken in low doses by mouth to induce labour. Prostaglandins are hormone‐like compounds that are made by the body for various functions (including the natural onset of labour). Unlike other prostaglandins such as vaginal dinoprostone, misoprostol does not need to be stored in the refrigerator. Taking a tablet is convenient to mothers and the low‐dose tablet sizes are now available (25 µg).  
Why is this important? 
A good induction method achieves a safe birth for mother and baby. It is effective, results in a relatively low number of caesarean sections, has few side effects, and is highly acceptable to mothers. Some methods of inducing labour may cause more caesarean sections by being ineffective at bringing on labour, other methods may lead to more caesareans as they cause too many contractions (hyperstimulation) that result in the baby becoming distressed (foetal heart rate changes). 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 14 February 2021 and identified 61 trials involving 20,026 women for inclusion in this review. Not all trials were high quality. 
Starting with oral misoprostol immediately may have a similar effect on rates of caesarean section (4 trials, 594 women; low‐certainty evidence) to giving no treatment for 12 to 24 hours then starting oxytocin, while the effects of misoprostol on uterine hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes are unclear (3 trials, 495 women; very low‐quality evidence). All women in theses trials had ruptured membranes. 
Oral misoprostol was compared to vaginal dinoprostone in 13 trials (9676 women). Misoprostol use probably decreased the risk of caesarean section (moderate‐certainty evidence). When studies were divided by their initial dose of misoprostol, there was evidence that use of 10 µg to 25 µg may be effective in reducing the risk of a caesarean section (9 trials, 8652 women), while the higher 50 µg dose might not reduce the risk (4 trials, 1024 women). There may be very small or no differences between misoprostol and dinoprostone in rates of vaginal births within 24 hours (10 trials, 8983 women; low‐certainty evidence) but may be fewer cases of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes with oral misoprostol (11 trials, 9084 women; low‐certainty evidence).  
Oral misoprostol was compared with vaginal misoprostol in 33 trials (6110 women). Oral use may have resulted in fewer vaginal births within 24 hours (16 trials, 3451 women; low‐certainty evidence). Oral use may have caused less hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (25 trials, 4857 women; low‐certainty evidence), especially with a dose of 10 µg to 25 µg. There was no clear difference in the number of caesarean sections overall (32 trials, 5914 women; low‐certainty evidence) but oral use likely resulted in fewer caesareans being performed because of concerns of the baby being in distress (24 trials, 4775 women). 
When oral misoprostol was compared to oxytocin for induction, misoprostol use probably resulted in fewer caesarean sections (6 trials, 737 women). We found no clear difference in vaginal birth within 24 hours (3 trials, 466 women; moderate‐certainty evidence) or hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (3 trials, 331 women; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Oral misoprostol was compared to a balloon catheter inserted in the cervix to mechanically induce labour. The number of vaginal births within 24 hours may have increased with misoprostol (4 trials, 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence). Misoprostol probably reduced the risk of caesarean section (6 trials, 2993 women; moderate‐certainty evidence) with no difference in risk of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (4 trials, 1044 women; low‐certainty evidence). 
Different doses and timings of giving oral misoprostol were explored in three small trials. The certainty of the findings from these trials was either low or very low so we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions from this data. 
What does this mean? 
Using low‐dose (50 µg or less) oral misoprostol to induce labour likely leads to fewer caesarean sections and so more vaginal births than vaginal dinoprostone, oxytocin, and a transcervical Foley catheter. Rates of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes were comparable with these methods. Misoprostol taken by mouth causes less hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes compared to when taken vaginally.  
More trials are needed to establish the most effective misoprostol regimen for labour induction, but for now the findings of this review support oral rather than vaginal use, and suggest that commencing oral misoprostol at a dose of 25 µg or less may be safe and effective.

Epiretinal membrane is an abnormal sheet of avascular fibrocellular tissue that develops on the inner surface of the retina. Epiretinal membrane can cause impairment of sight as a consequence of progressive distortion of retinal architecture. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of surgery compared to no intervention for epiretinal membrane.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, ISRCTN registry, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. The databases were last searched on 20 May 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing surgical removal of idiopathic epiretinal membrane compared to placebo, no treatment or sham treatment. Paired or within‐person studies were included, as well as those where both eyes of a single participant were treated. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods expected by Cochrane, and assessed certainty using the GRADE system. We considered the following five outcome measures: mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study eye between baseline (before randomisation), 6 months and 12 months later; proportion of people with a gain of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity in the study eye as measured by a logMAR chart at a starting distance of 4 m at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation; proportion of people with a loss of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity in the study eye as measured by a logMAR chart at a starting distance of 4 m at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation; mean quality of life score at 6 months and 12 months following surgery, measured using a validated questionnaire; and any harm identified during follow‐up. 
Main results
We included one study in the review. This was a RCT including 53 eyes of 53 participants with mild symptomatic epiretinal membrane and BCVA of 65 or more Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. Participants were randomly allocated to immediate surgery or to watchful waiting with deferred surgery if indicated by evidence of disease progression. The study was limited by imprecision owing to the small number of participants and was at some risk of bias owing to inconsistencies in the time points for outcome assessment and in the management of lens opacity. 
At 12 months, the visual acuity in the immediate surgery group was higher by a mean of 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.0 to 6.2 ETDRS letters; 53 participants; low‐certainty evidence) than the watchful waiting/deferred surgery group. 
The evidence of the effect of immediate surgery on gains of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.93; 53 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
At 12 months, no participant in either group sustained a loss of 0.3 logMAR or more of visual acuity (53 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
The included study did not measure quality of life.
At 12 months, no serious adverse event was identified in any participant. One participant developed chronic minimal cystoid macular oedema following immediate surgery (53 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We found no RCT that directly investigated the effect of surgery compared to no intervention. For severe disabling epiretinal membrane, the lack of a RCT comparing surgery to no intervention may reflect evidence from non‐randomised studies in favour of surgery; a RCT may be considered unnecessary and ethically unacceptable because a superior effect of surgery is widely accepted. For mild symptomatic epiretinal membrane, however, the value of surgery is uncertain. Low‐certainty evidence from this review suggests that watchful waiting or deferred surgery may offer outcomes as favourable as immediate surgery. However, this finding needs to be confirmed in further RCTs with appropriate statistical power, masking of treatment allocation, consistent management of cataract, and measurement of outcomes including patient‐reported quality of life over a more extended time frame.

Should people with a mild eye membrane have surgery now or wait?

Rationale
The retina is the light sensing layer in the back of the eye. A thin film can form on it. Doctors call this film an epiretinal membrane. It can pull on the retina and make sight look wavy or blurred. Reading and face lines can look bent.

Surgery can peel off this thin film. It may improve sight. But surgery has risks, like swelling. Many people with mild signs still see well. It is not clear if surgery right away helps them.

This study asked a simple question. If your signs are mild, is early surgery better than a wait and see plan? The hope was that early surgery would give better sight. The team also wanted to know about safety.

Trial Design
The team looked for fair tests of this question. They searched many medical lists up to May 20, 2020. They found one fair test to include.

In that test, people went into two groups by chance. One group had surgery right away. The other group used watch and wait care. People in the wait group could have surgery later if eyes got worse.

There were 53 people in the study. Each person had one study eye. All had mild signs from this membrane. They also saw well at the start based on a standard eye chart.

The study checked sight at about six months and one year. It used a standard eye chart test. The study did not report ages or sex. It did not measure day to day life quality. People stayed in the study for one year.

Results
After one year, the early surgery group could read about two more letters. This was on a standard eye chart. The wait group did almost as well. This small gap may not matter in real life.

No one in either group lost a large amount of sight at one year. The test could not show if more people had a big sight gain with early surgery. The study was small, so results are not certain.

No serious harm was found in any group at one year. One person in the early surgery group had long lasting mild swelling in the retina. The study did not report pain or how people felt day to day.

What do these results mean for you? If you have mild signs and still see well, it may be safe to wait. A watch and wait plan, with checks, may do as well as early surgery at one year. You could still have surgery later if your sight gets worse.

This is one small study, so we must be careful. The time of check ups was not the same for all. Care for a cloudy lens, or cataract, was not the same for all. These things can affect sight. So the results are not strong.

For people with very bad signs and poor sight, most doctors think surgery helps. A fair test that withholds surgery from them may not be right to do. But when signs are mild, the best plan is not clear yet.

We need more and larger fair tests. These tests should hide group choice from staff and patients. They should treat cataracts in the same way. They should also ask people how their sight affects daily life. The follow up should be longer than one year.

In short, here is the main take away. For mild epiretinal membrane, early surgery did not show a clear big benefit at one year. Watch and wait, with the option for later surgery, may be just as good. Talk with your eye doctor. Ask about your sight now, your risk, and your goals. This can help you choose the best plan for you.","What are the benefits and risks of surgery for epiretinal membrane (a disease of the eye)? 
Why is this question important?An epiretinal membrane is an abnormal layer of tissue that develops at the back of the eye. It affects around one in five people aged 75 years and older. In most people, the development of an epiretinal membrane is linked to the normal ageing processes in the eye and is described as 'idiopathic'. In other instances, epiretinal membrane is caused by a pre‐existing condition affecting the retina, such as inflammation or poor circluation. Epiretinal membrane can also develop after eye surgery. 
Epiretinal membrane typically forms over the part of the eye responsible for seeing fine detail (the macula). In some people, this does not affect vision. In others, it causes distorted or blurred vision, which can affect people’s quality of life. For example, an epiretinal membrane may impair people’s ability to read or drive. 
If an epiretinal membrane affects vision, it is commonly removed by surgery. A local anaesthetic (medication) is used to numb the eye area. As with any procedure, this surgery carries risks of harm from side effects. These include potential problems such as cataract, detached retina, infection and bleeding in the eye. 
To understand when the benefits of surgery outweigh its risks, we reviewed the research evidence. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched the medical literature for studies: 
‐ in which epiretinal membrane was not caused by a pre‐existing condition or surgery;
‐ that compared the effects of surgery against no surgery or a placebo (sham) procedure; and 
‐ where people were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a group that underwent surgery for epiretinal membrane, and a group that did not have surgery for epiretinal membrane. 
We then summarised the evidence and rated our confidence in it, based on factors such as study methods and size. 
What did we find?We found only one study that met our criteria. This study took place in Denmark and included 53 people who had epiretinal membranes causing mild impairment of sight. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Those in one group had immediate surgery. Those in the other group were watched closely and in the event of any deterioration in their condition were invited to have surgery. People in both groups were followed up for one year. 
The study results suggest that immediate surgery for epiretinal membrane causing mild impairment of sight: 
‐ may not benefit vision 12 months after surgery; and
‐ may not lead to serious unwanted effects. One person treated with immediate surgery experienced an unwanted effect that was not considered serious. This was the development of an eye condition caused by fluid building up at the back of the eye. 
The study did not investigate the impact of surgery on participants’ quality of life.
How confident are we in the evidence?We are not confident in the evidence, because: 
‐ it is based on one small study; and
‐ some of the methods used by the researchers who conducted it may have introduced errors in its results. 
What does this mean?For epiretinal membrane causing severe disabling impairment of sight, we found no carefully‐controlled study that measured the effect of surgery. For severe epiretinal membrane, surgery is widely considered to improve the outcome and is routine practice. A carefully controlled trial comparing surgery to no treatment is considered unecessary and ethically inappropriate. 
For epiretinal membrane causing mild impairment of sight, however, the effect of surgery is uncertain. There is some evidence that the outcome of watchful waiting may be as good as the effect of immediate surgery. However, the evidence is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions. Further studies that use robust methods and measure outcomes including quality of life in the longer term would help to determine effect of surgery with more confidence. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to May 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013264.pub2,"Background
Postoperative administration of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces patient opioid requirements and, in turn, may reduce the incidence and severity of opioid‐induced adverse events (AEs). 
Objectives
To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single‐dose intravenous (IV) ibuprofen, compared with placebo or an active comparator, for moderate‐to‐severe postoperative pain in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases without language restrictions: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS on 10 June 2021. We checked clinical trials registers and reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials that compared a single postoperative dose of intravenous (IV) ibuprofen with placebo or another active treatment, for treating acute postoperative pain in adults following any surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for review inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data.Our primary outcome was the number of participants in each arm achieving at least 50% pain relief over a 4‐ and 6‐hour period. 
Our secondary outcomes were time to, and number of participants using rescue medication; withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and for any other cause; and number of participants reporting or experiencing any AE, serious AEs (SAEs), and specific NSAID‐related or opioid‐related AEs. 
We were not able to carry out any planned meta‐analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Only one study met our inclusion criteria, involving 201 total participants, mostly female (mean age 42 years), undergoing primary, unilateral, distal, first metatarsal bunionectomy (with osteotomy and internal fixation). Ibuprofen 300 mg, placebo or acetaminophen 1000 mg was administered intravenously to participants reporting moderate pain intensity the day after surgery. Since we identified only one study for inclusion, we did not perform any quantitative analyses. The study was at low risk of bias for most domains. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to serious study limitations, indirectness and imprecision. 
Ibuprofen versus placebo 
Findings of the single study found that at both the 4‐hour and 6‐hour assessment period, the proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief was 32% (24/76) for those assigned to ibuprofen and 22% (11/50) for those assigned to placebo. These findings produced a risk ratio (RR) of 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 2.66 versus placebo for at least 50% of maximum pain relief over the 4‐hour and 6‐hour period (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Median time to rescue medication was 101 minutes for ibuprofen and 71 minutes for placebo (1 study, 126 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The number of participants using rescue medication was not reported within the included study. 
During the study (1 study, 126 participants), 58/76 (76%) of participants assigned to ibuprofen and 39/50 (78%) assigned to placebo reported or experienced any adverse event (AE), (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19; low‐certainty evidence). 
No serious AEs (SAEs) were experienced (1 study, 126 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Ibuprofen versus active comparators 
Ibuprofen (300 mg) was similar to the active comparator, IV acetaminophen (1000 mg) at 4 hours and 6 hours (1 study, 126 participants). For those assigned to active control (acetaminophen), the proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief was 35% (26/75) at 4 hours and 31% (23/75) at 6 hours. At 4 hours, these findings produced a RR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.43; very low‐certainty evidence) versus active comparator (acetaminophen). At 6 hours, these findings produced a RR of 1.03 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.66; very low‐certainty evidence) versus active comparator (acetaminophen). 
Median time to rescue medication was 101 minutes for ibuprofen and 125 minutes for the active comparator, acetaminophen (1 study, 151 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The number of participants using rescue medication was not reported within the included study. 
During the study, 58/76 (76%) of participants assigned to ibuprofen and 45/75 (60%) assigned to active control (acetaminophen) reported or experienced any AE, (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.59; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No SAEs were experienced (1 study, 151 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the suggestion that IV ibuprofen is effective and safe for acute postoperative pain in adults.  
","1. Plain Title
Do IV ibuprofen shots help pain after surgery?

2. Rationale
Pain after surgery is common. It can slow healing and sleep. It can make it hard to move. Many people get strong pain drugs, like morphine. These are called opioids. Opioids can cause sick stomach, hard stool, and sleepiness. They can slow breath. Doctors want ways to use fewer opioids.

Ibuprofen is a pain drug. It is a “non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug,” or NSAID. That means it can lower pain and swelling. An IV drug goes into a vein. It may work fast. This review asked if one IV dose of ibuprofen helps pain after surgery. It also asked if it is safe.

3. Trial Design
How is this study designed? A research team looked for all fair tests. They searched big medical lists on June 10, 2021. They looked for studies in adults after any type of surgery. People had to have moderate to severe pain. The study had to give one dose of IV ibuprofen after surgery. It had to compare this to a dummy drug, or to another pain drug.

The team found one study that fit. It had 201 adults. Most were women. The average age was 42 years. All had foot bunion surgery. This is a common foot bone surgery. People had moderate pain the day after surgery. Each person got one IV dose. The choices were ibuprofen 300 mg, acetaminophen 1000 mg, or a placebo. A placebo is a dummy drug with no active medicine.

The team then checked pain. They checked pain over 4 hours and 6 hours. They asked who got at least half pain relief. They also timed when people needed extra pain pills. Extra pills are called “rescue” medicine. They also watched for side effects. Side effects are any health problems during the study.

4. Results
What were the main results? This review found only one study. So the team could not pool results. They judged the proof as very uncertain. This was due to limits in the study. It was one type of surgery in one group. The groups were not large.

Pain relief: Ibuprofen helped some people. At 4 and 6 hours, 24 of 76 people on ibuprofen got at least half pain relief. On placebo, 11 of 50 people got at least half relief. For acetaminophen, 26 of 75 people at 4 hours got at least half relief. At 6 hours, 23 of 75 people did. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen were close.

Extra pain pills: The typical time to extra pain pills was longer with ibuprofen. It was 101 minutes after ibuprofen. It was 71 minutes after placebo. It was 125 minutes after acetaminophen. The study did not report how many people took extra pills.

Side effects: Many people in each group had some side effect. With ibuprofen, 58 of 76 had some side effect. With placebo, 39 of 50 had some side effect. With acetaminophen, 45 of 75 had some side effect. No one had a very bad side effect. A very bad side effect means life‑threat or a severe event.

Safety and limits: The team rated the proof as very low. This means we are not sure the results will hold in other groups. It was one study in foot surgery. We do not know if the same is true after other surgery. We also do not know the best dose. We do not know the effect of more than one dose. We do not know who is most likely to benefit.

What this means for patients: A single IV dose of ibuprofen may help some people after foot surgery. It may delay the need for extra pain pills. In this study, it looked close to IV acetaminophen. The counts for side effects were alike for ibuprofen and placebo. More people on ibuprofen had side effects than on acetaminophen in this study. No one had a very bad side effect in any group.

What this means for care: We still do not know if IV ibuprofen is a good and safe choice for all adults after surgery. We also do not know if it can cut opioid use in a clear way. More and larger tests are needed. These tests should include many types of surgery. They should track pain, extra pills, and side effects for longer.

Bottom line: The proof is not strong enough to support or reject IV ibuprofen for pain after surgery. It may help some people. But we need better data to be sure. Please talk with your care team about pain plans. They can help choose the best and safest plan for you.","What are the benefits and risks of a single injection of ibuprofen (an anti‐inflammation medicine) for relieving short‐term pain after surgery in adults?  
Key messages 
‐ There is not enough evidence to determine whether intravenous (injection into a vein) ibuprofen is an effective treatment for adults with pain after surgery or if it can harm them.  
‐ It would be beneficial if future studies on this topic were well‐designed with a large number of patients to determine if ibuprofen is an effective treatment for the management of pain after surgery. 
‐ More evidence is required to establish if ibuprofen causes serious unwanted effects.
Treating short‐term pain after surgery 
Pain is common in the short term (within 6 hours) after surgery (postoperative pain). 
Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, aspirin‐like drugs) are often delivered along with opioids (such as morphine) to treat this type of pain. However, NSAIDs can have side effects. NSAIDS (such as ibuprofen) may result in bleeding (e.g. at the site of an incision or wound) and may result in injury to the kidneys and gut.  
Patients need more and better treatment options to help manage short‐term pain after surgery. There is a lot of concern about using opioids to treat short‐term pain because of the risk that patients can develop unpleasant side effects or opioid over‐use disorder. It is therefore important to weigh the benefits and risks of NSAIDs when considering using them to reduce pain shortly after surgery. 
What did we want to find out? 
Ibuprofen is a NSAID that can be delivered intravenously. We wanted to know if intravenous ibuprofen (delivered by injection or drip) is a helpful treatment option to manage moderate‐to‐severe pain when patients cannot take medicines by mouth.  
What did we do? 
To make the comparison fair, patients in the studies must all have had the same random chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive the ibuprofen or the other treatment.  
We searched the medical literature (clinical studies) up to June 2021, where intravenous ibuprofen was used to treat pain after surgery in adults (aged over 18) and compared against: 
‐ a placebo (a control treatment, such as a bag of saline administered into a vein); or 
‐ another medicine.
What did we find? 
We found only one study which was suitable to include in our review. The study looked at the management of pain after bunionectomy. Bunionectomy is a surgery to remove a bunion at the base of the big toe. This study evaluated 201 people, mostly females. The study compared intravenous ibuprofen to: 
‐ a placebo; or
‐ another medicine, acetaminophen (paracetamol).
We were most interested in learning how many people had their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery.  
Pain reduction 
The study showed that:
‐ more people who received ibuprofen had their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery as compared to those who received placebo; and  
‐ there was little to no difference when ibuprofen was compared to another medicine, acetaminophen, i.e. the numbers of people with pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within 4 or 6 hours of surgery  
Need for extra pain medicines (rescue medication) 
Rescue medicine is an extra pain medication if the study medication is not treating the patient's pain well enough. The time (in minutes) to needing rescue medication was longer (delayed) with use of ibuprofen or acetaminophen than for those who received placebo.  
Adverse events 
There was not enough information in this study to assess side effects, but the rate at which they occurred appeared to be similar among all treatments. Very few patients dropped out because of side effects. This is usually the case in studies where patients are only in a study for a short period of time.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We only had results from one relatively small study. This limited our confidence in the evidence. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to June 2021.

Severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The definitive management for severe AS is aortic valve replacement (AVR). The choice of transcatheter approach versus open‐heart surgery for AVR in people with severe AS and low surgical risk remains a matter of debate. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in people with severe AS and low surgical risk. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 29 April 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We searched all databases from inception to present and imposed no restriction on language or date of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs that compared TAVI and SAVR in adults (18 years of age or older) with severe AS and low surgical risk. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias in the studies included. We analysed dichotomous data using the risk ratio (RR) and continuous data using the mean difference (MD), with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Our outcomes of interest were assessed in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow‐up). Primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, stroke, and rehospitalisation. Secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac death, length of hospital stay (LOS), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, new‐onset atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury (AKI), and any bleeding. 
Main results
We identified four studies (13 reports), with 2818 participants, and one ongoing study. Overall certainty of evidence ranged from high to very low. 
There is probably little or no difference between TAVI and SAVR for the following short‐term outcomes: all‐cause mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.44; SAVR 11 deaths per 1000, TAVI 8 deaths per 1000 (95% CI 4 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25; SAVR 21 strokes per 1000, TAVI 16 strokes per 1000 (95% CI 9 to 27); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); MI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.58; SAVR 14 MI per 1000, TAVI 11 MI per 1000 (95% CI 6 to 21); 2748 participants; 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); and cardiac death (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.56; SAVR 10 cardiac deaths per 1000, TAVI 7 cardiac deaths per 1000 (95% CI 3 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
TAVI may reduce the risk of short‐term rehospitalisation, although the confidence interval also includes the possibility of no difference in risk between groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06; SAVR 30 cases per 1000, TAVI 19 cases per 1000 (95% CI 12 to 32); 2468 participants; 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
TAVI, compared with SAVR, probably increases the risk of PPM implantation (RR 3.65, 95% CI 1.50 to 8.87; SAVR 47 per 1000, TAVI 170 cases per 1000 (95% CI 70 to 413); number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 7; 2683 participants; 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the LOS in days, although it appears to be associated with shorter LOS. 
TAVI, compared with SAVR, reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.30; 2683 participants; 3 studies), AKI (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.58; 2753 participants; 4 studies), and bleeding (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62; 2753 participants; 4 studies) (all high‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Our meta‐analysis indicates that, in the short term, TAVI probably has little or no mortality difference compared to SAVR for severe AS in individuals with low surgical risk. Similarly, there is probably little or no difference in risk of stroke, MI, and cardiac death between the two approaches. TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation, but we are uncertain about the effects on LOS. TAVI reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation, AKI, and bleeding. However, this benefit is offset by the increased risk of PPM implantation. Long‐term follow‐up data are needed to further assess and validate these outcomes, especially durability, in the low surgical risk population.

Tube valve or open surgery for a tight heart valve: what this review found

Rationale
Some people have a tight heart valve. Doctors call this aortic valve stenosis. It can cause chest pain, fainting, and short breath. It can lead to heart failure and even death.

The main fix is to replace the valve. There are two ways to do this. One way uses a thin tube in a blood vessel to place a new valve. Doctors call this TAVI. The other way is open chest surgery to remove the old valve and sew in a new one. Doctors call this SAVR.

Both ways can help. But for people with low surgical risk, doctors still debate the best way. Low surgical risk means doctors expect a low chance of bad events from surgery. This review asked a key question. Which way brings more good and less harm in the short term?

Trial Design
This was a review of high‑quality trials. In each trial, a computer put people by chance into one of two groups. One group had TAVI. The other group had open surgery. This is the best way to compare care.

The team searched many medical lists up to April 2019. They found four trials. One other study was still running. The four trials had 2818 adults. All had a very tight aortic valve. All had a low risk for surgery.

The trials looked at short‑term results only. That means during the hospital stay and up to 30 days after the procedure. The main things they tracked were death, stroke, and a return to the hospital. They also tracked heart attack, new heart rhythm problems, kidney injury, bleeding, time in the hospital, and the need for a pacemaker.

Results
Death in the short term was about the same in both groups. Out of 1000 people, 8 died after TAVI. Out of 1000 people, 11 died after surgery. The review suggests these numbers are close.

Stroke was also about the same. A stroke is a blood flow block or bleed in the brain. Out of 1000 people, 16 had a stroke after TAVI. Out of 1000 people, 21 had a stroke after surgery. The review suggests these numbers are close as well.

Heart attack was about the same in both groups. A heart attack is when blood flow to the heart stops. Out of 1000 people, 11 had a heart attack after TAVI. Out of 1000 people, 14 had a heart attack after surgery. Death due to heart causes was also about the same. Out of 1000 people, 7 died from heart causes after TAVI. Out of 1000 people, 10 died from heart causes after surgery.

Return to the hospital may be lower with TAVI. Out of 1000 people, 19 went back after TAVI. Out of 1000 people, 30 went back after surgery. We are less sure about this result.

More people needed a new pacemaker after TAVI. A pacemaker is a small device. It helps the heart beat in a steady way. Out of 1000 people, 170 needed a pacemaker after TAVI. Out of 1000 people, 47 needed a pacemaker after surgery. This is an important risk to weigh.

With TAVI, fewer people had a new fast or uneven beat. Doctors call this atrial fibrillation. With TAVI, fewer people had a sudden kidney problem. Doctors call this acute kidney injury. With TAVI, fewer people had bleeding. The review was very sure about these three results.

Time in the hospital may be shorter with TAVI. But the review could not prove this. We need more data to be sure.

What do these results mean for you? In the short term, both ways work about the same for low risk adults. Death, stroke, and heart attack were about the same with both treatments. TAVI may help you avoid bleeding, a new uneven heart beat, and a sudden kidney problem. But TAVI makes it more likely you will need a new pacemaker.

These results cover the short term only. We still do not know the long‑term results. We do not know how long the new valves last in low risk adults. Future studies will test valve life span and other long‑term results. Your choice should fit your goals and your health. Talk with your heart team about what matters most to you. They can help you weigh the trade‑offs for your case.","Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement in people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk 
Review question 
Does transcatheter approach, compared to open‐heart surgery, for aortic valve replacement improve outcomes in people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk? 
Background 
Aortic stenosis (AS) is the narrowing of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins). It typically gets worse over time. Its severity can be divided into mild, moderate, severe, and very severe; and it is distinguishable by ultrasound scan of the heart and other clinical features. Once it has become severe, treatment primarily involves surgery to replace the valve. An alternative approach is to use transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This approach improves outcomes in individuals who are inoperable or at a high to intermediate risk for surgery. However, it remains unclear if TAVI is beneficial to those who have severe AS and are at a low surgical risk. 
Search Date 
The evidence is current to April 2019. We searched the literature and found a total of 3092 citations that were potentially relevant. After reviewing each of these, we found 13 published articles describing four clinical trials that could help us answer our question. 
Study characteristics 
The four clinical trials included 2818 participants who were randomly allocated to undergo either TAVI or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The trials were multicentre and took place in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the USA, Denmark, and Sweden. 
Key Results 
Moderate‐certainty evidence from clinical trials shows that, in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow‐up), there is probably little or no difference between TAVI compared with SAVR in risk of death due to any cause, stroke (insult to the brain), myocardial infarction (injury or death of heart muscle), or death due to cardiac causes (e.g. myocardial infarction or failure of the heart muscle pump). Low‐certainty evidence shows that TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation compared with SAVR. We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the length of hospital stay, although it appears to be associated with shorter duration of hospitalisation. High‐certainty evidence shows that fewer people had atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heart rhythm), acute kidney injury (insult to the kidney), and bleeding when they underwent TAVI, compared with SAVR. However, moderate‐certainty evidence shows that TAVI probably increases the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (a device that is placed to artificially set the heart rhythm), compared with SAVR. 
Quality of the evidence 
We consider the overall quality of evidence to be moderate for most relevant outcomes (death, stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and risk of permanent pacemaker implantation), with the exception of rehospitalisation (low‐quality evidence) and length of hospital stay (very low quality evidence). The evidence for atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and bleeding was of high quality.

10.1002-14651858.CD012030.pub2,"Psychological therapies to reduce tiredness in patients with incurable cancer
Background 
Patients with incurable cancer often experience tiredness (fatigue) during cancer treatment. Psychological therapies may help to reduce this symptom. Tiredness in cancer patients receiving cancer treatment may be treated with psychological therapies aimed at influencing or changing thoughts, emotions, behaviours, social interactions, or a combination of these (e.g. cognitive‐behavioural therapies, supportive‐expressive group therapies). This review looked at how effective psychological therapies are in reducing tiredness in patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment. 
Study characteristics 
In November 2016, we searched for clinical trials looking at psychological therapies in patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment. We found 14 small studies of very low quality reporting data on tiredness outcomes, 12 of which provided data for analyses. A limited number (three studies) reported results about side effects; these studies investigated a psychological therapy combined with medication. 
Key findings 
Review authors found no support for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in reducing tiredness when assessed directly following the intervention. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that psychological therapies may improve physical functioning directly after the intervention and may improve tiredness at first follow‐up. Evidence shows no support for the effectiveness of psychosocial therapies in improving other domains of functioning. Limited evaluation of potential harm suggests no differences in side effects between patients receiving psychological therapy and those given usual care. Limited good quality evidence allows no conclusions on the use of psychological therapies in people with incurable cancer. Larger, high‐quality trials are needed to find out whether psychological therapies help reduce tiredness for people with incurable cancer during cancer treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of study evidence using four levels: very low, low, moderate, and high. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Included studies had design problems and included a very small number of participants. Therefore, the quality of the evidence in this review is very low, and results of this review should be interpreted with caution.

Can Talk Therapy Help With Cancer Tiredness? A Look at Small Studies

Rationale
People with incurable cancer often feel very tired. Doctors call this tiredness fatigue. It can start during cancer care. It can make daily tasks hard.

Incurable cancer means the cancer cannot be removed or cured. Care aims to help people live longer and feel better. Fatigue is not normal tiredness. Rest may not fix it. It can strain the body, mind, and daily life.

Many people also feel stress, worry, or low mood. These can make fatigue feel worse. Talk therapy may help with thoughts and feelings. It may also help with how people act day to day.

Talk therapy (also called psychological therapy) means meeting with a trained person. You learn skills to change thoughts and actions. You may also share feelings in a group. Some therapy teaches coping and problem solving skills. Some therapy helps people share and gain support.

Doctors want to know if talk therapy helps fatigue. This review looked at past clinical trials. The hope was that talk therapy could ease fatigue. The team also looked for any harms.

Trial Design
This was a review of past clinical trials. The team searched for trials in November 2016. They looked for studies during cancer care for incurable cancer. They focused on tiredness results.

They found 14 small studies. Twelve had data they could analyze. Only three studies reported side effects. Those three used talk therapy plus a medicine.

People in the studies had incurable cancer. They were getting cancer treatment. The abstract did not list ages or gender. Time in each study was not clear.

Types of talk therapy differed by study. Some taught coping and problem solving skills. Some used group sharing and support. Some studies compared therapy to usual care. Not all details were clear in this abstract.

The team rated the proof using four levels. The levels were high, moderate, low, and very low. Most of the proof in this review was very low. This means we are very unsure about the results.

Results
The review did not find clear help with tiredness right after therapy. This was the main tiredness check. So, we cannot say it works at that point.

There were small hints of benefit later. Some data showed less tiredness at a later check. A later check means a follow-up visit after therapy. Some data also showed better physical function right after therapy. But the proof for these gains was very weak.

Other parts of daily life did not seem to improve. The review saw no clear gains there. So, talk therapy did not show broad change across life areas.

Side effects looked similar to usual care. Only three studies reported side effects. Those three added medicine to therapy. So, we cannot judge harms well from this review.

Why is the proof weak? Many studies were small. Many had design limits. This can skew results. It can hide real help or make help look bigger than it is.

Very low-quality proof means we are very unsure. Results could change with better studies. High-quality proof means results would be solid. This review did not have that level of proof.

What does this mean for you? Talk therapy may still help some people cope. It can offer support and skills. But we do not have clear proof that it eases fatigue right away. We only saw weak hints of help at a later check.

What should happen next? We need more, larger, and better trials. These should test talk therapy during cancer care. They should look at fatigue and daily life. They should report harms in clear ways.

Why keep testing talk therapy? It may help thoughts, feelings, and actions that drain energy. It may help people manage cancer care demands. These are good reasons to study it well.

If you feel very tired, tell your care team. Ask about options to help you cope. You can also ask if talk therapy is right for you. Your team can guide you based on your needs.

In short, this review found no clear help right after therapy. It found weak hints of help at a later check and for physical function. It found no clear help in other life areas. Harms looked similar to usual care in very few studies. The proof was very low in quality. We need strong studies to know if talk therapy helps cancer fatigue.","Psychological therapies to reduce tiredness in patients with incurable cancer
Background 
Patients with incurable cancer often experience tiredness (fatigue) during cancer treatment. Psychological therapies may help to reduce this symptom. Tiredness in cancer patients receiving cancer treatment may be treated with psychological therapies aimed at influencing or changing thoughts, emotions, behaviours, social interactions, or a combination of these (e.g. cognitive‐behavioural therapies, supportive‐expressive group therapies). This review looked at how effective psychological therapies are in reducing tiredness in patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment. 
Study characteristics 
In November 2016, we searched for clinical trials looking at psychological therapies in patients with incurable cancer receiving cancer treatment. We found 14 small studies of very low quality reporting data on tiredness outcomes, 12 of which provided data for analyses. A limited number (three studies) reported results about side effects; these studies investigated a psychological therapy combined with medication. 
Key findings 
Review authors found no support for the effectiveness of psychological therapies in reducing tiredness when assessed directly following the intervention. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that psychological therapies may improve physical functioning directly after the intervention and may improve tiredness at first follow‐up. Evidence shows no support for the effectiveness of psychosocial therapies in improving other domains of functioning. Limited evaluation of potential harm suggests no differences in side effects between patients receiving psychological therapy and those given usual care. Limited good quality evidence allows no conclusions on the use of psychological therapies in people with incurable cancer. Larger, high‐quality trials are needed to find out whether psychological therapies help reduce tiredness for people with incurable cancer during cancer treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of study evidence using four levels: very low, low, moderate, and high. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Included studies had design problems and included a very small number of participants. Therefore, the quality of the evidence in this review is very low, and results of this review should be interpreted with caution.

Fetal malposition (occipito‐posterior and persistent occipito‐transverse) in labour is associated with adverse maternal and infant outcomes. Whether use of maternal postures can improve these outcomes is unclear. This Cochrane Review of maternal posture in labour is one of two new reviews replacing a 2007 review of maternal postures in pregnancy and labour. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of specified maternal postures for women with fetal malposition in labour on maternal and infant morbidity compared to other postures.  
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (13 July 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster‐RCTs conducted among labouring women with a fetal malposition confirmed by ultrasound or clinical examination, comparing a specified maternal posture with another posture. Quasi‐RCTs and cross‐over trials were not eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, risk of bias, and performed data extraction. We used mean difference (MD) for continuous variables, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included eight eligible studies with 1766 women. 
All studies reported some form of random sequence generation but were at high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding. There was a high risk of selection bias in one study, detection bias in two studies, attrition bias in two studies, and reporting bias in two studies. 
Hands and knees 
The use of hands and knees posture may have little to no effect on operative birth (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.50; 3 trials, 721 women; low‐certainty evidence) and caesarean section (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.87; 3 trials, 721 women; low‐certainty evidence) but the evidence is uncertain; and very uncertain for epidural use (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.31; 2 trials, 282 women; very low‐certainty evidence), instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.90; 3 trials, 721 women; very low‐certainty evidence), severe perineal tears (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.03 to 22.30; 2 trials, 586 women; very low‐certainty evidence), maternal satisfaction (average RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.54; 3 trials, 350 women; very low‐certainty evidence), and Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.34; 2 trials, 586 babies; very low‐certainty evidence).  
No data were reported for the hands and knees comparisons for postpartum haemorrhage, serious neonatal morbidity, death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant), admission to neonatal intensive care, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy.  
Lateral postures 
The use of lateral postures may have little to no effect on reducing operative birth (average RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.19; 4 trials, 871 women; low‐certainty evidence), caesarean section (average RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.39; 4 trials, 871 women; low‐certainty evidence), instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.36; 4 trials, 871 women; low‐certainty evidence), and maternal satisfaction (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; 2 trials, 451 women; low‐certainty evidence), but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of lateral postures on severe perineal tears (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.48; 3 trials, 609 women; very low‐certainty evidence), postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.70; 1 trial, 322 women; very low‐certainty evidence), serious neonatal morbidity (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.12; 3 trials, 752 babies; very low‐certainty evidence), Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.24; 1 trial, 322 babies; very low‐certainty evidence), admissions to neonatal intensive care (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.12; 2 trials, 542 babies; very low‐certainty evidence) and neonatal death (stillbirth or death of liveborn) (1 trial, 210 women and their babies; no events).  
For the lateral posture comparisons, no data were reported for epidural use, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy. We were not able to estimate the outcome death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant) due to no events (1 trial, 210 participants).  
Authors' conclusions
We found low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence which indicated that the use of hands and knees posture or lateral postures in women in labour with a fetal malposition may have little or no effect on health outcomes of the mother or her infant. If a woman finds the use of hands and knees or lateral postures in labour comfortable there is no reason why they should not choose to use them. Further research is needed on the use of hands and knees and lateral postures for women with a malposition in labour. Trials should include further assessment of semi‐prone postures, same‐side‐as‐fetus lateral postures with or without hip hyperflexion, or both, and consider interventions of longer duration or that involve the early second stage of labour.

Do labor positions help when a baby faces the wrong way?

Rationale
Some babies do not face the best way during labor. The baby may face your belly, not your back. Or the baby’s head may point to your side. Doctors call this “malposition.”

This can make labor hard and long. It can raise the chance of a tough birth. You may have more pain. You may need surgery or tools to help the birth. This can also stress the baby.

Many people hope that body position can help. For example, hands and knees, or lying on your side. These poses may help the baby turn. They are simple and low cost. But we do not know if they work.

This study looked at what we do know. It asked if these poses help moms and babies. It also asked if they lower harm.

Trial Design
This was a review of several trials. A review is a study that looks at many studies. It helps us see the big picture.

The review team found eight trials. These trials had 1,766 women in labor. Each woman had a baby in a “wrong way” head position. A midwife or doctor checked this by exam or by ultrasound.

Women were put into groups by chance. One group used a set pose, like hands and knees. Another group used a different pose, or usual care. The time in the study was during labor and birth.

The trials checked key outcomes. These were birth by surgery, called a C-section. Birth with tools, like forceps or a vacuum. Heavy bleeding after birth. Bad tears. Pain care with an epidural (a numbing shot in the back). Newborn health right after birth. A baby health check at five minutes, called the Apgar score.

Many trials were small. Many had limits in how they were run. This makes us less sure of the results.

Results
Hands and knees pose:
- We do not know if hands and knees change the chance of a C-section. The trials suggest little to no change.
- We do not know if hands and knees change the chance of a birth with tools. Again, the trials suggest little to no change.
- We are not sure if hands and knees change the need for an epidural. The data are very unsure.
- We are not sure if hands and knees change bad tears. We are also not sure about mom’s view of care.
- For the baby, we are not sure if hands and knees change the Apgar score at five minutes.
- The trials did not report on some key baby issues. These include baby death, brain injury, or need for breathing help. They also did not report on yellow skin that needs light care.

Side-lying pose (lateral postures):
- We do not know if lying on your side lowers the chance of a C-section. The trials suggest little to no change.
- We do not know if it lowers the chance of a birth with tools. The trials suggest little to no change.
- We do not know if side-lying changes how happy moms felt with care. The trials suggest little to no change.
- We are not sure if side-lying changes bad tears or heavy bleeding after birth.
- For the baby, we are not sure about health right after birth. We are also not sure about the need for care in the special baby unit. In one trial, no baby deaths were seen.
- Some baby outcomes were not studied. These include brain injury and yellow skin that needs light care.

What this means for you:
- Based on eight trials, these poses may not change major outcomes. This includes C-section, use of tools, or key newborn health checks.
- The proof is weak. Many trials were small or had limits. This means we are not very sure.
- Still, these poses are simple and safe for most. If you find them comfy, you can use them.
- They may help you cope with labor. They may help with back pain. But we cannot say they will help the baby turn.

Why this matters:
- When a baby faces the “wrong way,” labor can be hard. People want safe, low-cost help.
- This review shows we need better trials. We need to test poses for longer. We need to test them earlier in the push phase. We also need to test other poses. These include a half‑prone pose. Or lying on the same side as the baby, with or without hips bent more.

Bottom line:
- We do not have strong proof that hands and knees or side‑lying help key outcomes.
- You can still use these poses if they feel good. They do not seem to cause harm in these trials.
- Talk with your care team. Ask what may help you most in labor.","Mothers' positions in labour when baby is lying 'back‐to‐back'
What is the issue? 
Malposition is when the back of the baby's head lies towards the mother's back. As a result, labour and birth can be long and difficult, sometimes resulting in an operative birth (where the baby is delivered by caesarean section or with special tools to help the baby through the birth canal) and more perineal trauma (damage to the pelvic floor). The baby may be more likely to go to a neonatal care unit. Also, women may experience stress or disappointment with the birth experience.  
Why is this important? 
The way a pregnant woman is positioned during labour may help rotate a baby so that the back of the baby's head lies towards the front of the mother's abdomen. This improved position may help the mother and baby have a more normal labour and birth. However, it is not yet known which posture, if any, is effective and when is the best time to use it. 
A systematic review of studies of positions (postures) used by women in labour with a baby in a malposition can provide answers on whether the postures improve birth and other health outcomes for mothers and babies. The summary of this review can be used to update clinical practice guidelines. 
A Cochrane Review in 2007 reported that the use of the 'hands and knees' posture in labour was ineffective for malposition, but it did reduce labouring women's backache. Since then, more trials have been conducted, some using other postures; these need evaluating to see if those postures work. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence (published to 13 July 2021) and identified eight studies  in nine different countries involving 1766 women and their babies. Women in the included studies were either first‐time mothers or mothers who had birthed before. All the women's  pregnancies were at least at 36 weeks.  
The trials compared use of 'hands and knees' posture or 'side‐lying' (lateral) postures (lying on the same side as the baby, lying on the opposite side to the baby, and lying semi‐prone) to other postures (free posture, lying on back, leaning back, lying on the same side as the baby).  
For both the hands and knees posture and side‐lying positions during labour, there may be little or no difference in the numbers of operative births, haemorrhage (profuse bleeding of the mother), severe perineal trauma, and women's satisfaction with their labour and delivery, but there was insufficient evidence to be sure. Many of our outcomes of interest were not reported in the included studies. 
Overall, we have little to no confidence in the evidence, mainly because there were too few women and babies in the studies, and some studies used unclear methods. 
What does this mean? 
Overall, it is uncertain whether hands and knees or side‐lying positions in labour improve the health of mother and baby when a baby is in a malposition. However, if women find the use of hands and knees, side‐lying, or other postures in labour comfortable, there is no reason why they should not choose to use them. 
Further research is needed to enable optimal fetal positioning. In particular, further research is needed on variations in the postures, the impact of longer use of these postures during labour, and on long‐term outcomes for women and their babies.

Governments and health systems are increasingly using mobile devices to communicate with patients and the public. Targeted digital client communication is when the health system transmits information to particular individuals or groups of people, based on their health or demographic status. Common types of targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or take their medicines. Other types include phone calls, interactive voice response, or multimedia messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. 
Objectives
To explore clients' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile devices on topics related to reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, or adolescent health (RMNCAH). 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (OvidSP), Embase (Ovid), World Health Organization Global Health Library, and POPLINE databases for eligible studies from inception to 3‐6 July 2017 dependant on the database (See appendix 2). 
Selection criteria
We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; that explored clients' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile device in the areas of RMNCAH; and were from any setting globally. 
Data collection and analysis
We used maximum variation purposive sampling for data synthesis, employing a three‐step sampling frame. We conducted a framework thematic analysis using the Supporting the Use of Research Evidence (SURE) framework as our starting point. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach. We used a matrix approach to explore whether potential implementation barriers identified in our synthesis had been addressed in the trials included in the related Cochrane Reviews of effectiveness. 
Main results
We included 35 studies, from a wide range of countries on six continents. Nineteen studies were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income settings and sixteen in high‐income settings. Some of the studies explored the views of people who had experienced the interventions, whereas others were hypothetical in nature, asking what people felt they would like from a digital health intervention. The studies covered a range of digital targeted client communication, for example medication or appointment reminders, prenatal health information, support for smoking cessation while pregnant, or general sexual health information. 
Our synthesis showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence). They also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence). 
However, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes. Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence). Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence). Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence). The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence). Language issues as well as skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence). 
Clients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were also concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence). Some clients suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence). 
Clients wanted messages at a time and frequency that was convenient for them (moderate confidence). They had preferences for different delivery channels (e.g. short message service (SMS) or interactive voice response) (moderate confidence). They also had preferences about message content, including new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (moderate confidence). Clients' views about who sent the digital health communication could influence their views of the programme (moderate confidence). 
For an overview of the findings and our confidence in the evidence, please see the 'Summary of qualitative findings' tables. 
Our matrix shows that many of the trials assessing these types of programmes did not try to address the problems we identified, although this may have been a reporting issue. 
Authors' conclusions
Our synthesis identified several factors that can influence the successful implementation of targeted client communication programmes using mobile devices. These include barriers to use that have equity implications. Programme planners should take these factors into account when designing and implementing programmes. Future trial authors also need to actively address these factors and to report their efforts in their trial publications.

What people think about phone health messages for pregnancy, babies, and teens

Rationale
Many clinics now send health tips to people on their phones. They also send visit and pill reminders. This can help with care for sex and family health, pregnancy, birth, babies, and teens. These areas can affect daily life, family plans, and long term health.

But do these messages help people in real life? Do people like them? Do they feel safe and useful? The team wanted to learn what people think and feel about these messages.

The team thought phone messages could help many people. But they also knew that phones can be hard to use for some. Cost, phone access, or low signal can get in the way. This study was needed to see what works well and what does not.

These phone tools aim to give the right message to the right person. Health staff send notes based on a person’s needs or stage of life. For example, a mom gets a text on shots for her baby. Or a teen gets tips on safe sex.

Trial Design
This was a review of many studies from around the world. The team looked for studies where people shared their views and their life use of phone health messages. The studies asked about care for pregnancy, birth, newborn care, child care, and teen health. They also asked about family planning, HIV care, and help to stop smoking in pregnancy.

The team searched large medical data stores up to early July 2017. They found 35 studies from six continents. Nineteen studies were in low and mid income places. Sixteen were in high income places. Some studies asked people who had used the messages. Other studies asked what people would want from such tools.

The studies used open questions to hear people’s views. They looked at text notes, phone calls, and voice tools. They asked what people liked, what felt hard, and what could be better. The review did not track people over time. Each study set its own time frame, which the review did not add up.

People in these studies were women, men, and teens who use care for sex and family life. They also were people who are pregnant, new parents, or care givers of young kids. Some had health needs like HIV care. The review did not give one set age or gender mix across all studies.

Results
People’s views were mixed. Many said the messages helped them feel seen and cared for. They felt less alone. Some shared the tips with friends or family.

People liked clear, useful tips for daily life. They liked reminders for visits and pills. They wanted help that fit their own needs and stage of care. They wanted real life steps, not vague advice.

People wanted choice in how they get messages. Some liked text notes. Others liked a phone call or a voice note. People also wanted to choose the time and how often notes came.

Who sent the message mattered. People trusted notes that came from a clinic, hospital, or a known group. Trust made them more likely to read and use the tips.

But there were real problems too. Some had weak cell signal or no web access. Some had no phone, or lost or broke it. Some could not pay for phone time. Many said the notes should not cost them money.

Some people had low skill in reading or in phone use. Messages in a hard language were not helpful. Clear words in the local language worked best. Short notes with simple steps made sense to most.

Phone access was not the same for all. In some homes, men held the phone. Some women and teens could not use a phone when they wished. This made it hard to get private care tips.

Privacy was a big fear for topics that carry shame. This was true for HIV, birth control, or abortion care. People did not want others to read or hear their health notes. They asked for ways to hide or lock the content.

People gave ideas to keep their info safe. Use neutral words or code words in texts. Let people set a PIN. Let them choose how often, when, and how to get the notes. Let them opt in and opt out at any time.

The authors felt very sure about some problems. These were poor signal, phone loss, and cost. They also felt very sure about the need to keep things private. They felt quite sure about the wish for choice in time, rate, and type of message. They also felt quite sure that support feelings were a key gain.

The team checked if trials tried to fix these known problems. Many trials did not plan for them, or did not report on them. This makes it hard to judge real life use.

What does this mean for patients and planners? Phone health notes can help people feel backed and informed. But one size does not fit all. Cost, access, skills, and safety needs are key. Planners should plan for these from the start.

Programs should:
- Keep messages free for users.
- Use clear, short words in local languages.
- Let people choose text or voice, time, and rate.
- Use neutral words for private topics.
- Add lock or PIN options.
- Make it easy to opt in and out.

Future trials should test these steps and report them. This will help build tools that work for more people. It will also help reach those with less access and less power at home.","What are clients' experiences and perceptions of receiving health information via their mobile phones? 
What is the aim of this synthesis? 
The aim of this Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore clients' views and experiences of being communicated with by the health system through their mobile phone. Our synthesis looked at communication about pregnancy, newborn, and child health, sexual health, and family planning. By synthesis we mean the bringing together and synthesising of results from primary qualitative studies into a larger whole. We collected all relevant studies and included 35 studies in the synthesis. 
This synthesis links to other Cochrane Reviews that assess the effectiveness of this type of targeted digital health communication. 
Key messages 
Many clients like receiving messages from the health services by mobile phone. However, some clients have problems receiving messages due to lack of network access, internet, or phone, or language, reading, or privacy issues. Clients' experiences are also influenced by message timing, frequency, content, and sender. 
What did we study in the synthesis? 
Governments and health systems are starting to use mobile phones to communicate with clients. When the information is targeted at particular people or groups of people, and when the health system decides when and what to communicate, this is called 'digital targeted client communication.' Common types of digital targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or to take their medicines. Other types include phone calls or video messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. 
We looked for studies of clients' views and experiences of targeted communication by mobile phone. We focused on communication with pregnant women and parents of young children, and with adults and teenagers about sexual health and family planning. 
What are the main findings of the synthesis? 
We included 35 studies from around the world. These studies showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence). Others also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence). 
However, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes. Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence). Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence). Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence). The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence). Languages issues as well as clients' skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence). 
Clients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence). Some suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence).

Clients' views about who sent the digital health communication could influence their views of the programme, and many people wanted a sender that they knew and trusted (moderate confidence). 
How up‐to‐date is the synthesis? 
We searched for studies published before July 2017.

Hypoglycaemia is a common occurrence in people with diabetes but can also result from an imbalance in glucose homeostasis in the absence of diabetes. The best enteral route for glucose administration for suspected hypoglycaemia in a first aid situation is unknown. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of first aid glucose administration by any route appropriate for use by first‐aid providers (buccal, sublingual, oral, rectal) for symptomatic hypoglycaemia. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL as well as grey literature (records identified in the WHO ICTRP Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov and the EU Clinical Trials Register) up to July 2018. We searched reference lists of included studies retrieved by the above searches. 
Selection criteria
We included studies involving adults and children with documented or suspected hypoglycaemia as well as healthy volunteers, in which glucose was administered by any enteral route appropriate for use by first‐aid providers. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, extracted data and evaluated trials for overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess the risk of bias in the randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and the 'risk of bias In non‐randomised studies of interventions' (ROBINS‐I) tool, in addition to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions recommendations on cross‐over studies, for the non‐RCTs. We reported continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs. All data on glucose concentrations were converted to mg/dL. We contacted authors of included studies to obtain missing data. 
Main results
From 6394 references, we included four studies evaluating 77 participants, including two RCTs, studying children and adults with hypoglycaemia, respectively, and two non‐RCTs with healthy volunteers. The studies included three different routes of glucose administration (sublingual, buccal and a combination of oral and buccal administration). All studies had a high risk of bias in one or more 'Risk of bias' domain. 
Glucose administration by the sublingual route, in the form of table sugar under the tongue, resulted in a higher blood glucose concentration after 20 minutes compared with the oral route in the very specific setting of children with hypoglycaemia and symptoms of concomitant malaria or respiratory tract infection (MD 17 mg/dL, 95% CI 4.4 to 29.6; P = 0.008; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Resolution of hypoglycaemia at 80 minutes may favour sublingual administration (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.54; P = 0.006; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but no substantial difference could be demonstrated at 20 minutes (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.74; P = 0.16; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A decrease in the time to resolution of hypoglycaemia was found in favour of sublingual administration (MD ‐51.5 min, 95% CI ‐58 to ‐45; P < 0.001; 1 study; 42 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported in either group. No data were available for resolution of symptoms and time to resolution of symptoms, and treatment delay. 
Glucose administered by the buccal route in one study resulted in a lower plasma glucose concentration after 20 minutes compared with oral administration (MD ‐14.4 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐17.5 to ‐11.4 for an imputed within‐participants correlation coefficient of 0.9; P < 0.001; 1 trial; 16 participants; very low‐quality evidence). In another study there were fewer participants with increased blood glucose at 20 minutes favouring oral glucose (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.98; P = 0.05; 1 study; 7 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No data were available for resolution of symptoms and time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia and time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. 
For the combined oral and buccal mucosal route (in the form of a dextrose gel) the MD was ‐15.3 mg/dL, 95%CI ‐33.6 to 3; P = 0.09; 1 study; 18 participants; very low‐quality evidence . No improvement was identified for either route in the resolution of symptoms at 20 minutes or less following glucose administration (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.14; P = 0.08; 1 study; 18 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No data were available for time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia and time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. 
Authors' conclusions
When providing first aid to individuals with hypoglycaemia, oral glucose administration results in a higher blood glucose concentrations after 20 minutes when compared with buccal administration of glucose. A difference in plasma glucose concentration could not be demonstrated, when administering a dextrose gel, defined as “a combined oral and buccal mucosal route” compared to oral administration of a glucose tablet or solution. In the specific population of children with concomitant malaria and respiratory illness, sublingual sugar results in a higher blood glucose concentration after 20 minutes when compared with oral administration.These results need to be interpreted cautiously because our confidence in the body of evidence is very low due to the low number of participants and studies as well as methodological deficiencies in the included studies.

Best first aid way to give sugar for low blood sugar

Rationale
Low blood sugar can happen to people with diabetes and others. It can make you feel shaky, sweaty, weak, or confused. If it gets worse, you may pass out. Fast sugar can help you feel better.

Helpers can give sugar in more than one way. You can swallow it as a drink or a tablet. You can place it under the tongue or inside the cheek. It is not clear which way works best in first aid.

Some people with low blood sugar cannot swallow well. Illness can also make swallowing hard. In these cases, sugar under the tongue or in the cheek may help. We need to know if these ways work.

This study set out to compare these ways to give sugar. The big question was which way works fast and is safe. The hope was to guide first aid steps. Better steps can prevent harm from low blood sugar.

Trial Design
This was a review of earlier studies, not one new test. The team searched many medical sources. They looked for studies up to July of 2018. They also checked the lists of papers in those studies.

They looked for people with low blood sugar. This included adults and children. Some healthy people took part in other tests. All the sugar was given in ways a helper could use.

The studies used three main ways to give sugar. Under the tongue. Inside the cheek. Swallowed as a drink, tablet, or a gel in the mouth.

They found four small studies in all. Together, they had 77 people. Two were formal trials. Two were other kinds of small studies.

The studies watched people for short periods of time. Most checked blood sugar at 20 minutes. One also checked at 80 minutes. Some looked at how fast people felt better.

The sex of the people was not stated. Ages ranged from children to adults. One study had children who also had malaria or a lung infection. That group was a special case.

Results
Sugar under the tongue helped some children. These children had low blood sugar. They also had malaria or a breathing illness. Their blood sugar was higher at 20 minutes.

More of these children were no longer low at 80 minutes. They also got better faster. No bad effects were seen in that study. But it was one small study.

We are not very sure of these results. The study had few children. It also had design limits. So the proof is weak.

Sugar inside the cheek did not work as well as swallowing. Blood sugar was lower at 20 minutes with cheek sugar. This came from two small studies. We do not know about side effects in those studies.

A sugar gel in the mouth showed no clear gain. It was no better than a sugar drink or a tablet. There was no clear change in symptoms at 20 minutes. This came from one small study.

No study tested sugar given in the back passage. So we do not know if that helps. We also lacked some key measures. For example, we could not compare how fast help could start.

What do these results mean right now? If a person can swallow, a drink or tablet seems to work well. Sugar inside the cheek seems to help less than swallowing. A sugar gel seems about the same as a drink or tablet.

Sugar under the tongue may help if a child cannot swallow. This may be true for children with malaria or a lung illness. But we need more and better tests. So we must be careful with that choice.

All the studies were very small. Many had limits in how they were done. This makes us less sure of the results. Larger, better studies are needed.

This review still helps the field. It points to what may work best for first aid now. It also shows where we lack good proof. This can guide both care and future tests.

In short, here is what we know. Swallowed sugar helped more than sugar in the cheek. Sugar gel in the mouth did not beat a drink or tablet. Sugar under the tongue may help some sick children, but we are not sure.

The team’s main conclusion is cautious. For first aid, swallowed sugar seems a good choice when safe. Under tongue sugar may help some children who cannot swallow. But better and larger studies are needed to be sure.","First aid glucose administration routes for symptomatic hypoglycaemia
Review question 
We examined the effects of various routes of glucose administration as a first‐aid treatment in people with suspected or symptomatic hypoglycaemia. 
Background 
Hypoglycaemia, or having low blood sugar levels, is a common occurrence in people with diabetes but may also occur in other persons due to an imbalance in blood sugar regulation. Symptoms of mild or moderate hypoglycaemia are for example, shakiness, dizziness, sweating or nervousness, First aid for this condition is usually self‐administered but is often provided by family or friends, and glucose tablets compared with dietary forms of sugar such as juice, candies or dried fruit strips have shown to result in a better resolution of symptoms. Glucose can be given orally (swallowed), but also inside the cheek against the buccal mucosa (‘buccal administration’), under the tongue (‘sublingual administration’) or via the rectal route. In the latter three ways of treatment, the glucose is not being swallowed as with the oral route. 
Study characteristics 
We identified four studies. One randomised study (clinical trials where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) compared sublingual glucose administration, in the form of table sugar, with an oral administration in 42 hypoglycaemic children between one and 15 years old. Two non‐randomised studies compared buccal glucose administration with oral administration in 23 adult healthy fasting volunteers. One randomised study compared a dextrose gel with oral administration of glucose in 18 people with type 1 diabetes and hypoglycaemia. 
Key results 
Providing sugar under the tongue (sublingual) resulted in a greater rise in blood glucose after 20 minutes than giving the sugar orally, but this was in a specific setting including children with hypoglycaemia and symptoms of concomitant malaria or respiratory tract infection. On the other hand, giving glucose by the buccal mucosa route resulted in a lower plasma glucose concentration than with the oral route. For dextrose gel (where uptake of the glucose occurs through a combination of oral swallowing and via the buccal mucosa), no clear benefit was shown compared to oral glucose administration (glucose tablets or glucose solutions). Most studies did not report on time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia as defined by blood glucose levels above a certain threshold, time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The evidence is of very low certainty due to limitations in study design, few studies and small number of participants in the studies, and because half of the studies were performed with healthy volunteers rather than in people with characteristic hypoglycaemia.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for long‐term antibiotic treatments for people with cystic fibrosis who are infected with Burkholderia cepacia complex (bacteria composed of at least 20 different species). 
Background 
People with cystic fibrosis often suffer from repeated chest infections and eventually their lungs become permanently infected by bacteria, such as a family of bacteria called Burkholderia cepacia complex which can cause problems because many antibiotics do not work against them and they can cause a quicker deterioration in lung disease. We wanted to discover whether using long‐term antibiotic treatment was beneficial for people with cystic fibrosis and Burkholderia cepacia complex infection. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 12 April 2021.
Study characteristics 
This review included one study of 100 people aged between 6 and 57 years old. The study compared an inhaled antibiotic called aztreonam to placebo (a substance which contains no medication) and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly (by chance). The study lasted 52 weeks. 
Key results 
The only study included in this review found inhaled aztreonam had no beneficial effect on lung function or rates of chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis and Burkholderia cepacia complex infection. There was no difference between groups in relation to the average time to the next exacerbation or the number of people hospitalised for an exacerbation. Overall adverse events were similar between groups and with regards to other outcomes assessed, there was no difference between treatment groups for mortality, quality of life or sputum density. More research is needed to establish if other inhaled antibiotics may be useful. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall quality of evidence was considered to be moderate across all outcomes, which means further research is likely to have an important impact on results.

Do inhaled antibiotics help people with cystic fibrosis and B. cepacia?

Rationale
Cystic fibrosis is a life‑long lung and gut disease. It makes mucus thick and sticky. Thick mucus clogs the airways and traps germs. This can lead to cough, chest bugs, and lung damage.

One hard‑to‑treat germ group is Burkholderia cepacia complex. We call it B. cepacia. It includes many related germs. Many common antibiotics do not work on these germs.

People with these germs can get sick faster. They may have more chest flare‑ups. Doctors want better ways to treat these germs. They also want to slow lung damage.

Breathing in an antibiotic sends the drug right to the lungs. This may help control the germs there. Aztreonam is one such inhaled antibiotic. This review asked if long‑term use helps.

Trial Design
This was a review of the research. The review looked at studies up to April 12, 2021. It found one clinical trial to include. That trial tested aztreonam that people breathed in.

The trial had 100 people with cystic fibrosis. All had B. cepacia germs in their lungs. People were 6 to 57 years old. They took part for one year.

People got one of two treatments. They got aztreonam to breathe in. Or they got a placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but has no medicine.

A computer chose each person’s group by chance. No one picked their own group. This is the best way to compare groups. It helps make fair results.

Results
The trial found no clear benefit from aztreonam. It did not help lungs work better. It did not cut the number of chest flare‑ups. It did not change how soon the next flare‑up came.

Hospital stays were about the same in both groups. Side effects were also about the same. The number of people who died was the same. Day‑to‑day well‑being did not improve with aztreonam.

The amount of germs in mucus did not change. This means the drug did not lower B. cepacia in spit. Lung tests did not improve. People did not feel better overall.

These results are for one year of use. They tell us about this one drug only. They do not tell us about all inhaled antibiotics. Other drugs might act in a different way.

The review judged the evidence as moderate in quality. This means the results are fairly sound. But new studies could still change what we think. So, we need more good trials.

What does this mean for people with cystic fibrosis? Breathing in aztreonam long‑term did not help in this trial. It did not boost lung health or reduce flare‑ups. It did not improve how people felt or lived.

This is still useful news. It guides doctors away from a drug that may not help here. It also shows where to focus new work. We need to test other inhaled drugs for these germs.

Future trials should include more people. They should last long enough to show clear change. They should look at lung health, flare‑ups, and life impact. They should also track side effects with care.

For now, care should follow proven steps. That includes regular airway care and check‑ups. It also means fast care for chest flare‑ups. Your care team can guide the best plan for you.

In short, this review asked a clear question. Can inhaled aztreonam help people with cystic fibrosis and B. cepacia? The best study we have says no. More research should test other inhaled drugs.","Antibiotic treatments for long‐term Burkholderia cepacia infections in people with cystic fibrosis

10.1002-14651858.CD013194,"Background
Melanoma has one of the fastest rising incidence rates of any cancer. It accounts for a small percentage of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. History‐taking and visual inspection of a suspicious lesion by a clinician is usually the first in a series of ‘tests’ to diagnose skin cancer. Establishing the accuracy of visual inspection alone is critical to understating the potential contribution of additional tests to assist in the diagnosis of melanoma. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection for the detection of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in adults with limited prior testing and in those referred for further evaluation of a suspicious lesion. Studies were separated according to whether the diagnosis was recorded face‐to‐face (in‐person) or based on remote (image‐based) assessment. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: CENTRAL; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated visual inspection in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma, compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow‐up. We excluded studies reporting data for ‘clinical diagnosis’ where dermoscopy may or may not have been used. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities per algorithm and threshold using the bivariate hierarchical model. We investigated the impact of: in‐person test interpretation; use of a purposely developed algorithm to assist diagnosis; and observer expertise. 
Main results
We included 49 publications reporting on a total of 51 study cohorts with 34,351 lesions (including 2499 cases), providing 134 datasets for visual inspection. Across almost all study quality domains, the majority of study reports provided insufficient information to allow us to judge the risk of bias, while in three of four domains that we assessed we scored concerns regarding applicability of study findings as 'high'. Selective participant recruitment, lack of detail regarding the threshold for deciding on a positive test result, and lack of detail on observer expertise were particularly problematic. 
Attempts to analyse studies by degree of prior testing were hampered by a lack of relevant information and by the restricted inclusion of lesions selected for biopsy or excision. Accuracy was generally much higher for in‐person diagnosis compared to image‐based evaluations (relative diagnostic odds ratio of 8.54, 95% CI 2.89 to 25.3, P < 0.001). Meta‐analysis of in‐person evaluations that could be clearly placed on the clinical pathway showed a general trade‐off between sensitivity and specificity, with the highest sensitivity (92.4%, 95% CI 26.2% to 99.8%) and lowest specificity (79.7%, 95% CI 73.7% to 84.7%) observed in participants with limited prior testing (n = 3 datasets). Summary sensitivities were lower for those referred for specialist assessment but with much higher specificities (e.g. sensitivity 76.7%, 95% CI 61.7% to 87.1%) and specificity 95.7%, 95% CI 89.7% to 98.3%) for lesions selected for excision, n = 8 datasets). These differences may be related to differences in the spectrum of included lesions, differences in the definition of a positive test result, or to variations in observer expertise. We did not find clear evidence that accuracy is improved by the use of any algorithm to assist diagnosis in all settings. Attempts to examine the effect of observer expertise in melanoma diagnosis were hindered due to poor reporting. 
Authors' conclusions
Visual inspection is a fundamental component of the assessment of a suspicious skin lesion; however, the evidence suggests that melanomas will be missed if visual inspection is used on its own. The evidence to support its accuracy in the range of settings in which it is used is flawed and very poorly reported. Although published algorithms do not appear to improve accuracy, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the ‘no algorithm’ approach should be preferred in all settings. Despite the volume of research evaluating visual inspection, further prospective evaluation of the potential added value of using established algorithms according to the prior testing or diagnostic difficulty of lesions may be warranted.

How well can a simple eye check find melanoma?

Rationale
Melanoma is a kind of skin cancer. It causes most deaths from skin cancer. More people get melanoma each year. This makes it a big health burden.

Doctors often start with a look at the skin spot. This first step is a “visual check.” The doctor asks about your history and looks at the spot. The goal is to decide if more tests are needed.

We need to know how well this eye check works by itself. If we know its limits, we can judge if other tests add value. These can include a skin sample test, also called a biopsy. A biopsy looks at the spot under a microscope.

This study asked a clear question. How good is a doctor’s eye check at finding melanoma? It also asked how good it is at finding related early cell changes. The team looked at checks done in person and by photo.

Trial Design
This was a review of past research, not a new trial. The team searched many medical databases. They looked at studies up to August 2016. They also checked lists of papers to find more work.

The team included studies of adults with skin spots that looked like melanoma. In these studies, a doctor did a visual check. There were no special tools like a dermoscope. The doctor then chose next steps, like biopsy or follow up.

The team only used studies that compared the eye check to a trusted standard. The standard was lab study of a removed spot, or close follow up. The team grouped studies by how the check took place. One group was in person. The other group used photos sent for review.

The team also looked at who did the check. They wanted to see if training or tools changed results. They used a standard way to judge study quality. They checked for things that can tilt results.

This review did not enroll new patients. So there was no set time you would be in a study. It sums up what past studies found. It does not test a drug or treatment.

Results
The review found 49 papers. These papers reported 51 study groups. They covered 34,351 skin spots. Of these, 2,499 were melanoma or related early cell changes.

Many reports left out key details. In many, we do not know how spots were picked. We often do not know the exact rules used to call a spot “positive.” We also often do not know how much training the checker had.

These gaps can affect trust in the results. They can make a test look better or worse than it is. So, we must be careful with what we conclude. Still, some clear trends stood out.

In-person checks worked better than photo checks. Overall, in-person checks were about eight times more accurate than photo checks. This means seeing the spot live helps a lot. A photo review is more likely to get it wrong.

There was also a trade-off. When doctors tried hard to not miss cancer, they called more harmless spots “possible cancer.” When they tried to avoid false alarms, they missed more cancers. This balance shifted with the setting and the people seen.

For people seen early, with little prior testing, doctors caught more real melanomas. But they also had more false alarms. This means more people had a biopsy that showed no cancer. For people sent to a skin specialist, the pattern changed. Doctors missed more melanomas, but they had fewer false alarms.

These shifts may have several causes. The spots seen in each setting can be different. The rules used to call a spot “positive” may differ. The checker’s training can also play a role.

Some studies used set rules or checklists to guide the eye check. These are sometimes called algorithms. The review found no clear proof that these rules always help. In some places they might help. In others, they might not change much.

The key message is simple. A visual check is a key first step. But it will miss some melanomas if used alone. Some melanomas look like common, harmless spots. So, a second test often matters.

This review helps show where the eye check works best. It also shows where it falls short. It supports smart next steps when a spot looks suspect. These can include a biopsy or close follow up.

The authors call for better future studies. New work should plan ahead and report key details. It should test if checklists help in hard cases. It should also link test steps to where you are on your care path.

What does this mean for you? If a spot worries you, see a doctor. An in-person check is best. If the spot still looks odd, ask what next test is right for you. A look alone may not be enough.","How accurate is visual inspection of skin lesions with the naked eye for diagnosis of melanoma in adults? 
What is the aim of the review? 
Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate checking suspicious skin lesions (lumps, bumps, wounds, scratches or grazes) with the naked eye (visual inspection) can be to diagnose melanoma (diagnostic accuracy). The Review also investigated whether diagnostic accuracy was different depending on whether the clinician was face to face with the patient (in‐person visual inspection), or looked at an image of the lesion (image‐based visual inspection). Cochrane researchers included 19 studies to answer this question. 
Why is it important to know the diagnostic accuracy of visual examination of skin lesions suspected to be melanomas? 
Not recognising a melanoma when it is present (a false‐negative test result) delays surgery to remove it (excision), risking cancer spreading to other organs in the body and possibly death. Diagnosing a skin lesion (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) as a melanoma when it is not (a false‐positive result) may result in unnecessary surgery, further investigations, and patient anxiety. Visual inspection of suspicious skin lesions by a clinician using the naked eye is usually the first of a series of ‘tests’ to diagnose melanoma. Knowing the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection alone is important to decide whether additional tests, such as a biopsy (removing a part of the lesion for examination under a microscope) are needed to improve accuracy to an acceptable level. 
What did the review study? 
Researchers wanted to find out the diagnostic accuracy of in‐person compared with image‐based visual inspection of suspicious skin lesions. Researchers also wanted to find out whether diagnostic accuracy was improved if doctors used a 'visual inspection checklist' or depending on how experienced in visual inspection they were (level of clinical expertise). They considered the diagnostic accuracy of the first visual inspection of a lesion, for example, by a general practitioner (GP), and of lesions that had been referred for further evaluation, for example, by a dermatologist (doctor specialising in skin problems). 
What are the main results of the review? 
Only 19 studies (17 in‐person studies and 2 image‐based studies) were clear whether the test was the first visual inspection of a lesion or was a visual inspection following referral (for example, when patients are referred by a GP to skin specialists for visual inspection). 
First in‐person visual inspection (3 studies) 
The results of three studies of 1339 suspicious skin lesions suggest that in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 90 (9%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ An estimated 268 will have a visual inspection result indicating melanoma is present. Of these, 185 will not be melanoma and will result in an unnecessary biopsy (false‐positive results). 
‐ An estimated 732 will have a visual inspection result indicating that melanoma is not present. Of these, seven will actually have melanoma and would not be sent for biopsy (false‐negative results). 
Two further studies restricted to 4228 suspicious skin lesions that were all selected to be excised found similar results. 
In‐person visual inspection after referral, all lesions selected to be excised (8 studies) 
The results of eight studies of 5331 suspicious skin lesions suggest that in a group of 1000 lesions, of which 90 (9%) actually are melanoma: 
‐ An estimated 108 will have a visual inspection result indicating melanoma is present, and of these, 39 will not be melanoma and will result in an unnecessary biopsy (false‐positive results). 
‐ Of the 892 lesions with a visual inspection result indicating that melanoma is not present, 21 will actually be melanoma and would not be sent for biopsy (false‐negative results). 
Overall, the number of false‐positive results (diagnosing a skin lesion as a melanoma when it is not) was observed to be higher and the number of false‐negative results (not recognising a melanoma when it is present) lower for first visual inspections of suspicious skin lesions compared to visual inspection following referral. 
Visual inspection of images of suspicious skin lesions (2 studies) 
Accuracy was much lower for visual inspection of images of lesions compared to visual inspection in person. 
Value of visual inspection checklists 
There was no evidence that use of a visual inspection checklist or the level of clinical expertise changed diagnostic accuracy. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The majority of included studies diagnosed melanoma by lesion biopsy and confirmed that melanoma was not present by biopsy or by follow‐up over time to make sure the skin lesion remained negative for melanoma. In these studies, biopsy, clinical follow‐up, or specialist clinician diagnosis were the reference standards (means of establishing final diagnoses). Biopsy or follow‐up are likely to have been reliable methods for deciding whether patients really had melanoma. In a few studies, experts diagnosed the absence of melanoma (expert diagnosis), which is less likely to have been a reliable method for deciding whether patients really had melanoma. There was lots of variation in the results of the studies in this review and the studies did not always describe fully the methods they used, which made it difficult to assess their reliability. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Thirteen studies were undertaken in Europe (68%), with the remainder undertaken in Asia (n = 1), Oceania (n = 4), and North America (n = 1). Mean age ranged from 30 to 73.6 years (reported in 10 studies). The percentage of individuals with melanoma ranged between 4% and 20% in first visualised lesions and between 1% and 50% in studies of referred lesions. In the majority of studies, the lesions were unlikely to be representative of the range of those seen in practice, for example, only including skin lesions of a certain size or with a specific appearance. In addition, variation in the expertise of clinicians performing visual inspection and in the definition used to decide whether or not melanoma was present across studies makes it unclear as to how visual inspection should be carried out and by whom in order to achieve the accuracy observed in studies. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Error rates from visual inspection are too high for it to be relied upon alone. Although not evaluated in this review, other technologies need to be used to ensure accurate diagnosis of skin cancer. There is considerable variation and uncertainty about the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection alone for the diagnosis of melanoma. There is no evidence to suggest that visual inspection checklists reliably improve the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection, so recommendations cannot be made about when they should be used. Despite the existence of numerous research studies, further, well‐reported studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of visual inspection with and without visual inspection checklists and by clinicians with different levels of expertise are needed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.

10.1002-14651858.CD014257.pub2,"Background
Functional constipation is defined as chronic constipation with no identifiable underlying cause. It is a significant cause of morbidity in children, accounting for up to 25% of visits to paediatric gastroenterologists. Probiotic preparations may sufficiently alter the gut microbiome and promote normal gut physiology in a way that helps relieve functional constipation. Several studies have sought to address this hypothesis, as well as the role of probiotics in other functional gut disorders. Therefore, it is important to have a focused review to assess the evidence to date. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the management of chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children. 
Search methods
On 28 June 2021, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, WHO ICTR, and ClinicalTrials.gov, with no language, date, publication status, or document type limitations. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed probiotic preparations (including synbiotics) compared to placebo, no treatment or any other interventional preparation in people aged between 0 and 18 years old with a diagnosis of functional constipation according to consensus criteria (such as Rome IV). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 14 studies (1127 randomised participants): 12 studies assessed probiotics in the treatment of functional constipation, whilst two studies investigated synbiotic preparations. 
Three studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to the frequency of defecation at study end, but we did not pool them as there was very significant unexplained heterogeneity. Four studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to treatment success. There may be no difference in global improvement/treatment success (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.26; 313 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Five studies compared probiotics to placebo in relation to withdrawals due to adverse events, with the pooled effect suggesting there may be no difference (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.95; 357 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
The pooled estimate from three studies that compared probiotics plus an osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone found there may be no difference in frequency of defecation (MD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.57 to 0.56; 268 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Two studies compared probiotics plus an osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone in relation to global improvement/treatment success, and found there may be no difference between the treatments (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.15; 139 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Three studies compared probiotics plus osmotic laxative to osmotic laxative alone in relation to withdrawals due to adverse events, but it is unclear if there is a difference between them (RR 2.86, 95% CI 0.12 to 68.35; 268 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Two studies compared probiotics versus magnesium oxide. It is unclear if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD 0.28, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 1.14; 36 participants), treatment success (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.57; 36 participants) or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.04; 77 participants). The certainty of the evidence is very low for these outcomes. 
One study assessed the role of a synbiotic preparation in comparison to placebo. There may be higher treatment success in favour of synbiotics compared to placebo (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.47; 155 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. 
One study assessed a synbiotic plus paraffin compared to paraffin alone. It is uncertain if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD 0.74, 95% CI ‐0.96, 2.44; 66 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), or treatment success (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.17; 66 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. 
One study compared a synbiotic preparation to paraffin. It is uncertain if there is a difference in frequency of defecation (MD ‐1.53, 95% CI ‐3.00, ‐0.06; 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or in treatment success (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.65, 1.13; 60 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study reported that there were no withdrawals due to adverse effects in either group. 
All secondary outcomes were either not reported or reported in a way that did not allow for analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether probiotics are efficacious in successfully treating chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children or changing the frequency of defecation, or whether there is a difference in withdrawals due to adverse events when compared with placebo. There is limited evidence from one study to suggest a synbiotic preparation may be more likely than placebo to lead to treatment success, with no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. 
There is insufficient evidence to draw efficacy or safety conclusions about the use of probiotics in combination with or in comparison to any of the other interventions reported. The majority of the studies that presented data on serious adverse events reported that no events occurred. Two studies did not report this outcome. 
Future studies are needed to confirm efficacy, but the research community requires guidance on the best context for probiotics in such studies, considering where they should be best considered in a potential treatment hierarchy and should align with core outcome sets to support future interpretation of findings.

Do probiotics help children with long‑term constipation?

Rationale
Constipation means hard, rare, or painful poop. Some kids have this for a long time. Doctors call it “functional constipation” when no clear cause is found.

This problem can hurt daily life. Kids may have belly pain. They may feel stress and shame. Many see gut doctors for help.

Probiotics are live “good” germs. You can find them in some foods and pills. They may help the gut work well. Synbiotics mix probiotics with a food for the germs. This food is a type of fiber.

Past small studies have mixed results. Some show help. Some do not. We need to look at all the proof. The goal is to learn if these products help kids poop more and feel better. We also want to know if they are safe.

Trial Design
This is a review of many trials. Trials are studies where people get one of two options by chance. This is the best way to test what works.

The team searched many big medical lists on June 28, 2021. They did not limit by date, language, or type. They used strict rules to pick good trials.

They included kids from birth to age 18. All had long‑term constipation with no clear cause. Doctors used set rules, like the Rome rules, to make the diagnosis.

The review found 14 trials with 1127 children. Twelve trials tested probiotics. Two trials tested synbiotics.

The trials compared:
- Probiotics versus a fake pill, called placebo.
- Probiotics plus a laxative versus the laxative alone. An osmotic laxative draws water into poop.
- Probiotics versus magnesium oxide.
- A synbiotic versus placebo.
- A synbiotic plus paraffin versus paraffin alone.
- A synbiotic versus paraffin.

The main things the trials looked at were:
- How often the child had a bowel move.
- Whether the child got better over all.
- If side effects made people stop the study.

Some other outcomes were not shared, or not in a way they could use. This abstract did not report how long the kids stayed in the trials.

Results
What did the review find? In short, proof is not strong that probiotics help. A few results hint that a synbiotic may help. But we need more and better trials.

Probiotics versus placebo:
- Three trials looked at how often kids pooped at the end. The results did not match each other. The team could not combine them.
- Four trials looked at whether kids got better over all. These trials suggest no clear gain with probiotics.
- Five trials looked at side effects that made kids stop. These suggest no clear difference in safety.

Probiotics plus an osmotic laxative versus the laxative alone:
- Three trials looked at how often kids pooped. There was no clear difference.
- Two trials looked at whether kids got better over all. There was no clear difference.
- Three trials looked at side effects that made kids stop. It is not clear if there was a difference.

Probiotics versus magnesium oxide:
- Two trials looked at poop count, getting better, and side effects. None showed a clear difference. The proof here is very weak.

Synbiotics:
- One trial compared a synbiotic to placebo. More kids on the synbiotic got better. No one in either group stopped due to side effects.
- One trial compared a synbiotic plus paraffin to paraffin alone. There was no clear difference in poop count or getting better. No one stopped due to side effects.
- One trial compared a synbiotic to paraffin. There was no clear difference in getting better. Poop count results were not clear. No one stopped due to side effects.

Safety:
Most trials that shared data said there were no serious bad events. Two trials did not report on this. Based on what was shared, these products seem safe in the short term. But we still need more safety data.

What does this mean for families?
Right now, we do not have strong proof that probiotics help kids with this kind of constipation. Adding a probiotic to a laxative did not show extra help. One synbiotic seemed to help more than a fake pill in one trial. But other synbiotic trials did not confirm this.

So, probiotics may not help many kids with this problem. Synbiotics may help some, but we need more proof. If you plan to try them, talk with your child’s doctor first. Do not stop other care unless your doctor says so.

Why this work matters:
Constipation in kids is common and hard on families. We need clear, strong trials on this topic. Future trials should use the same main goals. For example, how often kids poop, if pain gets better, and safety. Trials should also show where probiotics fit in the care plan.

In sum:
- Fourteen trials tested probiotics or synbiotics in 1127 kids.
- Probiotics did not show clear help versus placebo.
- Probiotics plus a laxative did not add clear help.
- Probiotics versus magnesium oxide showed no clear winner.
- One synbiotic trial beat placebo. Other synbiotic trials were not clear.
- Most trials saw no serious bad events.
- We need more and better trials to know for sure.

Talk to your child’s doctor about the best care plan. They can help you weigh choices for your child.","Probiotics for treatment of chronic constipation in children
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether probiotics can be used to treat chronic constipation without a physical explanation in children (aged 0 to 18 years). 
We analysed data from 14 studies to answer this question.
Key messages 
We were unable to draw conclusions when comparing probiotics to placebo for frequency of defecation in children treated for chronic constipation without a physical explanation. There may be no difference in treatment success between the two groups. 
There may not be a difference in frequency of defecation or treatment success when comparing probiotics and laxatives to using laxatives alone. 
We were unable to draw conclusions when comparing probiotics to magnesium oxide for frequency of defecation or treatment success. 
There may be a higher frequency of defecation in children treated with synbiotic preparations compared to placebo. 
There may not be a difference in participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse events when comparing probiotic preparations to placebo. 
We were unable to draw conclusions on the safety of any of the other comparisons due to the low number of people who withdrew from the studies. 
What was studied in the review? 
Children often suffer from constipation for long periods of time, and when there is no underlying physical cause that can be found we call it 'functional constipation'. 
It has been suggested that probiotic and synbiotic preparations might help improve symptoms in these children. Probiotics are preparations that contain living bacteria that have been proposed to be beneficial to the digestive system. Synbiotics also include food substances that support the growth of these bacteria. 
There is currently no consensus about whether this is the case, or how these preparations are best used. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) comparing any probiotic or synbiotic treatment with any other treatment (such as dummy/placebo treatments) in children with chronic constipation without a physical explanation. We found 14 trials including a total of 1127 participants who were aged under 18. We made the following conclusions.• There may be no difference in treatment success when comparing probiotics to placebo.• We were unable to draw conclusions on whether there is a difference in the frequency of defecation.• There may be no difference in treatment success when comparing probiotics and laxatives to laxatives alone.• We were unable to draw conclusions on frequency of defecation or treatment success when comparing probiotics to magnesium oxide.• Synbiotics may be better than placebo in improving the frequency of defection.• There may be no difference in how many people withdrew from the trials because of side effects when comparing probiotics to placebo, or probiotics and laxative to laxative alone.• We have limited confidence in the evidence because the studies only included a small number of children, and due to lack of detail on some of the methods used. 
All analyses were limited due to differences in the specific probiotics or the treatments they were compared with, low numbers of children included in the studies and, most importantly, the use of a range of different measures of success. This meant that combining studies was difficult, so the overall ability of this review to answer its core questions was limited. 
What next? 
Future studies are needed to find out how helpful probiotics are for childhood constipation. Researchers need to agree whether probiotics should be a first option therapy, an add‐on to other therapies, a second option after other therapies have failed, or a combination of all the above. 
Future research should measure the same items (known as a core outcome set) to ensure these results can support future reviews. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review is current to June 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013228,"Background
The use of short‐acting insulin analogues (insulin lispro, insulin aspart, insulin glulisine) for adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes is still controversial, as reflected in many scientific debates. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of short‐acting insulin analogues compared to regular human insulin in adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Search methods
For this update we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the WHO ICTRP Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov to 31 October 2018. We placed no restrictions on the language of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials with an intervention duration of at least 24 weeks that compared short‐acting insulin analogues to regular human insulin in the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes, who were not pregnant. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We assessed dichotomous outcomes by risk ratios (RR), and Peto odds ratios (POR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed continuous outcomes by mean differences (MD) with 95% CI. We assessed trials for certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified 10 trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, randomising 2751 participants; 1388 participants were randomised to receive insulin analogues and 1363 participants to receive regular human insulin. The duration of the intervention ranged from 24 to 104 weeks, with a mean of about 41 weeks. The trial populations showed diversity in disease duration, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. None of the trials were blinded, so the risk of performance bias and detection bias, especially for subjective outcomes, such as hypoglycaemia, was high in nine of 10 trials from which we extracted data. Several trials showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods and results. 
None of the included trials defined all‐cause mortality as a primary outcome. Six trials provided Information on the number of participants who died during the trial, with five deaths out of 1272 participants (0.4%) in the insulin analogue groups and three deaths out of 1247 participants (0.2%) in the regular human insulin groups (Peto OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.41 to 6.64; P = 0.48; moderate‐certainty evidence). Six trials, with 2509 participants, assessed severe hypoglycaemia differently, therefore, we could not summarise the results with a meta‐analysis. Overall, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events was low, and none of the trials showed a clear difference between the two intervention arms (low‐certainty evidence). 
The MD in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) change was ‐0.03% (95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.09; P = 0.60; 9 trials, 2608 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction ranged between ‐0.31% and 0.25%. The MD in the overall number of non‐severe hypoglycaemic episodes per participant per month was 0.08 events (95% CI 0.00 to 0.16; P = 0.05; 7 trials, 2667 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between ‐0.03 and 0.19 events per participant per month. The results provided for nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes were of questionable validity. Overall, there was no clear difference between the two short‐acting insulin analogues and regular human insulin. Two trials assessed health‐related quality of life and treatment satisfaction, but we considered the results for both outcomes to be unreliable (very low‐certainty evidence). 
No trial was designed to investigate possible long term effects (all‐cause mortality, microvascular or macrovascular complications of diabetes), especially in participants with diabetes‐related complications. No trial reported on socioeconomic effects. 
Authors' conclusions
Our analysis found no clear benefits of short‐acting insulin analogues over regular human insulin in people with type 2 diabetes. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was poor and results on patient‐relevant outcomes, like all‐cause mortality, microvascular or macrovascular complications and severe hypoglycaemic episodes were sparse. Long‐term efficacy and safety data are needed to draw conclusions about the effects of short‐acting insulin analogues on patient‐relevant outcomes.

Fast meal insulin versus regular insulin for adults with type 2 diabetes

Rationale
Type 2 diabetes means the body cannot use insulin well. Blood sugar stays high. Over time, high sugar can harm the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and brain.

Insulin can lower blood sugar. Some people take a short‑acting insulin at meal time. There are fast‑acting “insulin analogues.” These include lispro, aspart, and glulisine. There is also “regular human insulin,” which is an older short‑acting insulin.

Fast‑acting insulin analogues start to work sooner. They may better match a meal. Some experts think this could help lower sugar after meals. But many people still ask if they work better or are safer than regular insulin.

This study asked a simple question. For adults with type 2 diabetes, do fast‑acting insulin analogues work better or more safely than regular insulin? The goal was to guide care with real data.

Trial Design
This report is a review of past trials. It looked at 10 randomized trials. “Randomized” means people were put into a group by chance.

All people were adults with type 2 diabetes. No one was pregnant. One group used a fast‑acting insulin analogue at meals. The other group used regular human insulin at meals.

The trials ran from about half a year to two years. The average time was about 41 weeks. In total, 2751 people took part. Of these, 1388 used fast‑acting insulin analogues. The other 1363 used regular insulin.

No trial hid which insulin people took. People and clinic staff knew the type of insulin. This can affect how people report things like low blood sugar. Some trial reports also had gaps in how they shared methods and results.

The trials did not all use the same rules. Details like who could join and how long they had diabetes were not the same across trials. Two trials tried to measure life quality and treatment joy. But those results were not solid.

Results
Death during the trial was rare. Six trials shared death numbers. In the fast‑acting insulin groups, 5 of 1272 people died. In the regular insulin groups, 3 of 1247 people died. These numbers are small. There was no clear difference between the groups.

Severe low blood sugar was also rare. Severe low blood sugar means a person needed help from someone else or needed medical care. Six trials looked at this outcome. But they used different rules. Because of that, the review could not add the results across trials. Looking at each trial on its own, there was no clear difference between the groups.

The A1c blood test was about the same in both groups. A1c shows your average blood sugar over about three months. Across many trials, fast‑acting insulin did not lower A1c more than regular insulin. In plain words, average blood sugar control looked the same.

Non‑severe low blood sugar was also close between the groups. Non‑severe low blood sugar means a person felt low but could self‑treat. The number of these events per person per month was very close in both groups. Any difference was small and not clear.

Some trials tried to count low blood sugar at night. But the way they measured this was not firm. The review could not rely on those night‑time results.

No trial was built to study long‑term health problems. That means we do not know if one insulin type is better for the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, or brain in the long run. No trial looked at how these insulin types affect money costs or time at work.

What do these results mean?
Based on the data we have, fast‑acting insulin analogues did not show clear benefits over regular insulin. They did not lower average blood sugar more. They did not cut severe low blood sugar. Death in the trials was rare and looked the same in both groups.

The proof we have is not very strong. Many trials were short. People and staff knew which insulin they used. Some reports had gaps. Trials did not track long‑term health harms or benefits. Because of this, we still need better and longer studies.

What should patients consider now?
For most adults with type 2 diabetes, both insulin types seem to work about the same. Your choice may come down to your meal plan, your routine, and what you and your care team prefer. Talk with your care team about your goals. Ask about how each insulin fits your day.

If you already use one type and do well, there may be no reason to switch. If you have trouble with your plan, ask if a change could help you. Either way, check your sugar as advised. Keep follow‑up visits. Share any low sugar events with your care team.

Bottom line
In these trials, fast‑acting meal insulin did not beat regular insulin for adults with type 2 diabetes. Average blood sugar control was much the same. Severe low blood sugar was rare in both groups. We still need long‑term data to see if one type helps prevent health problems over time.","Short‐acting insulin analogues versus regular human insulin for type 2 diabetes mellitus
Review question 
Are short‐acting insulin analogues better than regular human insulin for adult, non‐pregnant people with type 2 diabetes? 
Background 
Short‐acting insulin analogues act more quickly than regular human insulin. They can be injected immediately before meals and lead to lower blood sugar levels after food intake. Whether people with diabetes really profit from these newer insulins is debated. 
Study characteristics 
We found 10 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the short‐acting insulin analogues insulin lispro, insulin aspart, or insulin glulisine to regular human insulin in 2751 participants. The people in the included trials were monitored (followed) for 24 to 104 weeks. 
This evidence is up to date as of 31 October 2018.
Key results 
We are uncertain whether short‐acting insulin analogues are better than regular human insulin for long‐term blood glucose control or for reducing the number of times blood sugar levels drop below normal (hypoglycaemic episodes). The studies were too short to reliably investigate death from any cause. We found no clear effect of insulin analogues on health‐related quality of life. We found no information on late diabetes complications, such as problems with the eyes, kidneys, or feet. No study reported on socioeconomic effects, such as costs of the intervention and absence from work. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the included studies was low or very low for most outcomes, mainly because all studies were carried out in an open‐labelled fashion (study participants and study personnel knew who was getting which treatment). Several studies also showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods, and results were imprecise.

10.1002-14651858.CD013678.pub2,"Background
Lamellar macular holes (LMHs) are small, partial‐thickness defects of the macula defined by characteristic features on optical coherence tomography (OCT), including a newly recognised type of epiretinal membrane termed ‘epiretinal proliferation’. There may be a rationale to recommend surgery for individuals with LMHs, particularly those with functional or anatomical deterioration, or poor baseline vision causing significant disability, to stabilise the LMH and prevent further visual deterioration; however, there is currently no evidence‐based consensus. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of surgical interventions on post‐operative visual and anatomical outcomes in people with a confirmed LMH. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Scopus SciVerse, ISRCTN registry, US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We also searched reference lists of included trials to identify other eligible trials which our search strategy may have missed. The date of the search was 20 July 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants with a confirmed LMH diagnosis which reported one or more surgical intervention(s), alone or in combination, in at least one arm of the RCT. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods as expected by Cochrane. Two study authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for included trials. Trial authors were contacted for further information and clarification. 
Main results
A single RCT was eligible for inclusion. Thirty‐six participants were randomised in a 2:1 ratio; 24 were allocated to undergo surgery (pars plana vitrectomy, peeling of the epiretial proliferation followed by fovea‐sparing removal of the internal limiting membrane) and 12 (10 following two participant dropouts) to observation. 
Overall, the certainty of the evidence was low for all outcomes due to selection and detection bias, and the low number of participants enrolled in the study which may affect the accuracy of results and reliability of conclusions. 
At six‐month follow‐up, change in vision was better in the surgery group (‐0.27 logMAR improvement) than observation (0.02 worsening) (mean difference (MD): ‐0.29 logMAR, 95% confidence intervals (CI): ‐0.33 to ‐0.25). Central retinal thickness increased in the surgery group over 6 months 126 μm increase) compared with observation group (decrease by 11μm) (MD: 137 μm, 95% CI: 125.87 μm to 148.13 μm). Finally, at six‐month follow‐up, retinal sensitivity was better in the surgery group (3.03 dB increase) compared with the observation group (0.06 dB decrease) (MD: 3.09 dB, 95% CI: 2.07 to 4.11 dB). 
Vision‐related quality of life and metamorphopsia were not reported. No adverse outcomes or complications were reported in the study, however, authors could not provide information on whether any individuals developed deterioration in vision of 0.2 logMAR or worse. 
Authors' conclusions
The included single trial demonstrated improvements in visual and anatomical outcome measures for participants with a LMH who underwent surgery compared with observation only. Therefore, we can conclude that participants who undergo surgery may achieve superior post‐operative best corrected visual acuity and anatomical outcomes compared with observation only. However, the results of a single and small RCT provides limited evidence to support or refute surgery as an effective management option for LMHs. Future RCTs with a larger number of participants and with fewer methodological limitations and biases are necessary to inform future clinical practice.

Eye surgery for small holes in the center of sight

Rationale
The macula is the center of the retina. It helps you see fine detail. A lamellar macular hole is a small split in this spot. It can cause blur or wavy lines. Reading and other close work can be hard.

Eye scans can show this split. Doctors call the scan an OCT. Some people also grow a thin film on the retina. This film can pull on the macula and make things worse.

Doctors can watch and wait. Or they can do eye surgery. The surgery removes the eye gel and some thin layers on the retina. This may stop pull on the macula. It may help vision. Many patients ask, will surgery help more than waiting?

The aim of this review was clear. The team wanted to test if surgery helps vision and eye structure more than no surgery. The team also looked for side effects. This study is needed. There is no firm guide yet for this problem.

Trial Design
This was a careful review of trials. The team searched many trial lists and papers. They looked for trials of people with a proven lamellar macular hole. They last searched in July 2021.

They found one trial that fit the rules. In that trial, people went into groups by chance. This is like a coin flip. The plan was two to one. For every two people in the surgery group, one person was in the no surgery group.

There were 36 people at the start. Twenty four had surgery. Twelve were set to wait and watch. Two people in the watch group left the trial. So ten people in that group stayed in the study.

The surgery was a common eye surgery for this problem. The doctor took out the eye gel. The doctor also peeled the thin film on the retina. The doctor then removed a very thin inner layer. The doctor left the very center in place to protect it.

The people had eye checks for six months. The team used a standard eye chart test. They also used scans to look at the macula. They used a test of how well the retina senses light.

Results
The surgery group saw better at six months. On a standard eye chart test, they read better lines. The group that did not have surgery did not improve. Their vision was about the same or a little worse.

Eye scans also looked better after surgery. The center of the retina looked more normal. In people who did not have surgery, the scans did not show the same change.

The light sense test also got better with surgery. The retina could pick up light better. In the no surgery group, this test did not improve.

The study did not report on day to day life. It did not measure how twisted or wavy lines looked. Doctors call that wavy look “metamorphopsia.” So we do not know if these parts of life got better.

The study did not report any side effects. But the team could not confirm if any person lost a set amount of vision. So we must be careful when we think about safety from this one trial.

What do these results mean? In this small trial, surgery helped more than waiting. People who had surgery, on average, saw better. Their eye scans also looked better. Their retinas sensed light better. These are good signs.

But the proof is weak. There was only one trial. The trial had few people. The way the trial ran may also affect the results. These things can tilt the results. So we cannot be sure the same will happen for all patients.

We need more trials. Future trials should have more people. They should also track day to day life and wavy vision. They should watch for side effects in a clear way. Longer follow up would help too.

What does this mean for you? If you have a lamellar macular hole, surgery may help. It may help sight and the look of the macula on scans. But we do not have strong proof yet. Some people may do fine with watch and wait. Some people with poor sight or fast change may gain more from surgery.

Talk with your eye doctor. Ask about your scan and your sight now. Ask about the risks and gains for you. Your choice should fit your needs, your vision goals, and your eye health.","The effectiveness of surgery for treating lamellar macular holes
Why is this question important?Lamellar macular holes are small partial‐thickness defects affecting the centre of the retina, called the macula. The retina is the layer at the back of the eye that detects light, and the macula is essential for detailed vision. It has been suggested that surgery can prevent vision loss (or improve vision) in people with lamellar macular holes, but there is no current consensus. We reviewed published research to determine whether surgery improves vision for people with a lamellar macular hole. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of treatment. We then planned to compare the results, and summarise the evidence from the studies. Finally, we then aimed to rate our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and how similar the findings of the different studies were. 
What did we find?We found one study that involved a total of 36 people with a diagnosis of a lamellar macular hole. This study showed that people who underwent surgery may achieve better vision six months after their surgery compared with people who were observed without receiving surgery. However, limitations in the study design and its small size means that our confidence in the evidence was low. 
What does this mean?It remains unclear whether surgery is effective for people with lamellar macular holes. Further research is required. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 20 July 2021.

Interleukin‐1 (IL‐1) blocking agents have been used for treating severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), on the premise that their immunomodulatory effect might be beneficial in people with COVID‐19. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of IL‐1 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo on effectiveness and safety outcomes in people with COVID‐19. 
We will update this assessment regularly.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the COVID‐19 L‐OVE Platform (search date 5 November 2021). These sources are maintained through regular searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, trial registers and other sources. We also checked the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, regulatory agency websites, Retraction Watch (search date 3 November 2021). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IL‐1 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo for people with COVID‐19, regardless of disease severity. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed Cochrane methodology. The protocol was amended to reduce the number of outcomes considered. Two researchers independently screened and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the critical outcomes of clinical improvement (Day 28; ≥ D60); WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above (i.e. the proportion of participants with mechanical ventilation +/‐ additional organ support OR death) (D28; ≥ D60); all‐cause mortality (D28; ≥ D60); incidence of any adverse events; and incidence of serious adverse events. 
Main results
We identified four RCTs of anakinra (three published in peer‐reviewed journals, one reported as a preprint) and two RCTs of canakinumab (published in peer‐reviewed journals). All trials were multicentre (2 to 133 centres). Two trials stopped early (one due to futility and one as the trigger for inferiority was met). The median/mean age range varied from 58 to 68 years; the proportion of men varied from 58% to 77%. All participants were hospitalised; 67% to 100% were on oxygen at baseline but not intubated; between 0% and 33% were intubated at baseline. We identified a further 16 registered trials with no results available, of which 15 assessed anakinra (four completed, four terminated, five ongoing, three not recruiting) and one (completed) trial assessed canakinumab. 
Effectiveness of anakinra for people with COVID‐19  
Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in clinical improvement at D28 (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.20; 3 RCTs, 837 participants; absolute effect: 59 more per 1000 (from 22 fewer to 147 more); moderate‐certainty evidence. 
The evidence is uncertain about an effect of anakinra on 1) the proportion of participants with a WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above at D28 (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.22; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 55 fewer per 1000 (from 107 fewer to 37 more); low‐certainty evidence) and ≥ D60 (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.96; 1 RCT, 606 participants; absolute effect: 47 fewer per 1000 (from 72 fewer to 4 fewer) low‐certainty evidence); and 2) all‐cause mortality at D28 (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.39; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 32 fewer per 1000 (from 68 fewer to 40 more); low‐certainty evidence).  
The evidence is very uncertain about an effect of anakinra on 1) the proportion of participants with clinical improvement at ≥ D60 (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; 1 RCT, 115 participants; absolute effect: 59 fewer per 1000 (from 186 fewer to 102 more); very low‐certainty evidence); and 2) all‐cause mortality at ≥ D60 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.56; 4 RCTs, 1633 participants; absolute effect: 8 more per 1000 (from 84 fewer to 147 more); very low‐certainty evidence). 
Safety of anakinra for people with COVID‐19  
Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.11; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 14 more per 1000 (from 43 fewer to 78 more); moderate‐certainty evidence).  
The evidence is uncertain regarding an effect of anakinra on serious adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.56; 2 RCTs, 722 participants; absolute effect: 12 fewer per 1000 (from 104 fewer to 138 more); low‐certainty evidence). 
Effectiveness of canakinumab for people with COVID‐19  
Canakinumab probably results in little or no increase in clinical improvement at D28 (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.14; 2 RCTs, 499 participants; absolute effect: 42 more per 1000 (from 33 fewer to 116 more); moderate‐certainty evidence).  
The evidence of an effect of canakinumab is uncertain on 1) the proportion of participants with a WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above at D28 (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.20; 2 RCTs, 499 participants; absolute effect: 35 fewer per 1000 (from 69 fewer to 25 more); low‐certainty evidence); and 2) all‐cause mortality at D28 (RR:0.75; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.42); 2 RCTs, 499 participants; absolute effect: 20 fewer per 1000 (from 48 fewer to 33 more); low‐certainty evidence).  
The evidence is very uncertain about an effect of canakinumab on all‐cause mortality at ≥ D60 (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.91; 1 RCT, 45 participants; absolute effect: 112 fewer per 1000 (from 210 fewer to 227 more); very low‐certainty evidence). 
Safety of canakinumab for people with COVID‐19  
Canakinumab probably results in little or no increase in adverse events (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21; 1 RCT, 454 participants; absolute effect: 11 more per 1000 (from 74 fewer to 111 more); moderate‐certainty evidence). 
The evidence of an effect of canakinumab on serious adverse events is uncertain (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.13; 2 RCTs, 499 participants; absolute effect: 44 fewer per 1000 (from 94 fewer to 28 more); low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, we did not find evidence for an important beneficial effect of IL‐1 blocking agents. The evidence is uncertain or very uncertain for several outcomes. Sixteen trials of anakinra and canakinumab with no results are currently registered, of which four are completed, and four terminated. The findings of this review are updated on the COVID‐NMA platform (covid-nma.com).

Do IL-1 blocker drugs help people with COVID-19?

Rationale
COVID-19 can make some people very sick. Their immune system can overreact. This can hurt the lungs and other organs. People may need oxygen or a breathing machine.

IL-1 is a body signal that drives swelling, also called inflammation. Two drugs, anakinra and canakinumab, block IL-1. The hope is that this can calm harmful swelling.

Researchers asked a clear question. Do these drugs help people in the hospital with COVID-19? They also asked if the drugs are safe. This review was needed to guide care.

Trial Design
This study was a review of past trials. The team looked for the best kind of trials. These are called randomized trials. People got the study drug plus usual care, or usual care or a dummy drug. A dummy drug is a placebo. It looks the same, but it has no medicine.

The team searched large health data sources. The last search was 5 November 2021. They found six trials. Four trials studied anakinra. Two trials studied canakinumab.

These trials took place in many hospitals. Some trials ended early. People in the trials were adults. Ages were about 58 to 68 years. More men than women took part.

All people were in the hospital. Many needed oxygen. Some already had a tube to help them breathe. Trial teams checked people for about one to two months. Main checks were near day 28 and day 60.

Results
Overall, the review did not find clear benefit. IL-1 blocker drugs did not show big gains. Many results were uncertain. Some results had low or very low certainty.

Anakinra: help with getting better by day 28
Anakinra likely did not change how many people got better by day 28. Out of 1000 people, about 59 more got better. But the true number could be 22 fewer to 147 more. This means any gain was small or none.

Anakinra: need for a breathing machine or death by day 28
This result was uncertain. Out of 1000 people, about 55 fewer reached this bad state. But the true number could be 107 fewer to 37 more. We cannot be sure of a real effect.

Anakinra: need for a breathing machine or death by day 60 or later
This result was also uncertain. Out of 1000 people, about 47 fewer reached this bad state. But the true number could be 72 fewer to 4 fewer. This suggests a small drop, but we are not sure.

Anakinra: death by day 28 and by day 60 or later
Death by day 28 was uncertain. Out of 1000 people, about 32 fewer died. But the true number could be 68 fewer to 40 more. Death by day 60 or later was very uncertain. Out of 1000 people, about 8 more died. But the true number could be 84 fewer to 147 more.

Anakinra: safety
Anakinra likely did not change side effects. Out of 1000 people, about 14 more had any side effect. But the true number could be 43 fewer to 78 more. Serious side effects were uncertain. Out of 1000 people, about 12 fewer had a serious side effect. But the true number could be 104 fewer to 138 more.

Canakinumab: help with getting better by day 28
Canakinumab likely did not change how many people got better by day 28. Out of 1000 people, about 42 more got better. But the true number could be 33 fewer to 116 more. This means any gain was small or none.

Canakinumab: need for a breathing machine or death by day 28
This result was uncertain. Out of 1000 people, about 35 fewer reached this bad state. But the true number could be 69 fewer to 25 more. We cannot be sure of a real effect.

Canakinumab: death by day 28 and by day 60 or later
Death by day 28 was uncertain. Out of 1000 people, about 20 fewer died. But the true number could be 48 fewer to 33 more. Death by day 60 or later was very uncertain. Out of 1000 people, about 112 fewer died. But the true number could be 210 fewer to 227 more.

Canakinumab: safety
Canakinumab likely did not change side effects. Out of 1000 people, about 11 more had any side effect. But the true number could be 74 fewer to 111 more. Serious side effects were uncertain. Out of 1000 people, about 44 fewer had a serious side effect. But the true number could be 94 fewer to 28 more.

What this means for patients
Based on these trials, IL-1 blockers did not show clear benefit. They did not clearly help more people get better by day 28. They did not clearly lower the need for a breathing machine. They did not clearly lower deaths. Safety looked similar to usual care.

Some trials ended early. Many results were uncertain. This means we need more good trials. At the time of this review, many more trials were registered. Some were done. Some were stopped. Some were still running.

Conclusion from the investigators
The team did not find strong proof of benefit for IL-1 blockers. The drugs did not show clear gains in key outcomes. More results may come from ongoing trials. The team plans to update the review. Updates will appear on the COVID-NMA site: covid-nma.com.","Are medicines that block interleukin‐1 (a protein involved in immune responses) effective treatments for COVID‐19 and do they cause unwanted effects? 
Key messages 
• Overall, we did not find sufficient evidence to show that medicines that block interleukin‐1 (a protein involved in immune responses) are effective treatments for people with COVID‐19, or whether they cause unwanted effects. 
• We found 16 studies with unpublished results. We will update this review when new data are available. 
• In future, we need high‐quality studies to evaluate medicines that block interleukin‐1 to treat COVID‐19.  
What is interleukin‐1 and what is its role in COVID‐19? 
Interleukin‐1 (IL‐1) is a type of protein called a cytokine, which helps to regulate the body’s immune system. In particular, IL‐1 triggers inflammation to help fight infection. In COVID‐19, as the immune system fights the virus, the lungs and airways become inflamed, causing breathing difficulties. However, in some people, the immune system can over‐react (called a ‘cytokine storm’) and produce dangerously high levels of inflammation and tissue damage. This can lead to severe breathing difficulties, organ failure and death. 
What are interleukin‐1 ‘blockers’? 
IL‐1 blockers are medicines that stop IL‐1 from working by blocking signals from IL‐1 to other parts of the immune system. This reduces inflammation and may help the immune system to fight COVID‐19. In turn, this may reduce the need for breathing support with a ventilator (a machine that breathes for a patient) and reduce the number of deaths from COVID‐19. Three IL‐1 blockers are available: anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if IL‐1 blockers are effective treatments for people with COVID‐19, compared with standard care alone or with placebo (a dummy treatment that appears identical to the medicine being tested but without any active medicine). We were particularly interested in the effects of IL‐1 blockers on: 
•  whether people’s symptoms got better or worse;
•  how many people died; and
•  any unwanted effects and serious unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the effects of IL‐1 blockers to treat people with COVID‐19 compared with standard care alone or with placebo. People in the studies could have suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 of any severity (mild, moderate or severe), and be any age or sex. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found six studies with 2132 people. Four studies assessed anakinra (1633 people) and two assessed canakinumab (499 people). People in the studies were aged between 58 and 68 years old on average, and the majority were men. All the people in the studies were in hospital, mainly with moderate to critical COVID‐19. The studies varied in size, from 45 to 2253 people. At the start of the studies, 67% to 100% of people were receiving oxygen, and 0% to 33% were on a ventilator. 
We also found 16 studies that have not yet published their results.
Anakinra compared to usual care and placebo to treat people with COVID‐19 
• Anakinra probably results in little or no improvement in COVID‐19 symptoms (defined as improvement on a clinical scale or discharge from hospital) at 28 days after treatment (three studies, 837 people) but we do not know if it makes a difference at 60 days (one study, 115 people). 
• We do not know if anakinra makes a difference to the number of deaths at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 722 people) or at 60 days (four studies, 1633 people). 
• Anakinra probably results in little or no increase in any unwanted effects at 28 days after treatment, but we are not sure about its effect on serious unwanted effects (two studies, 722 people).  
Canakinumab compared to usual care and placebo to treat people with COVID‐19 
• Canakinumab probably results in little or no improvement in COVID‐19 symptoms (defined as improvement on a clinical scale or discharge from hospital) at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 499 people).  
• We do not know if canakinumab makes a difference to the number of deaths at 28 days after treatment (two studies, 499 people) or at 60 days (one study, 45 people).  
• Canakinumab probably results in little or no increase in any unwanted effects (one study, 454 people), but we are not sure about its effect on serious unwanted effects (two studies, 499 people) at 28 days.  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons. All the people in the studies were hospitalised, but some were more seriously ill than others ‐ some studies only included people on a ventilator. Usual care also differed between studies, and studies measured and reported their results using different methods.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 5 November 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013210.pub2,"Background
Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disease of the gut. About 75% of people with CD undergo surgery at least once in their lifetime to induce remission. However, as there is no known cure for the disease, patients usually experience a recurrence even after surgery. Different interventions are routinely used in maintaining postsurgical remission. There is currently no consensus on which treatment is the most effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and harms of interventions for the maintenance of surgically induced remission in Crohn's disease and rank the treatments in order of effectiveness. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 January 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles, abstracts from major gastroenterology meetings, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. There was no restriction on language, date, or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different interventions used for maintaining surgically induced remission in people with CD who were in postsurgical remission. Participants had to have received maintenance treatment for at least three months. We excluded studies assessing enteral diet, diet manipulation, herbal medicine, and nutritional supplementation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by arbitration of a third review author when necessary. We conducted a network meta‐analysis (NMA) using a Bayesian approach through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. For the pairwise comparisons carried out in Review Manager 5, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the NMA, we presented hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) and reported ranking probabilities for each intervention. For the NMA, we focused on three main outcomes: clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Data were insufficient to assess time to relapse and histologic relapse. Adverse events and serious adverse events were not sufficiently or objectively reported to permit an NMA. We used CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta‐Analysis) methods to evaluate our confidence in the findings within networks, and GRADE for entire networks. 
Main results
We included 35 RCTs (3249 participants) in the review. The average age of study participants ranged between 33.6 and 38.8 years. Risk of bias was high in 18 studies, low in four studies, and unclear in 13 studies. Of the 35 included RCTs, 26 studies (2581 participants; 9 interventions) were considered eligible for inclusion in the NMA. The interventions studied included 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA), adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone. This resulted in 30 direct contrasts, which informed 102 mixed‐treatment contrasts. 
The evidence for the clinical relapse network (21 studies; 2245 participants) and endoscopic relapse (12 studies; 1128 participants) were of low certainty while the evidence for withdrawal due to adverse events (15 studies; 1498 participants) was of very low certainty. This assessment was due to high risk of bias in most of the studies, inconsistency, and imprecision across networks. We mainly judged individual contrasts as of low or very low certainty, except 5‐ASA versus placebo, the evidence for which was judged as of moderate certainty. 
We ranked the treatments based on effectiveness and the certainty of the evidence. For clinical relapse, the five most highly ranked treatments were adalimumab, infliximab, budesonide, 5‐ASA, and purine analogues. We found some evidence that adalimumab (HR 0.11, 95% Crl 0.02 to 0.33; low‐certainty evidence) and 5‐ASA may reduce the probability of clinical relapse compared to placebo (HR 0.69, 95% Crl 0.53 to 0.87; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse (HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.27 to 1.34; low‐certainty evidence). We are less confident about the effectiveness of infliximab (HR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.02 to 1.74; very low‐certainty evidence) and purine analogues (HR 0.75, 95% CrI 0.55 to 1.00; low‐certainty evidence). It was unclear whether the other interventions reduced the probability of a clinical relapse, as the certainty of the evidence was very low. 
Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing endoscopic relapse. Whilst there might be some evidence of prevention of endoscopic relapse with adalimumab (HR 0.10, 95% CrI 0.01 to 0.32; low‐certainty evidence), no other intervention studied appeared to be effective. 
Due to high risk of bias and limited data across the network, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing withdrawal due to adverse events. Withdrawal due to adverse events appeared to be least likely with sulfasalazine (HR 1.96, 95% Crl 0.00 to 8.90; very low‐certainty evidence) and most likely with antibiotics (HR 53.92, 95% Crl 0.43 to 259.80; very low‐certainty evidence). When considering the network as a whole, two adverse events leading to study withdrawal (i.e. pancreatitis and leukopenia) occurred in more than 1% of participants treated with an intervention. Pancreatitis occurred in 2.8% (11/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.17% (2/1210) of all other groups studied. Leukopenia occurred in 2.5% (10/399) of purine analogue participants compared to 0.08% (1/1210) of all other groups studied. 
Authors' conclusions
Due to low‐certainty evidence in the networks, we are unable to draw conclusions on which treatment is most effective for preventing clinical relapse and endoscopic relapse. Evidence on the safety of the interventions was inconclusive, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia from purine analogues were evident in the studies. Larger trials are needed to further understand the effect of the interventions on endoscopic relapse.

Keeping Crohn’s disease calm after surgery: which drugs may help?

Rationale
Crohn’s disease harms the gut. It can cause pain, weight loss, and low energy. Many people need gut surgery. About 3 in 4 people with Crohn’s will have surgery at least once.

Surgery can make the disease quiet. Doctors call this “remission.” But there is no cure. Signs and pain often come back after surgery. This is called a “relapse.”

Doctors use many drugs to keep the disease calm. These drugs act in different ways. Some lower gut swelling. Some change the immune system. Some fight germs. We do not yet know which drug helps best after surgery.

This study set out to help. The main question was simple. Which drugs help keep Crohn’s calm after surgery, and are they safe? The team also looked at side effects. They asked which drugs people stop due to bad effects.

Trial Design
This was a review of many past trials. It was not one new trial. The team searched many data sources up to mid January 2019. They looked for the best kind of test: random tests that compare drugs to each other or to a fake pill.

They found 35 trials. These trials had 3,249 people in all. Most were adults. The average age was 34 to 39 years. All had Crohn’s disease. All were in remission after gut surgery.

People stayed on the study drug for at least three months. Some trials were longer. The trials tested many drugs. These were:
- 5-ASA: a pill that lowers gut swelling.
- Sulfasalazine: a pill that lowers gut swelling.
- Budesonide: a steroid pill that acts in the gut.
- Prednisolone: a steroid pill. One trial used it with sulfasalazine.
- Purine analogues: immune drugs such as azathioprine or 6-MP.
- Adalimumab and infliximab: biologic drugs. These are shots or IV drugs that block TNF, a protein tied to swelling.
- Antibiotics: drugs that fight germs.
- Probiotics: “good” germs in pill form.
- A fake pill (placebo) for some groups.

The team looked at three main things:
- Clinical relapse: when gut signs or pain come back.
- Endoscopic relapse: when a scope of the gut shows the disease is back.
- Stopping a drug due to side effects.

They used methods to combine results across trials. This helped compare drugs even when a trial did not test them head to head. Two team members checked the data. A third helped if they did not agree.

Results
Key point: the proof was weak in many trials. Many trials were small or had design flaws. That means we are not very sure about some results. Still, a few points can guide care.

Keeping signs and pain from coming back
- Adalimumab may help most to keep signs and pain from coming back. But we are not very sure.
- 5-ASA may help a bit. We are a bit more sure about this.
- Budesonide may not help much.
- We are not sure about infliximab or purine analogues. The proof was weak or mixed.
- We do not know if antibiotics or probiotics help. The proof was too weak.

Keeping scope signs from coming back
- We are not sure which drug helps here. The proof was weak.
- Adalimumab might help with scope signs. But we still lack strong proof.
- For other drugs, we did not see clear help on scope tests.

Side effects and stopping the drug
- We are not sure which drug leads to the fewest stops due to side effects. Data were too thin.
- People seemed least likely to stop sulfasalazine. People seemed most likely to stop antibiotics. But we are not sure about either point.
- One risk stood out. Purine analogues had more cases of pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is when the pancreas, a belly organ, gets sore and swollen. In the purine group, 11 in 399 people had it. In all other drug groups, 2 in 1,210 people had it.
- Purine analogues also had more cases of low white blood cells. White blood cells fight germs. In the purine group, 10 in 399 people had low white cells. In all other drug groups, 1 in 1,210 people had it.

What this means for people with Crohn’s
- After surgery, drugs may help keep Crohn’s calm. But we do not yet know the best choice for all.
- Adalimumab may help the most with signs and pain. 5-ASA may help some people. Budesonide may not help much.
- Scope signs are key too. We still need better proof to guide this part.
- Side effects matter. Purine analogues had more cases of pancreatitis and low white cells.

What doctors and patients can do now
- Talk with your care team. Share your goals and past drug use. Ask about risks and costs.
- If you try a drug, watch for belly pain, fever, or low energy. Tell your doctor fast if these occur.
- Be sure to go to your check ups. You may need blood tests or a scope at times.

What is next for research
- We need larger and better trials. Trials should last long enough and use the same clear rules.
- Trials should track signs, scope results, and side effects. This will help pick the best drug for more people.

Bottom line
We do not yet have one clear best drug to keep Crohn’s calm after surgery. Adalimumab may help the most with signs and pain. 5-ASA may help some. Budesonide may not help much. Purine analogues may raise some risks. Work with your doctor to choose the plan that fits you.","Interventions for maintaining surgically included remission in Crohn's disease
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out which drugs are most effective for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease who have undergone surgery to achieve remission. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. We examined these studies using a method known as network meta‐analysis (NMA) in order to compare and rank all the treatments in terms of clinical relapse, endoscopic relapse and safety. 
What was studied in the review? 
Crohn's disease is a chronic disease of the gut. It is known to change from periods when people experience a flare‐up of the disease (relapse) to periods of good health (remission). Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. People with Crohn's disease may undergo surgery to remove diseased parts of their gut and achieve remission. However, their symptoms return after a while. Different drugs can be given to ensure that people with Crohn's disease remain in remission for as long as possible. These drugs include mesalazine, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and adalimumab, amongst others. Whilst these drugs have been known to reduce inflammation (pain and swelling) in the gut, side effects can occur with their use. We attempted to find out which treatments are the safest and most effective for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease after surgery. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
We searched for studies published up to 15 January 2019.
What are the main results of the review? 
We included 35 relevant trials, which were published between 1976 and 2018. The studies included a total of 3249 participants who were mostly adults. Our NMA included 26 studies (2581 participants) and compared nine groups of treatments such as 5‐aminosalicylic acid, adalimumab, antibiotics, budesonide, infliximab, probiotics, purine analogues, sulfasalazine, and a combination of sulfasalazine and prednisolone, which are used in preventing relapse after surgery in people with Crohn's disease. Adalimumab may reduce the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo (dummy treatment). 5‐aminosalicylic acid probably reduces the chance of clinical relapse compared with placebo. Budesonide may not be effective in preventing clinical relapse. The entire network evidence is of low certainty due to the small number of participants included in the studies and high risk of bias. This means that are confidence in these results is limited. Research to understand the effect of the treatments on endoscopic relapse and safety was limited, however cases of pancreatitis and leukopenia were reported in participants who received purine analogues. 
Key messages 
We uncertain about which treatments are most effective in preventing postoperative relapse in Crohn's disease. Alhough there is limited research on the harms (side effects) of these treatments, there were reported instances of pancreatitis and leukopenia in participants who received purine analogues.

10.1002-14651858.CD010497.pub2,"Oral fumaric acid esters for the treatment of psoriasis
Background 
Psoriasis is a long‐term inflammatory skin condition that can markedly reduce the quality of life of affected individuals. Treatments taken by mouth (oral treatments), such as methotrexate, ciclosporin, and acitretin, are commonly prescribed to people with moderate to severe psoriasis. Oral fumaric acid esters (FAE) are licensed for the treatment of psoriasis in Germany but remain unlicensed in most other countries. This means that there are different treatment options offered to people in different countries. 
Review question 
What is the available evidence for the benefits and risks of using FAE for treating psoriasis? 
Study characteristics 
Our review included six randomised control trials (RCTs) that involved 544 participants. Five RCTs compared FAE with placebo, and one compared FAE with methotrexate. The outcomes we were interested in measuring were the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), which is a psoriasis severity score, and the proportion of participants who discontinued treatment because of adverse (side) effects that are common but sufficiently serious that the drug had to be stopped, such as severe diarrhoea, infections, or cutaneous malignancy. 
Key results 
It was difficult to pool and compare results because outcome measures differed between the studies. Three studies reported significant benefit with FAE when compared with placebo after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment, but we could not combine these results in a statistical analysis to show the overall difference. The included studies did not fully examine the chance of discontinuing FAE treatment because of adverse effects, which is uncertain. One study showed that individuals on FAE are nearly five times more likely to develop nuisance adverse effects; the most common were diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, flushing, reversible protein loss in the urine, and raised levels of eosinophil blood cells. Two RCTs were similar enough to allow the combination of their results and found that FAE were better than placebo when measured by the proportion of individuals who experienced at least a 50% improvement in their psoriasis severity score. One study reported improvement of individuals' quality of life with FAE in comparison with placebo, but the significance of this difference could not be calculated. The benefit of FAE was similar to methotrexate after 12 weeks when changes in disease severity from the start to the end of the trial were compared. The number of individuals experiencing nuisance adverse effects with these two treatments was not significantly different. The included studies, which were too small and of limited duration to provide evidence about rare or delayed effects, reported no serious adverse effects of FAE. 
Quality of the evidence 
The risk of study bias, which means any factors that may systematically deviate away from the true findings, was unclear in most studies. This may be because most of the studies were conducted decades ago or were incompletely reported. Several analyses comparing FAE with placebo and methotrexate were limited because the studies were small or did not provide enough information to establish how these treatments compare with each other. Therefore, the overall quality of the evidence was low when comparing FAE with placebo and very low when comparing FAE with methotrexate. 
Future RCTs should use standard psoriasis outcome measures, including a validated quality of life scale, to enable the comparison and combination of results. They should be longer in duration or have longer follow‐up phases to provide evidence about any delayed adverse effects.

Do fumarate pills help psoriasis? What the studies show

2. Rationale
Psoriasis is a long-term skin rash. It can cause red, thick, scaly spots. It can itch, burn, and crack. It can hurt daily life.

Many people need pills for this rash. Some pills are methotrexate, ciclosporin, and acitretin. Fumarate pills, also called fumaric acid esters (FAE), are one option. Germany allows doctors to use FAE for psoriasis. Many other countries do not.

We need to know if FAE work and if they are safe. This review asked a clear question. Do FAE help the skin rash and life quality? Do the side effects cause people to stop the pills? The hope was that FAE could calm the rash.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of six clinical trials. In these trials, people got a study pill or a dummy pill by chance. A dummy pill is also called a placebo. One trial used methotrexate, a common pill, to compare with FAE.

In all, 544 people took part. The reports did not give full details on age or gender. All people had psoriasis. Most trials lasted about 12 to 16 weeks.

The trials used a skin score called PASI. PASI shows how wide and thick the rash is. A lower PASI score means less rash. The trials also tracked if people had to stop the pill due to side effects.

Side effects may be mild or hard to live with. Serious side effects may include bad diarrhoea, infections, or even skin cancer. The trials looked for these events. They also checked life quality in some people.

4. Results
Three trials found a clear benefit with FAE. This was after 12 to 16 weeks. People on FAE had better skin scores than those on a dummy pill. But the trials did not all measure the same way. So the team could not add all the results together.

Two trials used the same measures. The team could add those results. In those two, more people on FAE got at least half better on the PASI score. One trial found that life quality also got better with FAE. The size of that gain was not clear.

One trial compared FAE with methotrexate for 12 weeks. The change in skin scores looked much the same. People had a similar number of mild side effects with both pills. This trial was small and short. So we cannot be sure the pills work the same over time.

Side effects with FAE did occur. One trial found people on FAE were about five times more likely to have mild side effects. These were flushing of the face, belly cramps, and diarrhoea. Some had protein in the urine that went back to normal. Some had a rise in a type of white blood cell, called eosinophils.

It was not clear how often people had to stop FAE due to side effects. The trials were too small and too short to catch rare or late harms. No serious side effects were reported in these trials. But we still need longer and larger trials to be sure.

The proof in these trials was weak. Many trials were old or had missing details. They used different ways to measure change. The proof was low for FAE versus the dummy pill. It was even lower for FAE versus methotrexate.

What does this mean for people with psoriasis? FAE may help the rash in the short term. Some people felt their life quality got better. Mild side effects were common. The chance of serious harm is not known from these short trials.

Doctors and patients need clearer proof. Future trials should last longer. They should use the same skin scores and a life quality scale. This would help us compare and combine results.

In short, FAE look helpful for some people. They may work about as well as methotrexate over 12 weeks. But we still have gaps in what we know. If you think about FAE, talk with your doctor. Ask about all pill options, side effects, and what is known where you live.","Oral fumaric acid esters for the treatment of psoriasis
Background 
Psoriasis is a long‐term inflammatory skin condition that can markedly reduce the quality of life of affected individuals. Treatments taken by mouth (oral treatments), such as methotrexate, ciclosporin, and acitretin, are commonly prescribed to people with moderate to severe psoriasis. Oral fumaric acid esters (FAE) are licensed for the treatment of psoriasis in Germany but remain unlicensed in most other countries. This means that there are different treatment options offered to people in different countries. 
Review question 
What is the available evidence for the benefits and risks of using FAE for treating psoriasis? 
Study characteristics 
Our review included six randomised control trials (RCTs) that involved 544 participants. Five RCTs compared FAE with placebo, and one compared FAE with methotrexate. The outcomes we were interested in measuring were the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), which is a psoriasis severity score, and the proportion of participants who discontinued treatment because of adverse (side) effects that are common but sufficiently serious that the drug had to be stopped, such as severe diarrhoea, infections, or cutaneous malignancy.

Hyperkalaemia is a common electrolyte abnormality caused by reduced renal potassium excretion in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Potassium binders, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate and calcium polystyrene sulfonate, are widely used but may lead to constipation and other adverse gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, reducing their tolerability. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer ion exchange resins for treatment of hyperkalaemia which may cause fewer GI side‐effects. Although more recent studies are focusing on clinically‐relevant endpoints such as cardiac complications or death, the evidence on safety is still limited. Given the recent expansion in the available treatment options, it is appropriate to review the evidence of effectiveness and tolerability of all potassium exchange resins among people with CKD, with the aim to provide guidance to consumers, practitioners, and policy‐makers. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of potassium binders for treating chronic hyperkalaemia among adults and children with CKD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 10 March 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled studies (quasi‐RCTs) evaluating potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia administered in adults and children with CKD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed risks of bias and extracted data. Treatment estimates were summarised by random effects meta‐analysis and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence interval (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using GRADE processes. 
Main results
Fifteen studies, randomising 1849 adult participants were eligible for inclusion. Twelve studies involved participants with CKD (stages 1 to 5) not requiring dialysis and three studies were among participants treated with haemodialysis. Potassium binders included calcium polystyrene sulfonate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. A range of routes, doses, and timing of drug administration were used. Study duration varied from 12 hours to 52 weeks (median 4 weeks). Three were cross‐over studies. The mean study age ranged from 53.1 years to 73 years. No studies evaluated treatment in children. 
Some studies had methodological domains that were at high or unclear risks of bias, leading to low certainty in the results. Studies were not designed to measure treatment effects on cardiac arrhythmias or major GI symptoms. 
Ten studies (1367 randomised participants) compared a potassium binder to placebo. The certainty of the evidence was low for all outcomes. We categorised treatments in newer agents (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) and older agents (calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate). Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate may make little or no difference to death (any cause) (4 studies, 688 participants: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.11, 4.32; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. The treatment effect of older potassium binders on death (any cause) was unknown. One cardiovascular death was reported with potassium binder in one study, showing that there was no difference between patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo for cardiovascular death in CKD and HD. There was no evidence of a difference between patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and placebo for health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) at the end of treatment (one study) in CKD or HD. Potassium binders had uncertain effects on nausea (3 studies, 229 participants: RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.65, 6.78; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), diarrhoea (5 studies, 720 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.47, 1.48; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), and vomiting (2 studies, 122 participants: RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.35 to 8.51; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. Potassium binders may lower serum potassium levels (at the end of treatment) (3 studies, 277 participants: MD ‐0.62 mEq/L, 95% CI ‐0.97, ‐0.27; I2 = 92%; low certainty evidence) in CKD and HD. Potassium binders had uncertain effects on constipation (4 studies, 425 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.71, 3.52; I2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) in CKD. Potassium binders may decrease systolic blood pressure (BP) (2 studies, 369 participants: MD ‐3.73 mmHg, 95%CI ‐6.64 to ‐0.83; I2 = 79%; low certainty evidence) and diastolic BP (one study) at the end of the treatment. No study reported outcome data for cardiac arrhythmias or major GI events. 
Calcium polystyrene sulfonate may make little or no difference to serum potassium levels at end of treatment, compared to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (2 studies, 117 participants: MD 0.38 mEq/L, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.79; I2 = 42%, low certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in systolic BP (one study), diastolic BP (one study), or constipation (one study) between calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate. 
There was no difference between high‐dose and low‐dose patiromer for death (sudden death) (one study), stroke (one study), myocardial infarction (one study), or constipation (one study). 
The comparative effects whether potassium binders were administered with or without food, laxatives, or sorbitol, were very uncertain with insufficient data to perform meta‐analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence supporting clinical decision‐making for different potassium binders to treat chronic hyperkalaemia in adults with CKD is of low certainty; no studies were identified in children. Available studies have not been designed to measure treatment effects on clinical outcomes such as cardiac arrhythmias or major GI symptoms. This review suggests the need for a large, adequately powered study of potassium binders versus placebo that assesses clinical outcomes of relevance to patients, clinicians and policy‐makers. This data could be used to assess cost‐effectiveness, given the lack of definitive studies and the clinical importance of potassium binders for chronic hyperkalaemia in people with CKD.

Do potassium binder drugs help adults with long-term kidney disease?

Rationale
Long-term kidney disease can raise blood potassium. This is called high potassium. Too much potassium can harm the heart. It can lead to an irregular heart beat. It can also cause weakness and numb hands or feet.

Doctors use drugs called potassium binders. These drugs stick to potassium in the gut. Then the body passes it out in stool. Older binders can cause hard stool and belly pain. Newer binders may cause fewer gut side effects.

This study asked a key question. Do these drugs help and are they safe? The team also asked which drug may work best. They wanted facts to guide patients and doctors.

Trial Design
This was a review of clinical trials. The team searched many study lists. The search went up to March 10, 2020. They looked for trials in adults or kids with kidney disease. The trials had to test a potassium binder drug.

The review found 15 trials. These trials had 1849 adults in total. Twelve trials were in people not on dialysis. Three trials were in people on blood cleaning treatment. This is called hemodialysis. No trials in children were found.

People in the trials were older adults. The average ages ran from 53 to 73. Trials ran for many time frames. Some lasted 12 hours. Some lasted up to 52 weeks. Most lasted about four weeks.

The drugs tested were of two types. Older drugs were sodium polystyrene sulfonate and calcium polystyrene sulfonate. Newer drugs were patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. Many trials compared a drug to a dummy pill. A few compared one drug to another. Some tested high dose versus low dose. People took the drugs in many ways. Some took them with food or laxatives. Some took them with a sugar called sorbitol.

Results
Key point one: blood potassium. Potassium binders lowered blood potassium a little. This was seen across trials. This was true in people on dialysis and not on dialysis. The size of the drop was small. We do not know the best drug or dose yet.

Key point two: blood pressure. In a few trials, blood pressure dropped a little. We do not know if this helps in the long run. We also do not know which drug led to this change.

Key point three: death and heart events. The trials were not made to study heart events. They did not track irregular heart beats. They did not track big gut harms. Newer drugs did not change death, from any cause, in the trials. We do not know the effect of older drugs on death. We do not know if any drug prevents heart events.

Key point four: how people felt day to day. One trial asked about life quality. It found no clear change with a binder drug. This means people did not feel better or worse in that study.

Key point five: side effects. It was not clear if these drugs caused gut side effects. This includes sick stomach, loose stool, throw up, or hard stool. The results were mixed and not strong. No trial reported big gut harms. Older drugs are known to cause hard stool. But this review could not confirm how often this happens. Newer drugs may cause fewer gut side effects. We still need stronger proof.

Key point six: drug versus drug. Calcium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium polystyrene sulfonate worked about the same. They led to similar potassium levels at the end. They also had similar blood pressure and hard stool results. In one trial, high dose and low dose patiromer had similar results. There was no clear gap in death, stroke, heart attack, or hard stool.

Key point seven: how to take the drug. We do not know if food helps or harms. We do not know if taking the drug with a laxative helps. The trials had too little data on this.

How strong is this proof? The proof was weak. Many trials were small. Many trials were short. Some had design flaws. This makes the results less sure. We need large and long trials. These trials should track heart events and big gut harms. They should also track how people feel day to day. No trials in children were found, so we cannot guide care for kids.

What does this mean for patients? Potassium binders can lower blood potassium a bit. We do not know if they help people live longer. We do not know if they prevent heart events. We do not know which binder is best. We do not know the best dose. If you have high potassium, talk with your kidney doctor. Ask about risks and goals. Ask which drug may fit your needs. Newer drugs may be easier on the gut. But we still need better proof.

Bottom line
These drugs can help lower blood potassium. The size of help is small. We do not yet know the long-term gains or risks. More and better trials are needed.","Are potassium treatments effective for reduce the excess of potassium among people with chronic kidney disease? 
What is the issue? 
High levels of potassium (a body salt) can build up with chronic kidney disease. This can lead to changes in muscle function including the heart muscle, and cause problems with heart rhythms that can be dangerous. Dialysis can remove potassium from the blood, but for some patients levels can still be high. Patients with severe kidney failure who have not yet started dialysis may have high potassium levels. Treatments have been available for many years but can cause constipation and abdominal discomfort, which make them intolerable for many patients. Newer treatments have been developed including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These may be more tolerable but it is uncertain whether they help to prevent heart complications. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all the research trials that have assessed the potassium‐lowering treatments for children and adults with chronic kidney diseases. We evaluated how certain we could be about the overall findings using a system called ""GRADE"". 
What did we find? 
There are 15 studies involving 1849 randomised adults. Patients in the studies were given a potassium binder or a dummy pill (placebo) or standard care. The treatment they got was decided by random chance. The studies were generally short‐term over days to weeks and focused on potassium levels. Heart related complications could not be measured in this short time frame. Based on the existing research, we can't be sure whether potassium binders improve well‐being or prevent complications in people with chronic kidney disease. There were no studies in children. 
Conclusions 
We can't be certain about the best treatments to reduce body potassium levels for people with chronic kidney disease. We need more information from clinical studies that involve a larger number of patients who have the treatment over several months or years.

Road traffic suicides are common. However, due to the difficulty in distinguishing between motor vehicle crash fatalities and actual suicides, no official figures exist for this method of suicide. Restricting access to means is an important universal or population‐based approach to suicide prevention with clear evidence of its effectiveness. However, the evidence with respect to means restriction for the prevention of suicide on roads is not well established. We conducted a systematic review to assess the impact of restrictions on the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to restrict the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Transport Research International Documentation (TRID) Database from the date of database inception to March 2020. We conducted searches of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. We applied no date, language, or publication status restrictions to these searches. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials, controlled intervention studies without randomisation, before‐after studies, or studies using interrupted time series designs, which evaluated interventions to restrict the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened abstracts and full‐text publications against the inclusion criteria. Two review authors planned to independently extract data and assess risk of bias of included studies. However, we identified no studies eligible for inclusion. 
Main results
We identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review highlights the paucity of research around road traffic suicides and the need for future robust studies that aim to investigate the effectiveness of interventions to prevent suicide on roads. Suicide ascertainment is a key issue; therefore, clear objective criteria are necessary in order to scale up and study this method more accurately. In the absence of any substantial evidence, we advocate for more awareness on road traffic suicides and its inclusion in future government suicide prevention policies. Further research exploring effective measures, particularly those that do not require driver compliance, are also needed.

Making roads safer: a careful review of ways to prevent suicide on roads

Rationale
Suicide means a person ends their own life. This harms families and communities. Many suicides may happen on roads. A person may step or drive into traffic to die. But it is hard to tell if a crash was a suicide.

We know one key fact. When we limit access to ways to die, suicide can go down. This has worked in other places. For example, at some bridges and rail lines. But we do not know if this works on roads.

This review asked a clear question. Do steps that limit access to suicide on roads help? These steps could make it harder to harm oneself on a road. If they work, they could save many lives.

The team did this work because we need answers. Doctors, road planners, and leaders need strong proof. They want to know what steps to use. They also want to plan fair and safe road rules.

Trial Design
How is this study designed? This was a “systematic review.” That means the team used set steps. They tried to find and check all good studies. They did not test a drug or a device.

The team searched large online libraries of research. They looked in Cochrane, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. They also used a road transport library. They searched from the start of each library to March 2020.

They also searched trial lists. These lists track planned and new studies. They used the WHO trial list and ClinicalTrials.gov. They looked for both new and not yet published work.

They set clear rules for what to include. They looked for strong study types. This could be trials, controlled studies, and before-and-after designs. They planned to study changes over time.

Two reviewers checked titles and full papers. They used the same rules for each paper. They planned to pull out data and check for errors. They planned to do this work in pairs.

Who was in the study? No people took part in this review. The team did not enroll patients. They looked for studies of road users and roads. But they found no study to include.

How long would a person be in the study? This point does not apply here. No one joined a trial in this review. So there were no visits or study time for people.

Results
What were the main results? The team found no studies to include. Not one study met their rules. So we do not have strong proof yet. We do not know which road steps work best.

This gap matters a lot. Road suicides may be common. But they can hide in crash data. A crash may look like an accident. It may be a suicide. We need better ways to tell the difference.

The team says we need clear and shared rules. These rules should help us tell if a crash was a suicide. With good rules, we can track this problem. Then we can test road steps well.

We also need new, strong studies. These should test steps that do not need the driver to act. For example, steps that work on their own once in place. Steps like this can help even when a person does not seek help.

The findings help the field in key ways. First, they show where the proof is thin. Second, they show how to build better proof. Third, they call leaders to act with care.

What are the benefits for patients and the public? Right now, we cannot point to the best road steps. But this review sets a plan for next steps. It calls for better data and better tests. That can lead to safer roads and saved lives.

What do the researchers conclude? They call for more awareness of this issue. They ask that leaders add road suicide to plans. They want fair and smart road policy. They want to test steps that do not rely on driver choice.

What does this mean for you? If you or a loved one uses the road, this concerns you. We all share the road. Safer road design can help us all. If you feel at risk now, please seek help today.

In sum, this careful review found no strong studies yet. We still need to learn what works on roads. Clear rules and new research can guide the way. With better data, we can prevent harm and save lives.","Means restriction to prevent suicide on roads
Why is this review important? 
Road traffic suicides are difficult to distinguish from motor vehicle crash fatalities and, therefore, no official figures exist for this method of suicide. Limiting access to lethal methods used for suicide (called means restriction) is an important universal or population strategy for preventing suicide. While there is evidence that means restriction is an effective approach for preventing suicides, the evidence for preventing suicide on roads is not well established. Therefore, this review aimed to explore the impact restriction of access would have on suicide on roads. 
Searching for evidence 
We searched several medical databases to find studies that assessed the impact of restricting access to means of suicide on roads. We searched the databases up to March 2020. We also searched international trial registries for unpublished and ongoing studies. Our main outcomes of interest were suicide and attempted suicide or self‐harm. 
Key results 
We found no studies eligible for inclusion in the review. As a result, we cannot draw any conclusions as to the effectiveness of means restriction interventions for the prevention of suicide on roads. Determining suicidal intent is a major problem in road crash fatalities, therefore clear objective criteria are necessary in order to scale up, study and understand this method of suicide more accurately. Improved awareness of suicide on roads in suicide prevention activities is needed, as well as, its inclusion in future government suicide prevention policies. Robust studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions to prevent suicide on roads are urgently required

Many millions of people living with dementia around the world are not diagnosed, which has a negative impact both on their access to care and treatment and on rational service planning. Telehealth ‐ the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to provide health services at a distance ‐ may be a way to increase access to specialist assessment for people with suspected dementia, especially those living in remote or rural areas. It has also been much used during the COVID‐19 pandemic. It is important to know whether diagnoses made using telehealth assessment are as accurate as those made in conventional, face‐to‐face clinical settings. 
Objectives
Primary objective: to assess the diagnostic accuracy of telehealth assessment for dementia and mild cognitive impairment. 
Secondary objectives: to identify the quality and quantity of the relevant research evidence; to identify sources of heterogeneity in the test accuracy data; to identify and synthesise any data on patient or clinician satisfaction, resource use, costs or feasibility of the telehealth assessment models in the included studies. 
Search methods
We searched multiple databases and clinical trial registers on 4 November 2020 for published and 'grey' literature and registered trials. We applied no search filters and no language restrictions. We screened the retrieved citations in duplicate and assessed in duplicate the full texts of papers considered potentially relevant. 
Selection criteria
We included in the review cross‐sectional studies with 10 or more participants who had been referred to a specialist service for assessment of a suspected cognitive disorder. Within a period of one month or less, each participant had to undergo two clinical assessments designed to diagnose dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI): a telehealth assessment (the index test) and a conventional face‐to‐face assessment (the reference standard). The telehealth assessment could be informed by some data collected face‐to‐face, e.g. by nurses working in primary care, but all contact between the patient and the specialist clinician responsible for synthesising the information and making the diagnosis had to take place remotely using ICT. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies. Data extracted covered study design, setting, participants, details of index test and reference standard, and results in the form of numbers of participants given diagnoses of dementia or MCI. Data were also sought on dementia subtype diagnoses and on quantitative measures of patient or clinician satisfaction, resource use, costs and feasibility. We assessed risk of bias and applicability of each included study using QUADAS‐2. We entered the results into 2x2 tables in order to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of telehealth assessment for the diagnosis of all‐cause dementia, MCI, and any cognitive syndrome (combining dementia and MCI). We presented the results of included studies narratively because there were too few studies to derive summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity. 
Main results
Three studies with 136 participants were eligible for inclusion. Two studies (20 and 100 participants) took place in community settings in Australia and one study (16 participants) was conducted in veterans' homes in the USA. Participants were referred from primary care with undiagnosed cognitive symptoms or were identified as being at high risk of having dementia on a screening test in the care homes. Dementia and MCI were target conditions in the larger study; the other studies targeted dementia diagnosis only. Only one small study used a 'pure' telehealth model, i.e. not involving any elements of face‐to‐face assessment. 
The studies were generally well‐conducted. We considered two studies to be at high risk of incorporation bias because a substantial amount of information collected face‐to‐face by nurses was used to inform both index test and reference standard assessments. One study was at unclear risk of selection bias. 
For the diagnosis of all‐cause dementia, sensitivity of telehealth assessment ranged from 0.80 to 1.00 and specificity from 0.80 to 1.00. We considered this to be very low‐certainty evidence due to imprecision, inconsistency between studies and risk of bias. For the diagnosis of MCI, data were available from only one study (100 participants) giving a sensitivity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.84) and a specificity of 0.73 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.84). We considered this to be low‐certainty evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias. For diagnosis of any cognitive syndrome (dementia or MCI), data from the same study gave a sensitivity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.99) and a specificity of 0.22 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.60). The majority of diagnostic disagreements concerned the distinction between MCI and dementia, occurring approximately equally in either direction. There was also a tendency for patients identified as cognitively healthy at face‐to‐face assessment to be diagnosed with MCI at telehealth assessment (but numbers were small). 
There were insufficient data to make any assessment of the accuracy of dementia subtype diagnosis. 
One study provided a small amount of data indicating a good level of clinician and especially patient satisfaction with the telehealth model. There were no data on resource use, costs or feasibility. 
Authors' conclusions
We found only very few eligible studies with a small number of participants. An important difference between the studies providing data for the analyses was whether the target condition was dementia only (two studies) or dementia and MCI (one study). The data suggest that telehealth assessment may be highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of all‐cause dementia when assessed against a reference standard of conventional face‐to‐face assessment, but the estimates are imprecise due to small sample sizes and between‐study heterogeneity, and may apply mainly to telehealth models which incorporate a considerable amount of face‐to‐face contact with healthcare professionals other than the doctor responsible for making the diagnosis. For the diagnosis of MCI by telehealth assessment, best estimates of both sensitivity and specificity were somewhat lower, but were based on a single study. Errors occurred at the cognitively healthy/MCI and the MCI/dementia boundaries. However, there is no evidence that diagnostic disagreements were more frequent than would be expected due to the known variation between clinicians’ opinions when assigning a dementia diagnosis.

Can video or phone visits diagnose memory problems as well as in‑person visits?

Rationale
Many people who have memory or thinking problems never get a clear diagnosis. This can block care and support. It also makes it hard to plan health services.

Telehealth means care by video or phone. It can help people who live far from a clinic. It was used a lot during COVID‑19. But we need to know if a telehealth visit can diagnose as well as an in‑person visit.

Dementia is a brain illness. It harms memory, thinking, and daily life. Mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, is a milder change in memory or thinking. MCI does not affect daily life as much as dementia. A test that can tell who has dementia or MCI can help people get the right care.

This study looked at past research. The team asked: Do telehealth exams give the same diagnosis as face‑to‑face exams? They also asked if people and doctors like telehealth. They looked for data on time, cost, and how easy it is to use.

Trial Design
This was a review of studies. The team searched many sources up to late 2020. They did not limit language. Two people checked each study.

They included studies that used both telehealth and in‑person exams for the same person. Each person had both exams within one month or less. The telehealth exam was by video or phone with a specialist doctor. Some studies also used notes from a nurse who saw the person in person first.

The people in the studies had signs of memory or thinking problems. Some were referred by a family doctor. Some lived in care homes and had high risk on a screen test. The studies took place in Australia and the United States. One study was in veterans’ homes.

There were three studies with 136 people in total. One study had 100 people. The other two had 20 and 16 people. Two studies checked for dementia only. One study checked for both dementia and MCI.

For each person, the time in the study was short. It was one month or less. In that time, they had the telehealth visit and the in‑person visit.

Results
The studies were small but well done overall. Only one small study used pure telehealth with no in‑person steps first. In two studies, a nurse met the person in person and shared those notes. The doctor then did the video or phone part. This mix could make telehealth look better than it is on its own.

For dementia diagnosis, telehealth did well. Across studies, it gave the same answer as in‑person visits in about 8 to 10 out of 10 people. This means it often caught dementia when it was there. It also often said “no dementia” when that was true. But the number of people was small. So the exact rate is not firm.

For MCI, the results came from only one study with 100 people. Telehealth called MCI the same as in‑person in about 7 out of 10 people. This shows fair, but not great, match. Some people with MCI by in‑person visit were called dementia by telehealth. Some with dementia by in‑person visit were called MCI by telehealth. So the line between MCI and dementia was hard to judge by telehealth.

The same big study also looked at “any memory problem.” That means dementia or MCI. Telehealth was very good at not missing people who had a problem. But it was not good at saying who had no problem. In that study, many people who were healthy by in‑person visit were called MCI by telehealth. The number of such cases was small, but the trend was clear.

There was not enough data to judge types of dementia, like Alzheimer’s disease. So we do not know if telehealth can sort those types well.

One study asked people and doctors how they felt about telehealth. People liked it. Doctors also felt good about it. The review found no solid data on time, cost, or how easy it would be to use telehealth at scale.

What does this mean for patients?
Telehealth may help people get a dementia diagnosis without a long trip. It can be easier for the person and family. It may speed up the path to care. When the goal is to find dementia, telehealth matched in‑person results in most cases. Results for MCI were less strong. Telehealth may blur the line between MCI and dementia. It may also mark some healthy people as having mild problems.

These results are early. The number of people in the studies was small. Also, in most studies, a nurse met the person in person first. That may boost the match with in‑person exams. We need more studies that use pure telehealth. We also need to test telehealth in more places and groups.

In short, telehealth looks promising for spotting dementia. It may miss fewer people who need help. But it may over‑label mild problems. Talk with your doctor about the best option for you. If you have a telehealth visit, ask how follow‑up will work. Ask how they will confirm your diagnosis if results are not clear.

Investigator conclusion
Telehealth may be as good as in‑person visits for finding dementia. The proof for MCI is weaker. Most errors happen when telling MCI and dementia apart. More and larger studies are needed. We also need data on cost, time, and how to make telehealth easy to use.","Accuracy of telehealth assessment for diagnosing dementia and mild cognitive impairment
Background 
Dementia is an illness in which memory and other thinking skills deteriorate to the point that someone can no longer manage their daily activities without assistance. If the memory and thinking problems are milder, so that independent living is not affected, the condition is described as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Both conditions usually affect older people. It is considered important that people with dementia or MCI can get an accurate diagnosis at a time and place suitable for them so that they and their families can understand the problem and can access treatment and support. However millions of people with dementia around the world never get a diagnosis. There are many reasons for this, but one may be a lack of accessible diagnostic services, particularly for people in rural areas or those who find it difficult to travel. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, many face‐to‐face services were closed. Telehealth ‐ the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to provide health services at a distance may be a way to increase access to specialist assessment for people with suspected dementia who cannot easily get to clinics. However, it is important to be sure that increased accessibility does not come at the expense of accuracy of diagnosis. 
Review question 
We asked how accurate telehealth diagnoses of dementia and MCI were compared to diagnoses made when patients attend traditional clinics for a face‐to‐face assessment. 
What we did 
We searched databases of medical studies up to 4 November 2020 for studies in which people had two assessments for suspected dementia or MCI: one telehealth assessment and one conventional face‐to‐face assessment. Both assessments were done by specialists and took place within a month of each other. For the telehealth assessment, all contact between the patient and the diagnosing specialist had to have been done remotely, using ICT, but some of the information needed to make the diagnosis could be collected by other members of the healthcare team who saw the patient in person. We then assessed how closely the results of the telehealth assessments agreed with the face‐to‐face assessments. 
What we found 
We included three studies (136 participants) who had suspected dementia. One small study (16 participants) was conducted in veterans' homes in the USA; the other two studies were in community services in Australia. They all used videoconference systems for their telehealth assessments. All three studies aimed to make dementia diagnoses but only one also aimed to diagnose MCI. The quality of the studies was generally good. In two studies, nurses who saw the patients in person played a big role in gathering information used in both assessments, which could bias those studies towards close agreement between the assessments. 
The studies found that telehealth assessment correctly identified 80% to 100% of the people who were diagnosed with dementia at face‐to‐face assessment and also correctly identified 80% to 100% of people who did not have dementia. 
Only one study (100 participants) attempted to diagnose MCI. In this study, 71% of participants who had MCI and 73% of participants who did not have MCI were correctly identified using telehealth assessment. 
Telehealth assessment in this study correctly identified 97% of the participants who had either MCI or dementia, but correctly identified only 22% of those who did not have either, although again this result was very uncertain because of the very small number of people in this category. 
It is important to note that diagnoses of dementia and MCI made by two specialists seeing patients face‐to‐face will not show 100% agreement. Therefore perfect agreement between telehealth and face‐to‐face assessments cannot be expected. 
What we concluded 
From the evidence we found, telehealth assessment for diagnosing dementia seems to have a good level of accuracy when compared to face‐to‐face assessment, although the small number of studies and participants and differences between the included studies means that there is a lot of uncertainty about this result. Telehealth appeared to be a little less accurate for diagnosing MCI than for diagnosing dementia. Agreement between two face‐to‐face assessments is also not perfect and we cannot say that disagreements between telehealth and face‐to‐face diagnoses were any more common.

Posterior blepharitis is common and causes ocular surface and lid damage as well as discomfort. It affects 37% to 47% of all ophthalmology patients; its incidence increasing with age. It is a multifactorial disease associated with multiple other pathologies, such as rosacea, meibomianitis, and infections. Treatment usually focuses on reliefing the symptoms by using artificial tears, lid scrubs, and warm compresses. The condition may be notoriously difficult to manage adequately once it becomes chronic. One such management approach for chronic blepharitis is the use of oral antibiotics for both their antibacterial as well as anti‐inflammatory properties. There are currently no guidelines regarding the use of oral antibiotics, including antibiotic type, dosage, and treatment duration, for the treatment of chronic blepharitis. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of oral antibiotic use for people with chronic blepharitis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 29 August 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral antibiotics with placebo in adult participants with chronic blepharitis (including staphylococcal, seborrhoeic, or Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD)). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology and graded the certainty of the body of evidence for six outcomes using the GRADE classification. 
Main results
We included two studies with 220 participants (numbers of eyes unclear). One parallel‐group RCT comparing oral doxycycline (40 mg once a day) with placebo enrolled 70 participants with blepharitis and facial rosacea in the USA. Follow‐up duration was three months. One three‐arm RCT conducted in South Korea investigated the effect of high‐dose (200 mg twice a day) and low‐dose (20 mg twice a day) doxycycline versus placebo after one month of study medication. It enrolled 50 participants with chronic MGD in each study arm (i.e. 150 participants enrolled in total). 
The two studies did not evaluate the same outcome measurements, which precluded any meta‐analysis. The evidence for the effect of oral antibiotics on subjective improvement in symptoms was very uncertain. One study suggested that there was little to no effect of oral doxycycline on subjective symptoms based on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores ranging from 0 to 100 (higher score indicates worse condition) (mean difference (MD) 3.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) −4.61 to 11.71; n = 70) and bulbar conjunctival hyperemia ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) (MD −0.01, 95% CI −0.38 to 0.36; n = 70) at 12 weeks. The three‐arm RCT showed that oral doxycycline may slightly improve number of symptoms (MD −0.56, 95% CI −0.95 to −0.17; n = 93 (high‐dose doxycycline versus placebo); MD −0.48, 95% CI −0.86 to −0.10; n = 93 (low‐dose doxycycline versus placebo)) and proportion of participants with symptom improvement (risk ratio (RR) 6.13, 95% CI 2.61 to 14.42; n = 93 (high‐dose doxycycline versus placebo); RR 6.54, 95% CI 2.79 to 15.30; n = 93 (low‐dose doxycycline versus placebo)) at one month, but the evidence is very uncertain. We judged the certainty of evidence for subjective symptoms as very low. 
One study evaluated aqueous tear production by Schirmer's test (mm/5 min) (higher score indicates better condition) and tear film stability by measuring tear film break‐up time (TBUT) in seconds (higher score indicates better condition) at one month. We found very low certainty evidence that oral doxycycline may improve these clinical signs. The estimated MD in Schirmer's test score after one month of treatment was 4.09 mm (95% CI 2.38 to 5.80; n = 93) in the high‐dose doxycycline group versus the placebo group and 3.76 mm (95% CI 1.85 to 5.67; n = 93) in the low‐dose doxycycline group versus the placebo group. The estimated MD in TBUT after one month was 1.58 seconds (95% CI 0.57 to 2.59; n = 93) when comparing the high‐dose doxycycline group with the placebo group, and 1.70 seconds (95% CI 0.96 to 2.44; n = 93) when comparing the low‐dose doxycycline group with the placebo group. Although there was a noted improvement in these scores, their clinical importance remains uncertain. 
One study suggested that oral doxycycline may increase the incidence of serious side effects: 18 (39%) participants in the high‐dose doxycycline group, 8 (17%) in the low‐dose doxycycline group, and 3 (6%) out of 47 participants in the placebo group experienced serious side effects (RR 6.13, 95% CI 1.94 to 19.41; n = 93 (high‐dose doxycycline versus placebo); RR 2.72, 95% CI 0.77 to 9.64; n = 93 (low‐dose doxycycline versus placebo)). Additionally, one study reported that one case of migraine headache and five cases of headache were observed in the oral doxycycline group, and one case of non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma was observed in the placebo group. We judged the certainty of evidence for adverse events as very low. 
Authors' conclusions
There was insufficient evidence to draw any meaningful conclusions on the use of oral antibiotics for chronic blepharitis. Very low certainty evidence suggests that oral antibiotics may improve clinical signs, but may cause more adverse events. The evidence for the effect of oral antibiotics on subjective symptoms is very uncertain. Further trials are needed to provide high quality evidence on the use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of chronic blepharitis.

Do antibiotic pills help with chronic eyelid inflammation?

Rationale
Blepharitis is long‑term swelling of the eyelid edges. It can make lids red, sore, and crusty. It can also lead to dry, gritty eyes. Many eye clinic patients have it. It is more common as we age.

This swelling often links to skin problems. One is rosacea, which causes red, bumpy skin on the face. Another is blocked oil glands in the lids. These oil glands are called meibomian glands.

People often use warm cloths, lid cleaning, and eye drops. These steps may help, but not for all. Some people still have pain and blur. The problem can last for years.

Doctors sometimes give antibiotic pills. One common pill is doxycycline. This pill fights germs. It can also calm swelling. But we do not have clear rules on if, when, and how to use it. We do not know the best dose or how long to take it. This study asked: Do these pills help more than a fake pill? Do they cause harm? The main idea was that pills might ease eye signs and eye pain. But they could also cause side effects.

Trial Design
The team did a careful review of trials. A trial is a test that compares care options. The team looked for trials with adult patients. All patients had chronic blepharitis. Some had blepharitis with facial rosacea. Some had meibomian gland disease. Patients took doxycycline or a fake pill. A fake pill has no drug. It looks the same.

The search used many databases. The last search was on August 29, 2020. They set no date or language limit. The review found two trials. In total, the trials enrolled 220 adults.

One trial was in the United States. It had 70 people. They had blepharitis and facial rosacea. People took doxycycline 40 mg once a day. The team checked them for three months.

The other trial was in South Korea. It had three groups. One group took a high dose: 200 mg, two times a day. One group took a low dose: 20 mg, two times a day. One group took a fake pill. Each group started with 50 people. People took the study pills for one month.

The trials looked at how people felt. They also looked at eye signs seen by a doctor. These signs include how much tear the eye makes. They also include how long tears stay smooth on the eye. Time in the studies ranged from one to three months.

Results
The two trials did not measure the same things. So, the team could not combine the results. The data for how people felt was very unsure.

In the United States trial, people did not feel much better on the pill. They filled out a symptom score. This score tracks burning, grittiness, and pain. There was little to no change at three months. The red look of the white part of the eye also did not change.

In the South Korea trial, people on the pill felt a bit better at one month. Both low dose and high dose showed small gains. More people said their symptoms got better than with the fake pill. But the team had very little trust in these results. The way the trials measured symptoms was not the same. The follow‑up time was short.

One trial looked at eye tests at one month. One test measures how much tear the eye makes. Another test measures how long tears stay smooth. People on doxycycline had small gains on both tests. But we do not know if these small gains matter to patients. The team rated this evidence as very unsure.

Side effects are key to know. One trial found more serious side effects with high‑dose doxycycline. In that group, 18 people had serious side effects. In the low‑dose group, 8 people had serious side effects. In the fake pill group, 3 out of 47 people had serious side effects. The report also noted headaches and a migraine in the pill groups. One person in the fake pill group had a blood cancer called non‑Hodgkin’s lymphoma. We cannot say if the pill caused or did not cause these events. The team again had very little trust in this data.

What does this mean for patients? Based on these two trials, we cannot say that antibiotic pills help symptoms of chronic blepharitis. One trial showed no clear change at three months. Another showed small gains at one month. We also cannot say that the small gains on eye tests matter in daily life. There may be more serious side effects, especially with high dose. The numbers were small. The time on the pills was short.

The review shows a gap in care. Many people live with sore lids and dry eyes. Doctors lack clear guides on pills for this problem. Better trials are needed. These trials should use the same measures. They should run for more time. They should study dose, length of use, and side effects. They should tell us how many people feel better and by how much. They should also tell us if the risks are worth it.

Conclusion from the investigators: There is not enough good proof to guide the use of oral antibiotics for chronic blepharitis. Pills may help eye test scores a little. They may also raise the risk of serious side effects. We need more and better trials before we can advise routine use. If you have chronic blepharitis, talk with your eye doctor. Ask about all options. Ask about pros and cons. Together, you can choose the best plan for you.","Treating long‐lasting blepharitis (swollen and itchy eyelids): how well do antibiotics (medicines that kill bacteria) work when taken by mouth (orally)? 
Key messages· We did not find enough evidence to show how well antibiotics taken by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
· One antibiotic tested may improve some clinical aspects (symptoms and course of the disease), but we are uncertain about its benefit in this respect, and it may also cause a higher number of unwanted effects. 
· More studies are needed to find out how well antibiotics taken by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What is blepharitis?Blepharitis is a common condition affecting the eyes. It causes swelling and redness on the edges of the eyelids, making them feel sore, and an itching or a gritty feeling in the eyes. The most common causes of blepharitis are infection by a type of bacteria that lives on the surface of the eye, or skin conditions such as dermatitis. 
How is blepharitis treated?Blepharitis is usually treated by regularly cleaning the eyelids, or using a cream or eye drops containing an antibiotic (a type of medicine that kills bacteria). If these do not work, then taking antibiotics by mouth (orally) is often tried. However, there are no guidelines about which type of antibiotic to give, what dose to use, or how long treatment should last. 
What did we want to find out?We wanted to find out how well antibiotics given by mouth can treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that tested antibiotics given by mouth to treat long‐lasting blepharitis. 
What did we find?We found 2 studies in 220 adults with long‐lasting blepharitis. One study took place in the USA and lasted for three months; it tested the antibiotic doxycycline compared to placebo treatment (a 'dummy' treatment that does not contain any medicine but looks identical to the medicine being tested). The other study took place in South Korea and tested the effects of high or low doses of doxycycline compared to placebo treatment. 
One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company; the other study did not report a source of funding. The studies measured results of treatment in different ways, so it was not possible to combine the studies' results to analyse them together. 
What are the main results of our review?We are uncertain about the effects of doxycycline on symptoms such as itching, burning, and watery eyes, as evaluated by people taking part in the studies. 
One study measured changes in how much an affected eye watered (produced tears) before and after one month of treatment. High‐ and low‐dose doxycycline may improve the eye's ability to produce tears (evidence from 1 study with 93 people in each dose group). 
One study evaluated dryness of the eye by measuring the time it took for a dry spot to appear on the surface of the eye after blinking (the 'tear film break‐up time'). Taking doxycycline (high‐ and low‐dose) for one month may improve problems with dryness (evidence from 1 study with 93 people in each dose group). 
Taking doxycycline for one month may cause more unwanted effects than taking a placebo (evidence from 1 study in 139 people). The number of unwanted effects reported was higher in the high‐dose doxycycline group. 
No studies measured:
· how many bacteria were present in the eye before or after treatment;
· people's well‐being (quality of life); or
· the costs and benefits of the treatments tested.
What are the limitations of the evidence?We have very low confidence in the evidence because of limitations in the ways the studies were conducted, and because the results of the studies varied widely and were inconsistent. One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company, which could have affected the way the study was designed, conducted, and reported. Further research is likely to change and increase our confidence in the results. 
How up‐to‐date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 29 August 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013336,"Extended versus standard lymph node dissection in patients with bladder cancer undergoing total bladder removal 
Review question 
When removing the whole bladder for bladder cancer, how does removing the lymph nodes from a large area (extended lymph node dissection) compare to only from a smaller area (standard lymph node dissection)? 
Background 
People with advanced cancer of the bladder that has spread into the deep muscle layers (but not outside the bladder) often have an operation to remove the whole bladder. As part of this operation, surgeons remove lymph nodes in that part of the body, which is an important part of the immune system. Traditionally, only the lymph nodes close to the bladder and its major blood vessels were removed. This is called a standard lymph node dissection which removes lymph nodes as high up as to where the main blood vessels for the pelvis and the leg split up. Some people think that also removing lymph nodes further away from the bladder is better in getting rid of cancer. This is called an extended lymph node dissection. It removes lymph nodes as high up as the blood vessels that supply the lower part of the intestines. We don't know whether this indeed helps people live longer and not die from bladder cancer and how the unwanted effects compare. 
Study characteristics 
We included only studies in which chance determined whether people got a standard or extended lymph node dissection that was reported in literature up to April 29, 2019. 
Key results 
We found only one such study that answered our review question. This study was done at 16 large hospitals in Germany and included 401 men and women with bladder cancer. 
We found that having an extended node dissection may make people less likely to die for any reason or to die from bladder cancer over time, although our confidence in this result is limited. 
We are uncertain whether an extended node dissection causes more serious unwanted effects than a standard lymph node dissection. 
We are also uncertain whether an extended node dissection makes cancer less likely to come back over time and causes a similar risk of not‐so‐serious unwanted effects compared to a standard lymph node dissection. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of evidence for these findings was low or very low, meaning that the true outcomes may be very different from what this review found.

Bladder cancer surgery: standard or extended lymph node removal?

Rationale
Bladder cancer can grow into the bladder muscle. Doctors often remove the whole bladder. This is major surgery. During this surgery, doctors also remove lymph nodes nearby. Lymph nodes are small filters in the body.

Cancer cells can travel to lymph nodes. Removing them can show how far cancer has spread. It may also remove hidden cancer cells. That could help people live longer. It could also lower the chance cancer comes back.

Doctors have used a standard node removal for years. It takes nodes close to the bladder. It goes up to where the main leg vessels split. Some surgeons remove more nodes in a wider area. This is called extended node removal.

We do not know which way works best. Some think extended removal may help more. It may clear more cancer cells. But it may also raise harms from surgery. Patients and doctors need better proof.

Trial Design
A team reviewed the medical studies on this question. They only included trials with random choice. That means a coin flip chose the surgery type. The review searched published work up to April 29, 2019. The team found one trial that fit.

The trial took place at 16 hospitals in Germany. It enrolled 401 adults with bladder cancer. Men and women took part in the trial. All had surgery to remove the bladder. The summary did not give the follow-up time.

People got either standard or extended node removal. Surgeons removed nodes during the bladder surgery. The trial tracked deaths from any cause over time. It also tracked death from bladder cancer. It also tracked cancer return and side effects.

Results
The trial suggests a possible benefit with extended removal. Fewer people may have died over time. This includes death from any cause. It also includes death from bladder cancer. But our confidence in this is limited.

We do not know about serious harms from extended removal. The trial did not prove a clear difference. We cannot say if harms were higher or lower. We also cannot be sure about less serious harms. The data leave this uncertain.

We do not know if cancer came back less with extended removal. The trial did not show a clear change. The result could go either way. We need more studies to know for sure. For now, both ways may be similar here.

The strength of the evidence was low to very low. This means the true results may differ. New studies could change what we think. So we must be careful with firm claims. We need more trials to settle this.

What does this mean for you? Both surgery ways remain valid today. Your surgeon can explain the pros and cons for you. Your health and how far the cancer spread matter a lot. Please ask your care team about your best plan.","Extended versus standard lymph node dissection in patients with bladder cancer undergoing total bladder removal

10.1002-14651858.CD013206.pub2,"Background
Eczema is a common and chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder. It seriously impacts quality of life and economic outcomes, especially for those with moderate to severe eczema. Various treatments allow sustained control of the disease; however, their relative benefit remains unclear due to the limited number of trials directly comparing treatments. 
Objectives
To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of different types of systemic immunosuppressive treatments for moderate to severe eczema using NMA and to generate rankings of available systemic immunosuppressive treatments for eczema according to their efficacy and safety. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to August 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic immunosuppressive agents for moderate to severe atopic eczema when compared against placebo or any other eligible eczema treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We synthesised data using pair‐wise analysis and NMA to compare treatments and rank them according to their effectiveness. 
Effectiveness was assessed primarily by determining the proportion of participants who achieved at least 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) and improvement in the Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM). Safety was evaluated primarily by considering the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) and infection. 
We deemed short‐term follow‐up as ≤ 16 weeks and long‐term follow‐up as > 16 weeks.
We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for these primary outcomes using six domains of CiNEMA grading. 
Main results
We included a total of 74 studies, with 8177 randomised participants. Approximately 55% of participants were male, with average age of 32 years (range 2 to 84 years), although age and gender were unreported for 419 and 902 participants, respectively. Most of the included trials were placebo controlled (65%), 34% were head‐to‐head studies (15% assessed the effects of different doses of the same drug), and 1% were multi‐armed studies with both an active comparator and a placebo. 
All trials included participants with moderate to severe eczema, but 62% of studies did not separate data by severity; 38% of studies assessed only severe eczema. The total duration of included trials ranged from 2 weeks to 60 months, whereas treatment duration varied from a single dose (CIM331, KPL‐716) to 60 months (methotrexate (MTX)). 
Seventy studies were available for quantitative synthesis; this review assessed 29 immunosuppressive agents from three classes of interventions. These included (1) conventional treatments, with ciclosporin assessed most commonly; (2) small molecule treatments, including phosphodiesterase (PDE)‐4 inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors; and (3) biological treatments, including anti‐CD31 receptors, anti‐interleukin (IL)‐22, anti‐IL‐31, anti‐IL‐13, anti‐IL‐12/23p40, anti‐OX40, anti‐TSLP, anti‐CRTH2, and anti‐immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibodies, but most commonly dupilumab. 
Most trials (73) assessed outcomes at a short‐term duration ranging from 2 to 16 weeks, whereas 33 trials assessed long‐term outcomes, with duration ranging from 5 to 60 months. All participants were from a hospital setting. Fifty‐two studies declared a source of funding, and of these, pharmaceutical companies funded 88%. We rated 37 studies as high risk; 21, unclear risk, and 16, low risk of bias, with studies most commonly at high risk of attrition bias. 
Network meta‐analysis suggests that dupilumab ranks first for effectiveness when compared with other biological treatments. Dupilumab is more effective than placebo in achieving EASI75 (risk ratio (RR) 3.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.51 to 3.69) and improvement in POEM score (mean difference 7.30, 95% CI 6.61 to 8.00) at short‐term follow‐up (high‐certainty evidence). 
Very low‐certainty evidence means we are uncertain of the effects of dupilumab when compared with placebo, in terms of the proportion of participants who achieve EASI75 (RR 2.59, 95% CI 1.87 to 3.60) at longer‐term follow‐up. 
Low‐certainty evidence indicates that tralokinumab may be more effective than placebo in achieving short‐term EASI75 (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.21 to 5.34), but there was no evidence for tralokinumab to allow us to assess short‐term follow‐up of POEM or long‐term follow‐up of EASI75. 
We are uncertain of the effect of ustekinumab compared with placebo in achieving EASI75 (long‐term follow‐up: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.45; short‐term follow‐up: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.97; both very low certainty). We found no evidence on ustekinumab for the POEM outcome. 
We are uncertain whether other immunosuppressive agents that targeted our key outcomes influence the achievement of short‐term EASI75 compared with placebo due to low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence. 
Dupilumab and ustekinumab were the only immunosuppressive agents evaluated for longer‐term EASI75. Dupilumab was the only agent evaluated for improvement in POEM during short‐term follow‐up. 
Low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence indicates a lower proportion of participants with SAEs after treatment with QAW039 and dupilumab compared to placebo during short‐term follow‐up, but low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence suggests no difference in SAEs during short‐term follow‐up of other immunosuppressive agents compared to placebo. 
Evidence for effects of immunosuppressive agents on risk of any infection during short‐term follow‐up and SAEs during long‐term follow‐up compared with placebo was of low or very low certainty but did not indicate a difference. 
We did not identify differences in other adverse events (AEs), but dupilumab is associated with specific AEs, including eye inflammation and eosinophilia. 
Authors' conclusions
Our findings indicate that dupilumab is the most effective biological treatment for eczema. Compared to placebo, dupilumab reduces eczema signs and symptoms in the short term for people with moderate to severe atopic eczema. Short‐term safety outcomes from clinical trials did not reveal new safety concerns with dupilumab. Overall, evidence for the efficacy of most other immunosuppressive treatments for moderate to severe atopic eczema is of low or very low certainty. 
Given the lack of data comparing conventional with newer biological treatments for the primary outcomes, there remains high uncertainty for ranking the efficacy and safety of conventional treatments such as ciclosporin and biological treatments such as dupilumab. 
Most studies were placebo‐controlled and assessed only short‐term efficacy of immunosuppressive agents. Further adequately powered head‐to‐head RCTs should evaluate comparative long‐term efficacy and safety of available treatments for moderate to severe eczema.

Which eczema drugs help most and are safe? A review of many trials

Rationale
Eczema is a long-term skin rash. It can itch, burn, and crack. Bad flares can harm sleep, work, and school. Care can also cost a lot.

Many drugs can calm the rash. These drugs act on the body’s immune system. But we do not know which drug helps most or is safest. Few trials test two drugs head to head.

This study set out to compare many drugs at once. The team asked two key things. Which drugs work best for bad eczema? Which drugs are safest to use?

Trial Design
This was a review of past clinical trials. The team searched large medical lists through August 2019. They looked for fair tests that used a fake pill or shot, or compared two drugs. All people in the trials had moderate or severe eczema.

In total, 74 trials met the rules. These trials had 8,177 people in all. The average age was 32 years. Ages ranged from 2 to 84 years, and about half were men.

Most trials took place in the hospital. Most compared a drug to a fake pill or shot with no drug. A smaller set compared one drug to another drug. Time on treatment ranged from one dose to five years.

The team used a method to compare many drugs at once. It can link drugs even if no head to head trial exists. They looked at short term results, up to 16 weeks. They also looked at long term results, more than 16 weeks.

The main benefit goal was a clear skin change. This meant at least three-fourths better on a common skin score. They also looked at a patient form on itch, sleep, and daily life. For safety, they counted serious side effects and infections.

Results
One drug, called dupilumab, stood out in the short term. More people on this drug got three-fourths better skin by 16 weeks. People also felt better on the patient form. We feel sure of these short term results.

We do not know if dupilumab keeps this edge long term. Few trials tracked people beyond 16 weeks. The long term skin score data were not clear. We need more long term trials.

Another drug, tralokinumab, may help in the short term. More people on this drug hit the skin goal than on a fake shot. But we do not have data on the patient form for this drug. We also lack long term results.

For many other drugs, we cannot say if they help. The data were small or not clear. One drug, ustekinumab, showed no clear gain over a fake shot. Many drugs did not have enough strong trials.

Short term safety looked okay overall. Dupilumab had no new safety issues in these trials. Dupilumab and one other drug had fewer serious side effects than a fake shot in short term tests. For most drugs, infections were about the same as with a fake shot in short term tests.

Dupilumab did have some side effects to note. Some people had eye redness, pain, or swell. Some had a rise in a type of white blood cell. This cell type is called an eosinophil.

What do these results mean for care today? For now, dupilumab is the top choice among the newer drugs. It helps more people with bad eczema in the short term. It also helps with itch and sleep by the patient report.

But gaps remain. Few trials match older drugs to these newer drugs. For example, we cannot rank a common older drug, ciclosporin, against dupilumab. Few trials used the same goals, and most were short.

We also need more head to head trials. These trials should test two active drugs, not just a drug versus a fake shot. They should last long enough to see steady gains and harms. This will help doctors and patients choose well.

In short, this large review gives clear short term news. Dupilumab helps many people with bad eczema feel and look better by 16 weeks. Safety in the short term looked reassuring in these trials. But we still need strong, long term, head to head tests to guide care.","Which oral or injected medicines work best to treat moderate to severe eczema?
Why this question is important 
Eczema is a persistent condition that causes dry, cracked, and itchy skin. People with mild eczema have small patches of dry skin, and people with moderate eczema have larger, redder, or swollen areas of skin. People with severe eczema have red crusts and broken skin (which may ooze fluid) that develop all over the body. 
Although there is currently no cure for eczema, treatments that aim to relieve symptoms are available. Usually, the first treatment option is to apply creams, ointments, or liquids to the affected skin. If this does not work, it is possible to take oral or injected (systemic) medicines that work throughout the body. 
Many systemic medicines are available for eczema. To help people decide which one is most appropriate for managing their symptoms, we reviewed the evidence on benefits and risks of different systemic medicines for people with moderate or severe eczema. We particularly wanted to find out: 
• whether some medicines were more likely than others to have an important positive effect on symptoms (defined as either at least a 75% improvement on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), or improvement on the Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)—two scales that are used by clinicians to evaluate changes in eczema symptoms); and 
• whether some medicines are associated with more serious unwanted events, including infection, than others. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (studies where people are randomly divided into different treatment groups) because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We then compared study results and summarised the evidence from all studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, the size of studies, and the consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate, or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found 74 studies that involved a total of 8177 people with moderate to severe eczema. Studies lasted between 2 weeks and 60 months. Treatments received varied from a single, one‐off dose to weekly doses for 60 months. These studies evaluated 29 different medicines by comparing them to a placebo (fake treatment) or to another medicine, or by comparing different doses of the same medicine. The medicine that was studied most frequently was dupilumab (12 studies), a laboratory‐made version of a protein, which blocks parts of the immune system involved in causing eczema. 
Dupilumab versus placebo 
High‐certainty evidence shows that, compared to a placebo or other laboratory‐made proteins, dupilumab improves the symptoms of people with moderate to severe eczema in the short term (within 16 weeks of treatment). It is unclear whether this improvement is sustained after 16 weeks because no studies have looked at changes in POEM scores beyond that time, and because the evidence from studies that measured EASI scores was of very low certainty. Dupilumab may be associated with fewer serious unwanted events than placebo (low‐certainty evidence). 
Other systemic medicines versus placebo 
Evidence on the benefits and risks of other systemic medicines compared to placebo is limited because no studies have measured their effects on symptom improvement or serious unwanted effects, or because the certainty of the evidence is low or very low. 
Comparing different systemic medicines with one another 
Reviewers found too few studies that compared different systemic medicines against one another to determine which worked best for people with moderate to severe eczema. 
What this means 
Evidence shows that, compared to placebo, dupilumab improves the symptoms of people with moderate to severe eczema within 16 weeks of treatment and may be associated with fewer serious unwanted events. 
Reviewers found too few robust studies to conclude whether dupilumab improves symptoms beyond 16 weeks, or whether this medicine works better than older systemic medicines. Future studies need to compare different systemic treatments beyond 16 weeks in people with moderate to severe eczema.

10.1002-14651858.CD013198.pub2,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. Acute exacerbations punctuate the natural history of COPD and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and disease progression. Chronic airflow limitation is caused by a combination of small airways (bronchitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema), which can impact day‐to‐day activities and overall quality of life. In carefully selected patients with COPD, long‐term, prophylactic use of antibiotics may reduce bacterial load, inflammation of the airways, and the frequency of exacerbations. 
Objectives
To assess effects of different prophylactic antibiotics on exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events in people with COPD in three separate network meta‐analyses (NMAs), and to provide rankings of identified antibiotics. 
Search methods
To identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs), we searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials and clinical trials registries. We conducted the most recent search on 22 January 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs with a parallel design of at least 12 weeks' duration evaluating long‐term administration of antibiotics prophylactically compared with other antibiotics, or placebo, for patients with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
This Cochrane Review collected and updated pair‐wise data from two previous Cochrane Reviews. Searches were updated and additional studies included. We conducted three separate network meta‐analyses (NMAs) within a Bayesian framework to assess three outcomes: exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events. For quality of life, we collected data from St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Using previously validated methods, we selected the simplest model that could adequately fit the data for every analysis. We used threshold analysis to indicate which results were robust to potential biases, taking into account each study’s contributions to the overall results and network structure. Probability ranking was performed for each antibiotic class for exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events. 
Main results
Characteristics of studies and participants  
Eight trials were conducted at multiple sites that included hospital clinics or academic health centres. Seven were single‐centre trials conducted in hospital clinics. Two trials did not report settings. Trials durations ranged from 12 to 52 weeks. Most participants had moderate to severe disease. Mean age ranged from 64 years to 73 years, and more males were recruited (51% to 100%). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) ranged from 0.935 to 1.36 L. Most participants had previous exacerbations. Data from 12 studies were included in the NMAs (3405 participants; 16 treatment arms including placebo). Prophylactic antibiotics evaluated were macrolides (azithromycin and erythromycin), tetracyclines (doxycyclines), quinolones (moxifloxacin) and macrolides plus tetracyclines (roxithromycin plus doxycycline). 
Risk of bias and threshold analysis  
Most studies were at low risk across domains, except detection bias, for which only seven studies were judged at low risk. In the threshold analysis for exacerbations, all comparisons in which one antibiotic was compared with another were robust to sampling variation, especially macrolide comparisons. Comparisons of classes with placebo were sensitive to potential bias, especially macrolide versus placebo, therefore, any bias in the comparison was likely to favour the active class, so any adjustment would bring the estimated relative effect closer to the null value, thus quinolone may become the best class to prevent exacerbations. 
Exacerbations  
Nine studies were included (2732 participants) in this NMA (exacerbations analysed as time to first exacerbation or people with one or more exacerbations). Macrolides and quinolones reduced exacerbations. Macrolides had a greater effect in reducing exacerbations compared with placebo (macrolides: hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.60 to 0.75; quinolones: HR 0.89, 95% CrI 0.75 to 1.04), resulting in 127 fewer people per 1000 experiencing exacerbations on macrolides. The difference in exacerbations between tetracyclines and placebo was uncertain (HR 1.29, 95% CrI 0.66 to 2.41). Macrolides ranked first (95% CrI first to second), with quinolones ranked second (95% CrI second to third). Tetracyclines ranked fourth, which was lower than placebo (ranked third). Contributing studies were considered as low risk of bias in a threshold analysis. 
Quality of life (SGRQ)  
Seven studies were included (2237 participants) in this NMA. SGRQ scores improved with macrolide treatment compared with placebo (fixed effect‐fixed class effect: mean difference (MD) ‐2.30, 95% CrI ‐3.61 to ‐0.99), but the mean difference did not reach the minimally clinical important difference (MCID) of 4 points. Tetracyclines and quinolones did not improve quality of life any more than placebo, and we did not detect a difference between antibiotic classes. 
Serious adverse events  
Nine studies were included (3180 participants) in the NMA. Macrolides reduced the odds of a serious adverse event compared with placebo (fixed effect‐fixed class effect: odds ratio (OR) 0.76, 95% CrI 0.62 to 0.93). There was probably little to no difference in the effect of quinolone compared with placebo or tetracycline plus macrolide compared with placebo. There was probably little to no difference in serious adverse events between quinolones or tetracycline plus macrolide. With macrolide treatment 49 fewer people per 1000 experienced a serious adverse event compared with those given placebo. Macrolides ranked first, followed by quinolones. Tetracycline did not rank better than placebo. 
Drug resistance  
Ten studies reported drug resistance. Results were not combined due to variation in outcome measures. All studies concluded that prophylactic antibiotic administration was associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance. 
Authors' conclusions
This NMA evaluated the safety and efficacy of different antibiotics used prophylactically for COPD patients. Compared to placebo, prolonged administration of macrolides (ranked first) appeared beneficial in prolonging the time to next exacerbation, improving quality of life, and reducing serious adverse events. No clear benefits were associated with use of quinolones or tetracyclines. In addition, antibiotic resistance was a concern and could not be thoroughly assessed in this review. Given the trade‐off between effectiveness, safety, and risk of antibiotic resistance, prophylactic administration of antibiotics may be best reserved for selected patients, such as those experiencing frequent exacerbations. However, none of the eligible studies excluded patients with previously isolated non‐tuberculous mycobacteria, which would contraindicate prophylactic administration of antibiotics, due to the risk of developing resistant non‐tuberculous mycobacteria.

Long-term antibiotics to help prevent COPD flare-ups: what we know

Rationale
COPD is a long-term lung disease. It makes it hard to breathe. Many people with COPD have “flare-ups.” A flare-up is a sudden worse spell of cough, mucus, or breath loss.

Flare-ups can lead to ER visits or a stay in the hospital. They can speed up lung damage. They can also harm day-to-day life. People may not be able to walk or do chores.

Some doctors use daily antibiotics to try to prevent flare-ups. “Prophylactic” means used to prevent a problem. These drugs may lower the germ load in the lungs. They may also calm swelling in the airways.

This study asked if long-term antibiotics help people with COPD. The main idea was simple. If we prevent flare-ups, people may feel and do better. We also must weigh the risks. One key risk is drug resistance.

Trial Design
This study is a review of many trials. These trials put people into groups by chance. They compared long-term antibiotics with each other or with placebo. A placebo is a pill with no drug.

The study team searched for trials up to January 22, 2020. They found 12 good trials to compare. These trials took place in hospitals and clinics. Time in each trial ran from about 3 months to 12 months.

In all, 3405 people joined the trials. Most had moderate to severe COPD. Most had flare-ups in the past. The average ages were about 64 to 73 years.

More men than women took part. The trials tested several drug types. These were macrolides, like azithromycin and erythromycin. They also tested tetracyclines, like doxycycline.

Another group tested quinolones, like moxifloxacin. One group used two drugs together. That was roxithromycin plus doxycycline. Some groups got a placebo.

The review used a method to rank drugs. It can compare many drugs at once. It also looked at three key things. These were flare-ups, quality of life, and serious health problems.

Results
Flare-ups were the main focus. Macrolide drugs helped most. Fewer people had a flare-up on a macrolide than on a placebo. About 127 fewer out of 1000 had a flare-up.

For quinolones, the benefit was not clear. The results did not show a sure drop in flare-ups. For tetracyclines, the result was also not clear. The review ranked macrolides first for preventing flare-ups.

Quinolones ranked second. Tetracyclines ranked below placebo in that ranking. The authors checked for bias in the data. They found some results could shift with bias.

Even so, the clear gain was with macrolides. Next, the review looked at quality of life. The trials used a lung survey called SGRQ. It asks about breath, cough, and daily life.

Macrolides led to a small gain on this survey. People felt a bit better overall. But the change was small. Many people may not notice it in daily life.

Tetracyclines did not help quality of life more than placebo. Quinolones also did not show a gain over placebo. There was no clear gap between antibiotic types for this measure. The main useful change was with macrolides.

The review also looked at serious health problems. These are big problems that may need a hospital stay. On macrolides, fewer people had a serious problem. About 49 fewer out of 1000 had one.

For quinolones, the change was small or none. For tetracyclines, the change was small or none. In this ranking, macrolides were best. Quinolones came next.

A key risk is germ resistance. This means germs learn to beat the drug. Ten trials checked this risk. All ten found that long-term antibiotics led to more drug-resistant germs.

That risk is a big concern. It can make future lung infections hard to treat. It can also spread to others. So we must use long-term antibiotics with care.

There is one more safety note. Some people have a lung germ called non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Doctors often call this NTM. People with past NTM should not get long-term antibiotics to prevent flare-ups.

This is because NTM can become drug resistant. The trials in this review did not screen out people with past NTM. So doctors must check for NTM before they start these drugs.

What do these results mean for patients? Long-term macrolides can help some people with COPD. They can cut the chance of a flare-up. They may also lower the chance of a serious health problem.

The gain in day-to-day life was small. Quinolones and tetracyclines did not show clear gains. All long-term antibiotics can raise the risk of drug-resistant germs. This risk matters to you and your community.

The authors suggest careful use. These drugs may suit people who have many flare-ups. The choice should be shared by you and your doctor. It should weigh your flare-up risk and your infection risk.

Ask your care team if this applies to you. Ask about your past germs and tests. Ask about other ways to prevent flare-ups, too. Together, you can choose the best plan for you.","Prophylactic antibiotics for people with COPD
Review question 
Which preventative antibiotic is effective and safe for reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life, and reducing serious side effects in people with COPD? 
What is COPD? 
COPD is a lung condition that can cause long‐term breathing problems. Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Flare‐ups (so‐called exacerbations) can be triggered by infection or inflammation, causing worsening symptoms and lung damage. Frequent exacerbations can lead to reduced quality of life and can increase the risk of death. 
Why did we do this review? 
We wanted to find out if one type of preventative antibiotic was better than another in reducing exacerbations, improving quality of life, and reducing side effects. We did this by using information from two previous reviews and comparing different antibiotics with each other, and with a control treatment (called placebo), by creating networks. As information was limited, the networks allowed us to combine information and determine the best preventative antibiotics by ranking them in order of ability to reduce exacerbations, improve quality of life, and reduce serious side effects. 
What evidence did we find? 
We tested three types of antibiotics: macrolides, quinolones, and tetracyclines. Macrolides were better in reducing exacerbations compared to control treatment. There was no clear difference in exacerbations when quinolone or tetracycline was compared with a control treatment. Tetracyclines were ranked lower than placebo in reducing exacerbations. We used the data for each antibiotic group to rank antibiotic groups in order of their ability to reduce exacerbations. We found that macrolides ranked first, followed by quinolones (second). Tetracyclines were ranked fourth and were not better than control treatment (ranked third). 
Macrolides improved quality of life compared with control treatment. Quinolones did not appear to impact quality of life, and tetracyclines may have been associated with worsening quality of life compared to control treatment. 
Macrolides were more effective in reducing serious unwanted events. There was no clear benefit for serious unwanted events with quinolone, tetracycline, or combined macrolide plus tetracycline compared with control treatment. 
We could not clearly show benefit or harm of preventative antibiotic use for microbial resistance. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did not find any concerns about the ways in which studies were carried out, except that for some studies, people collecting the information knew (1) which patient was included in which treatment group, and (2) patient results when treatments were completed. Overall, the numerical information was robust and was unlikely to be influenced by differences noted between individual studies. 
Conclusion 
We found that exacerbations were reduced, quality of life was improved, and unwanted events were fewer with macrolides compared with control treatment. We could not determine whether quinolones or tetracyclines were of benefit compared with control treatment. Macrolides were ranked highest, followed by quinolones, which ranked second. Tetracyclines were no better than control treatment (ranked fourth and third, respectively). Although these NMAs show some benefit of using macrolides, they are based on a limited number of studies, and concerns remain about antibiotic resistance with long‐term use of antibiotics.

10.1002-14651858.CD013736.pub2,"Background
Endotracheal intubation is a commonly performed procedure in neonates, the risks of which are well‐described. Some endotracheal tubes (ETT) are equipped with a cuff that can be inflated after insertion of the ETT in the airway to limit leak or aspiration. Cuffed ETTs have been shown in larger children and adults to reduce gas leak around the ETT, ETT exchange, accidental extubation, and exposure of healthcare workers to anesthetic gas during surgery. With improved understanding of neonatal airway anatomy and the widespread use of cuffed ETTs by anesthesiologists, the use of cuffed tubes is increasing in neonates. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of cuffed ETTs (inflated or non‐inflated) compared to uncuffed ETTs for respiratory support in neonates. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, and CINAHL on 20 August 2021; we also searched trial registers and checked reference lists to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster‐randomized trials comparing cuffed (inflated and non‐inflated) versus uncuffed ETTs in newborns. We sought to compare 1. inflated, cuffed versus uncuffed ETT; 2. non‐inflated, cuffed versus uncuffed ETT; and 3. inflated, cuffed versus non‐inflated, cuffed ETT. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. Two review authors independently assessed studies identified by the search strategy for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We identified one eligible RCT for inclusion that compared the use of cuffed (inflated if ETT leak greater than 20% with cuff pressure 20 cm H2O or less) versus uncuffed ETT. The author provided a spreadsheet with individual data. Among 76 infants in the original manuscript, 69 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this Cochrane Review. We found possible bias due to lack of blinding and other bias. 
We are very uncertain about frequency of postextubation stridor, because the confidence intervals (CI) of the risk ratio (RR) were very wide (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.35 to 5.25; risk difference (RD) 0.03, −0.11 to 0.18; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No neonate was diagnosed with postextubation subglottic stenosis; however, endoscopy was not available to confirm the clinical diagnosis. 
We are very uncertain about reintubation for stridor or subglottic stenosis because the CIs of the RR were very wide (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.49; RD −0.03, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.05; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No neonate had surgical intervention (e.g. endoscopic balloon dilation, cricoid split, tracheostomy) for stridor or subglottic stenosis (1 study, 69 participants). 
Neonates randomized to cuffed ETT may be less likely to have a reintubation for any reason (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.45; RD −0.39, 95% CI −0.57 to −0.21; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome 3, 95% CI 2 to 5; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
We are very uncertain about accidental extubation because the CIs of the RR were wide (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.12 to 5.46; RD −0.01, 95% CI −0.12 to 0.10; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
We are very uncertain about all‐cause mortality during initial hospitalization because the CIs of the RR were extremely wide (RR 2.46, 95% CI 0.10 to 58.39; RD 0.03, 95% CI −0.05 to 0.10; 1 study, 69 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
There is one ongoing trial. We classified two studies as awaiting classification because outcome data were not reported separately for newborns and older infants. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence for comparing cuffed versus uncuffed ETTs in neonates is limited by a small number of babies in a single RCT with possible bias. There is very low certainty evidence for all outcomes of this review. CIs of the estimate for postextubation stridor were wide. No neonate had clinical evidence for subglottic stenosis; however, endoscopy results were not available to assess the anatomy. 
Additional RCTs are necessary to evaluate the benefits and harms of cuffed ETTs (inflated and non‐inflated) in the neonatal population. These studies must include neonates and be conducted both for short‐term use (in the setting of the operating room) and chronic use (in the setting of chronic lung disease) of cuffed ETTs.

Cuffed breathing tubes for newborns: what we know so far

Rationale
Some very small babies need help to breathe. Doctors place a breathing tube in the windpipe. This is called an endotracheal tube, or ETT. It helps air get to the lungs.

Some tubes have a cuff. A cuff is a small, soft ring like a tiny balloon. The cuff can fill with air after the tube is in place. This can help stop air leak around the tube. It may also help block spit from going into the lungs.

In older kids and adults, cuffed tubes can help. They can cut air leak. They can lower the need to change tubes. They can lower the chance the tube slips out. So, doctors now use more cuffed tubes in newborns too.

But newborns have small and soft airways. A tight cuff might harm the voice box area. It could cause noisy breathing after tube removal. This sound is called stridor. It could also lead to a tight spot below the voice box. This is called subglottic stenosis.

The goal of this research was clear. The team asked if cuffed tubes help more than harm in newborns. They wanted to know if cuffed tubes are safe. They also wanted to know if cuffed tubes work better than plain tubes.

Trial Design
This was a review of trials. The team searched many research lists in 2021. They looked for the best kind of tests. These tests place babies in groups by chance. One group gets a cuffed tube. The other group gets a plain tube.

They planned to include many kinds of fair tests. They planned to compare three things. First, cuffed tubes filled with air versus plain tubes. Second, cuffed tubes left unfilled versus plain tubes. Third, filled cuffed tubes versus unfilled cuffed tubes.

They found only one fair test that fit the plan. It took place in a hospital. It included 69 newborns who needed a breathing tube. In the cuffed group, staff filled the cuff only if a big leak was seen. They kept the fill gentle.

The trials took place in newborns who needed help to breathe. The study did not report the time each baby took part. We do not know how long each tube stayed in. We also do not know follow up time after tube removal.

The team also found one more trial that is still in progress. Two other studies mixed newborns and older babies. Those did not give results for newborns alone.

Results
The team looked at airway problems after the tube came out. They looked for stridor. Stridor is a harsh, high sound when a baby breathes in. The one trial was small. The range of results was wide. So we are not sure if cuffed tubes change the chance of stridor.

They also looked for a tight airway below the voice box. This is called subglottic stenosis. No baby was said to have this problem. But doctors did not use a tiny camera test to look. So we cannot be sure.

They checked if babies needed the tube put back in due to airway noise or a tight spot. We are not sure if cuffed tubes change this need. The numbers were small, and the range was wide.

No baby needed airway surgery. This includes balloon stretch, a split of the ring, or a neck tube. That is good news, but the study was small.

The team also looked at reintubation for any cause. In this small trial, fewer babies with cuffed tubes needed the tube put back in. This may be a real gain. But the proof is weak. We need more and bigger trials to be sure.

They looked at tube slips. This is when the tube comes out by accident. We cannot tell if cuffed tubes change this risk. The study was too small to show a clear link.

They looked at deaths in the first hospital stay. Again, we cannot tell if cuffed tubes change this risk. The numbers were very small, and the range was very wide.

What do these results mean for care now? Cuffed tubes may help cut the need to put the tube back in. They did not lead to airway surgery in this small study. But we are very unsure about harms like stridor. We are also unsure about a tight airway, tube slips, and deaths. The proof we have now is very weak.

The study had limits. Staff knew which tube each baby had. This can affect care and results. The trial was small and in one place. The team did not use camera tests to check the airway. So some problems could be missed.

What comes next? We need more fair tests in newborns. We need tests in the operating room for short use. We also need tests in babies on long term breathing help. These new tests should use gentle cuff care. They should check the airway with a camera when safe. They should follow babies long enough to find late harm.

In short, cuffed tubes for newborns may help in some ways. But we do not know if they are safer or better overall. For now, doctors should weigh the pros and cons for each baby. More and better trials will guide the best choice.","Cuffed versus uncuffed endotracheal tubes for neonates
Background: newborn babies rarely need a tube placed in the windpipe; however, this may occur before a procedure or to help with breathing. The tube may or may not have a cuff. The standard of care in newborn babies is a tube without a cuff. Cuffed tubes are used more frequently in older babies and children to reduce leaks of gas around the tube, the risk of aspiration (breathing food, saliva, or stomach contents into the airways or lungs), the need to change the tube, or the tube coming out. 
Review question: in this review, we evaluated the evidence for or against using a cuffed tube in newborn babies. 
Study characteristics: we collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer the review question and found one study enrolling 76 babies, of whom 69 met eligibility for this review. This review is up‐to‐date as of 20 August 2021. 
Key results: there is not enough evidence for or against tubes with a cuff to prevent airway problems. Newborn babies who have a tube with a cuff may require less frequent replacement of the tube for any reason and less frequent replacement of the tube to find the correct size than babies who had a tube without a cuff. 
Reliability of the evidence: we judged the reliability of the evidence to be very low. This is because only a few babies were in a single trial and there was possible bias. There is one ongoing trial. We classified two studies as awaiting classification because outcome data were not reported separately for newborns and older infants.

10.1002-14651858.CD006672.pub3,"Perineal techniques during the second stage of labour for reducing perineal trauma
What is the issue? 
Vaginal births are often associated with some form of trauma to the genital tract, and tears that affect the anal sphincter or mucosa (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears) can cause serious problems. Perineal trauma can occur spontaneously or result from a surgical incision (episiotomy). Different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head, and allow the perineum to stretch slowly to prevent injury. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. The objective of this updated review was to assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence of perineal trauma. This is an update of a review that was published in 2011. 
Why is this important? 
Trauma to the perineum can cause pain and other problems for women after the birth. The damage is described as first‐, second‐, third‐ and fourth‐degree tears – first‐degree tears being the least damage and fourth‐degree tears being the most. Third‐ and fourth‐degree tears, affect the anal sphincter or mucosa, thus causing the most problems. Reducing the use of episiotomies will reduce trauma to the perineum. Also, different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. It is important to know if these do indeed reduce trauma and pain for women. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies in September 2016. Twenty two trials were eligible for inclusion in this updated review but only twenty studies (involving 15,181 women), contributed results to the review. The participants in the studies were women without medical complications who were expecting a vaginal birth. The studies varied in their risk of bias, and the quality of the studies was very low to moderate. 
Hands off (or poised) compared to hands on  
Using 'hands off' the perineum resulted in fewer women having an episiotomy (low‐quality evidence), but made no difference to numbers of women with no tears (moderate‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), or third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There were considerable unexplained differences in results between the four studies. None of the studies provided data on the number of tears requiring suturing. 
Warm compresses versus control (hands off or no warm compress)  
Fewer women in the warm‐compress group experienced third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). A warm compress did not affect numbers of women with intact perineum (moderate‐quality evidence), tears requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compresses increase or reduce the incidence of first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). 
Massage versus control (hands off or routine care)  
There were more women with an intact perineum in the perineal massage group (low‐quality evidence), and fewer women with third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). Massage did not appear to make a difference to women with perineal trauma requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (very low‐quality evidence). 
Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care  
One small study found that women who had Ritgen's manoeuvre had fewer first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), but more second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in terms of the number of third‐ or fourth‐degree tears, or episiotomies (both low‐quality evidence). 
What does this mean? 
We found that massage and warm compresses may reduce serious perineal trauma (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears). Hands‐off techniques may reduce the number of episiotomies but it was not clear that these techniques had a beneficial effect on other perineal trauma. There remains uncertainty about the value of other techniques to reduce damage to the perineum during childbirth. 
More research is necessary, to evaluate different perineal techniques and to answer questions about how to minimise perineal trauma. There is insufficient evidence on women's experiences and views (only one included study collected information on this). It is important for future research to ascertain whether these interventions are acceptable to women.

Do warm cloths, massage, or hands-off care during birth help prevent tears?

Rationale
Birth by the vagina can cause tears in the skin and muscle near the vagina. This area is the perineum. It sits between the vagina and the anus. Tears can cause pain, stress, and slow healing after birth.

Some tears are small. Some are deep. Deep tears can harm the ring muscle that holds in stool. This ring muscle sits at the back passage. Deep tears can lead to long term bowel problems. This is why we want to lower tears.

Midwives use many simple steps to try to help. These steps can slow the baby’s head as it comes out. They may help the skin and muscle to stretch. Common steps include warm cloths, massage, and how the hands guide the head. Some midwives use a cut called an episiotomy. This is a cut to make the opening larger. But cuts can still harm. So fewer cuts may mean less harm.

We need to know which steps help most. We also need to know if they are safe and feel okay to women. This review looked for clear proof on these steps.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team looked for studies in September 2016. They found 22 trials that fit the plan. Twenty trials gave results. These 20 trials had 15,181 women.

All the women planned a vaginal birth. They did not have major health problems. The care teams tried one of several steps during the push stage of labor. This stage is when the baby’s head comes out.

The review looked at:
- Hands-off (also called “poised”) versus hands-on care. Hands-off means the care team does not hold the head or the perineum as the head comes.
- Warm cloths on the perineum versus no warm cloths.
- Perineal massage during the push stage versus no massage or routine care.
- Ritgen’s move versus standard care. Ritgen’s is a special hand move to guide the head slowly.

The main results they checked were types of tears and if a woman had a cut (episiotomy). They also checked if the perineum stayed intact, and if tears needed stitches. Each woman was part of the study only during birth and soon after, when the team could see the tears.

Results
What did hands-off care do?
- Fewer women had a cut (episiotomy) with hands-off care.
- Hands-off care did not change the number of women with no tears.
- It did not change the number of first degree tears. These are small skin tears.
- It did not change the number of second degree tears. These tears go into the muscle.
- It did not change the number of deep tears. Deep tears reach the ring muscle or lining of the back passage.
- The trials did not all agree. The results were not the same in each trial.

What did warm cloths do?
- Warm cloths cut the risk of deep tears. This means fewer third and fourth degree tears.
- Warm cloths did not change how often the perineum stayed intact.
- Warm cloths did not change how often women had a cut (episiotomy).
- Warm cloths did not change how often second degree tears or tears that need stitches happened.
- We do not know if warm cloths change first degree tears.

What did massage do?
- Massage led to more women with no tears at all.
- Massage also cut the risk of deep tears.
- Massage did not change how often women had cuts (episiotomies).
- Massage did not change how often first or second degree tears or tears needing stitches happened.

What did Ritgen’s move do?
- One small trial looked at this move.
- It found fewer first degree tears.
- It found more second degree tears.
- It found no change in deep tears or cuts (episiotomies).

How sure are these results?
- The quality of the trials ranged from very low to moderate.
- For warm cloths and massage and deep tears, we are somewhat sure.
- For hands-off care and cuts, we are less sure, and trials gave mixed results.
- For many other results, we are not very sure. New studies may change what we think.

What does this mean for you?
- Warm cloths on the perineum may help prevent deep tears.
- Massage during the push stage may also help prevent deep tears. It may also help some women have no tears at all.
- Hands-off care may mean fewer cuts. But it may not change other tears.
- Ritgen’s move needs more study. We have only one small trial.

Why is this review key for birth care?
Deep tears can lead to pain and bowel issues. Steps that lower deep tears can help many women. Warm cloths and massage are simple. They cost little. Care teams can use them in most places. They may help protect the perineum.

What do the researchers suggest next?
We need more high quality trials. We need to know which step works best, and in which setting. We also need to ask women how these steps feel to them. Only one trial asked women about their views. Care should match what works and what women want.

Bottom line
Warm cloths and massage during pushing may lower deep tears. Hands-off care may lower cuts. Other methods need more study. Talk with your care team about these options as you plan your birth.","Perineal techniques during the second stage of labour for reducing perineal trauma

10.1002-14651858.CD013168.pub2,"Background
Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is used to treat aorto‐iliac and isolated iliac aneurysms in selected patients, and prospective studies have shown advantages compared with open surgical repair, mainly in the first years of follow‐up. Although this technique produces good results, anatomic issues (such as common iliac artery ectasia or an aneurysm that involves the iliac bifurcation) can make EVAR more complex and challenging and can lead to an inadequate distal seal zone for the stent‐graft. Inadequate distal fixation in the common iliac arteries can lead to a type Ib endoleak. To avoid this complication, one of the most commonly used techniques is unilateral or bilateral internal iliac artery occlusion and extension of the iliac limb stent‐graft to the external iliac arteries with or without embolisation of the internal iliac artery. However, this occlusion is not without harm and is associated with ischaemic complications in the pelvic territory such as buttock claudication, sexual dysfunction, ischaemic colitis, gluteal necrosis, and spinal cord injury. 
New endovascular devices and alternative techniques such as iliac branch devices and the sandwich technique have been described to maintain pelvic perfusion and decrease complications, achieving revascularisation of the internal iliac arteries in patients not suitable for an adequate seal zone in the common iliac arteries. These approaches may also preserve the quality of life of treated individuals and may decrease other serious complications including spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis, thereby decreasing the morbidity and mortality of EVAR. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion during endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialists searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 28 August 2019. The review authors searched Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) and the Indice Bibliográfico Español de Ciencias de la Salud (IBECS) on 28 August 2019 and contacted specialists in the field and manufacturers to identify relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared internal iliac artery revascularisation with internal iliac artery occlusion for patients undergoing endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed identified studies for potential inclusion in the review. We used standard methodological procedures in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions. 
Main results
We identified no RCTs that met the inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
We found no RCTs that compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation. High‐quality studies that evaluate the best strategy for managing endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms with inadequate distal seal zones in the common iliac artery are needed.

Keeping pelvic blood flow safe during stent repair of artery bulges

Rationale
An aneurysm is a weak, bulged spot in an artery. The aorta and iliac arteries run through the belly and pelvis. A bulge here can tear and bleed a lot. That can cause death.

Doctors can fix some bulges with a stent graft. This is a small tube of metal and fabric. They place it inside the artery through a blood vessel. This is called endovascular repair, or EVAR. It can help some people heal faster than open surgery.

EVAR needs a snug seal at both ends of the stent graft. The far end sits in the iliac arteries. Sometimes that area is wide or shaped in a hard way. The seal may not hold well there. When the seal fails, blood can leak around the graft. Doctors call this a type Ib endoleak.

To avoid a leak, doctors may block the internal iliac artery. This is a branch that brings blood to the pelvis and buttocks. They may then place the graft into the external iliac artery. Blocking that branch can cause harm. People may have pain in the buttock when they walk. They may have sex problems. The bowel can get low blood flow. In rare cases, tissue in the buttock can die. The spinal cord can also be at risk.

New tools aim to keep blood flowing to the pelvis. One way is to reconnect the internal iliac artery. Doctors call this revascularisation. Some use special side-branch stents. Others use a “sandwich” setup with two stents. These may lower harm and keep life quality. But we need strong proof to guide care.

This study asked a clear question. Is it better to keep pelvic blood flow or to block it during EVAR? The goal was to look at the best type of study to answer this. That type is a randomised controlled trial, or RCT. In an RCT, people get one of two care plans by chance. That helps us see which plan works best and is safest.

Trial Design
This was not a single clinic trial. It was a careful review of trials. A team used Cochrane methods. Cochrane is a group that rates health studies. The team set strict rules first. They would include only RCTs. The trials had to compare two ways. One way was to keep blood flow in the internal iliac artery. The other way was to block that artery. All people in those trials would have an aorto-iliac aneurysm. Or they would have an iliac aneurysm at the split of the artery.

The team looked for trials in many big study lists. They searched up to 28 August 2019. They also asked experts and device makers. Two people checked each study to see if it fit. They used standard Cochrane steps to cut bias. They planned to look at key results. These included leaks, harm, death, and life quality.

The plan did not set limits on age or sex. It did not set a time that people would be in a trial. That would depend on each trial. But this review did not find any trials to include. So there were no people in this review. There is no set time a person would be in a study here.

Results
The team found no RCTs that met their rules. There were zero trials that compared keeping pelvic blood flow with blocking it during EVAR. This means we do not have top quality proof yet. We cannot say which plan is better in these cases.

Why does this matter? The choice can affect how you feel and live. Blocking flow to the pelvis can cause pain with walking. It can cause sex problems. It can harm the bowel. It can hurt the buttock or spinal cord. Keeping flow may lower these harms. New devices try to do that. But we need strong trials to prove it.

What should patients know now? Your artery shape may limit your choices. Your doctor may advise one plan or the other. That advice is based on your case and on lower level studies. It also depends on skill and tools in your hospital. You can ask how each choice may help or harm you. You can ask about the risk of leaks. You can ask about pain, sex life, and bowel health. You can ask what care you will need after the fix.

What is next for research? We need well run RCTs. These trials should test both care plans head to head. They should look at leaks, harm, death, and life quality. They should follow people long term. They should tell us who does best with each plan. This will help doctors and patients choose well.

What did the authors conclude? They found no RCTs to answer the main question. So they could not say which plan is best. They called for high quality trials to guide care. Until then, doctors must use the best mix of skill, tools, and current knowledge. Patients and doctors should decide together. The choice should fit the person, the artery shape, and the risks and goals.","Internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms 
Background 
An aorto‐iliac aneurysm is a dilatation (aneurysm) of the aorta, the main large blood vessel in the body, which carries blood out from the heart to all organs and iliac arteries (distal branches of the aorta). The aneurysm can grow and burst (rupture), which leads to severe bleeding and is frequently fatal; an estimated 15,000 deaths occur each year from ruptured aortic abdominal aneurysms in the USA alone. To avoid this complication, the aorto‐iliac aneurysm should be repaired when the maximum diameter of the aorta reaches 5 cm to 5.5 cm, or when the maximum diameter of the common iliac arteries reaches 3 cm to 4 cm. 
Endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms is one approach that is used to manage this condition: a tube (stent‐graft) is placed inside the aorto‐iliac aneurysm, so that blood flows through the stent‐graft and no longer into the aneurysm, excluding it from the circulation. To achieve a successful deployment of the stent‐graft, a good seal zone (fixation zone) is needed in the aorta (proximal) and in the common iliac arteries (distal). However, in 40% of patients, the distal seal zone in the common iliac arteries is inadequate. In these cases, most commonly the stent‐graft is extended to the external iliac artery and the internal iliac artery is blocked (occluded). However, this obstruction (occlusion) is not without harms: the internal iliac artery supplies blood to the pelvic organs (rectum, bladder, and reproductive organs) and the pelvic muscles, and occlusion is associated with complications in the pelvic area such as buttock claudication (cramping pain in the buttock during exercise), sexual dysfunction, and spinal cord injury. 
New endovascular devices and techniques such as iliac branch devices have emerged to maintain blood flow into the internal iliac artery. These special stent‐grafts position the distal seal zone within the external iliac artery, and a side branch of the graft allows for revascularisation of the internal iliac artery, while excluding the aneurysm from the circulation, promoting an adequate distal seal zone, and maintaining pelvic circulation. This may also preserve the quality of life of treated individuals and may reduce serious complications including spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis. 
This review aimed to assess the effects of internal iliac artery revascularisation compared with internal iliac artery occlusion during endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We searched for evidence that directly compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. Our searches up to 28 August 2019 did not identify any randomised controlled trials (clinical studies in which people are randomly (by chance alone) put into one of several intervention groups) that met our criteria. Studies are needed to help vascular and endovascular surgeons choose the best option for endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms with an inadequate distal fixation zone. 
Conclusion 
We found no RCTs that compared internal iliac artery revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular treatment of aorto‐iliac aneurysms. High‐quality studies that evaluate the best strategy for managing the endovascular repair of aorto‐iliac aneurysms with inadequate distal seal zones in the common iliac artery are needed.

10.1002-14651858.CD007287.pub4,"Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer
Background  Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancers. Standard therapy consists of surgery and chemotherapy. Responses to chemotherapy are generally good; however, most women experience relapse, for which no curative treatment is available. The presence of certain immune cells in tumours is associated with longer survival. This suggests that stimulation of anti‐tumour immune responses (i.e. immunotherapy) might be a useful approach for improving outcomes among women with ovarian cancer. 
Review question This review evaluated the feasibility of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce anti‐tumour immune responses through administration of a tumour antigen ‐ a molecule that is expressed by tumour cells and is hardly expressed by healthy cells. Reviewers collected information on clinical outcomes, immunological responses, and side effects. 
Main findings We identified 67 studies, which included 3632 women with ovarian cancer and were published between 1966 and 2017. The most frequently described strategy was administration of antibodies targeting the tumour antigen CA‐125 (2347 participants in 17 studies). Most of these studies primarily evaluated safety and immunological responses. Severe flu‐like and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 7% to 30% of participants. Researchers frequently detected antibodies and immune cells recognising the tumour antigen CA‐125, albeit response rates varied between studies. Despite these promising immunological responses, four large studies reported no survival advantage for participants treated with CA‐125‐directed antibody over those given placebo. 
For strategies not relying on antibody administration, similar conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Overall, study authors report that treatment was well tolerated and inflammatory side effects at the injection site were most frequently observed. Researchers observed responses of the immune system for most strategies studied, but the clinical benefit of these strategies remains to be evaluated in large trials. 
Certainty of the evidence and conclusions Because no high‐certainty evidence of clinical benefit is currently available, antibody therapy targeting CA‐125 should not be incorporated into standard treatment in its current form. 
Based on lack of uniformity in included studies, we strongly advocate universal adoption of response definitions, guidelines for adverse events reporting, and directives for trial conduct and reporting. Furthermore, results from ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are awaited, and further RCTs should be conducted.

Can training the immune system help women with ovarian cancer?

Rationale
Ovarian cancer starts in a woman’s ovaries. It is a hard cancer to treat. Doctors use surgery and chemo as care. Chemo often works at first.

But the cancer often comes back. When it comes back, no cure is known. This is a big burden for women and families. New care is needed.

Our body has a defense force called the immune system. It can find and kill germs. It can also see some cancer cells. Tumors that have more of these defense cells link with longer life.

This led doctors to try a new idea. It is called immune therapy. The plan is to train the immune system to better see the cancer. One way is to use a cancer “tag,” also called an antigen.

An antigen is a small part on a cancer cell. It acts like a flag. Healthy cells have little or none of that flag. Doctors can teach the immune system to spot that flag.

One common flag on ovarian cancer cells is CA-125. Some drugs use proteins called antibodies that stick to CA-125. Antibodies act like guided hooks. They can help the immune system find the cancer.

Trial Design
This was not one trial. It was a review of many studies. The team looked at 67 studies done from 1966 to 2017. These studies enrolled 3,632 women with ovarian cancer.

Most studies tested antibodies that target CA-125. Seventeen studies used this plan. Those 17 studies had 2,347 women. Many of these studies looked at safety and signs that the immune system woke up.

Some studies used other plans. These did not give antibodies. They used other ways to show the cancer flag to the immune system. The goal was the same: train the body to fight the cancer.

The abstract did not report the ages of the women. It also did not say how long each woman stayed in a study. The review included women with ovarian cancer only. All were female.

Results
Many studies saw signs that the immune system did respond. Doctors often found new antibodies in the blood. They also saw immune cells that could spot CA-125. But the size of these responses was not the same in all studies.

Side effects did occur. With CA-125 antibody drugs, severe flu-like or stomach and bowel problems happened in about 7 to 30 in 100 women. Flu-like means fever, aches, and chills. Gut problems can include pain, loose stools, or nausea.

For the plans that did not use antibodies, most side effects were mild. Redness, heat, or swelling at the shot site was common. Doctors said the care was, over all, well tolerated. Still, careful watch is needed.

Did women live longer with these drugs? Four large studies gave a clear answer for CA-125 antibody drugs. In those studies, women who got the CA-125 antibody did not live longer than women who got a placebo. A placebo is a dummy shot with no active drug.

So, even with immune system signs, the main goal was not met. The drugs helped the immune system wake up. But they did not help women live longer in those large studies. This is key for patients and families.

What about the other plans that did not use antibodies? The early signs look hopeful. Many showed an immune response. But we do not yet know if they help women live longer or feel better. We need large, fair tests to find out.

What do the results mean now? Based on what we know, CA-125 antibody drugs should not be part of routine care. Not yet. Surgery and chemo stay the standard care. Immune therapy for this cancer is still in study.

What should come next? Future trials need clear, shared rules. These include how to define a response, how to report bad side effects, and how to run and report a trial. This helps compare results and protect patients.

We also need more large, fair trials. These are called randomized controlled trials. In these trials, chance decides who gets which care. This helps make sure the groups are alike.

In time, we may learn who might benefit most. We may also learn the best dose, timing, and mix with other care. For now, the promise is real, but not proven.

In short, training the immune system can spark a response. But proof of clear patient benefit is missing so far. More and better trials are under way. Patients should ask their care team if a trial is right for them.","Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer
Background  Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancers. Standard therapy consists of surgery and chemotherapy. Responses to chemotherapy are generally good; however, most women experience relapse, for which no curative treatment is available. The presence of certain immune cells in tumours is associated with longer survival. This suggests that stimulation of anti‐tumour immune responses (i.e. immunotherapy) might be a useful approach for improving outcomes among women with ovarian cancer. 
Review question This review evaluated the feasibility of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce anti‐tumour immune responses through administration of a tumour antigen ‐ a molecule that is expressed by tumour cells and is hardly expressed by healthy cells. Reviewers collected information on clinical outcomes, immunological responses, and side effects. 
Main findings We identified 67 studies, which included 3632 women with ovarian cancer and were published between 1966 and 2017. The most frequently described strategy was administration of antibodies targeting the tumour antigen CA‐125 (2347 participants in 17 studies). Most of these studies primarily evaluated safety and immunological responses. Severe flu‐like and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 7% to 30% of participants. Researchers frequently detected antibodies and immune cells recognising the tumour antigen CA‐125, albeit response rates varied between studies. Despite these promising immunological responses, four large studies reported no survival advantage for participants treated with CA‐125‐directed antibody over those given placebo. 
For strategies not relying on antibody administration, similar conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Overall, study authors report that treatment was well tolerated and inflammatory side effects at the injection site were most frequently observed. Researchers observed responses of the immune system for most strategies studied, but the clinical benefit of these strategies remains to be evaluated in large trials. 
Certainty of the evidence and conclusions Because no high‐certainty evidence of clinical benefit is currently available, antibody therapy targeting CA‐125 should not be incorporated into standard treatment in its current form. 
Based on lack of uniformity in included studies, we strongly advocate universal adoption of response definitions, guidelines for adverse events reporting, and directives for trial conduct and reporting. Furthermore, results from ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are awaited, and further RCTs should be conducted.

Hospital‐acquired pneumonia is one of the most common hospital‐acquired infections in children worldwide. Most of our understanding of hospital‐acquired pneumonia in children is derived from adult studies. To our knowledge, no systematic review with meta‐analysis has assessed the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens in neonates and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia. 
Objectives
To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in neonates and children. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trial registers to February 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials comparing one antibiotic regimen with any other antibiotic regimen for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in neonates and children. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality and serious adverse events; our secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, pneumonia‐related mortality, non‐serious adverse events, and treatment failure. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow‐up. 
Main results
We included four randomised clinical trials (84 participants). We assessed all trials as having high risk of bias. 
We did not conduct any meta‐analyses, as the included trials did not compare similar antibiotic regimens. 
Each of the four trials assessed a different comparison, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Only one trial reported our primary outcomes of all‐cause mortality and serious adverse events. Three trials reported our secondary outcome of treatment failure. Two trials primarily included community‐acquired pneumonia and hospitalised children with bacterial infections, hence the children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia constituted subgroups of the total sample sizes. 
Where outcomes were reported, the certainty of the evidence was very low for each of the comparisons. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
None of the included trials assessed health‐related quality of life, pneumonia‐related mortality, or non‐serious adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions
The relative beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the very low certainty of the available evidence. The current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. Randomised clinical trials assessing different antibiotic regimens for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in children and neonates are warranted.

Which antibiotics work best for hospital lung infections in children?

Rationale
Hospital-acquired pneumonia is a lung infection. It starts after a child is in the hospital. It is common in children around the world. It can make a child very unwell.

Doctors treat this infection with antibiotics. Antibiotics kill, or stop, the germs that cause the infection. Many antibiotics exist. Doctors want to know which one helps most and is safest.

Most past work comes from studies in adults. But children are not small adults. Their bodies handle drugs in different ways. So, we need studies in children.

This study asked a clear question. Do any antibiotic plans work better for these hospital lung infections in children and newborns? The team thought that one plan might help more or have fewer harms.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team looked for trials in many large medical databases. They also checked trial lists and talked to study authors. The search went up to February 2021.

They included only randomised trials. In these trials, children got one drug or another by chance. The children were newborns or older children in the hospital. They had a lung infection that began in the hospital.

The team planned what to look for before they started. Main results were death from any cause and serious side effects. Other results were life quality, death from pneumonia, mild side effects, and treatment failure. Treatment failure means the infection did not get better with the drug.

Three people picked the trials and took the data. They also judged how each trial was done. They used a clear system to rate how sure we can be about the results. This system is called GRADE. A low GRADE means we are not very sure.

The team used the longest follow-up time that each trial reported. The time that each child stayed in a trial was not the same. Some trials did not report that time in detail.

Results
The review found four trials. These trials had 84 children in total. Each trial was small. The team found problems in how all four trials were run.

Because of this, the results may not be reliable. The trials did not test the same drug pairs. So, the team could not add the results together.

Each trial compared different antibiotics. One compared cefepime to ceftazidime. One compared linezolid to vancomycin. One compared meropenem to cefotaxime. One compared ceftobiprole to a cephalosporin. These are all types of antibiotics.

Only one trial reported the main results of death and serious side effects. Three trials reported treatment failure. Two trials mainly studied other infections. In those, only some of the children had hospital-acquired pneumonia. Those children were a small part of the whole trial group.

No trial looked at life quality. No trial reported death due to pneumonia. No trial recorded mild side effects. This means we lack key facts that matter to families.

Where trials did report results, we are very unsure about them. The team rated the evidence as very low. The small size and trial flaws lower our trust. The mixed drug pairs also make it hard to compare.

So, we cannot say which antibiotic works best. We also cannot say which one is safer. The review does not support one drug plan over another for these children.

What does this mean for children and families? For now, there is no clear best choice. Doctors may choose based on local germs, the child’s health, and drug access. But this review shows a big gap.

We need better trials in children and newborns. These trials should be large and well planned. They should compare drug plans that doctors use often. They should measure death, serious and mild side effects, life quality, and treatment failure. They should include only children with this hospital lung infection or report them clearly.

Until then, we must be careful when we use adult data for children. Children deserve proof that fits their needs. This review points the way to build that proof.

In summary, the key points are simple. Hospital-acquired pneumonia in children is common. We looked at four small trials with 84 children. The trials used different drug pairs and had flaws. We cannot tell which antibiotics help most or harm least. More and better trials are needed.","Antibiotics for hospital‐acquired pneumonia in newborns and children
Review question 
Which antibiotic regimen is safer and more effective in treating neonates (newborns) and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia? 
Background 
Hospital‐acquired pneumonia is an inflammation of the tissue of one or both lungs caused by an infection that occurs during a hospital stay (i.e. 48 hours or more after hospital admission). It is one of the most common hospital‐acquired infections in children worldwide, and is associated with a high death rate. Most of our understanding of hospital‐acquired pneumonia in children is drawn from adult studies. To our knowledge this is the first review with meta‐analysis that assesses the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens in newborns and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to February 2021.
Study characteristics 
We included four trials randomising 84 children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia to different antibiotic regimens. Three trials were multicentre trials from the USA, Latin America, Europe, and South Africa. The South African trial included one site in Malaysia. Each of the four included trials compared different antibiotic regimens, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Study funding sources 
Three trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Pharmacia Corp, and Basilea Pharmaceutica International Ltd.), indicating a possible risk of bias related to a vested interest risk. 
Key results 
Each of the four included trials compared different antibiotic regimens, as follows: cefepime versus ceftazidime; linezolid versus vancomycin; meropenem versus cefotaxime; and ceftobiprole versus cephalosporin. 
Only one trial reported our primary outcomes of death from all causes and serious adverse events (major complications). Three trials reported our secondary outcome of treatment failure. Two trials primarily included community‐acquired pneumonia and hospitalised children with bacterial infections, hence the children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia constituted only subgroups of the total study populations. 
Where outcomes were reported, the certainty of the evidence was very low for each of the comparisons. We were unable to draw any meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
None of the included trials assessed health‐related quality of life, pneumonia‐related death, or non‐serious adverse events (minor complications). 
Conclusions 
The available evidence does not suggest that one antibiotic regimen is safer and more effective than another in treating newborns and children with hospital‐acquired pneumonia. Further research is needed. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of evidence is very low. All four included trials had high risk of bias (i.e. the studies were designed in such a way that the results may have been skewed). In addition, the included trials involved few participants, which is likely to have led to inaccurate results.

Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease. People with asthma have inflammation of their airways that causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness and chest tightness, with or without a cough. Statins possess multiple therapeutic effects, including lowering lipid levels in the blood. Statins are reported to have a potential role as an adjunct treatment in asthma. However, comprehensive evidence of the benefits and harms of using statins is required to facilitate decision making. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of statins as an adjunct therapy for asthma in adults and children. 
Search methods
We searched for studies in the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid SP and Embase Ovid SP, from their inception dates We handsearched the proceedings of major respiratory conferences. We also searched clinical trials registries for completed, ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews to identify additional studies. 
The search is current to 7 February 2020.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel‐group design that assessed statins for at least 12 weeks' duration. We considered all participants with a clinical diagnosis of asthma to be eligible, regardless of age, sex, disease severity and previous or current treatment. We planned to include studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened and selected the studies, extracted outcome data and intervention characteristics from included studies, and assessed risk of bias according to standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We resolved any disagreement through discussion. 
Main results
We found only one trial involving a total of 60 people living with asthma. The trial compared the effect of atorvastatin with a placebo (dummy treatment containing lactose) in treating people with chronic asthma. The trial did not report data for the primary outcomes or adverse events. There was uncertainty about the relative effect on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in the atorvastatin group compared with the placebo group. The study did not report serious adverse effects for the interventions. The included study had internal discrepancies in its reported data. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence was of very low certainty, so we are unable to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of statins to treat asthma. High‐quality RCTs are needed to assess the effect of statins on people with asthma. Well‐designed multicentre trials with larger samples and longer duration of treatment are required, which assess outcomes such as adverse events, hospital utilisation and costs, to provide better quality evidence. Future studies that include subgroups of obese people with asthma are also required.

Can cholesterol pills help people with asthma?

Rationale
Asthma is a long-term lung disease. It can cause wheeze, tight chest, short breath, and cough. These flare-ups can be scary and can limit daily life. Many people still have symptoms, even with care.

Statins are pills that lower fat in the blood. Doctors use them to protect the heart. Statins may also calm swelling in the body. This could help the swollen airways seen in asthma.

Some early reports said statins might help asthma if added to usual care. But we do not know if they work or are safe for this use. We need clear proof to guide patients and doctors. This study looked for that proof.

Trial Design
This was a research review of past trials. The team searched many medical files and trial lists. They looked for work from the start of those files up to early 2020. They also checked meeting books and paper lists.

They planned to include only fair tests called “randomized trials.” In these tests, chance picks who gets which pill. The trials had to last at least 12 weeks. People in the trials had to have a doctor’s diagnosis of asthma. Adults and children could be in the trials. Any asthma level and any past treatment were okay.

The review found one trial. It had 60 people with long-term asthma. The trial compared atorvastatin with a dummy pill. A dummy pill looks the same but has no drug. People took the study pills along with their usual asthma care. The report did not state the age or sex mix of the people. The trial lasted at least 12 weeks.

Results
What did this trial measure? It did not report its main planned results. It did not give side effect data. It did report on lung tests. But the data were not clear enough to judge a true effect.

The lung tests included how much air you can blow out in one second. They also looked at how fast you can blow air out. These tests can show if airways are tight. The results did not show a clear gain with the statin pill. We cannot say if the statin helped, did not help, or harmed.

The trial did not report any serious harms. But it also did not give full side effect data. Some numbers in the report did not match each other. This lowers trust in the results.

As a whole, the evidence was very weak. It came from one small trial. It did not report key results. It had data problems. So, the review team could not say if statins help asthma. They also could not say if statins are safe for asthma.

What does this mean for people with asthma? Do not start or stop a statin for asthma based on this review. If you take a statin for your heart or blood fats, keep taking it as your doctor says. If you have questions, talk with your care team. They can help weigh your own risks and needs.

What does this mean for research? We need better trials. Future trials should be larger and last longer. They should take place at more than one site. They should measure things that matter to patients. These include side effects, lung attacks, and trips to the hospital. They should also look at costs of care. Trials should report all data in a clear and full way.

It may help to study groups within asthma. One group is people with asthma who also live with high body weight. Some reports suggest statins might help more in this group. We do not yet know. Good trials can test this in a fair way.

In sum, this review asked a simple question. Do statins, added to usual care, help asthma? Right now, we do not know. One small trial is not enough to guide care. Better studies can give the answers patients need.","Statins for asthma
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of statins in people with asthma.
Background 
Asthma is a common chronic (persistent) airway disease. Asthma is caused by inflammation in the lungs and bronchoconstriction (tightening of the small tubes in the lungs in response to a trigger such as pollen or cold air). Inflammation and bronchoconstriction cause airflow obstruction (narrowing and blockage). People with asthma experience recurrent attacks of wheezing, difficultly in breathing, and chest tightness, with or without a cough. 
Statins are anti‐inflammatory medicines. We wanted to review the evidence for statins because the theory is that their anti‐inflammatory properties will help people with asthma. We wanted to discover whether using statin therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care alone or different types of statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin). 
Study characteristics 
We found only one trial that assessed atorvastatin (a type of statin drug) and placebo (dummy treatment) in 60 adults with asthma over a period of 12 weeks. These people had chronic asthma (persistent airway disease) when they started treatment. 
Key results 
We found that the statin (atorvastatin) did not result in any clear improvement in lung function in people with asthma, but may be better in asthma control than the dummy drug. However, because there is only one trial, we cannot draw firm conclusions. 
The trial did not report on adverse effects or severe adverse effects (harms). We are uncertain whether statins may  have beneficial effects on relieving asthma or whether they may increase the risk of adverse events or non‐serious adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low certainty, so we cannot draw firm conclusions about whether statins are helpful and safe to be used by people with asthma. 
The evidence is current to 7 February 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD014877.pub2,"Rapid molecular tests for tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance: the views and experiences of people who are tested and healthcare providers 
What is the aim of this review? 
We aimed to understand the experiences and opinions of people using rapid automated tests that identify tuberculosis and resistance to tuberculosis drugs (molecular diagnostic tests). Users include people who might have tuberculosis and their families or caregivers, doctors, nurses, laboratory staff, and managers of services or programmes. 
What was studied in this review?  
Rapid molecular diagnostic tests were designed to make diagnosis easier and faster for people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, because they do not require a well‐equipped laboratory, but can be done in clinics closer to where people live. Since these tests can also suggest whether an individual suffers from drug‐resistant tuberculosis (including multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis (MDR‐TB)), the right treatment can be started earlier. We collected and analysed all relevant studies and found 32 studies conducted in areas where tuberculosis is common in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
MDR‐TB is tuberculosis caused by resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective first‐line drugs used to treat tuberculosis.  
This qualitative evidence synthesis links to another Cochrane Review that examines the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid molecular test for tuberculosis drug resistance. Yet, diagnostic tests only have an impact on health if they are put to use in a correct and timely manner. Accuracy studies do not reveal what users think of or how they experience the test in question. We need to understand the perspectives and experiences of all users. Otherwise, we risk these tests not fitting settings where they are to be used or not being accessible for those in need. 
What are the main findings? 
People with tuberculosis value knowing what is wrong with them. People valued having an accurate diagnosis, avoiding delays in being diagnosed, having accessible testing facilities, and keeping cost low. Similarly, healthcare providers value having accurate tests that give them confidence in the diagnosis, rapid results, and keeping cost low, being able to use different specimens (such as sputum and stool)  and receiving information about drug resistance as part of the test results. Laboratory personnel appreciated that laboratory work was made easier and that staff was more satisfied thanks to rapid molecular diagnostic tests. 
Our review also identified several challenges to realizing these values. Some people with tuberculosis and some healthcare providers were reluctant to use rapid molecular diagnostic tests because of fears of testing positive, concerns of stigma or discredit in the community, or expenses related to the testing. Additional support is required to overcome these barriers that are common to other approaches to testing for tuberculosis. Other challenges that led to delays and underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests were health system inefficiencies; poor quality of specimens; difficulty in transporting specimens; lack of sufficient resources such as staff or equipment; increased workload for providers; inefficiencies in integrating the test into routines at clinics; the complicated or lengthy steps involved in obtaining a tuberculosis diagnosis; clinicians relying too much on the test result while neglecting their own experience with diagnosing tuberculosis; and processes of implementing the test in national programmes that lacked data about real‐life situations and did not include all relevant stakeholders such as local decision‐makers, providers or people seeking a diagnosis. 
Lastly, people expressed concerns about unsustainable funding, maintenance requirements of the tests, lengthy delays in diagnosis, underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests, lack of tuberculosis diagnostic facilities in local communities, conflicts of interest between donors and people who utilize the tests, and too many restrictions on who was allowed to access the test. These concerns hampered access to prompt and accurate testing and treatment. This was particularly the case for vulnerable people, such as children, people with MDR‐TB, or those with limited ability to pay. 
Overall, these challenges risk undoing the added value of rapid molecular diagnostic tests. They risk leading to less frequent use of these tests. Implementation of new diagnostic tests, like those considered in this review, will need to tackle the challenges identified in this review including weak infrastructure and systems, as well as insufficient data about real‐life situations before and during implementation in order to ensure the tests are accessible for those in need. 
How up to date is this review? 
We included studies published between 1 January 2007 and 20 October 2021. We limited all searches to 2007 onward because the development of Xpert MTB/RIF, the first rapid molecular diagnostic test in this review, was completed in 2009.

What people think about fast tests that find TB and if TB drugs will work

2. Rationale
Tuberculosis, or TB, is a lung disease. It can cause cough, fever, and weight loss. It can be deadly if people do not get care in time.

Many people wait a long time for a TB test result. Travel and test fees can be hard, too. Some tests need big labs that are far from home.

Fast TB tests can help. These tests look for TB germs. They can also show if key TB drugs will work. When drugs do not work, it is called drug‑resistant TB. MDR‑TB means the germs resist two main drugs. These drugs are rifampicin and isoniazid.

Tests only help when people can use them in real life. We need to know what users think. We need to know what gets in the way. This review asks: Do people trust these tests? Are they easy to get? Do they fit clinic work? These answers can guide better TB care.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team did not run a new trial. They read and combined many reports.

They looked at 32 studies. The studies took place in places where TB is common. Most were in countries with fewer resources. The team searched for studies from 2007 to late 2021. A key fast test, called Xpert MTB/RIF, was ready in 2009.

The studies asked many kinds of users. These were people with TB signs, their kin or care givers, nurses, doctors, lab staff, and clinic or program leads. The studies asked about views and daily use of the tests. People in this review did not join a new study. So, there was no set time in a study for them.

Fast TB tests can be done near home. They do not need a big lab. Some tests can use sputum. Sputum is thick mucus from deep in the lungs. Some can also use stool.

4. Results
People with TB signs want to know what is wrong soon. They liked fast test results. They liked tests that are close to home. They liked low or no cost. They liked tests that are right the first time.

Health workers liked fast and clear answers. They said it helped them treat with more trust. They liked when the test showed if drugs would work. They liked tests that could use sputum or stool. This helped with kids and others who cannot make sputum.

Lab staff said the work got easier. They felt more joy at work. They said the fast tests helped the whole team.

But there were many roadblocks. Some people feared a positive test. They feared shame or blame from others. We call this stigma. Some feared test costs. These fears kept people away from care.

Some clinics had slow or weak systems. Samples were poor or got lost in travel. Staff and tools were not enough. Workload went up. The test did not fit the clinic flow in some sites. The steps to get a TB answer were long and hard.

Some doctors leaned only on the test. They paid less attention to signs and exam. This could delay care when tests were not clear.

Some plans to add the test were not based on real life. The plans did not ask local leaders, staff, or patients. This led to rules that did not fit the place. It also led to test underuse.

Money for tests was not always safe or sure. Machines need upkeep and parts. When funds or parts ran out, tests stopped. Long waits then came back. Some places had no local test site. People had to travel far.

Some groups gave money but set strict rules on who can test. These rules could block people in need. At times, the goals of funders did not match user needs. This also got in the way.

These harms were worst for people at high risk. This includes kids, people with MDR‑TB, and people with little money. For them, any delay can be grave.

What do these results mean? Fast TB tests can help a lot. They can cut the wait. They can guide the right drugs fast. Many users like them and trust them. But weak systems can erase these gains.

To make these tests help more people, we need to fix the basics. Clinics need enough staff and tools. Sites need a plan to move samples. Rules should be clear and simple. Money for tests and upkeep must be steady. People who use the tests must help shape the plans. This means patients, staff, and local leaders.

This review brings real‑world voices to the table. It shows what works and what does not. It can guide better TB care in many places. The review is up to date through October 20, 2021.","Rapid molecular tests for tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance: the views and experiences of people who are tested and healthcare providers

Other challenges that led to delays and underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests were health system inefficiencies; poor quality of specimens; difficulty in transporting specimens; lack of sufficient resources such as staff or equipment; increased workload for providers; inefficiencies in integrating the test into routines at clinics; the complicated or lengthy steps involved in obtaining a tuberculosis diagnosis; clinicians relying too much on the test result while neglecting their own experience with diagnosing tuberculosis; and processes of implementing the test in national programmes that lacked data about real‐life situations and did not include all relevant stakeholders such as local decision‐makers, providers or people seeking a diagnosis. 
Lastly, people expressed concerns about unsustainable funding, maintenance requirements of the tests, lengthy delays in diagnosis, underuse of rapid molecular diagnostic tests, lack of tuberculosis diagnostic facilities in local communities, conflicts of interest between donors and people who utilize the tests, and too many restrictions on who was allowed to access the test. These concerns hampered access to prompt and accurate testing and treatment. This was particularly the case for vulnerable people, such as children, people with MDR‐TB, or those with limited ability to pay. 
Overall, these challenges risk undoing the added value of rapid molecular diagnostic tests. They risk leading to less frequent use of these tests. Implementation of new diagnostic tests, like those considered in this review, will need to tackle the challenges identified in this review including weak infrastructure and systems, as well as insufficient data about real‐life situations before and during implementation in order to ensure the tests are accessible for those in need. 
How up to date is this review? 
We included studies published between 1 January 2007 and 20 October 2021. We limited all searches to 2007 onward because the development of Xpert MTB/RIF, the first rapid molecular diagnostic test in this review, was completed in 2009.

Ocrelizumab is a humanised anti‐CD20 monoclonal antibody developed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017 for using in adults with relapsing‐remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Ocrelizumab is the only disease‐modifying therapy (DMT) approved for PPMS. In November 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) also approved ocrelizumab as the first drug for people with early PPMS. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the benefits, harms, and tolerability of ocrelizumab in people with MS. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits, harms, and tolerability of ocrelizumab in people with RRMS and PPMS. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and two trials registers on 8 October 2021. We screened reference lists, contacted experts, and contacted the main authors of studies. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults diagnosed with RRMS or PPMS according to the McDonald criteria, comparing ocrelizumab alone or associated with other medications, at the approved dose of 600 mg every 24 weeks for any duration, versus placebo or any other active drug therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
Four RCTs met our selection criteria. The overall population included 2551 participants; 1370 treated with ocrelizumab 600 mg and 1181 controls. Among the controls, 298 participants received placebo and 883 received interferon beta‐1a. The treatment duration was 24 weeks in one study, 96 weeks in two studies, and at least 120 weeks in one study. One study was at high risk of allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel; all four studies were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. 
For RRMS, compared with interferon beta‐1a, ocrelizumab was associated with: 1. lower relapse rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.73; 2 studies, 1656 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); 2. a lower number of participants with disability progression (hazard ratio (HR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.84; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 3. little to no difference in the number of participants with any adverse event (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; 2 studies, 1651 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); 4. little to no difference in the number of participants with any serious adverse event (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.11; 2 studies, 1651 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 5. a lower number of participants experiencing treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.91; 2 studies, 1651 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 6. a lower number of participants with gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.35; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 7. a lower number of participants with new or enlarging T2‐hyperintense lesions on MRI (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.69; 2 studies, 1656 participants; low‐certainty evidence) at 96 weeks. 
For PPMS, compared with placebo, ocrelizumab was associated with: 1. a lower number of participants with disability progression (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98; 1 study, 731 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 2. a higher number of participants with any adverse events (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.11; 1 study, 725 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); 3. little to no difference in the number of participants with any serious adverse event (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.23; 1 study, 725 participants; low‐certainty evidence); 4. little to no difference in the number of participants experiencing treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.75; 1 study, 725 participants; low‐certainty evidence) for at least 120 weeks. There were no data for number of participants with gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions on MRI and number of participants with new or enlarging T2‐hyperintense lesions on MRI. 
Authors' conclusions
For people with RRMS, ocrelizumab probably results in a large reduction in relapse rate and little to no difference in adverse events when compared with interferon beta‐1a at 96 weeks (moderate‐certainty evidence). Ocrelizumab may result in a large reduction in disability progression, treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events, number of participants with gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions on MRI, and number of participants with new or enlarging T2‐hyperintense lesions on MRI, and may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events (low‐certainty evidence). 
For people with PPMS, ocrelizumab probably results in a higher rate of adverse events when compared with placebo for at least 120 weeks (moderate‐certainty evidence). Ocrelizumab may result in a reduction in disability progression and little to no difference in serious adverse events and treatment discontinuation caused by adverse events (low‐certainty evidence). 
Ocrelizumab was well tolerated clinically; the most common adverse events were infusion‐related reactions and nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract and upper respiratory tract infections.

Ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis: what four clinical trials found

Rationale
Multiple sclerosis, or MS, harms the brain and spinal cord. The immune system attacks the body by mistake. This can cause flares, called relapses. It can also cause slow, steady loss of function over time.

There are two common types in this report. One is relapsing-remitting MS, or RRMS. People with RRMS have flares that come and go. The other is primary progressive MS, or PPMS. PPMS gets worse over time, with few or no flares.

Ocrelizumab is a lab-made antibody drug for MS. It targets a part of the immune system. It is the only approved drug for PPMS at this time. It is also approved for RRMS. Doctors and patients need to know how well it works and how safe it is. The group who wrote this report wanted to gather and review the best trial data. They looked for proof of benefit, side effects, and how well people can stay on the drug.

Trial Design
How is this study designed? The team did a review of clinical trials. They used a set plan to find and judge the trials. They searched medical databases and trial sites on 8 October 2021. They looked for randomized controlled trials. In these trials, people are picked by chance to get one treatment or another.

The trials had adults with RRMS or PPMS. The dose of ocrelizumab was 600 mg every 24 weeks. The team compared ocrelizumab to a dummy drug, called placebo, or to interferon beta‑1a. Interferon beta‑1a is a standard MS drug.

Four trials met the plan. In total, 2551 adults took part. Of these, 1370 got ocrelizumab. The other 1181 were in the control groups. Of the control group, 298 got placebo. The other 883 got interferon beta‑1a. One trial ran for 24 weeks. Two ran for 96 weeks, which is about two years. One ran for at least 120 weeks, which is over two years.

Some trials had limits. One had issues with how groups were kept secret at the start. All had missing data for some people. This can affect how sure we can be. Still, they were high‑quality trials overall.

Results
What were the main results?

For people with RRMS
- Ocrelizumab led to fewer relapses than interferon beta‑1a. A relapse is a new flare of MS signs.
- Fewer people had their disability get worse. This means day to day function fell more slowly.
- The number of people with any side effect was about the same as interferon.
- Serious side effects were about the same as interferon.
- Fewer people stopped the drug due to side effects.
- Brain scans showed less active disease. People had fewer new or growing spots on MRI. These spots show areas of attack in the brain.

These RRMS results were over about 96 weeks. We feel fairly sure about the lower relapse rate and the similar rate of any side effects. We feel less sure, but still hopeful, about the slow down in disability and the brain scan results. We also feel less sure, but hopeful, about fewer people stopping due to side effects and about similar rates of serious side effects.

For people with PPMS
- Ocrelizumab led to fewer people whose disability got worse. This suggests it may slow decline.
- More people had some type of side effect than with placebo.
- Serious side effects were about the same as placebo.
- About the same number of people stopped the drug due to side effects.

These PPMS results were over at least 120 weeks. We feel fairly sure that any side effects were more common than with placebo. We feel less sure, but hopeful, that ocrelizumab slows decline. We also feel less sure, but hopeful, that serious side effects and stops due to side effects were about the same as placebo. There were no brain scan results reported for PPMS in these trials.

Common side effects
Ocrelizumab was well tolerated in the trials. The most common side effects were:
- Reactions during or soon after a drug visit. Signs can be rash, itch, or flu‑like feelings.
- Nose and throat colds.
- Urine infections.
- Chest or upper breathing infections.

What does this mean for patients?
For RRMS, ocrelizumab likely helps more than interferon beta‑1a in key ways. It likely lowers relapses. It may slow the loss of function. It may calm brain scan signs of active disease. It likely has about the same rate of side effects as interferon. It may have about the same rate of serious side effects. Fewer people may need to stop the drug due to side effects.

For PPMS, ocrelizumab may slow the loss of function over time. But more people had some side effects than with placebo. Serious side effects and stopping the drug due to side effects were about the same. Ocrelizumab is the only approved drug for PPMS. These results matter to people with PPMS and their care teams.

How sure are we?
The review used strict methods to judge the data. Some findings are more firm than others. When we say “we feel fairly sure,” that means moderate certainty. When we say “we feel less sure,” that means low certainty. Missing data and short study time can lower how sure we are.

Bottom line
- In RRMS, ocrelizumab likely reduces relapses. It may slow decline and calm brain scan signs. Side effects were about the same as with interferon.
- In PPMS, ocrelizumab may slow decline. More people had some side effects than with placebo. Serious side effects were about the same.

These results support the use of ocrelizumab in both RRMS and PPMS. Talk with your doctor about your goals, risks, and other options.","What are the benefits and risks of ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis?
Key messages 
– Ocrelizumab is a recently approved medicine to treat people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In relapsing‐remitting MS (where people experience flare‐ups of symptoms), ocrelizumab probably substantially reduces flare‐ups, may substantially reduce worsening of symptoms, and probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects compared with interferon beta‐1a (a standard treatment for MS), 96 weeks after treatment starts. 
– Compared to placebo (a dummy medicine) after 120 weeks of treatment for primary progressive MS (where people's symptoms worsen gradually), ocrelizumab may reduce worsening of symptoms. Ocrelizumab probably increases unwanted effects but makes little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects. 
– We need more, better‐designed studies to test the effectiveness of ocrelizumab and measure unwanted effects.  
What is multiple sclerosis? 
MS is a condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the nerves in the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system). This damage prevents messages travelling from the central nervous system to other parts of the body. It causes a range of potential symptoms from pins and needles to difficulties with balance and walking.  
There are several types of MS. In relapsing‐remitting MS, people have 'flare‐ups' of disease followed by periods of recovery. In primary progressive MS, people's symptoms gradually worsen over time.  
What is ocrelizumab? 
Ocrelizumab is a medicine that has been recently approved to treat relapsing‐remitting MS and primary progressive MS. It is a disease‐modifying therapy, which is a type of medicine that treats the underlying symptoms of MS. Ocrelizumab targets white blood cells in the body's immune system. It sticks to a type of these cells called B cells, and stops them attacking the central nervous system. This prevents inflammation and nerve damage, reducing the number and severity of relapses and slowing the worsening of symptoms. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if ocrelizumab is more effective than any other medicine or placebo in people with relapsing‐remitting MS and primary progressive MS. 
We were interested in how many people:
– had symptom flare‐ups;
– had worsening symptoms;
– experienced unwanted effects; and
– stopped treatment due to unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared ocrelizumab against any other medicine or placebo for people with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing‐remitting MS or primary progressive MS. People in the studies could be any age or sex, could have mild or severe symptoms, and could have had MS for any length of time. 
We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found four studies with 2551 people with MS. The largest study included 732 people and the smallest included 163 people. The studies were in countries around the world, but mostly in the USA. One study lasted for 24 weeks; two studies for 96 weeks; and one study for at least 120 weeks. Pharmaceutical companies funded the four studies. 
Three studies compared ocrelizumab with interferon beta‐1a in people with relapsing‐remitting MS. Interferon beta‐1a is an older type of disease‐modifying therapy. One study compared ocrelizumab with placebo for people with primary progressive MS. 
Main results 
Ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta‐1a for people with relapsing‐remitting MS, after 96 weeks of treatment: 
– probably substantially reduces the number of people who had flare‐ups;
– may substantially reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse;
– probably makes little or no difference to unwanted effects; and 
– may substantially reduce the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects.  
Ocrelizumab compared with placebo for people with primary progressive MS, after 120 weeks of treatment: 
– may reduce the number of people whose symptoms got worse; 
– probably increases unwanted effects;  and
– may make little or no difference to the number of serious unwanted effects and the number of people who stopped having treatment due to unwanted effects. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the results is moderate to low for several reasons. First, people dropped out of the studies unevenly, which meant more people had one treatment than the other. Second, there was not enough information about some of our points of interest to allow us to draw conclusions for outcomes, there was not enough information available for us to be confident in the results. Finally, changes in symptoms shown by scans could have been due to causes other than disease progression. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to 8 October 2021.

The prevalence of non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life expectancy and increases risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the requirement for liver transplantation. Uncertainty surrounds relative benefits and harms of various nutritional supplements in NAFLD. Currently no nutritional supplement is recommended for people with NAFLD. 
Objectives
• To assess the benefits and harms of different nutritional supplements for treatment of NAFLD through a network meta‐analysis• To generate rankings of different nutritional supplements according to their safety and efficacy 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until February 2021 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with NAFLD. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) for people with NAFLD, irrespective of method of diagnosis, age and diabetic status of participants, or presence of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. 
Data collection and analysis
We performed a network meta‐analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods whenever possible and calculated differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available‐case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. 
Main results
We included in the review a total of 202 randomised clinical trials (14,200 participants). Nineteen trials were at low risk of bias. A total of 32 different interventions were compared in these trials. A total of 115 trials (7732 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The remaining trials did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. 
Follow‐up ranged from 1 month to 28 months. The follow‐up period in trials that reported clinical outcomes was 2 months to 28 months. During this follow‐up period, clinical events related to NAFLD such as mortality, liver cirrhosis, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver‐related mortality were sparse. 
We did not calculate effect estimates for mortality because of sparse data (zero events for at least one of the groups in the trial). None of the trials reported that they measured overall health‐related quality of life using a validated scale. The evidence is very uncertain about effects of interventions on serious adverse events (number of people or number of events). 
We are very uncertain about effects on adverse events of most of the supplements that we investigated, as the evidence is of very low certainty. However, people taking PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) may be more likely to experience an adverse event than those not receiving an active intervention (network meta‐analysis results: OR 4.44, 95% CrI 2.40 to 8.48; low‐certainty evidence; 4 trials, 203 participants; direct evidence: OR 4.43, 95% CrI 2.43 to 8.42). People who take other supplements (a category that includes nutritional supplements other than vitamins, fatty acids, phospholipids, and antioxidants) had higher numbers of adverse events than those not receiving an active intervention (network meta‐analysis: rate ratio 1.73, 95% CrI 1.26 to 2.41; 6 trials, 291 participants; direct evidence: rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.25 to 2.40; low‐certainty evidence). 
Data were sparse (zero events in all groups in the trial) for liver transplantation, liver decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. So, we did not perform formal analysis for these outcomes. The evidence is very uncertain about effects of other antioxidants (antioxidants other than vitamins) compared to no active intervention on liver cirrhosis (HR 1.68, 95% CrI 0.23 to 15.10; 1 trial, 99 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
The evidence is very uncertain about effects of interventions in any of the remaining comparisons, or data were sparse (with zero events in at least one of the groups), precluding formal calculations of effect estimates. 
Data were probably because of the very short follow‐up period (2 months to 28 months). It takes follow‐up of 8 to 28 years to detect differences in mortality between people with NAFLD and the general population. Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in clinical outcomes are noted in trials providing less than 5 to 10 years of follow‐up. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about effects of nutritional supplementation compared to no additional intervention on all clinical outcomes for people with non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease. 
Accordingly, high‐quality randomised comparative clinical trials with adequate follow‐up are needed. We propose registry‐based randomised clinical trials or cohort multiple randomised clinical trials (study design in which multiple interventions are trialed within large longitudinal cohorts of patients to gain efficiencies and align trials more closely to standard clinical practice) comparing interventions such as vitamin E, prebiotics/probiotics/synbiotics, PUFAs, and no nutritional supplementation. The reason for the choice of interventions is the impact of these interventions on indirect outcomes, which may translate to clinical benefit. Outcomes in such trials should be mortality, health‐related quality of life, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and resource utilisation measures including costs of intervention and decreased healthcare utilisation after minimum follow‐up of 8 years (to find meaningful differences in clinically important outcomes).

Do nutrition pills help people with fatty liver disease?

Rationale
Fatty liver disease not due to alcohol is common. About one in five to one in three people have it. In this disease, fat builds up in the liver. Over time, it can cause scars in the liver. These scars are called cirrhosis. It can also raise the chance of liver cancer. Some people may need a liver transplant. It can also shorten life.

Many people hope that nutrition pills may help. These may include vitamins, special fats, or other pills. But we do not know if they work. We also do not know if they are safe for this use. So, this study asked two main things. Do any of these pills help people with fatty liver live better or live longer? Do any of these pills cause harm?

The study looked at many trials all at once. This lets us compare many pills, even if the pills were not tested head to head. The goal was to rank the pills by safety and by how well they work. This can guide care in the clinic and at home.

Trial Design
This was a review of many randomized trials. In such trials, people get put into groups by chance. One group gets a pill. Another group may get a fake pill or no pill. This helps test if the pill works.

The team searched medical study files up to February 2021. They looked for trials in people with fatty liver not due to alcohol. They included trials no matter how the fatty liver was found. Trials could include people of any age. People could have diabetes or not. People who had a liver transplant in the past were not in these trials.

The review found 202 trials. These trials had 14,200 people in total. The trials tested 32 different pills or types of pills. These included vitamins, fats, and other kinds of nutrition pills. Not all trials measured the main health outcomes. One hundred fifteen trials, with 7,732 people, reported at least one key outcome.

People were in each trial for one month to 28 months. In trials that looked at major health events, time in the study was two months to 28 months. This is not a long time. Major liver events may take many years to happen. So these trials may miss them.

Results
What did they find? There were very few major health events during the study time. Very few people died. Very few people got cirrhosis, liver cancer, or needed a liver transplant. Since these events were rare, the team could not tell if the pills changed these risks. They did not run math tests for death or for some other major events. There just were not enough events to study.

The trials did not measure how people felt in daily life using a standard tool. This type of tool checks how a person feels and functions day to day. So we do not know if any pill made people feel better in daily life.

The team also looked at side effects. These are health problems that may be due to the pill. The evidence here was often very uncertain. Still, there were some signs to note. People who took a type of fat, called polyunsaturated fat, had more side effects than people who took no active pill. In small trials, they had about four times as many side effects. People who took “other” types of nutrition pills also had more side effects than people who took no active pill. They had close to two times as many. These findings came from a small number of trials with a small number of people. So we must be careful in how we read them.

For most other pills, the team could not be sure. The results were not clear. The studies were short. Many did not report the same outcomes. Some had weak methods. Because of this, the team could not say that any pill helped with the outcomes that matter most. These include living longer, avoiding cirrhosis, avoiding liver cancer, or avoiding a liver transplant.

Why is this? Major liver problems in fatty liver build over many years. It can take eight to 28 years to see clear gaps in life span. Trials that last two years or less will rarely show these gaps. So short trials are not enough to find true long term benefits or harms.

What does this mean for you? Today, no nutrition pill has clear proof that it helps major health outcomes in this disease. Some pills may raise the chance of side effects. If you have fatty liver, talk with your care team before you start any nutrition pill. Ask about known benefits, known harms, and costs. Ask what else you can do. Diet, weight loss if you have extra weight, and exercise can help liver fat. Your care team can guide you on these steps.

What should come next? The authors call for large, high quality trials. These trials should run for at least eight years. They should test pills that may have promise, like vitamin E, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and certain fats, or no pill. They should use clear goals. These goals should include death, day to day health, bad liver events, and use of health care. Trials can use big patient lists to make them faster and more real to life. This can help us learn what really works and what does not.

In short, from the studies so far, we have much doubt. We do not see clear help from nutrition pills for fatty liver. We do see possible harms with some pills. We need better and longer trials to guide safe care.","Nutritional supplementation for people with non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease
What is the aim of this Cochrane Review?To find out if any form of nutritional supplementation decreases effects of non‐alcohol‐related fatty liver disease on lifespan, health‐related quality of life, chronic liver disease, and its complications, and whether nutritional supplementation causes any harm. 
Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an accumulation of fat in the liver of people who have no history of significant alcohol consumption, use of medicines, disease such as hepatitis C virus infection, or other conditions such as starvation that can damage the liver. Fatty liver can lead to liver damage resulting in inflammation (non‐alcohol‐related steatohepatitis, or NASH) or liver scarring (liver cirrhosis). Various medical treatments have been tried for treatment of NAFLD. However, no current evidence suggests that any of them work. Nutritional supplementation has the potential to decrease liver damage, but whether this occurs is currently unclear. The authors of this review collected and analysed all relevant randomised clinical trials with the aim of finding out what is the best treatment. They found 202 randomised clinical trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups). During analysis of data, review authors used standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time. In addition, review authors used advanced techniques that allow comparison of multiple treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network (or indirect) meta‐analysis'). 
Date of literature searchFebruary 2021. 
Key messagesOnly 19 trials were at low risk of bias, and because of this, uncertainty about the findings of this review is considerable. Studies that reported clinically important liver damage or its complications studied participants for a period of 2 months to 28 months. During this period, clinically important outcomes related to NAFLD such as death, liver‐related complications such as liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver decompensation (complications caused by scarring of the liver), liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), and death due to liver disease were rare, even without any treatment. No evidence suggests that any nutritional supplementation decreased these. A possible reason for complications of liver disease being rare in trial participants may be the short follow‐up period given in these trials (participants were followed only for a period of 2 months to 28 months). Liver‐related complications due to NAFLD develop over 8 to 28 years. Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in clinical outcomes can be noted in trials with less than 5 to 10 years of follow‐up. 
What was studied in the Review?This Review looked at people of any sex, age, and ethnic origin, with non‐alcohol‐related liver disease. Review authors excluded studies of people with previous liver transplantation. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 7 to 61 years. Participants were given different treatments including various vitamins and other nutritional supplements. Review authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death, quality of life, serious and non‐serious adverse events, severe liver damage, complications resulting from severe liver damage, liver cancer, and death due to liver damage ('clinical outcomes').What were the main results of the Review?The 202 studies included 14,200 participants. Study data were sparse. In all, 115 studies with 7732 participants provided data for analyses. Follow‐up of trial participants ranged from 1 month to 28 months (2 months to 28 months for trials that reported clinical outcomes). The Review shows the following.‐ The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about effects of interventions on all clinical outcomes.‐ Well‐designed trials that collect data over longer follow‐up times are needed in the future to find out the best nutritional supplementation (if any) for people with NAFLD.

10.1002-14651858.CD013812,"Background
In response to the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the impact of COVID‐19, national and subnational governments implemented a variety of measures in order to control the spread of the virus and the associated disease. While these measures were imposed with the intention of controlling the pandemic, they were also associated with severe psychosocial, societal, and economic implications on a societal level. One setting affected heavily by these measures is the school setting. By mid‐April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world’s student population. In consideration of the adverse consequences of school closures, many countries around the world reopened their schools in the months after the initial closures. To safely reopen schools and keep them open, governments implemented a broad range of measures. 
The evidence with regards to these measures, however, is heterogeneous, with a multitude of study designs, populations, settings, interventions and outcomes being assessed. To make sense of this heterogeneity, we conducted a rapid scoping review (8 October to 5 November 2020). This rapid scoping review is intended to serve as a precursor to a systematic review of effectiveness, which will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA‐ScR) checklist and was registered with the Open Science Framework.

To identify and comprehensively map the evidence assessing the impacts of measures implemented in the school setting to reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the SARS‐CoV‐2/COVID‐19 pandemic, with particular focus on the types of measures implemented in different school settings, the outcomes used to measure their impacts and the study types used to assess these. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the CDC COVID‐19 Research Articles Downloadable Database for preprints, and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 8 October 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included studies that assessed the impact of measures implemented in the school setting. Eligible populations were populations at risk of becoming infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, or developing COVID‐19 disease, or both, and included people both directly and indirectly impacted by interventions, including students, teachers, other school staff, and contacts of these groups, as well as the broader community. We considered all types of empirical studies, which quantitatively assessed impact including epidemiological studies, modelling studies, mixed‐methods studies, and diagnostic studies that assessed the impact of relevant interventions beyond diagnostic test accuracy. Broad outcome categories of interest included infectious disease transmission‐related outcomes, other harmful or beneficial health‐related outcomes, and societal, economic, and ecological implications. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data from included studies in a standardized manner, and mapped them to categories within our a priori logic model where possible. Where not possible, we inductively developed new categories. In line with standard expectations for scoping reviews, the review provides an overview of the existing evidence regardless of methodological quality or risk of bias, and was not designed to synthesize effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterize strength of evidence (GRADE). 
Main results
We included 42 studies that assessed measures implemented in the school setting. The majority of studies used mathematical modelling designs (n = 31), while nine studies used observational designs, and two studies used experimental or quasi‐experimental designs. Studies conducted in real‐world contexts or using real data focused on the WHO European region (EUR; n = 20), the WHO region of the Americas (AMR; n = 13), the West Pacific region (WPR; n = 6), and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR; n = 1). One study conducted a global assessment and one did not report on data from, or that were applicable to, a specific country. 
Three broad intervention categories emerged from the included studies: organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (n = 36), structural/environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (n = 11), and surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (n = 19). Most studies assessed SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission‐related outcomes (n = 29), while others assessed healthcare utilization (n = 8), other health outcomes (n = 3), and societal, economic, and ecological outcomes (n = 5). Studies assessed both harmful and beneficial outcomes across all outcome categories. 
Authors' conclusions
We identified a heterogeneous and complex evidence base of measures implemented in the school setting. This review is an important first step in understanding the available evidence and will inform the development of rapid reviews on this topic.

What school steps to deal with COVID-19 have been studied so far?

Rationale
COVID-19 is an illness caused by a new virus. It can spread fast from person to person. Many parts of life changed due to this virus.

Most schools closed for a time. This helped slow the spread. But school closings also hurt kids, homes, and jobs.

As cases fell, many places chose to open schools again. They used many steps to try to make this safe. Leaders wanted to know which steps might help.

There were many kinds of studies on school steps. They used many ways to test ideas and many kinds of results. It was hard to compare them.

This team did a “scoping review.” That means they made a map of the research. They did not test how well each step worked. They set out to list what was done, where, and how it was studied.

They aimed to guide fast follow-up reviews. These next reviews will study how well steps work. The work will help the World Health Organization (WHO) plan advice.

Trial Design
How is this study designed? This was a review of past studies. The team did not run a new trial with people. No one had to join or spend time in this study.

The team looked for studies about steps used in schools. They searched large health study lists on one date, October 8, 2020. They worked on the review from October 8 to November 5, 2020.

They included studies that looked at the impact of school steps. These steps aimed to open schools, keep them open, or both. The studies looked at how the steps could change the spread of the virus.

The people in the included studies were those at risk of COVID-19. This group could be students, teachers, and school staff. It also could be their close contacts and the wider group in the town.

The review took in many types of study. This included math model work, real world watch-and-record work, and test-like work. The team wrote down what each study did and what it found.

Results
The review found 42 studies on school steps. Most were math model studies. There were 31 math model studies, nine watch-and-record studies, and two test-like studies.

Many studies used data from Europe and the Americas. Some used data from the West Pacific and the East Mediterranean. One study looked at the whole world. One study did not say which place it fit.

The steps fell into three main groups. One group was “how the school runs day to day.” This means how to plan the school day to cut spread. Thirty-six studies looked at this.

One group was “how the school space is set up.” This means changes to the room or air. Eleven studies looked at this. The last group was “test and act.” This means how to find cases and what to do next. Nineteen studies looked at this.

The studies looked at many kinds of results. Twenty-nine looked at how the virus spreads. Eight looked at use of health care. Three looked at other health. Five looked at money, jobs, and life impact.

The team found both good and bad effects. Some steps may help cut spread. Some steps may have costs for kids, homes, or schools. But this review did not judge how well steps work.

This review did not grade study quality. It did not rate risk of bias. It did not join the results to give one clear score. That was not its goal.

What does this mean for you and your child? This map shows what has been tried and studied in schools. It shows where we have more facts and where we have gaps. It helps plan the next set of fast reviews.

Those next reviews will test which steps work best. They will also test which mix of steps is best. They will help leaders choose school steps with more care.

In short, many kinds of school steps have been studied. Most studies used math to model spread. Fewer used real world data. The results cover spread, health care use, and life impact.

The team says this is a first step. It guides where to look next and what to ask. It will help the WHO build advice on school steps during COVID-19.","Which school‐based measures designed to contain the COVID‐19 pandemic have been evaluated to date, and how were they evaluated? 
Why is this question important? 
To combat the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the impact of COVID‐19, countries worldwide have taken a variety of public health measures. In many countries, shutting schools was one of the earliest responses. By mid‐April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world’s student population. This severely disrupted school, family and work life, with likely negative impacts including: 
‐ a worsening of children’s and adolescents’ health and well‐being;‐ increases in inequalities between children and adolescents from disadvantaged and more privileged backgrounds;‐ possible decreased parental income and job security;‐ possible loss of parental economic productivity. 
Given the potential negative consequences of school closures, many countries have since reopened schools. To avoid disease transmission among students, between staff and students, and beyond, a range of school‐based measures have been put in place. These include: 
‐ students and staff wearing face masks and regularly washing their hands;‐ adapting school activities (for example, not singing in music classes);‐ improving ventilation systems; and‐ screening suspected cases of infection. 
To date, we know little about which school‐based measures designed to contain COVID‐19 have been evaluated, and how they have been evaluated. It is important to find this out, so that, in time, we can compare the effectiveness of different measures and inform future policy guidelines. 
We set out to identify and map the evidence on school‐based measures to contain COVID‐19. This work is intended to form the basis of a future review about the effectiveness of these measures. This review will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
How did we identify and map the evidence? 
First, we searched for studies that evaluated any intervention set in schools designed to prevent the spread of COVID‐19. We considered all types of studies, and a broad range of outcomes, including: 
‐ infectious disease transmission;‐ other harmful or beneficial effects on health;‐ wider implications for society, the economy, and the population. 
We then grouped studies according to how similar or different they were. This allowed us to gauge: 
‐ which types of study have been used to evaluate measures to date;‐ where studies have been conducted;‐ which types of intervention have been evaluated; and‐ which outcomes have been studied. 
What did we find? 
We found 42 studies.
Type of study 
Thirty‐one studies used mathematical modelling designs, to predict the effects of measures on populations. Two studies used experimental designs, in which researchers divide people or settings into groups to compare the effects of different measures. Nine studies used observational designs, in which researchers simply observed the effect of the intervention. 
Study setting 
Studies were conducted in Europe (20 studies), North and South America (13 studies), the West Pacific (6 studies), and the Eastern Mediterranean (1 study). Most studies evaluated measures in more than one school setting (for example, primary education and secondary education). Three studies focused on secondary schools. 
Type of intervention 
Studies evaluated three broad types of measure:
1. Organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (36 studies): these included: 
‐ measures designed to limit risks of disease transmission between people who come into contact with each other (such as face‐masks and physical distancing policies); and‐ measures to reduce opportunities for contact (for example, staggered arrival, break and departure times). 
2. Structural or environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 (11 studies): for example, dividing up school playgrounds or improving air circulation. 
3. Surveillance and response measures to detect SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (19 studies): these included: 
‐ testing, tracing, and symptom screening; and‐ isolation of confirmed cases or quarantine of suspected cases. 
Outcomes studied 
Studies assessed the effects of measures on:
‐ SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission (29 studies), including the number of new cases or the average number of people to whom one infected person will pass the virus (reproduction number R);‐ healthcare use (8 studies), for example, the number of hospitalizations;‐ other health outcomes (3 studies), for example, the risk of developing hand eczema (a skin condition); and‐ societal, economic, and other population‐level outcomes (5 studies), including cost. 
What are the implications of our findings? 
A wide range of school‐based measures designed to contain COVID‐19 have been evaluated to date. To evaluate these, researchers have used different methods and investigated different outcomes. This review is an important first step in gauging what evidence is available, and will inform future rapid reviews on this topic.

At least 1 in 200 people have suffered a severe allergic reaction to a sting from a bee, wasp, or ant, and insect stings are the second most common cause of fatal allergic reactions in some countries. Treatment with insect venom, usually given by a course of injections (called venom immunotherapy), is thought to reduce the risk of allergic reactions to an insect sting. In this review, we evaluated the effectiveness of venom immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings. 
From analysis of 7 studies, which included 392 participants, we found that this treatment reduces the chance of having a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by 90%, a consistent finding between studies. Venom immunotherapy also significantly improves the quality of life of people who have had a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by reducing anxiety and possible limitation of activities caused by fear of insects. However, almost 1 in 10 people treated with venom immunotherapy during the trials had an allergic reaction to their treatment. We were unable to find out whether venom immunotherapy prevents fatal allergic reactions to insect stings, because these are so rare. The decision whether to start venom immunotherapy depends on an accurate diagnosis, followed by careful assessment of a person's risk of having another allergic reaction to a sting, the degree to which the insect sting allergy affects their quality of life, and the risk of an allergic reaction to their treatment.

Allergy shots for bee, wasp, and ant stings: what this review found

Rationale
Stings from bees, wasps, and ants can cause bad allergic reactions. These reactions can be life threatening. At least 1 in 200 people have had a bad sting reaction. In some countries, stings are the second top cause of fatal allergy. Many people live with fear after a bad sting.

Doctors can give shots with a tiny amount of insect venom. These are allergy shots for stings. Doctors call this venom immunotherapy. The goal is to train the body to stay calm after a sting. This may lower the chance of a bad reaction.

This review asked a clear question. Do venom shots help prevent bad reactions after a new sting? The review also asked if life feels better with this care. It looked at safety, too. The team wanted to know how often the shots cause side effects.

Venom shots may help people in many ways. They may cut the risk of a bad reaction. They may ease fear of going outside. They may help people enjoy daily life again. This is why the review was needed.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team looked at seven studies. These studies included 392 people. All had a past bad reaction to an insect sting. The stings were from bees, wasps, or ants.

People in the studies got shots with a small amount of venom. Doctors gave more than one shot over time. The shots aimed to prevent a new bad reaction. The review compared people who got shots with those who did not. The abstract did not list how long people were in each study.

The review did not report ages or gender. It did not say how often people got each shot. It did not say how long each person stayed in care. So, we cannot share those details here. The main focus was if the shots work and if they are safe.

Results
The main finding was clear. Venom shots cut the chance of a bad reaction after a new sting. The drop was large. The chance fell by about nine in ten. This result was steady across the seven studies.

Many people also felt better day to day. Life felt less limited. People felt less fear of stings. They could take part in more normal tasks. In short, life got better for many.

But the shots can cause side effects. About 1 in 10 people had an allergic reaction to the shots. The abstract did not say how severe those reactions were. This shows there is some risk. People and doctors should weigh this risk and the benefits.

The review could not show if the shots prevent deaths. Death from a sting reaction is rare. Because it is rare, the studies did not have enough deaths to measure this. So we cannot say if the shots lower the chance of death.

What do these results mean for you? If you had a bad sting reaction, venom shots may help. They may lower the chance of another bad reaction. They may help you feel safer and do more. But there is a chance of a reaction to the shots.

The choice to start venom shots is personal. It should start with a right diagnosis. Your doctor should confirm a sting allergy. Then you can talk about your own risk of another sting. You can also talk about how your allergy affects your life. You should review the chance of a reaction to the shots.

This review adds strong support for venom shots. It shows they help prevent bad reactions after stings. It also shows many people feel better with them. At the same time, it reminds us that side effects can occur. It points to the need for good testing and careful care.

In summary, here is what we know. Seven studies with 392 people were reviewed. Venom shots cut the risk of a bad reaction by about nine in ten. About 1 in 10 people had a reaction to the shots. We do not know if the shots prevent deaths. Talk with your doctor to see if this care fits your needs.","Immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings

10.1002-14651858.CD013246.pub2,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with dyspnoea, cough or sputum production (or both) and affects quality of life and functional status. More efficient approaches to alternative management that may include patients themselves managing their condition need further exploration in order to reduce the impact on both patients and healthcare services. Digital interventions may potentially impact on health behaviours and encourage patient engagement. 
Objectives
To assess benefits and harms of digital interventions for managing COPD and apply Behaviour Change Technique (BCT) taxonomy to describe and explore intervention content. 
Search methods
We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register (date of last search 28 April 2020). We found other trials at web‐based clinical trials registers. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing digital technology interventions with or without routine supported self‐management to usual care, or control treatment for self‐management. Multi‐component interventions (of which one component was digital self‐management) compared with usual care, standard care or control treatment were included. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved with a third review author. We assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes were impact on health behaviours, self‐efficacy, exacerbations and quality of life, including the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The minimally important difference (MID) for the SGRQ is 4 points. Two review authors independently applied BCT taxonomy to identify mechanisms in the digital interventions that influence behaviours. 
Main results
Fourteen studies were included in the meta‐analyses (1518 participants) ranging from 13 to 52 weeks duration. Participants had mild to very severe COPD. Risk of bias was high due to lack of blinding. GRADE ratings were low to very low certainty due to lack of blinding and imprecision. Common BCT clusters identified as behaviour change mechanisms in interventions were goals and planning, feedback and monitoring, social support, shaping knowledge and antecedents. 
Digital technology intervention with or without routine supported self‐management 
Interventions included mobile phone (three studies), smartphone applications (one study), and web or Internet‐based (five studies). 
Evidence is very uncertain about effects on impact on health behaviours as measured by six‐minute walk distance (6MWD) at 13 weeks (mean difference (MD) 26.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐21.70 to 74.10; participants = 122; studies = 2) or 23 to 26 weeks (MD 14.31, 95% CI ‐19.41 to 48.03; participants = 164; studies = 3). There may be improvement in 6MWD at 52 weeks (MD 54.33 95% CI ‐35.47 to 144.12; participants = 204; studies = 2) but studies were varied (very low certainty). 
There may be no difference in self‐efficacy on managing Chronic Disease Scale (SEMCD) or pulmonary rehabilitation adapted index of self‐efficacy tool (PRAISE). Evidence is very uncertain. 
Quality of life may be slightly improved on the chronic respiratory disease questionnaire (CRQ) at 13 weeks (MD 0.45, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.90; participants = 123; studies = 2; low certainty), but is not clinically important (MID 0.5). There may be little or no difference at 23 or 52 weeks (low to very low certainty). There may be a clinical improvement on SGRQ total at 52 weeks (MD ‐26.57, 95% CI ‐34.09 to ‐19.05; participants = 120; studies = 1; low certainty). Evidence for COPD assessment test (CAT) and Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) is very uncertain. 
There may be little or no difference in dyspnoea symptoms (CRQ dyspnoea) at 13, 23 weeks or 52 weeks (low to very low certainty evidence) or mean number of exacerbations at 26 weeks (low‐certainty evidence). 
There was no evidence for the number of people experiencing adverse events.
Multi‐component interventions 
Digital components included mobile phone (one study), and web or internet‐based (four studies). 
Evidence is very uncertain about effects on impact on health behaviour (6MWD) at 13 weeks (MD 99.60, 95% CI ‐15.23 to 214.43; participants = 20; studies = 1). 
No evidence was found for self‐efficacy. Four studies reported effects on quality of life (SGRQ and CCQ scales). The evidence is very uncertain. 
There may be no difference in the number of people experiencing exacerbations or mean days to first exacerbation at 52 weeks with a multi‐component intervention compared to standard care. 
Evidence is very uncertain about effects on the number of people experiencing adverse events at 52 weeks. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a clear benefit or harm of digital technology interventions with or without supported self‐management, or multi‐component interventions compared to usual care in improving the 6MWD or self‐efficacy. We found there may be some short‐term improvement in quality of life with digital interventions, but there is no evidence about whether the effect is sustained long term. Dyspnoea symptoms may improve over a longer duration of digital intervention use. The evidence for multi‐component interventions is very uncertain and as there is little or no evidence for adverse events, we cannot determine the benefit or harm of these interventions. The evidence base is predominantly of very low certainty with concerns around high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. Given that variation of interventions and blinding is likely to be a concern, future, larger studies are needed taking these limitations in consideration. Future studies are needed to determine whether the small improvements observed in this review can be applied to the general COPD population. 
A clear understanding of behaviour change through the BCT classification is important to gauge uptake of digital interventions and health outcomes in people with varying severity of COPD. Currently there is no guidance for interpreting BCT components of a digital intervention for changes to health outcomes. We could not interpret the BCT findings to the health outcomes we were investigating due to limited evidence that was of very low certainty. In future research, standardised approaches need to be considered when designing protocols to investigate effectiveness of digital interventions by including a standardised approach to BCT classification in addition to validated behavioural outcome measures that may reflect changes in behaviour.

Do phone and web tools help people with COPD manage their health?

2. Rationale
COPD is a long‑term lung disease. It can cause short breath, cough, and mucus. It can make daily life hard. Many people with COPD need help to stay well.

Some tools use phones, apps, or the web. These tools can send tips, track health, and support care at home. They may help people change habits and feel more in control. We wanted to learn if these tools help and if they are safe.

We also looked at how these tools try to change habits. A habit change method is a planned way to help people act in new ways. Examples are setting goals, giving feedback, and offering support.

3. Trial Design
We looked at trials where people joined by chance to one of two groups. One group used a digital tool. The other group got usual care or a control plan. This helps show if the tool makes a real difference.

We found 14 trials with 1,518 people. People had COPD from mild to very severe. Each trial lasted from 13 to 52 weeks. Some tools were by phone calls or texts. Some were apps. Some were web programs.

Some trials used only a digital tool. Others used a mix of tools and care steps. We call these “multi‑component” plans. We also looked at what each tool asked people to do.

The trials measured many things. These included:
- How far people walked in six minutes. This shows day‑to‑day strength.
- How sure people felt about caring for their illness. We call this self‑belief.
- Quality of life. This means how people feel and function each day.
- Short breath, also called breathlessness.
- Flare‑ups. A flare‑up is a sudden bad spell.
- Harm from the tools.

Most trials could not hide the group from people. People knew what care they got. This can change how people act or report results. So, we are less sure about the results.

4. Results
Digital tools alone, with or without extra support
- Walking distance: Results were not clear at about three or six months. People may walk a bit farther at one year. But the size of the effect was not clear. We are not very sure about this.
- Self‑belief: People may feel no more sure about caring for their illness. We are not very sure about this.
- Quality of life: There may be a small, short‑term gain. This small gain may not feel important in daily life. One study at one year showed a bigger gain. But we are not very sure about it.
- Short breath: There may be little or no change in the first months. Breath may improve with longer use, but we are not sure.
- Flare‑ups: There may be little or no difference in the number of flare‑ups at about six months.
- Harms: Trials did not give clear data on harms.

Multi‑component plans that include a digital tool
- Walking distance: Results were not clear. We are not very sure about them.
- Self‑belief: Trials did not give data we could use.
- Quality of life: Results were not clear. We are not very sure about them.
- Flare‑ups: There may be no clear difference at one year.
- Harms: We do not know if harms were more or less with these plans.

How the tools tried to change habits
The tools often:
- Helped set goals and make plans.
- Gave feedback and tracked progress.
- Offered social support.
- Taught skills and knowledge.
- Used reminders or cues.

These methods make sense. But we could not link any one method to better health. The evidence was too weak and too mixed to tell.

What this means for people with COPD
- Digital tools may help a little with how you feel in the short term. They may help you walk a bit farther after a year. But we are not sure.
- These tools did not show clear cuts in flare‑ups. They did not clearly boost self‑belief.
- We do not know enough about harms. Trials did not report them well.
- The kinds of tools and plans were very mixed. Results varied across trials.

What this means for care and research
- We do not have strong proof for big gains or harms from these tools.
- Many trials had limits. People knew their group. Groups were small. Results were not exact.
- Bigger and better trials are needed. Trials should test clear plans and report harms.
- Trials should use the same habit change terms and measures. This will help us learn what works and for whom.

Bottom line
Phone, app, and web tools may give small short‑term help for people with COPD. They may help walking after a year, but we are not sure. There is no clear drop in flare‑ups. We do not have good data on harms. We need larger, better trials to know if these tools truly help in real life.","Digital interventions for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Review question 
Do digital interventions help people to improve their self‐management of COPD and their health? Do they help to change their behaviour about managing their symptoms? 
What is COPD? 
COPD is a chronic and progressive condition affecting the airways and lungs. Typically, COPD results from prolonged exposure to harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke, leading to inflammation of the airways, as well as abnormal expansion of the airspaces of the lungs. Owing to the highly varied nature of COPD, there is much variety in how the condition affects individuals’ lives. A persistent cough and breathlessness are characteristic symptoms of COPD, worsening during flare‐ups (exacerbations) and becoming more severe over time. This makes activities of daily living more difficult and greatly impacts quality of life. 
Managing COPD is complex and varies depending on the severity of the condition. Self‐management techniques often play a role in relieving symptoms, such as breathing exercises, as well as a combination of medication and supplementary oxygen. 
'Digital interventions' and 'telehealth' are terms used to encompass the use of technology to communicate and send information between a patient and a healthcare provider ‐ helping to manage the patient’s condition remotely. This may involve (but is not restricted to) the use of a mobile phone or tablet computer application to log symptoms and lung function, allowing a clinician to adjust medications in real‐time. It may also involve remotely training a patient in self‐management techniques. There is scope for those living with COPD to greatly benefit from the use of such interventions, offering convenient and accessible healthcare provision. 
Why did we do this review? 
We wanted to find out if digital interventions were helpful for people with COPD in terms of managing their condition, and if these interventions played a part in changing their behaviour towards self‐management. Additionally, we wanted to understand the behaviour change techniques incorporated in different digital interventions. 
What evidence did we find? 
Mostly, digital interventions or multi component approaches did not improve walking distance or betterment in one's own belief in managing their condition. There was small short‐term improvement in quality of life with Internet‐based interventions but we cannot be certain whether the improvement is seen long term. Breathing difficulties may improve with long‐term use of digital interventions, but they may have little to no effect on flare‐ups. Due to limited data available, we cannot say with confidence that digital interventions can be used to improve health in people with COPD, or that they reduce harm. There is little or no evidence about possible unwanted side‐effects of digital interventions. More research in this field can provide more robust conclusions for their use and insight into people's behaviours towards these novel approaches.

10.1002-14651858.CD006297.pub2,"Intermediate acting versus long acting insulin for type 1 diabetes mellitus
Diabetes mellitus type 1 is a chronic disease with short and long term complications. The treatment for this disease is insulin administration, with basal and bolus insulin preparations being its main stay. Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin had previously been considered the standard of care for basal insulin replacement in blood glucose lowering for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Over the years, newer and longer acting insulins with a more physiological action profile became available: insulin ultralente, and later insulin glargine and insulin detemir. Their theoretical advantages lead to the thought of a beneficial effect on glucose level and rate of complications, such as very low levels of glucose or long term complications. The aim of this review was to assess whether this theoretical advantage is translated into real‐life benefits, by comparing the effect of long acting insulins to intermediate acting insulins on diabetes control.  Twenty‐three studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria with a total of 3872 and 2915 participants in the intervention and in the control group, respectively. The methodological quality of all the studies was rated intermediate to low. Trials duration was no longer than one year. The level of glycosylated haemoglobin, a marker of diabetes control, was lower in the long acting insulin group, but the observed difference was of doubtful clinical significance. Longer acting insulins were superior mostly in their nocturnal effect, which resulted in a lower level of fasting glucose levels and fewer episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. No data on long term complications were available.  The currently available data can not substantiate conclusions on the benefits and risks of long acting insulins, and long‐term data are of need.

Long acting insulin versus NPH for type 1 diabetes: what studies show

Rationale
Type 1 diabetes is a life long illness.
The body makes little or no insulin.
Without insulin, sugar builds up in the blood.
This can cause harm now and later in life.
High sugar can harm eyes, nerves, kidneys, and the heart.

People with this illness need insulin each day.
Many take a slow, steady dose called basal insulin.
One older basal type is NPH insulin.
Newer long acting insulins last longer and act more evenly.
Some types include ultralente, glargine, and detemir.

Doctors hoped these newer types would help more.
They may lower sugar swings at night.
They may lower morning sugar and reduce very low sugar events.
This review asked if these hopes match real life.

Very low sugar can cause shaking, sweat, and trouble thinking.
Night time lows can scare people and their families.
People want safe, steady sugar levels.
Better basal insulin may help reach that goal.

Trial Design
The team reviewed past research studies.
They found 23 studies that fit their plan.
Each study compared long acting insulin with NPH.
All people in the trials had type 1 diabetes.

Study time in each trial was up to one year.
Study quality was fair to low.
In all, 3,872 people used long acting insulin.
In all, 2,915 people used NPH insulin.
Ages and genders were not stated in this summary.

Results
The main blood test was A1C.
A1C shows average sugar over three months.
Long acting insulin led to a lower A1C.
But the drop was very small.
The team felt this small change may not matter in care.

Long acting insulin worked better at night.
People had fewer night time low sugar events.
Morning, before breakfast, sugar levels were lower.
These are helpful day to day benefits.
The results fit how long acting insulin works.

The trials did not track long term problems.
So we do not know about eye, nerve, or kidney harm.
We also do not know about heart or stroke.
We cannot say if long acting insulin lowers these risks.
More long term studies are needed.

The trials lasted only up to one year.
The study methods were not very strong.
These facts limit what we can claim.
The team could not prove clear overall benefit or harm.
We need larger and longer studies.

What does this mean for people?
Long acting insulin may help with night lows and morning sugar.
It may not change overall control by very much.
Talk with your care team about your best insulin plan.
Your goals and needs should guide that choice.

In sum, long acting insulin had small overall gains.
It helped nights and mornings more than days.
We lack data on long term safety and benefit.
Better trials over many years are still needed.","Intermediate acting versus long acting insulin for type 1 diabetes mellitus
Diabetes mellitus type 1 is a chronic disease with short and long term complications. The treatment for this disease is insulin administration, with basal and bolus insulin preparations being its main stay. Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin had previously been considered the standard of care for basal insulin replacement in blood glucose lowering for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Over the years, newer and longer acting insulins with a more physiological action profile became available: insulin ultralente, and later insulin glargine and insulin detemir. Their theoretical advantages lead to the thought of a beneficial effect on glucose level and rate of complications, such as very low levels of glucose or long term complications. The aim of this review was to assess whether this theoretical advantage is translated into real‐life benefits, by comparing the effect of long acting insulins to intermediate acting insulins on diabetes control.  Twenty‐three studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria with a total of 3872 and 2915 participants in the intervention and in the control group, respectively. The methodological quality of all the studies was rated intermediate to low. Trials duration was no longer than one year. The level of glycosylated haemoglobin, a marker of diabetes control, was lower in the long acting insulin group, but the observed difference was of doubtful clinical significance. Longer acting insulins were superior mostly in their nocturnal effect, which resulted in a lower level of fasting glucose levels and fewer episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. No data on long term complications were available.  The currently available data can not substantiate conclusions on the benefits and risks of long acting insulins, and long‐term data are of need.

Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management, reduce morbidity and improve survival. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised to the skin but has potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue, while cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and melanoma have a much higher potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death. Exfoliative cytology is a non‐invasive test that uses the Tzanck smear technique to identify disease by examining the structure of cells obtained from scraped samples. This simple procedure is a less invasive diagnostic test than a skin biopsy, and for BCC it has the potential to provide an immediate diagnosis that avoids an additional clinic visit to receive skin biopsy results. This may benefit patients scheduled for either Mohs micrographic surgery or non‐surgical treatments such as radiotherapy. A cytology scrape can never give the same information as a skin biopsy, however, so it is important to better understand in which skin cancer situations it may be helpful. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of exfoliative cytology for detecting basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of standard diagnostic practice (visual inspection with or without dermoscopy). Secondary objectives were: to determine the diagnostic accuracy of exfoliative cytology for detecting cSCC, invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, and any other skin cancer; and for each of these secondary conditions to compare the accuracy of exfoliative cytology with visual inspection with or without dermoscopy in direct test comparisons; and to determine the effect of observer experience. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also studied the reference lists of published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
Studies evaluating exfoliative cytology in adults with lesions suspicious for BCC, cSCC or melanoma, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS‐2). Where possible we estimated summary sensitivities and specificities using the bivariate hierarchical model. 
Main results
We synthesised the results of nine studies contributing a total of 1655 lesions to our analysis, including 1120 BCCs (14 datasets), 41 cSCCs (amongst 401 lesions in 2 datasets), and 10 melanomas (amongst 200 lesions in 1 dataset). Three of these datasets (one each for BCC, melanoma and any malignant condition) were derived from one study that also performed a direct comparison with dermoscopy. Studies were of moderate to poor quality, providing inadequate descriptions of participant selection, thresholds used to make cytological and histological diagnoses, and blinding. Reporting of participants' prior referral pathways was particularly poor, as were descriptions of the cytodiagnostic criteria used to make diagnoses. No studies evaluated the use of exfoliative cytology as a primary diagnostic test for detecting BCC or other skin cancers in lesions suspicious for skin cancer. Pooled data from seven studies using standard cytomorphological criteria (but various stain methods) to detect BCC in participants with a high clinical suspicion of BCC estimated the sensitivity and specificity of exfoliative cytology as 97.5% (95% CI 94.5% to 98.9%) and 90.1% (95% CI 81.1% to 95.1%). respectively. When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 clinically suspected BCC lesions with a median observed BCC prevalence of 86%, exfoliative cytology would miss 21 BCCs and would lead to 14 false positive diagnoses of BCC. No false positive cases were histologically confirmed to be melanoma. Insufficient data are available to make summary statements regarding the accuracy of exfoliative cytology to detect melanoma or cSCC, or its accuracy compared to dermoscopy. 
Authors' conclusions
The utility of exfoliative cytology for the primary diagnosis of skin cancer is unknown, as all included studies focused on the use of this technique for confirming strongly suspected clinical diagnoses. For the confirmation of BCC in lesions with a high clinical suspicion, there is evidence of high sensitivity and specificity. Since decisions to treat low‐risk BCCs are unlikely in practice to require diagnostic confirmation given that clinical suspicion is already high, exfoliative cytology might be most useful for cases of BCC where the treatments being contemplated require a tissue diagnosis (e.g. radiotherapy). The small number of included studies, poor reporting and varying methodological quality prevent us from drawing strong conclusions to guide clinical practice. Despite insufficient data on the use of cytology for cSCC or melanoma, it is unlikely that cytology would be useful in these scenarios since preservation of the architecture of the whole lesion that would be available from a biopsy provides crucial diagnostic information. Given the paucity of good quality data, appropriately designed prospective comparative studies may be required to evaluate both the diagnostic value of exfoliative cytology by comparison to dermoscopy, and its confirmatory value in adequately reported populations with a high probability of BCC scheduled for further treatment requiring a tissue diagnosis. 
","1. Plain Title
A gentle skin cell scrape to help check for basal cell skin cancer

2. Rationale
Skin cancer is common. Some skin cancers grow close to where they start. Others can spread to other parts of the body. Basal cell skin cancer often stays in one spot. But it can grow and harm nearby skin and tissue.

Fast and right diagnosis helps plan care. A skin biopsy is the usual test. In a biopsy, the doctor takes a small piece of skin. A lab then checks that piece under a scope. This test works well, but it is invasive and can leave a mark.

A cell scrape test may be an easier choice for some people. The doctor gently scrapes the top of the spot. The lab looks at the skin cells on a glass slide. This test is called exfoliative cytology. You may also hear “Tzanck smear.” It uses a small tool and takes a few minutes.

Doctors hoped this cell scrape test could spot basal cell skin cancer fast. It may help avoid an extra clinic visit to hear biopsy results. It may also help plan care when the doctor needs proof before treatment. This can include some types of radiation care. The main goal was to see how well this test works.

3. Trial Design
This was not one new trial. It was a review of past studies. The team searched many medical databases. They looked at all studies from the start of each database up to mid 2016. They also checked lists of other review papers.

They found nine studies in adults with skin spots that looked like cancer. Most had a strong clinical guess of basal cell skin cancer. Doctors in those studies did the cell scrape test. They also did a skin biopsy on the same spot. The lab checked the biopsy to confirm the true result.

Some studies also used “dermoscopy.” Dermoscopy is when a doctor looks at the spot with a hand scope. It gives more light and detail than with the eye alone. A few studies compared the cell scrape test with this scope check. All studies used the biopsy as the final truth.

This review did not enroll new people. It did not set a set time in the study. In the original studies, the tests were done at clinic visits. The biopsy and the cell scrape came from the same spot. Lab staff then read the slides.

4. Results
The nine studies looked at 1,655 skin spots in total. Of those spots, 1,120 were basal cell skin cancers. Two studies also included 41 squamous cell skin cancers. One study included 10 melanomas. Most studies looked at people with a high chance of basal cell skin cancer.

For basal cell skin cancer in these high‑chance cases, the cell scrape test worked well. The review gave an easy way to picture this. Think of 1,000 spots where doctors already think many are basal cell skin cancer. Out of those 1,000 spots, 860 would truly be basal cell skin cancer. The cell scrape test would miss about 21 of those true cancers. It would also wrongly call about 14 spots “basal cell” when they were not. None of the wrong “basal cell” calls were melanoma in the studies that said this.

There was not enough data to judge how well the test finds melanoma. There was also not enough data for squamous cell skin cancer. The review could not say if the cell scrape test is better or worse than the hand scope check. There was only one direct study for that kind of match‑up.

The studies had some limits. Many did not say how they chose patients. Many did not explain how the readers were trained. Many did not say how they set the rules for a positive or negative cell scrape slide. In many studies, it was not clear if the person who read the cell slide knew the biopsy result. This makes it hard to judge how strong the findings are.

No study used the cell scrape test as the first test in all skin spots that might be cancer. In all studies, doctors already thought the spot was basal cell skin cancer. So, we do not know how the test would work as a first step in a general clinic.

What can patients take from this? The cell scrape test may help confirm basal cell skin cancer when doctors already have a strong guess. It may help when a doctor needs proof before some care, like some radiation plans. It may help some people avoid an extra visit to hear biopsy results. But the test cannot replace a biopsy in many cases. It also cannot show how deep the cancer goes, which matters for care.

For melanoma or squamous cell skin cancer, a scrape test is less likely to help. For these cancers, the full skin piece from a biopsy gives key facts. Those facts guide care and help plan the right cut or other care.

In short, a skin cell scrape can be a helpful tool in select basal cell cases. It is quick and less invasive. But we still need better studies. Future studies should compare the cell scrape with the hand scope check. They should enroll people in a clear and fair way. They should report how readers are trained and blinded. This will show where the test helps most, and where it does not.","How accurate is exfoliative cytology ('skin scrape' cytology) for diagnosing basal cell carcinoma and other skin cancers in adults? 
Why is improving the diagnosis of skin cancer important? 
There are a number of different types of skin cancer. The most common is basal cell carcinoma (BCC). BCC is a localised cancer that can grow and destroy the skin around it. They rarely spread into the body like other cancers can. Very small or superficial low‐risk BCCs can generally be treated with treatments such as creams rather than surgery, while it is better to surgically remove BCCs that are more likely to grow and spread. Radiotherapy (a treatment where radiation is used to kill cancer cells) can also be used if BCCs are very large or cannot be removed by surgery. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is also usually a localised skin cancer. In a small proportion of cases it can spread to other parts of the body, so the best treatment is to remove it using surgery. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer as it has a higher potential to spread to other parts of the body, and so it is vital to recognise it and remove it early. If people with BCC do not receive the correct diagnosis (known as a false negative test result), their treatment can be delayed, making the surgical procedure more complicated. Diagnosing BCC when it is actually something else (a false positive result) may result in unnecessary treatment, surgery or other investigations and can cause the patient stress and anxiety. If BCC is incorrectly diagnosed in an individual who actually has an cSCC or melanoma, effective treatment can be delayed and this might lead to a greater chance that the cSCC or melanoma spreads to other organs in the body, which can be very serious. 
What is the aim of the review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out how accurate a technique called 'exfoliative cytology' is for diagnosing skin cancer. Researchers in Cochrane found nine studies to answer this question. Nine studies were concerned with the diagnosis of BCC, two with the diagnosis of cSCC and one with the diagnosis of melanoma. 
What was studied in the review? 
Exfoliative cytology means scraping the surface of a possible skin cancer with a knife and then spreading a small layer of the scrape onto a glass slide so that the cells in the scrape can be stained and looked at under a microscope. It is less invasive than skin biopsy and quick to perform, with results available immediately. This could save patients an additional clinic visit to receive skin biopsy results. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The review examined nine studies with a total of 1655 lesions (a mole or area of skin with an unusual appearance in comparison with the surrounding skin) that were given these final diagnoses*: 1120 BCCs, 41 cSCCs and 10 melanomas. 
For identifying BCC, seven studies show the effect of using exfoliative cytology to confirm BCC in lesions that doctors already suspected were BCCs. In a group of 1000 such lesions, of which 860 (86%) actually do have BCC, then: 
‐ an estimated 853 people will have an exfoliative cytology result confirming that a BCC is present. Of these 14 (1.6%) will not actually have a BCC (false positive result); 
‐ of the 147 people with an exfoliative cytology result indicating that no BCC is present, 21 (14%) will in fact actually have a BCC (false negative result). 
One study compared the accuracy of exfoliative cytology to using a hand‐held microscope (dermoscopy) for making a diagnosis of BCC but used a different method of removing cells and included patients with a higher risk of melanoma than found in the other eight studies. 
There was not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of exfoliative cytology for diagnosing cSCC or melanoma. 
How reliable are the results of the studies of this review? 
The small number of studies included in this review, poor description of how patients were selected to be included in the study, and limited information on how the test results were used to make diagnoses, reduces the reliability of our results. 
The studies did not explain how patients had been referred to have the exfoliative cytology test. Most important of all, the test was only used in people in whom doctors had already diagnosed a BCC just by looking at the skin lesion. In other words, the test was being used to confirm a doctor's diagnosis. Most studies did not include enough people with skin lesions that are similar in appearance to a BCC to be sure that this test correctly identifies a BCC. This may cause exfoliative cytology to appear more accurate than it would be in actual practice. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were conducted in the UK, across Europe and in Australia. Study authors rarely described patient characteristics, such as age and location of the lesion. The percentage of people included in the studies with a final diagnosis of BCC ranged from 18% to 90% (nine studies). For cSCC it was 4% and 18% (two studies), and for melanoma it was 5% (one study). It was not possible to tell from the studies how clinicians had decided that study participants had lesions that could be a skin cancer. 
What are the implications of this review? 
No research has been done using exfoliative cytology to diagnose a skin cancer when a patient is first seen by a doctor. The results of this review suggest that exfoliative cytology can help to confirm BCC in patients with skin lesions that a doctor already suspects of being a BCC. This test could be useful for patients with BCCs that need non‐surgical treatments, such as radiotherapy, where a tissue diagnosis is needed before the treatment can be given. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for and used studies published up to August 2016.
*In these studies, biopsy was the reference standard (means of establishing the final diagnosis).

10.1002-14651858.CD013694.pub2,"Background
Tuberculosis is a leading cause of infectious disease‐related death and is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of specific rapid molecular tests, including Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra, as initial diagnostic tests for the detection of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. However, the WHO estimates that nearly one‐third of all active tuberculosis cases go undiagnosed and unreported. We were interested in whether a single test, Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra, could be useful as a screening test to close this diagnostic gap and improve tuberculosis case detection. 
Objectives
To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in adults, irrespective of signs or symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in high‐risk groups and in the general population. Screening ""irrespective of signs or symptoms"" refers to screening of people who have not been assessed for the presence of tuberculosis symptoms (e.g. cough). 
To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for detecting rifampicin resistance in adults screened for tuberculosis, irrespective of signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in high‐risk groups and in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched 12 databases including the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE and Embase, on 19 March 2020 without language restrictions. We also reviewed reference lists of included articles and related Cochrane Reviews, and contacted researchers in the field to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Cross‐sectional and cohort studies in which adults (15 years and older) in high‐risk groups (e.g. people living with HIV, household contacts of people with tuberculosis) or in the general population were screened for pulmonary tuberculosis using Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra. For tuberculosis detection, the reference standard was culture. For rifampicin resistance detection, the reference standards were culture‐based drug susceptibility testing and line probe assays. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form and assessed risk of bias and applicability using QUADAS‐2. We used a bivariate random‐effects model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) separately for tuberculosis detection and rifampicin resistance detection. We estimated all models using a Bayesian approach. For tuberculosis detection, we first estimated screening accuracy in distinct high‐risk groups, including people living with HIV, household contacts, people residing in prisons, and miners, and then in several high‐risk groups combined. 
Main results
We included a total of 21 studies: 18 studies (13,114 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for pulmonary tuberculosis and one study (571 participants) evaluated both Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Three studies (159 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance. Fifteen studies (75%) were conducted in high tuberculosis burden and 16 (80%) in high TB/HIV‐burden countries. We judged most studies to have low risk of bias in all four QUADAS‐2 domains and low concern for applicability. 
Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as screening tests for pulmonary tuberculosis 
In people living with HIV (12 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CrI) were 61.8% (53.6 to 69.9) (602 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and 98.8% (98.0 to 99.4) (4173 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 50 have tuberculosis on culture, 40 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive; of these, 9 (22%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); and 960 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; of these, 19 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives). 
In people living with HIV (1 study), Xpert Ultra sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) were 69% (57 to 80) (68 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 98% (97 to 99) (503 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 50 have tuberculosis on culture, 53 would be Xpert Ultra‐positive; of these, 19 (36%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); and 947 would be Xpert Ultra‐negative; of these, 16 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives). 
In non‐hospitalized people in high‐risk groups (5 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 69.4% (47.7 to 86.2) (337 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and 98.8% (97.2 to 99.5) (8619 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 10 have tuberculosis on culture, 19 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive; of these, 12 (63%) would not have tuberculosis (false‐positives); and 981 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative; of these, 3 (0%) would have tuberculosis (false‐negatives). 
We did not identify any studies using Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra for screening in the general population. 
Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for rifampicin resistance 
Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity was 81% and 100% (2 studies, 20 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and specificity was 94% to 100%, (3 studies, 139 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Of the high‐risks groups evaluated, Xpert MTB/RIF applied as a screening test was accurate for tuberculosis in high tuberculosis burden settings. Sensitivity and specificity were similar in people living with HIV and non‐hospitalized people in high‐risk groups. In people living with HIV, Xpert Ultra sensitivity was slightly higher than that of Xpert MTB/RIF and specificity similar. As there was only one study of Xpert Ultra in this analysis, results should be interpreted with caution. There were no studies that evaluated the tests in people with diabetes mellitus and other groups considered at high‐risk for tuberculosis, or in the general population. 
","Plain Title
Can one quick test help find hidden TB in adults at risk?

Rationale
Tuberculosis, or TB, is a lung infection. It can make people cough, lose weight, and feel weak. It spreads in the air when a sick person coughs. TB is a top cause of death in the world.

Many people with TB do not get a test or care. They may not have cough yet. Or they cannot reach a clinic. This leaves a big gap in care.

A quick lab test may help. The names are Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. These tests check spit for TB germs. They also look for signs that a key drug, rifampicin, may not work.

Today, health staff use these tests mainly for people who have TB signs. This review asked a new question. Can one of these tests screen adults for TB even if they have no signs? If yes, clinics could find more people with TB. Then people could start care sooner. That may help stop spread.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team searched many research lists on March 19, 2020. They looked for studies in adults age 15 and up. The studies screened people for lung TB. They used Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra as the screen test.

The studies used a culture test to check who had TB. A culture lets TB germs grow in a lab. It is slow but very sure. For drug checks, they also used lab tests that show if rifampicin works.

Who did the studies screen? They screened adults at high risk. This group included people with HIV. It also included people in prison, miners, and people who live with a person with TB. The review did not find studies in the general public.

The review found 21 studies. Eighteen studies used Xpert MTB/RIF for TB screening. One study used both tests. Three small studies looked at rifampicin drug resistance with Xpert MTB/RIF. Most studies took place in places with many TB cases. Two review authors checked each study and the data.

The studies were cross‑sectional or cohort. Cross‑sectional means they checked people at one point in time. The review did not report how long each person took part.

Results
Main finding: In adults at high risk, one Xpert test can screen for TB with good accuracy. Results were much the same in people with HIV and in other high‑risk groups.

People living with HIV:
- Xpert MTB/RIF found many, but not all, people with TB. Out of 1,000 people, assume 50 had TB by culture. The Xpert test called 40 people “TB positive.” Of those 40, 9 did not have TB. The test called 960 people “TB negative.” Of those 960, 19 did have TB.
- One study also tested Xpert Ultra. Out of 1,000 people, assume 50 had TB by culture. The Xpert Ultra test called 53 people “TB positive.” Of those 53, 19 did not have TB. The test called 947 people “TB negative.” Of those 947, 16 did have TB.
- In short, Xpert Ultra found a few more people with TB than Xpert MTB/RIF. But it also gave more false alarms. Only one study tested Xpert Ultra in this way. So we should be careful with this result.

Other high‑risk adults not in hospital:
- Out of 1,000 people, assume 10 had TB by culture. The Xpert MTB/RIF test called 19 people “TB positive.” Of those 19, 12 did not have TB. The test called 981 people “TB negative.” Of those 981, 3 did have TB.
- This means the test found some people with TB in a group with few cases. It also gave some false alarms. But most people who did not have TB got the right result.

General public:
- The review did not find any studies that used these tests to screen the general public. It also found no studies in people with diabetes or some other high‑risk groups.

Rifampicin resistance:
- A few small studies checked if Xpert MTB/RIF can spot rifampicin resistance. Rifampicin is a key TB drug. When TB resists this drug, care is hard.
- In two small studies with 20 people who had resistance, the test found about 4 in 5 to all cases. In three studies with 139 people without resistance, the test correctly said “no resistance” in about 94 to 100 in 100 people. These numbers come from very small groups, so we should be careful.

What this means for patients:
- A single Xpert test can help find TB in adults at high risk. This can help start care fast. It may also help lower spread.
- Some people with TB will still get a “negative” result. So if you feel unwell, seek care again. Health staff may use more than one test.
- Xpert Ultra may find a few more cases in people with HIV. But it may also give more false alarms. Only one study tested this, so we need more data.

What this means for health systems:
- These tests can help close the TB care gap in places with many TB cases. They work as a screen tool in high‑risk adults. Clinics can use them to decide who needs more tests.
- We still need studies in the general public. We also need studies in other high‑risk groups, like people with diabetes.

Investigator conclusion:
- Xpert MTB/RIF works as a screen test in high‑risk adults in high TB settings. Results in people with HIV and in other high‑risk groups were much the same. Xpert Ultra may do a bit better in people with HIV. But we need more studies on Xpert Ultra.","How accurate are sputum Xpert tests for screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults whether or not they have tuberculosis symptoms? 
Why is using Xpert tests to screen for pulmonary tuberculosis important? 
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of infectious disease‐related death and one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using specific rapid tests as initial tests for diagnosing tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in people with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. However, the WHO estimates that nearly one‐third of all active tuberculosis cases go undiagnosed and unreported. Not recognizing tuberculosis when it is present (a false negative test result) may result in illness and death and an increased risk of infecting others. An incorrect diagnosis of tuberculosis (false‐positive result) may mean that people are given antibiotics when there is no benefit to be gained. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as screening tests for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults whether or not they have tuberculosis symptoms (such as cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats). We were interested in how the tests worked in groups at high risk for tuberculosis, including people living with HIV (PLHIV), household contacts of people with tuberculosis, miners, people residing in prisons, people with diabetes, and in the general public. 
What was studied in this review? 
Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are rapid tests for simultaneously diagnosing tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. We combined study results to determine: 
‐ sensitivity: people with tuberculosis (rifampicin resistance) correctly diagnosed as having the condition. 
‐ specificity: people without tuberculosis (rifampicin resistance) correctly identified as not having the condition. 
The closer sensitivity and specificity are to 100%, the better the test.
What are the main results in this review? 
Twenty‐one studies: 18 studies (13,114 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test for pulmonary tuberculosis and one study (571 participants) evaluated both Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra. Three studies (159 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance. 
For every 1000 people tested, if 50 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard:
PLHIV 
‐ Xpert MTB/RIF (12 studies):
· 40 people would test positive, including 9 without tuberculosis (62% sensitivity)
· 960 people would test negative, including 19 with tuberculosis (99% specificity)
‐ Xpert Ultra (1 study):
· 53 people would test positive, including 19 without tuberculosis (69% sensitivity)
· 947 people would test negative, including 16 with tuberculosis (98% specificity)
For every 1000 people tested, if 10 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard:
Other high‐risk groups combined 
‐ Xpert MTB/RIF (5 studies):
· 19 people would test positive, including 12 without tuberculosis (69% sensitivity)
· 981 people would test negative, including 3 with tuberculosis (99% specificity)
For detection of rifampicin resistance, Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity was 81% and 100% (2 studies) and specificity was 94% to 100% (3 studies). 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
In the included studies, the reference standards for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis (culture) and rifampicin resistance (drug susceptibility testing) are likely to have been reliable methods for deciding whether patients really had the conditions. We were fairly confident in the results for Xpert MTB/RIF in PLHIV, and less so for other high‐risk groups. Not enough people have been studied to be confident about the results for Xpert Ultra or for detection of rifampicin resistance. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Studies were mainly performed in high tuberculosis and high HIV burden settings. No studies evaluated the tests in people with diabetes mellitus or the general population. 
What are the implications of this review? 
In PLHIV, Xpert MTB/RIF as a screening test was accurate for tuberculosis in high tuberculosis burden settings. In high‐risk groups, Xpert MTB/RIF may assist in identifying tuberculosis, but the certainty of evidence is low. In PLHIV, Xpert Ultra sensitivity was slightly higher than that of Xpert MTB/RIF and specificity similar based on one study. There were few studies and few people tested for rifampicin resistance and no studies that evaluated the tests in people with diabetes or in the general population.

10.1002-14651858.CD012584.pub2,"To continue taking or to stop taking antiplatelet drugs for a few days before non‐cardiac surgery in adults 
Review question 
We set out to determine whether continuing to take antiplatelet drugs before non‐cardiac surgery that requires general, spinal or regional anaesthesia increases the risk of experiencing serious bleeding, ischaemic event or death in adults, when compared with stopping antiplatelet drugs for at least five days before non‐cardiac surgery. 
Background 
Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel reduce the risk of people getting blood clots, and are routinely prescribed for people who have had coronary stents inserted. They are also recommended for people with unstable angina or heart disease, or people who have had a heart attack, heart surgery or a stroke. Taking antiplatelet therapy introduces an increased risk of bleeding, which could lead to problems if a person needs non‐cardiac surgery. Stopping usual antiplatelet therapy a few days before surgery might reduce the risk of serious bleeding during surgery. Not taking these antiplatelet drugs could, however, increase the risk of a heart attack, stroke, or death. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence from randomized controlled trials is current to January 2018. We included five trials with 666 adults in the review. Three studies are ongoing. All participants were taking antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) at the start of the study. Two studies stopped antiplatelet drugs for at least five days before surgery, and three studies gave participants a placebo instead of antiplatelet therapy during this time. 
Key results 
We found low‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to the number of people who died up to 30 days or six months after surgery (five studies, 659 participants). We found moderate‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy probably makes little or no difference to incidences of bleeding serious enough to need a blood transfusion during or immediately after surgery (four studies, 368 participants). We found low‐certainty evidence that either continuing or stopping antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to bleeding serious enough to need further surgery (four studies, 368 participants), and may make little or no difference to the number of ischaemic events such as stroke or heart attack (four studies, 616 participants). 
Quality of the evidence 
Some studies had low risk of bias because they had clearly reported their methods for randomizing people to each group, and three studies used a placebo agent so that people did not know whether or not they were continuing their usual antiplatelet therapy. However, we found few studies with few events, with wide variation in results. To continue or stop taking antiplatelet drugs for a few days before non‐cardiac surgery might make little or no difference to the number of people who died, who had bleeding that needed further surgery or who had ischaemic events, and it probably makes little or no difference to bleeding that needed a blood transfusion. We found three ongoing studies which will increase certainty in the effect in future updates of the review.

Should you stop blood thinner pills before surgery not on the heart?

Rationale
Many people take blood thinner pills. These include aspirin and clopidogrel. These pills help stop blood clots. Clots can block blood flow. A block can cause a stroke or a heart attack.

People take these pills after a heart stent. People also take them if they have heart pain, past heart attack, heart surgery, or a past stroke. These pills can raise the chance of bleeding. Bleeding can be a problem during surgery.

Some doctors stop these pills before surgery. They may stop them for five days or more. This may lower bleeding during surgery. But it may raise the chance of a stroke or a heart attack.

This study asked a clear question. Is it safer to stop these pills for a few days? Or is it safer to keep taking them? The team hoped to find which choice lowers harm. They also asked if one choice lowers deaths.

The study matters to many people. Many adults need surgery not on the heart. Many also take aspirin or clopidogrel. Clear guidance can help people and doctors plan care.

Trial Design
This was a review of trials. Trials are tests that put people into groups by chance. That helps make fair groups. The review looked at trials up to January 2018.

The review found five trials. These trials had 666 adults in total. All people took aspirin or clopidogrel when they joined. The people were having surgery not on the heart. The surgery used sleep or numbing medicine.

The trials used two paths. In some trials, people stopped the pills for at least five days. In other trials, people took a look‑alike pill with no drug. This is a “placebo,” or fake pill. Some people kept taking the real pills.

The trials checked several results. They looked at deaths after surgery. They looked at strokes or heart attacks. They looked at bleeding that needed a blood transfusion. They also looked at bleeding that needed more surgery.

The time in the trials was not long. The teams checked people up to 30 days. Some checked up to six months. The abstract did not list gender details. Three more trials are still in progress.

Results
What did the trials show? Stopping the pills or keeping them both had similar results. We are not very sure about some findings. The trials were small. Still, the results were close in both groups.

Deaths were about the same in both groups. This was true at 30 days. It was also true at six months. We are not very sure about this. The data were limited.

The need for a blood transfusion was also about the same. This means serious bleeding was similar. We are fairly sure about this part. The data were a bit stronger here.

The need for more surgery due to bleeding was about the same. Again, we are not very sure. The numbers were small. Results varied across trials.

Strokes or heart attacks were about the same in both groups. We are not very sure about this part. The trials found few such events. So, the true effect is less clear.

Why is the proof not strong? Some trials had clear plans and fair groups. Three used fake pills. That kept people from knowing their group. But there were only five trials. There were few bad events. Results also varied.

What does this mean for patients? For most adults in these trials, either plan seemed similar. Stopping the pills for a few days did not lower death. It did not lower strokes or heart attacks. It did not lower serious bleeding. Keeping the pills did not raise these harms much either.

This review helps set the stage. It suggests both choices may be safe for many. But we need more proof for a firm answer. Three new trials are under way. They may give clearer results.

What should a person do now? Each case is unique. Your own risk may differ. Some people bleed more. Some have a high risk of stroke or heart attack. Your surgery type also matters.

The study team’s view is careful. They think both choices may be similar for many. They also think more data will help. Talk with your heart and surgery teams. Ask about your risks and goals. Use this review to help guide that talk.

Key points to remember:
- Blood thinners help stop clots but can raise bleeding risk.
- Five trials with 666 adults were reviewed.
- Stopping the pills or keeping them gave similar results.
- Deaths, strokes, heart attacks, and serious bleeding were about the same.
- Proof is limited. More trials are coming.","To continue taking or to stop taking antiplatelet drugs for a few days before non‐cardiac surgery in adults

10.1002-14651858.CD015207,"Background
Elevated blood pressure, or hypertension, is the leading cause of preventable deaths globally. Diets high in sodium (predominantly sodium chloride) and low in potassium contribute to elevated blood pressure. The WHO recommends decreasing mean population sodium intake through effective and safe strategies to reduce hypertension and its associated disease burden. Incorporating low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) into population strategies has increasingly been recognised as a possible sodium reduction strategy, particularly in populations where a substantial proportion of overall sodium intake comes from discretionary salt. The LSSS contain lower concentrations of sodium through its displacement with potassium predominantly, or other minerals. Potassium‐containing LSSS can potentially simultaneously decrease sodium intake and increase potassium intake.  Benefits of LSSS include their potential blood pressure‐lowering effect and relatively low cost. However, there are concerns about potential adverse effects of LSSS, such as hyperkalaemia, particularly in people at risk, for example, those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or taking medications that impair potassium excretion. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety of replacing salt with LSSS to reduce sodium intake on cardiovascular health in adults, pregnant women and children. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL, EBSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 18 August 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. No language or publication restrictions were applied. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective analytical cohort studies in participants of any age in the general population, from any setting in any country. This included participants with non‐communicable diseases and those taking medications that impair potassium excretion. Studies had to compare any type and method of implementation of LSSS with the use of regular salt, or no active intervention, at an individual, household or community level, for any duration. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full‐text articles to determine eligibility; and extracted data, assessed risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB tool, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by adults, children (≤ 18 years) and pregnant women. Primary effectiveness outcomes were change in diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP and SBP), hypertension and blood pressure control; cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality were additionally assessed as primary effectiveness outcomes in adults. Primary safety outcomes were change in blood potassium, hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia. 
Main results
We included 26 RCTs, 16 randomising individual participants and 10 randomising clusters (families, households or villages). A total of 34,961 adult participants and 92 children were randomised to either LSSS or regular salt, with the smallest trial including 10 and the largest including 20,995 participants. No studies in pregnant women were identified. Studies included only participants with hypertension (11/26), normal blood pressure (1/26), pre‐hypertension (1/26), or participants with and without hypertension (11/26). This was unknown in the remaining studies. The largest study included only participants with an elevated risk of stroke at baseline. Seven studies included adult participants possibly at risk of hyperkalaemia. All 26 trials specifically excluded participants in whom an increased potassium intake is known to be potentially harmful. The majority of trials were conducted in rural or suburban settings, with more than half (14/26) conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
The proportion of sodium chloride replacement in the LSSS interventions varied from approximately 3% to 77%. The majority of trials (23/26) investigated LSSS where potassium‐containing salts were used to substitute sodium. In most trials, LSSS implementation was discretionary (22/26). Trial duration ranged from two months to nearly five years.  
We assessed the overall risk of bias as high in six trials and unclear in 12 trials.
LSSS compared to regular salt in adults: LSSS compared to regular salt probably reduce DBP on average (mean difference (MD) ‐2.43 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.50 to ‐1.36; 20,830 participants, 19 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) and SBP (MD ‐4.76 mmHg, 95% CI ‐6.01 to ‐3.50; 21,414 participants, 20 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) slightly.  
On average, LSSS probably reduce non‐fatal stroke (absolute effect (AE) 20 fewer/100,000 person‐years, 95% CI ‐40 to 2; 21,250 participants, 3 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence), non‐fatal acute coronary syndrome (AE 150 fewer/100,000 person‐years, 95% CI ‐250 to ‐30; 20,995 participants, 1 RCT, moderate‐certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (AE 180 fewer/100,000 person‐years, 95% CI ‐310 to 0; 23,200 participants, 3 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) slightly, and probably increase blood potassium slightly (MD 0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.18; 784 participants, 6 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence), compared to regular salt.  
LSSS may result in little to no difference, on average, in hypertension (AE 17 fewer/1000, 95% CI ‐58 to 17; 2566 participants, 1 RCT, low‐certainty evidence) and hyperkalaemia (AE 4 more/100,000, 95% CI ‐47 to 121; 22,849 participants, 5 RCTs, moderate‐certainty evidence) compared to regular salt. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on blood pressure control, various cardiovascular events, stroke mortality, hypokalaemia, and other adverse events (very‐low certainty evidence). 
LSSS compared to regular salt in children: The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on DBP and SBP in children. We found no evidence about the effects of LSSS on hypertension, blood pressure control, blood potassium, hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia in children. 
Authors' conclusions
When compared to regular salt, LSSS probably reduce blood pressure, non‐fatal cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality slightly in adults. However, LSSS also probably increase blood potassium slightly in adults. These small effects may be important when LSSS interventions are implemented at the population level. Evidence is limited for adults without elevated blood pressure, and there is a lack of evidence in pregnant women and people in whom an increased potassium intake is known to be potentially harmful, limiting conclusions on the safety of LSSS in the general population. We also cannot draw firm conclusions about effects of non‐discretionary LSSS implementations. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of LSSS on blood pressure in children.

Using low-sodium salt instead of table salt may help adult heart health

Rationale
High blood pressure is common. It can lead to stroke, heart attack, and death. Too much sodium in food can raise blood pressure. Regular table salt is mostly sodium chloride. Many people also do not get enough potassium in food.

Low-sodium salt swaps some sodium for potassium. Potassium is a mineral that helps the heart and nerves work well. This swap may lower blood pressure. It may also cost little and be easy to use at home.

Some people should not get extra potassium. This includes people with kidney disease. It can also include people on some water pills or heart drugs. This study looked at both benefit and safety. The team asked if low-sodium salt helps the heart and if it raises blood potassium too much.

Trial Design
This was a review of many fair tests. In these tests, people used low-sodium salt or regular salt. The team looked for studies from all over the world. They found 26 trials. The trials took place in homes, families, villages, or whole groups.

Most trials were in rural or small towns. Over half took place in low- and middle-income lands. In total, 34,961 adults and 92 children took part. Some had high blood pressure. Some did not. No trials in pregnant women were found.

In most trials, people used the study salt to cook or at the table. The amount of sodium swapped out ranged from small to large. That swap was from about 3 in 100 to 77 in 100 parts. Most trials used potassium to replace sodium. Trials lasted from two months to almost five years. All trials left out people who should not get extra potassium.

Results
Adults who used low-sodium salt had lower blood pressure. The top number fell by about 5 points. The bottom number fell by about 2 points. These are average drops across many people. The drop was small for one person. But small drops may mean fewer heart events in large groups.

There were fewer strokes that did not cause death. That was about 20 fewer each year in 100,000 adults. There were fewer serious heart problems, like heart attack. That was about 150 fewer each year in 100,000 adults. There were also fewer deaths from heart disease. That was about 180 fewer each year in 100,000 adults.

Blood potassium rose a little. The rise was small on a blood test. Cases of very high potassium did not change much. There were about 4 more cases in 100,000 adults. There was little to no change in how many people got high blood pressure. We are less sure about other heart events and other side effects.

These adult results were from people who could safely use extra potassium. The trials left out people at clear risk from potassium. This includes people with kidney disease. It also includes people on drugs that keep potassium in. So we do not know if low-sodium salt is safe for them. If you have kidney disease, or take such drugs, ask your doctor first.

We do not know if this helps children. Only 92 children took part. The data on blood pressure in kids were not clear. There was no data on potassium or safety in kids. There were no trials in pregnant women. So we cannot say if it helps or is safe in pregnancy.

Most trials had people use low-sodium salt they add at home. We do not know if it helps when food makers swap salt in factory foods. We also have less data in adults without high blood pressure. So we are less sure how much they will gain.

What does this mean for you? If you are an adult who can safely use potassium, a low-sodium salt may help. It may lower your blood pressure a bit. It may also lower your chance of stroke and heart problems a bit. The rise in blood potassium was small in these trials. Still, talk to your doctor if you have kidney issues. Also talk to your doctor if you take heart or water pills.

In short, swapping to low-sodium salt may help heart health in adults. The benefit is small for one person. But it can add up for many people. Safety looks good for most adults. But it is unclear for some groups. We need more trials in kids and pregnant women. We also need tests in people with kidney disease. And we need to know more about salt swaps in factory foods.","Does using low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS) instead of regular salt reduce blood pressure and heart disease risks, and is it safe? 
Key messages 
• In adults, using LSSS instead of regular salt in food probably lowers blood pressure slightly. Adults using LSSS instead of regular salt probably have a slightly lower risk of non‐fatal heart conditions, such as stroke or a sudden reduced blood flow to the heart, and death from heart disease. 
• Using LSSS instead of regular salt probably also slightly increases the level of blood potassium (a mineral that keeps your heart beating at the right pace) in adults. This could be harmful for people who cannot effectively regulate the potassium in their bodies. Other evidence on safety is very limited. 
• We are not certain about effects of using LSSS instead of regular salt on blood pressure in children, or whether using LSSS is safe in children. 
• This evidence may not directly apply to people known to be at risk of high blood potassium, such as people with kidney problems or on certain medications. 
What are low‐sodium salt substitutes (LSSS)? 
LSSS are products with less sodium than regular salt. Amounts of sodium in LSSS are lowered by replacing some of the sodium with potassium or other minerals. LSSS may help lower risks of using regular salt, since eating lots of sodium and not enough potassium contributes to high blood pressure. Globally, high blood pressure is the largest cause of preventable deaths, mainly because it causes stroke, acute coronary syndrome (ACS; where less blood flows to the heart), and kidney problems. 
However, LSSS also has potential health risks. Using LSSS may lead to higher than normal blood potassium (hyperkalaemia), which causes problems with the heartbeat speed and rhythm, or can cause the heart to stop. These risks are greater in certain people, for example, those whose kidneys do not work properly to remove potassium. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out what the effects of using LSSS instead of regular salt are on blood pressure as well as on events (stroke and ACS) and heart disease death. We also wanted to know if using LSSS instead of regular salt is safe, both in the general population and in people who are known to be at risk of high blood potassium levels. 
We wanted to find this out for adults, children and pregnant women.
What did we do?We searched five electronic databases and trial registries for studies that compared using LSSS with using regular salt. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the combined evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.  
What did we find? 
We found 26 trials* involving 34,961 adults and 92 children. No studies in pregnant women were found. Most trials were undertaken in rural or suburban areas, with more than half done in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Most trials included some people with high blood pressure (22); the largest included only people with a high risk of stroke. Seven trials were done in people at possible risk of high blood potassium. All trials excluded people where high potassium intake is known to be harmful, such as people with kidney problems or on certain medications. Nearly all trials (23) examined LSSS types where some sodium was replaced with potassium. The amount of sodium replaced in the various LSSS used in the trials ranged from very small (3%) to large (77%). 
*Trials are types of studies in which participants are assigned randomly to two or more treatment groups. This is the best way to ensure similar groups of participants. 
Main results 
In adults, LSSS probably lowers blood pressure (diastolic and systolic) slightly when compared to regular salt. Using LSSS also probably lowers risk of non‐fatal stroke, non‐fatal ACS and heart disease death slightly when compared to regular salt. 
However, using LSSS instead of regular salt probably also slightly increases the level of potassium in the blood. 
Compared to regular salt, LSSS may result in little to no difference in high blood pressure and hyperkalaemia. 
We could not draw any conclusions about effects of LSSS on blood pressure control, various heart disease events, death caused by stroke, lower than normal blood potassium (hypokalaemia), and other adverse events. 
We could not draw any conclusions about the effects or safety of using LSSS instead of regular salt in children. 
What are the limitations of the evidence?  
We are moderately confident in the evidence. Our confidence was lowered mainly because of concerns about how some trials were conducted, and whether the results apply to the general population. We are not sure about the effects and safety of LSSS in children, pregnant women, people known to have a risk of high blood potassium, or those who do not have high blood pressure. We are also unsure about the effects of LSSS when used in foods not prepared at home. Further research may change these results. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to August 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013669.pub2,"Background
Self‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury regardless of degree of suicidal intent or other types of motivation) is a growing problem in most countries, often repeated, and associated with suicide. Evidence assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological agents and/or natural products in the treatment of SH is lacking, especially when compared with the evidence for psychosocial interventions. This review therefore updates a previous Cochrane Review (last published in 2015) on the role of pharmacological interventions for SH in adults. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of pharmacological agents or natural products for SH compared to comparison types of treatment (e.g. placebo or alternative pharmacological treatment) for adults (aged 18 years or older) who engage in SH. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL] and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [CDSR]), together with MEDLINE. Ovid Embase and PsycINFO (to 4 July 2020). 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmacological agents or natural products with placebo/alternative pharmacological treatment in individuals with a recent (within six months of trial entry) episode of SH resulting in presentation to hospital or clinical services. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a repeated episode of SH over a maximum follow‐up period of two years. Secondary outcomes included treatment acceptability, treatment adherence, depression, hopelessness, general functioning, social functioning, suicidal ideation, and suicide. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised trial quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence internals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI. The overall certainty of evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. repetition of SH at post‐intervention) was appraised for each intervention using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included data from seven trials with a total of 574 participants. Participants in these trials were predominately female (63.5%) with a mean age of 35.3 years (standard deviation (SD) 3.1 years). It is uncertain if newer generation antidepressants reduce repetition of SH compared to placebo (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.19; N = 129; k = 2; very low‐certainty evidence). There may be a lower rate of SH repetition for antipsychotics (21%) as compared to placebo (75%) (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.50; N = 30; k = 1; low‐certainty evidence). However, there was no evidence of a difference between antipsychotics compared to another comparator drug/dose for repetition of SH (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.58; N = 53; k = 1; low‐certainty evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference for mood stabilisers compared to placebo for repetition of SH (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.95; N = 167; k = 1; very low‐certainty evidence), or for natural products compared to placebo for repetition of SH (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.62; N = 49; k = 1; lo‐ certainty) evidence. 
Authors' conclusions
Given the low or very low quality of the available evidence, and the small number of trials identified, there is only uncertain evidence regarding pharmacological interventions in patients who engage in SH. More and larger trials of pharmacotherapy are required, preferably using newer agents. These might include evaluation of newer atypical antipsychotics. Further work should also include evaluation of adverse effects of pharmacological agents. Other research could include evaluation of combined pharmacotherapy and psychological treatment.

Medicines for adults who self-harm: what the research shows

Rationale
Self-harm means when a person hurts or poisons themself on purpose. It may or may not link to a wish to die. Many people repeat self-harm. It can lead to great pain for the person and their loved ones. It can also raise the risk of death.

Doctors use talking help to treat self-harm. There is more proof for talking help than for pills. Still, many people take mental health pills. These include mood pills, mind pills, and mood steady pills. Some people also try plant or diet products.

This study asked a clear question. Do any of these pills or natural products help stop repeat self-harm? The team thought some pills might help. If a pill could lower repeats, that would be a big gain. But we need good, fair tests to be sure.

Trial Design
This was a review of fair tests called trials. In these trials, people got a pill or a dummy pill by chance. A dummy pill looks the same but has no drug. The team looked for trials up to July 2020.

The people in the trials were adults age 18 or more. Each had an act of self-harm in the last six months. They had gone to a clinic or a hospital. Across all trials, there were 574 people. About two in three were women. The average age was about 35 years.

The trials tested four types of treatment. These were newer antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and natural products. The main thing the team looked at was repeat self-harm. Time in the trials went up to two years.

Results
Overall, the proof was weak. There were only seven small trials. The results were not firm. This means we cannot be sure if pills help stop repeat self-harm.

Antidepressants are mood pills. Two small trials had 129 people. We do not know if newer antidepressants help. The results could be due to chance. We need more and larger trials.

Antipsychotics are pills used for some mental health problems. One very small trial had 30 people. It found fewer repeats with an antipsychotic than with a dummy pill. About 1 in 5 on the pill self-harmed again. About 3 in 4 on the dummy pill did. But one other small trial compared an antipsychotic to another drug or dose. It did not find a clear difference. These trials were small. So we are not sure.

Mood stabilizers are pills that aim to steady mood. One trial had 167 people. It did not find a clear effect on repeat self-harm. Again, the proof was not strong.

Natural products are plant or diet products. One small trial had 49 people. It did not find a clear effect compared to a dummy pill. We need more work to know if any such product helps.

The trials also planned to look at other things. These were mood, hope, daily life, social life, thoughts of death, and death. The abstract did not share clear results for these. We also need better data on side effects. Future trials should track harms in a clear way.

What do these results mean for patients? For now, we do not have solid proof that pills, by themselves, lower the chance of repeat self-harm. One small trial hints that an antipsychotic might help some people. But the trial was very small. Other small trials did not find clear gains for mood pills, mood steady pills, or natural products.

Why is this study useful? It shows that the field needs better tests. We need more and larger trials that last long enough. These trials should test newer antipsychotics and other newer pills. They should also test pills plus talking help. Trials should track both benefits and harms.

The study team’s view is clear. The current proof is low or very low in quality. We need better and bigger studies to know if any pill helps adults who self-harm. Until then, we cannot make firm claims about the benefit of these pills for repeat self-harm.","Drugs and natural products for self‐harm in adults
We have reviewed the international literature regarding pharmacological (drug) and natural product (dietary supplementation) treatment trials in the field. A total of seven trials meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. There is little evidence of beneficial effects of either pharmacological or natural product treatments. However, few trials have been conducted and those that have are small, meaning that possible beneficial effects of some therapies cannot be ruled out. 
Why is this review important? 
Self‐harm (SH), which includes intentional self‐poisoning/overdose and self‐injury, is a major problem in many countries and is strongly linked with suicide. It is therefore important that effective treatments for SH patients are developed. Whilst there has been an increase in the use of psychosocial interventions for SH in adults (which is the focus of a separate review), drug treatments are frequently used in clinical practice. It is therefore important to assess the evidence for their effectiveness. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Hospital administrators (e.g. service providers), health policy officers and third party payers (e.g. health insurers), clinicians working with patients who engage in SH, patients themselves, and their relatives. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review is an update of a previous Cochrane Review from 2015 which found little evidence of beneficial effects of drug treatments on repetition of SH. This updated aims to further evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of drugs and natural products for patients who engage in SH with a broader range of outcomes. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of drug treatments for adults who had recently engaged in SH. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
There is currently no clear evidence for the effectiveness of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, or natural products in preventing repetition of SH. 
What should happen next? 
We recommend further trials of drugs for SH patients, possibly in combination with psychological treatment.

Review question 
Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the effect of timed intercourse versus spontaneous intercourse in couples trying to conceive. 
Background 
Many couples find it difficult to achieve a pregnancy and have concerns about their fertility. Each cycle, a woman is fertile from approximately five days before ovulation until several hours after ovulation, due to limited survival times of the sperm and egg. Therefore, prospectively identifying this fertile period of a woman's menstrual cycle, to guide timing of intercourse, may improve conception rates. This may reduce unnecessary medical treatment and costs of advanced infertility treatment, but could also cause adverse events such as stress. The fertile period can be identified by different methods including urinary fertility monitoring, calendar charting, observing changes in cervical mucous and basal body temperatures or follicular maturation on ultrasound. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and risks of timed intercourse on pregnancy outcomes in couples trying to conceive. 
Study characteristics 
We found five randomised controlled trials comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction, in a total of 2840 women or couples trying to conceive. The evidence was current to August 2014. 
Key results 
One large included study (1453 women) has not published usable results and could therefore not be analysed. One study reported live birth rates and found no evidence of a difference; however, the study was too small to have any clinical value. Only one study reported levels of stress and showed no evidence of a difference between timed intercourse with urinary fertility monitoring and intercourse without urinary fertility monitoring. No other adverse events were reported. Only two studies reported clinical pregnancy rates, and showed no evidence of a difference in pregnancy rates in couples with subfertility. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was assumed to be 16%, the chance of a clinical pregnancy following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%. However, if including self‐reported pregnancies (not confirmed by ultrasound), pregnancy rates were higher after timed intercourse. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. 
No difference in effect was found between couples trying to conceive for less than 12 months versus 12 months or more. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low for all outcomes. The main limitations of the evidence were imprecision, poor reporting of clinically relevant outcomes and a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished. Therefore, the findings should be regarded with caution.

Does timing sex help couples get pregnant?

Rationale
Many couples have trouble getting pregnant. This is a common worry and brings stress. It can lead to more doctor visits and cost.

A woman can get pregnant only on some days each cycle. This “fertile window” is about five days before the egg is released, and the day of release. The egg lives for only a short time after release. Sperm can live in the body for a few days.

Some people try to plan sex for these fertile days. People may use urine sticks that spot a hormone rise. Others track the cycle on a calendar. Some watch changes in vaginal fluid. Some track body heat at rest. Some doctors look at the ovaries with an ultrasound scan.

Timing sex may raise the chance of pregnancy. It could also cut the need for costly care. But trying to time sex may add stress. This review asked if timing sex helps, and if it harms.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The group was The Cochrane Collaboration. They did a careful look at fair tests called trials. In these trials, groups were set by chance.

The review found five such trials. They compared timed sex with sex not timed to the fertile days. In all, there were 2,840 women or couples. One large trial, with 1,453 women, did not share usable results.

Some trials used urine sticks to guide timing. Other timing tools were not clear or not the focus. People in these trials were trying to have a baby. Some had tried for less than one year. Some had tried for one year or more.

The trials did not give clear info on age. The time each person was in a trial was not clear. One trial did look at time to get pregnant. It found no clear gap between the two groups.

Results
Only one small trial in the review told us about live births. It found no clear gap in live births. This small trial was too small to give strong proof. So we cannot be sure of the true effect on live births.

Two trials told us about “clinical pregnancy.” This means a pregnancy seen on an early scan. These trials found no clear gap between timed and not timed sex. The range of results was wide.

Here is one way to view that range. If 16 in 100 get pregnant without timing, then with timing it could be 9 to 33 in 100. That range is very wide. It means the true effect is not clear. Timed sex might help, might not help, or could even seem worse.

Some trials also counted “self‑reported” pregnancies. These were not yet seen on a scan. With those added, timed sex looked better. If 13 in 100 get pregnant without timing, with timing it could be 14 to 23 in 100. This may mean timed sex helps some people. But we still need stronger proof.

One trial checked stress. It found no clear gap in stress between groups. No other harms were reported in the trials. This suggests timing sex did not raise harm in these studies.

There was no clear gap for people who had tried less than one year. There was also no clear gap for people who had tried one year or more. One trial checked how long it took to get pregnant. It found no clear time difference.

The strength of the proof was low to very low. Many results were not clear or not well reported. One large trial did not share its results. This missing piece could change what we think. Due to these limits, we must be careful with these findings.

What does this mean for couples? Based on these trials up to August 2014, timed sex may not raise live births. It may not raise clinical pregnancies by a clear amount. It does not seem to add stress. It may help a bit if we count early, self‑reported pregnancies. But we cannot say for sure.

More and better trials are needed. They should report live births and stress in clear ways. They should share all results. This will help couples and doctors make better choices.

If you plan to try timing, know it may or may not help. It seems safe based on what we know. If you feel stress, talk with your partner or doctor. Choose the plan that fits your life and values.","Timed intercourse for couples with subfertility

10.1002-14651858.CD013497.pub2,"Background
GM‐CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor) is a growth factor that is used to supplement culture media in an effort to improve clinical outcomes for those undergoing assisted reproduction. It is worth noting that the use of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media often adds a further cost to the price of an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycle. The purpose of this review was to assess the available evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness and safety of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of GM‐CSF‐supplemented human embryo culture media versus culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF, in women or couples undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Search methods
We used standard methodology recommended by Cochrane. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, DARE, OpenGrey, PubMed, Google Scholar, and two trials registers on 15 October 2019, checked references of relevant papers and communicated with experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing GM‐CSF (including G‐CSF (granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor))‐supplemented embryo culture media versus any other non‐GM‐CSF‐supplemented embryo culture media (control) in women undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were live birth and miscarriage rate. The secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, multiple gestation, preterm birth, birth defects, aneuploidy, and stillbirth rates. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methodology. We undertook one comparison, GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media versus culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF, for those undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Main results
We included five studies, the data for three of which (1532 participants) were meta‐analysed. We are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media makes any difference to the live‐birth rate when compared to using conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF (odds ratio (OR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.52, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 69%, low‐quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of live birth associated with conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF was 22%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media would be between 21% and 30%. 
We are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media makes any difference to the miscarriage rate when compared to using conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.36, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 0%, low‐quality evidence). This evidence suggests that if the miscarriage rate associated with conventional culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF was 4%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media would be between 2% and 5%. 
Furthermore, we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media makes any difference to the following outcomes: clinical pregnancy (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.45, 3 RCTs, N = 1532 women, I2 = 67%, low‐quality evidence); multiple gestation (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.10, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 35%, very low‐quality evidence); preterm birth (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.04, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, I2 = 76%, very low‐quality evidence); birth defects (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.01, I2 = 0%, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, low‐quality evidence); and aneuploidy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.26, I2 = 0%, 2 RCTs, N = 1432, low‐quality evidence). We were unable to undertake analysis of stillbirth, as there were no events in either arm of the two studies that assessed this outcome. 
Authors' conclusions
Due to the very low to low quality of the evidence, we cannot be certain whether GM‐CSF is any more or less effective than culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF for clinical outcomes that reflect effectiveness and safety. It is important that independent information on the available evidence is made accessible to those considering using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media. The claims from marketing information that GM‐CSF has a positive effect on pregnancy rates are not supported by the available evidence presented here; further well‐designed, properly powered RCTs are needed to lend certainty to the evidence.

Does adding a lab protein to IVF dish fluid help parents have a baby?

2. Rationale
Some people need help to get pregnant. One method is in vitro fertilization, or IVF. In IVF, eggs and sperm meet in a lab. The early embryo grows in a dish with fluid.

Some clinics add a protein to this fluid. The name is GM-CSF. It is a lab-made protein that helps cell growth. It may help early embryos grow. This add-on can raise the cost of IVF.

We asked a simple question. Does this add-on help more people have a baby? Is it safe for the parent and the baby? We also asked if the cost is likely worth it.

3. Trial Design
This study was a review of trials. A trial is a study that tests a plan. In these trials, people were put into groups by chance. One group used dish fluid with GM-CSF. The other group used dish fluid without it.

The review looked for trials in many places. The team used careful, set rules to find and judge trials. They looked up to 15 October 2019. They found five trials. Three trials had data we could add up. These three trials had 1,532 women in total.

All people were having assisted reproduction. Most were women using IVF. The trials checked if a live baby was born. They also checked if a pregnancy was lost. Other things they checked were pregnancy seen on scan, twins or more, early birth, birth defects, embryo chromosome problems, and stillbirth.

The abstract did not say how old the patients were. It did not say how long each person was in a trial. IVF cycles can vary in time. The abstract did not give those time details.

4. Results
Live birth was the main thing we looked at. We are not sure if the add-on helps. Here is one way to picture it. Without the add-on, about 22 out of 100 people had a live birth. With the add-on, the number was between 21 and 30 out of 100. This means we did not see a clear gain.

We also looked at loss of pregnancy. We are not sure if the add-on changes this risk. Without the add-on, about 4 out of 100 people had a loss. With the add-on, the number was between 2 and 5 out of 100. This was not a clear change.

For other results, we also did not see clear gains. We could not tell a clear difference for pregnancy seen on scan. We could not tell a clear change for twins or more. We could not tell a clear change for early birth. We could not tell a clear change for birth defects. We could not tell a clear change for embryo chromosome problems. There were no stillbirths in the trials that checked this.

The trust we can place in these results is low. Some trials were small. Some results did not match across trials. Because of this, these results may change with new, good trials. We need more large, well-run trials to be sure.

What does this mean for you? Based on what we have, the add-on did not show clear help. It did not clearly raise the chance of a live baby. It did not clearly lower the chance of a loss. It did not show clear safety gains or harms. The add-on can raise the cost of an IVF cycle. Right now, we do not see proof that supports claims that it improves pregnancy rates.

If you plan IVF, ask your care team about this add-on. Ask about the cost. Ask about the chance of a live birth with and without it. Ask how strong the proof is for people like you. Share your goals and values. Together, you can pick the plan that fits you.

In short, the review found no clear benefit from adding GM-CSF to the dish fluid. The safety picture is also not clear. Better trials are needed. Until then, claims that this add-on boosts success do not have strong proof.","Growth factor‐supplemented culture media for women undergoing assisted reproduction
Review question 
Does culture media containing the growth factor GM‐CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor) improve the chances of a pregnancy and live‐born baby, and reduce the risk of miscarriage, twin or triplet pregnancy, premature birth, birth defects, genetic problems in the baby, and stillbirth? 
Background 
Assisted reproduction includes processes whereby a woman's eggs and a man's sperm are combined to achieve fertilisation outside of the body. Embryos are placed in a solution called culture medium to support the growing embryo until it can be replaced into the woman's uterus. Culture medium supplemented with GM‐CSF is widely available in clinics and is often offered as an 'add‐on' to an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycle in an effort to improve the success rates of treatment. Using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture medium can make IVF more expensive. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to October 2019. We obtained data from three randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) of 1532 infertile women undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a specialised form of IVF whereby the sperm is injected into the egg. We compared GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media versus culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF for those undergoing assisted reproduction. 
What the review found 
Low‐quality evidence reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to the live‐birth rate when compared to using culture media not containing GM‐CSF. This suggests that if the rate of live birth associated with culture media not containing GM‐CSF is 22%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐containing culture media would be between 21% and 30%. Low‐quality evidence also reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to miscarriage when compared to using culture media not containing GM‐CSF. This suggests that if the miscarriage rate associated with culture media not containing GM‐CSF is 4%, the rate with the use of GM‐CSF‐containing culture media would be between 2% and 5%. Low‐quality evidence for pregnancy, birth defects, and genetic problems with the baby, and very low‐quality evidence for twin or triplet pregnancies, and premature birth, reveals that we are uncertain whether GM‐CSF‐containing culture media makes any difference to these outcomes when compared to culture media not containing GM‐CSF. Two studies looked at stillbirth, but as no stillbirths occurred in either study, we were unable to analyse this outcome. 
Overall conclusions 
Due to the very low to low quality of the evidence, we cannot be certain whether GM‐CSF is any more or less effective or harmful than culture media not supplemented with GM‐CSF. It is important that independent information on the available evidence is made accessible to those considering using GM‐CSF‐supplemented culture media. In the meantime, more large studies are needed to increase the certainty of our conclusions.

Smoking is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly coronary heart disease (CHD). However, quitting smoking may prevent secondary CVD events in people already diagnosed with CHD.  
Objectives
To examine the impact of smoking cessation on death from CVD and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), in people with incident CHD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the trials registries clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We ran all searches from database inception to 15 April 2021.  
Selection criteria
We included cohort studies, and both cluster‐ and individually randomised controlled trials of at least six months' duration. We treated all included studies as cohort studies and analysed them by smoking status at follow‐up. Eligible studies had to recruit adults (> 18 years) with diagnosed CHD and who smoked tobacco at diagnosis, and assess whether they quit or continued smoking during the study. Studies had to measure at least one of our included outcomes with at least six months' follow‐up. Our primary outcomes were death from CVD and MACE. Secondary outcomes included all‐cause mortality, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, non‐fatal stroke, new‐onset angina and change in quality of life.  
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. 
We assessed the risk of bias for the primary outcomes using the ROBINS‐I tool. We compared the incidence of death from CVD and of MACE (primary outcomes) between participants who quit smoking versus those who continued to smoke for each included study that reported these outcomes. We also assessed differences in all‐cause mortality, incidence of non‐fatal myocardial infarction, incidence of non‐fatal stroke and new onset angina. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For our outcome, change in quality of life, we calculated the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for the difference in change in quality of life from baseline to follow‐up between those who had quit smoking and those who had continued to smoke. For all meta‐analyses we used a generic inverse variance random‐effects model and quantified statistical heterogeneity using the I²statistic. 
We assessed the certainty of evidence for our primary outcomes using the eight GRADE considerations relevant to non‐randomised studies. 
Main results
We included 68 studies, consisting of 80,702 participants.
For both primary outcomes, smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk compared with continuous smoking: CVD death (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.75; I² = 62%; 18 studies, 17,982 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and MACE (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.71; I² = 84%; 15 studies, 20,290 participants; low‐certainty evidence). These findings were robust to our planned sensitivity analyses. Through subgroup analysis, for example comparing adjusted versus non‐adjusted estimates, we found no evidence of differences in the effect size. While there was substantial heterogeneity, this was primarily in magnitude rather than the direction of the effect estimates. Overall, we judged 11 (16%) studies to be at moderate risk of bias and 18 (26%) at serious risk, primarily due to possible confounding. There was also some evidence of funnel plot asymmetry for MACE outcomes. For these reasons, we rated our certainty in the estimates for CVD death as moderate and MACE as low.  
For our secondary outcomes, smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk in all‐cause mortality (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.66; I² = 58%; 48 studies, 59,354 participants), non‐fatal myocardial infarction (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.72; I² = 2%; 24 studies, 23,264 participants) and non‐fatal stroke (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 11,352 participants). As only one study reported new onset of angina, we did not conduct meta‐analysis, but this study reported a lower risk in people who stopped smoking. Quitting smoking was not associated with a worsening of quality of life and suggested improvement in quality of life, with the lower bound of the CI also consistent with no difference (SMD 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.24; I² = 48%; 8 studies, 3182 participants).  
Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence that smoking cessation is associated with a reduction of approximately one‐third in the risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease in people who stop smoking at diagnosis. This association may be causal, based on the link between smoking cessation and restoration of endothelial and platelet function, where dysfunction of both can result in increased likelihood of CVD events.  
Our results provide evidence that there is a decreased risk of secondary CVD events in those who quit smoking compared with those who continue, and that there is a suggested improvement in quality of life as a result of quitting smoking. Additional studies that account for confounding, such as use of secondary CVD prevention medication, would strengthen the evidence in this area.

Quitting smoking after heart disease helps you live longer and feel better

Rationale
Heart and blood vessel disease is common and serious. Coronary heart disease means narrow heart arteries. It can cause chest pain, heart attack, and early death. Smoking makes these problems worse.

Many people still smoke after a heart disease diagnosis. They face a higher risk of more heart events. Doctors tell people to quit, but some wonder if it still helps after diagnosis. This study asked a clear question. Do people with heart disease live longer if they quit smoking?

The team also looked at other big outcomes. These include heart attacks, strokes, and chest pain. They also checked daily well‑being. This is called quality of life. The idea was simple. If you stop smoking, your heart and blood vessels can work better.

Trial Design
This was a review of studies that were already done. The team looked for studies in many medical databases. They searched from the start of each database to April 2021. They picked studies that followed people for at least six months.

All people in the studies were adults with coronary heart disease. They all smoked when they learned they had the disease. The studies compared people who later quit with people who kept smoking. The team did not add any new patients.

In total, they used 68 studies. These studies included 80,702 people. The studies measured death from heart or vessel disease. They also measured big heart or vessel events, like heart attacks or strokes. Other outcomes were death from any cause, new chest pain, and quality of life.

Results
People who quit smoking had better outcomes. They had a lower chance of dying from heart or vessel disease. They also had fewer big heart or vessel events. These include heart attack, stroke, or death from heart causes.

The size of the benefit was clear and meaningful. The risk of another heart or vessel event went down by about one third. The pattern was the same across many studies. The results were steady even when the team tested them in different ways.

Quitting also linked to fewer deaths from any cause. People who quit had fewer non‑fatal heart attacks. They also had fewer non‑fatal strokes. One study looked at new chest pain. It found less new chest pain in people who quit.

Quality of life did not get worse after quitting. In fact, it seemed to improve a little. This means daily life and well‑being may get better when people stop smoking. People did not feel worse after they quit.

Why might this be true? Smoking harms the lining of blood vessels. It also harms the way platelets work. Platelets are tiny blood cells that help stop bleeding. When these do not work right, clots can form. Clots can block blood flow to the heart or brain. When people quit, these systems can improve. That may lower the chance of a heart attack or stroke.

No single study can be perfect. In some studies, other care may have differed. For example, people may have used different heart drugs. These things can affect risk. Still, the results point in the same direction. Quitting helps most people with heart disease.

What does this mean for you? If you have heart disease and you smoke, quitting matters. It can help you live longer. It can lower the chance of another heart attack or stroke. It may also help you feel better day to day.

The researchers suggest more studies. New work should track other heart drugs and care. This can make sure the results are as exact as possible. But you do not need to wait for more data to act. Quitting smoking is one of the best steps you can take.

Support can help you quit. Ask your care team about quit aids and programs. Many tools exist, like coaching, nicotine replacement, and medicines. Pick a plan that fits you. Each day without smoking helps your heart and your life.","Does stopping smoking make people with heart disease less likely to have another heart attack? 
Key messages 
• People with heart disease who stop smoking are likely to experience a decreased risk in future heart attacks or other events linked to the heart or blood vessels, such as stroke.  
• People with heart disease who stop smoking are unlikely to have worse quality of life. 
Smoking and heart disease 
Smoking increases the chances that a person will have a heart attack, however there is less information on whether stopping smoking can reduce the risk of having a second heart attack.  
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out whether stopping smoking after a heart attack can reduce the chances of having further heart attacks or other types of disease linked to the heart or blood vessels. If stopping smoking does prevent further illness this could motivate more people to quit smoking and encourage doctors and nurses to provide more active support to help people to stop.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that lasted at least 6 months, and that included people diagnosed with heart disease who were smoking when the study started. Studies also had to measure whether people did or did not stop smoking and whether or not they had another event linked to their heart or blood vessels, such as another heart attack or a stroke.  
Search date: we included studies published up to 15 April 2021. 
What we found 
We found 68 studies with 80,702 people. Most studies included adult men and women from the general population, however, 11 studies included only men. We looked at the combined results of 60 studies that measured events linked to heart disease and of 8 studies that measured people’s quality of life over a period of 6 months or more.  
What are the results of our review? 
Compared with people who continued to smoke, people who stopped smoking were a third less likely to die from heart disease or stroke (evidence from 17,982 people in 18 studies) and a third less likely to have another heart attack or stroke (evidence from 20,290 people in 15 studies). Our confidence in these results was moderate (death from heart disease or stroke) and low (death from heart disease or stroke, another heart attack or another stroke) respectively. Our confidence in the strength of our results was reduced because of issues with how some of the studies were designed and carried out. However, when we only examined studies of a higher standard, we continued to find that people who stopped smoking were less likely to die from heart disease or stroke. This suggests that while we may be uncertain about how big the reduction in the chance of dying is, people who stop smoking are likely to reduce their chances of dying from heart disease or stroke to some degree. We found similar results for a decreased likelihood of dying from any cause, having another heart attack that does not lead to death and having a stroke that does not lead to death.  
We also found that people who stopped smoking had a suggested improvement in quality of life compared with those who continued smoking after being diagnosed with heart disease.

Stuttering, or stammering as it is referred to in some countries, affects a child's ability to speak fluently. It is a common communication disorder, affecting 11% of children by four years of age. Stuttering can be characterized by sound, part word or whole word repetitions, sound prolongations, or blocking of sounds or airflow. Moments of stuttering can also be accompanied by non‐verbal behaviours, including visible tension in the speaker's face, eye blinks or head nods. Stuttering can also negatively affect behavioural, social and emotional functioning. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
To assess the immediate and long‐term effects of non‐pharmacological interventions for stuttering on speech outcomes, communication attitudes, quality of life and potential adverse effects in children aged six years and younger. 
Secondary objective 
To describe the relationship between intervention effects and participant characteristics (i.e. child age, IQ, severity, sex and time since stuttering onset) at pretest. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, nine other databases and two trial registers on 16 September 2020, and Open Grey on 20 October 2020. There were no limits in regards to language, year of publication or type of publication. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and requested data on unpublished trials from authors of published studies. We handsearched conference proceedings and programmes from relevant conferences. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that assessed non‐pharmacological interventions for stuttering in young children aged six years and younger. Eligible comparators were no intervention, wait list or management as usual. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We identified four eligible RCTs, all of which compared the Lidcombe Program to a wait‐list control group. In total, 151 children aged between two and six years participated in the four included studies. In the Lidcombe Program, the parent and their child visit a speech and language therapist (SLT) in a clinic. One study conducted clinic visits by telephone. In each clinic visit, parents were taught how to conduct treatment at home. Two studies took place in Australia, one in New Zealand and one in Germany. Two studies were conducted for nine months, one for 16 weeks and one for 12 weeks. The frequency of clinic visits and practice sessions at home varied within the programme. One study was partially funded by the Rotary Club, Wiesbaden, Germany; and one was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. One study did not report funding sources and another reported that they did not receive any funding for the trial.  
All four studies reported the outcome of stuttering frequency. One study also reported on speech efficiency, defined as articulation rate. No studies reported the other predetermined outcomes of this review, namely stuttering severity; communication attitudes; emotional, cognitive or psychosocial domains; or adverse effects.  
The Lidcombe Program resulted in a lower stuttering frequency percentage syllables stuttered (% SS) than a wait‐list control group at post‐test, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and nine months postrandomization (mean difference (MD) −2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) −3.48 to −0.84, 4 studies, 151 participants; P = 0.001; very low‐certainty evidence).  
However, as the Lidcombe Program is designed to take one to two years to complete, none of the participants in these studies had finished the complete intervention programme at any of the data collection points. 
We assessed stuttering frequency to have a high risk of overall bias due to high risk of bias in at least one domain within three of four included studies, and to have some concern of overall bias in the fourth, due to some concern in at least one domain. 
We found moderate‐certainty evidence from one study showing that the Lidcombe Program may increase speech efficiency in young children. 
Only one study reported outcomes at long‐term follow‐up. The long‐term effect of intervention could not be summarized, as the results for most of the children in the control group were missing. However, a within‐group comparison was performed between the mean % SS at randomization and the mean % SS at the time of extended follow‐up, and showed a significant reduction in frequency of stuttering.  
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review indicates that the Lidcombe Program may result in lower stuttering frequency and higher speech efficiency than a wait‐list control group in children aged up to six years at post‐test. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the very low and moderate certainty of the evidence and the high risk of bias identified in the included studies. Thus, there is a need for further studies from independent researchers, to evaluate the immediate and long‐term effects of other non‐pharmacological interventions for stuttering compared to no intervention or a wait‐list control group.

Help for young children who stutter: what this research review found

Rationale
Stuttering makes it hard for a child to speak with ease. Some kids repeat sounds or words. Some hold a sound for too long. Some feel tight in the face or blink. This can hurt mood, friends, and school life.

Stuttering is common in young kids. About one in nine stutter by age four. We need to know what care helps most. This review looked at non-drug care. One option is the Lidcombe Program.

The Lidcombe Program is a plan for young kids who stutter. A parent and child meet with a speech and language therapist. In visits, the parent learns how to help at home. One study did visits by phone. The goal is to help the child speak more smoothly.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. It looked at four trials. In all, 151 children took part. All were two to six years old. All had stuttering.

In each trial, kids were put in groups by chance. One group got the Lidcombe Program. The other group waited for care later. This is called a wait-list. The trials took place in Australia, New Zealand, and Germany.

All trials used trained speech and language therapists. Parents and kids went to clinic visits. In one trial, visits were by phone. At each visit, parents learned how to do the home work.

How long was each trial? Two trials ran nine months. One ran 16 weeks. One ran 12 weeks. The full Lidcombe Program can take one to two years. No child in these trials had finished the full plan.

What did the trials measure? All four looked at how often a child stuttered. One trial also looked at how fast and smooth speech was. The trials did not report how severe the stutter felt. They did not report the child’s thoughts about talking. They did not report on mood or day to day life. They did not report any harms.

Results
Short-term findings: Kids in the Lidcombe group stuttered less than kids who waited. This was seen at 12 weeks, 16 weeks, and at nine months. In one trial, kids also spoke a bit faster and smoother. These are good signs for near-term help.

Long-term findings: Only one trial looked at longer term effects. Many results from the wait group were not there. So we cannot judge long-term effects well. In the group that got care, stuttering went down over time. But we do not know how they compare to kids who waited.

What about safety? No trial reported harms. We do not know if there were any harms. We also do not know about effects on mood, thoughts, or daily life. The trials did not share those results.

How sure are these results? The trials had some limits. Some parts of the trials had problems. This lowers how sure we can be. The proof that stuttering went down is not strong. The proof that speech got smoother came from one trial only. So we should read these results with care.

What does this mean for families? The Lidcombe Program may help young kids stutter less in the short term. It may also help them speak more smoothly. But we need more good trials to be sure. We also need trials from teams not tied to the program. We need to see how kids do in the long term. We need to know more about mood, school, and life effects. We also must learn about any harms.

What should come next in this field? We need more careful trials of non-drug care. These trials should look at more than speech counts. They should ask how kids feel and live. They should track results for a long time. They should report any harms. They should also compare other types of care.

Bottom line: For children six and younger, the Lidcombe Program may help reduce stuttering in the short term. It may help speech flow as well. But the proof is not strong yet. More and better research is needed to guide care.","Medicine‐free treatment for stuttering in children aged six years and younger
What was the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to find out if medicine‐free treatment for stuttering can improve speech fluency, children's communication attitudes and the impact on the child's quality of life, and potential harmful effects in children aged six years and younger, both in the short‐ and long‐term. We collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question and found four studies. 
Key messages 
The Lidcombe Program may result in lower stuttering frequency and higher speech efficiency (i.e. number of words or syllables spoken per minute) for young children after receiving the amount of treatment included in the studies. We do not yet know the impact of the programme delivered in its entirety, as no study reported outcomes for children who had completed the programme, which is designed to last for one to two years. 
Only one study reported how treatment worked in the long run, but the effect of treatment could not be summarized, as the results for most children in the control group were missing. 
We require more high‐quality studies assessing stuttering treatments for young children, including studies that report on a broader range of outcomes and that assess treatments other than the Lidcombe Program. 
What did the review study? 
Stuttering, or stammering as it is sometimes called, is a common communication disorder, that usually begins when children are between two and four years of age. Stuttering can be characterized by repetitions of individual speech sounds, parts of words or whole words; involuntary lengthening of speech sounds; or speech blockages. Moments of stuttering can also be accompanied by visible tension in the speaker's face or voice, eye blinks or head nods. Stuttering can have a negative effect on how people feel about themselves and how they live their lives. Therefore, it is important to identify effective treatments for stuttering in young children to reduce the chance that they will experience these negative effects. 
What were the main results of the review?  
We found four studies, all of which compared young children who received the Lidcombe Program to young children on a wait‐list. In three studies, the children on the wait‐list did not receive any treatment until after the study was finished. In the fourth, the children on the wait‐list could receive treatment from their local speech language therapist (SLT) if they wanted to. At the end of the study, parents of seven children (35%) in the control group reported their child had received some treatment, either the Lidcombe Program or another treatment programme called ""Easy Does It"", while on the wait‐list. 
There were 151 children aged between two and six years in the four studies. In the Lidcombe Program, an SLT conducted clinic visits with the child and parent in person in a clinic or spoke to them by telephone. During these visits, parents were taught to conduct treatment at home during 10‐ to 15‐minute daily practice sessions. Two studies were conducted in Australia, one in New Zealand and one in Germany. Two studies were conducted for nine months, one for 16 weeks and one for 12 weeks. One study was partially funded by the Rotary Club, Wiesbaden, Germany; and one was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. One study did not report any funding sources and another reported that they did not receive any funding for the trial. 
All four studies reported the effects of treatment on stuttering frequency. One study also reported on speech efficiency. We found no studies that looked at the effects of treatments for stuttering on stuttering severity; communication attitudes; emotional (how a child recognizes, expresses, and manages feelings), cognitive (how a child thinks, explores and works problems out) or psychosocial (how a child's individual needs link to the needs or demands of society) development; or side effects. 
The included studies suggest that the Lidcombe Program may reduce stuttering frequency in young children compared to a wait‐list control group (very low‐quality evidence). One study also reported that the Lidcombe Program may increase speech efficiency in young children compared to a wait‐list control group (moderate‐quality evidence). 
Only one study followed the children up to five years after treatment started, and at that time the results for most of the children in the control group were missing. Therefore, we do not know if the benefits of the treatment lasted over time. 
How up‐to‐date was this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to 16 September 2020. One additional database was searched on 20 October 2020.  
How reliable was the evidence generated by this review? 
The quality of the results related to stuttering frequency was very low and the results related to speech efficiency was moderate. This means that we are uncertain that the treatment effect would stay the same if we added more studies to the review. More studies comparing different treatments for stuttering to a wait‐list control group are needed to know the effect of treatment for stuttering with greater certainty.

10.1002-14651858.CD007726.pub3,"Stopping or continuing long‐term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia 
Review question 
We investigated the effects of stopping antipsychotic drugs in older people with dementia who had been taking them for three months or longer. 
Background 
People with dementia may have symptoms and behavioural problems that can be distressing and difficult for carers to manage. Such symptoms (often described as neuropsychiatric symptoms, or NPS) include anxiety, apathy, depression, psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), wandering, repeating words or sounds, shouting, and behaving in agitated or aggressive ways, or both. 
Antipsychotic drugs are often prescribed with the aim of controlling these symptoms and behaviours, although most current guidance suggests these drugs should only be used for short periods of time for the most challenging behaviours. This is largely because these drugs are thought to have risks of side effects (including some that are serious), and because many behavioural problems improve without treatment. However, many people with dementia continue to take antipsychotic drugs over long periods of time. 
This review investigated whether it is feasible for older people with dementia and NPS to stop antipsychotic drugs which they have been taking for at least three months. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2013. 
Methods 
We searched up to 11 January 2018 for any study that randomly allocated some people with dementia who were taking antipsychotic drugs to continue this treatment and others to stop taking antipsychotic drugs. Study participants were followed up over a period of time to see what happened. 
Results 
We included 10 studies with a total of 632 participants in our review. We added one new study with 19 participants for this update. Most participants lived in nursing homes. The studies varied considerably with regard to the people they included, the methods they used and the outcomes they measured. 
Because the studies were so diverse, it was not possible to combine all the data numerically. We found low‐quality evidence that older people with dementia may be able to stop long‐term antipsychotics without their behavioural problems getting worse. However, in some people who had psychosis, agitation or aggression and who had improved significantly when they first started antipsychotic treatment, we found that stopping the drugs may increase the risk of the behavioural problems getting worse again. On the other hand, agitation decreased after stopping the drugs in some participants whose NPS at the beginning of the studies was relatively mild. 
We did not find enough evidence to know whether stopping antipsychotics has beneficial effects on quality of life, thinking and remembering, or the ability to carry out daily tasks, nor if the risk of harmful events ‐ such as falls ‐ is reduced. We are uncertain whether stopping antipsychotics leads to people living longer. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, evidence was low‐ or very low‐quality. This means we have limited or little confidence in the results, and that it is possible that other similar research could find something different. The main reasons for this assessment were that there were few studies that included few people, and a risk that results were not fully reported. All included studies had problems recruiting enough participants, making it more difficult for them to detect effects of stopping antipsychotics. 
Conclusions 
Limited evidence suggests that stopping long‐term antipsychotic drug use in older people with dementia and NPS may be done without making their behaviour worse. There may be benefits especially for those with milder NPS. There may be people with more severe symptoms who benefit from continuing treatment, but more research in people with both milder and more severe NPS is needed to be sure about this. The overall conclusions have not changed since the last version of this review and the number of included trials is still low. 
","Plain Title
Can older people with dementia stop antipsychotic drugs?

Rationale
Dementia affects memory, mood, and daily life. It can also cause hard behaviors. These can include fear, low mood, and lack of drive. They can also include seeing or hearing things not there. That is called psychosis. Some people may shout, pace, or act in a rough way.

These signs can cause stress for the person and for family or staff. Doctors may use antipsychotic drugs to calm the most hard acts. These drugs can help some people for a short time. But they can also cause harm. Due to this, most guides say to use them for a short time only.

Many people still take these drugs for a long time. Some signs also can get better on their own. We need to know if people can stop the drugs after long use. We also need to know who should stay on the drugs. The idea was that many people may do well if they stop.

Trial Design
This was a review of fair tests. The team looked for all good tests up to 11 January 2018. In these tests, all people had dementia. All had taken an antipsychotic drug for three months or more.

In each test, some people kept the drug. Others stopped the drug. Who kept or stopped was set by chance. The teams then watched what took place over time.

The review found 10 tests. These had 632 people in all. This update added one small test with 19 people. Most people lived in care homes. The groups in each test were not the same. The tools and goals were not the same either.

People in the tests had a mix of signs. These signs can include fear, low mood, and lack of drive. They can also include psychosis, pacing, or rough acts. The teams checked if signs got worse or better. They also looked at falls, life span, clear thought, and daily tasks.

The time in each test was not the same. The review did not give one set time. Each test watched people for a time and then wrote what they saw.

Results
What did the review find? The main point is this: many older people with dementia may stop the drug. For many, their signs did not get worse. This was more likely when signs were mild at the start.

Some people had a different path. This was most true for those who had psychosis, strong rough acts, or a lot of pace and fuss. If those signs had gotten much better when the drug began, then stopping the drug could make them worse again. In short, some people with hard signs may need to stay on the drug.

There was also a group who felt less on edge after they stopped. This was seen in people with more mild signs at the start. So, for some, stopping may calm them more, not less.

Did stopping help other parts of life? We do not know. There was not enough proof. The tests did not show clear change in clear thought. They did not show clear change in daily tasks or in joy in life. We also do not know if stopping lowers harms like falls. We are not sure if people live longer if they stop.

How strong is the proof? The proof was weak or very weak. There were only a few tests. Each test had few people. The tests used many ways to check signs. Some of the data may be missing. Due to this, the results could change if we get more good tests.

What does this mean for care? Many people with mild signs may be able to stop. This may help lower drug harms. It may not make signs worse. But some people with very hard signs may do best if they stay on the drug. A slow and safe plan to stop may help. But each person is not the same.

Why does this matter? Antipsychotic drugs can help, but they can also harm. This review gives hope that many can stop long term use. It also warns that some should not. It shows that we need more good tests. We need tests in people with mild and with hard signs.

What did the team conclude? Their view did not change from the past review. The team said that stopping long term use may be safe for many. It may help most when signs are mild. Some with very hard signs may need to go on. We need more proof to be sure.

Note: Do not stop a drug on your own. Please talk with the doctor who knows you or your loved one. They can make a plan that is safe for you.","Stopping or continuing long‐term antipsychotic drug use for behavioural and psychological symptoms in older people with dementia

10.1002-14651858.CD013693.pub2,"Background
Globally, children under 15 years represent approximately 12% of new tuberculosis cases, but 16% of the estimated 1.4 million deaths. This higher share of mortality highlights the urgent need to develop strategies to improve case detection in this age group and identify children without tuberculosis disease who should be considered for tuberculosis preventive treatment. One such strategy is systematic screening for tuberculosis in high‐risk groups. 
Objectives
To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the presence of one or more tuberculosis symptoms, or symptom combinations; chest radiography (CXR); Xpert MTB/RIF; Xpert Ultra; and combinations of these as screening tests for detecting active pulmonary childhood tuberculosis in the following groups. 
– Tuberculosis contacts, including household contacts, school contacts, and other close contacts of a person with infectious tuberculosis. 
– Children living with HIV.
– Children with pneumonia.
– Other risk groups (e.g. children with a history of previous tuberculosis, malnourished children). 
– Children in the general population in high tuberculosis burden settings.
Search methods
We searched six databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase, on 14 February 2020 without language restrictions and contacted researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Cross‐sectional and cohort studies where at least 75% of children were aged under 15 years. Studies were eligible if conducted for screening rather than diagnosing tuberculosis. Reference standards were microbiological (MRS) and composite reference standard (CRS), which may incorporate symptoms and CXR. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using QUADAS‐2. We consolidated symptom screens across included studies into groups that used similar combinations of symptoms as follows: one or more of cough, fever, or poor weight gain and one or more of cough, fever, or decreased playfulness. For combination of symptoms, a positive screen was the presence of one or more than one symptom. 
We used a bivariate model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and performed analyses separately by reference standard. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Nineteen studies assessed the following screens: one symptom (15 studies, 10,097 participants); combinations of symptoms (12 studies, 29,889 participants); CXR (10 studies, 7146 participants); and Xpert MTB/RIF (2 studies, 787 participants). Several studies assessed more than one screening test. No studies assessed Xpert Ultra. For 16 studies (84%), risk of bias for the reference standard domain was unclear owing to concern about incorporation bias. Across other quality domains, risk of bias was generally low. 
Symptom screen (verified by CRS) 
One or more of cough, fever, or poor weight gain in tuberculosis contacts (4 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 2% to 13%): pooled sensitivity was 89% (95% CI 52% to 98%; 113 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 69% (95% CI 51% to 83%; 2582 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 339 would be screen‐positive, of whom 294 (87%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (false positives); 661 would be screen‐negative, of whom five (1%) would have pulmonary tuberculosis (false negatives). 
One or more of cough, fever, or decreased playfulness in children aged under five years, inpatient or outpatient (3 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 3% to 13%): sensitivity ranged from 64% to 76% (106 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and specificity from 37% to 77% (2339 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 251 to 636 would be screen‐positive, of whom 219 to 598 (87% to 94%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 364 to 749 would be screen‐negative, of whom 12 to 18 (2% to 3%) would have pulmonary tuberculosis. 
One or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis close contact (World Health Organization four‐symptom screen) in children living with HIV, outpatient (2 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 3% and 8%): pooled sensitivity was 61% (95% CI 58% to 64%; 1219 screens; moderate‐certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 94% (95% CI 86% to 98%; 201,916 screens; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 symptom screens where 50 of the screens are on children with pulmonary tuberculosis, 88 would be screen‐positive, of which 57 (65%) would be on children who do not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 912 would be screen‐negative, of which 19 (2%) would be on children who have pulmonary tuberculosis. 
CXR (verified by CRS) 
CXR with any abnormality in tuberculosis contacts (8 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 2% to 25%): pooled sensitivity was 87% (95% CI 75% to 93%; 232 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 99% (95% CI 68% to 100%; 3281 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children, where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 63 would be screen‐positive, of whom 19 (30%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 937 would be screen‐negative, of whom 6 (1%) would have pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Xpert MTB/RIF (verified by MRS) 
Xpert MTB/RIF, inpatient or outpatient (2 studies, tuberculosis prevalence 1% and 4%): sensitivity was 43% and 100% (16 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and specificity was 99% and 100% (771 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Of 1000 children, where 50 have pulmonary tuberculosis, 31 to 69 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 to 19 (28% to 29%) would not have pulmonary tuberculosis; 931 to 969 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative, of whom 0 to 28 (0% to 3%) would have tuberculosis. 
Studies often assessed more symptoms than those included in the index test and symptom definitions varied. These differences complicated data aggregation and may have influenced accuracy estimates. Both symptoms and CXR formed part of the CRS (incorporation bias), which may have led to overestimation of sensitivity and specificity. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that in children who are tuberculosis contacts or living with HIV, screening tests using symptoms or CXR may be useful, but our review is limited by design issues with the index test and incorporation bias in the reference standard. 
For Xpert MTB/RIF, we found insufficient evidence regarding screening accuracy.
Prospective evaluations of screening tests for tuberculosis in children will help clarify their use. In the meantime, screening strategies need to be pragmatic to address the persistent gaps in prevention and case detection that exist in resource‐limited settings.

Simple checks to find lung TB in children: what works best?

2. Rationale
Tuberculosis, or TB, is a germ that spreads in the air. It can hurt the lungs and other parts of the body. It can cause long illness and death.

Kids face a high burden. About 12 in 100 new TB cases are in kids. But about 16 in 100 of about 1.4 million TB deaths are in kids. This shows the need to find TB in kids sooner.

We also need to find kids at risk who do not have TB now. They may need TB care to stop TB later. A planned “screen” can help. A screen is a quick check to see who needs more tests.

This study looked at many screens. These include: symptom checks like cough or fever; a chest x-ray, which is a picture of the chest; and a lab test called Xpert MTB/RIF. The goal was to learn how well these screens find TB in kids.

3. Trial Design
This was not one trial. It was a review of many studies. The team searched six large data sets on 14 February 2020. They found 19 studies. In each study, at least 3 in 4 children were under age 15.

The screens were used in groups at high risk. These groups were:
- Kids who live with or spend time with a person who has TB.
- Kids who live with HIV.
- Kids with pneumonia.
- Other high risk groups, such as kids who had TB before or who were malnourished.
- Kids in the general population in places with a lot of TB.

The screens included:
- Symptom checks. These used one or more of: cough, fever, poor weight gain, or less play.
- Chest x-ray. This is a picture of the chest to look for lung disease.
- Xpert MTB/RIF. This is a lab test that looks for TB germs in a sample, such as sputum.
No study in this review checked Xpert Ultra.

These studies used two ways to confirm TB. One method looked for the germ in the lab. The other method used a mix of signs, symptoms, and x-ray. Using the same items in the screen and in the “proof” can make a screen seem better than it is.

Time in the studies was not clear in this review. The aim was to learn how well the screens work, not how long care took. The team also rated how sure they were in the results. They used levels like low, moderate, or very low.

4. Results
Key point: A screen does not give a final answer. It flags kids who need more tests.

Symptom screens in kids who had contact with a person with TB:
- The symptom set was one or more of: cough, fever, or poor weight gain.
- Out of 1000 kids, where 50 have lung TB:
  - 339 would have a “positive” screen.
  - Of those 339, 294 would not have TB. These are false alarms.
  - 661 would have a “negative” screen.
  - Of those 661, 5 would have TB. These are missed cases.
- The proof strength for this result was low.

Symptom screens in children under age five in clinics or hospitals:
- The symptom set was one or more of: cough, fever, or less play.
- Out of 1000 kids, where 50 have lung TB:
  - 251 to 636 would have a “positive” screen.
  - Of those, 219 to 598 would not have TB.
  - 364 to 749 would have a “negative” screen.
  - Of those, 12 to 18 would have TB.
- The proof strength ranged from moderate to low.

Symptom screens in kids who live with HIV in clinics:
- The symptom set was the World Health Organization four-symptom screen: cough, fever, poor weight gain, or a TB close contact.
- Out of 1000 screens, where 50 are on kids who have lung TB:
  - 88 screens would be “positive.”
  - Of those, 57 would be on kids without TB.
  - 912 screens would be “negative.”
  - Of those, 19 would be on kids with TB.
- The proof strength was moderate for finding TB and low for ruling out TB.

Chest x-ray in kids who had contact with a person with TB:
- The rule was “any change” seen on x-ray.
- Out of 1000 kids, where 50 have lung TB:
  - 63 would have a “positive” x-ray.
  - Of those, 19 would not have TB.
  - 937 would have a “negative” x-ray.
  - Of those, 6 would have TB.
- The proof strength was low.

Xpert MTB/RIF in clinics or hospitals:
- Out of 1000 kids, where 50 have lung TB:
  - 31 to 69 would test “positive.”
  - Of those, 9 to 19 would not have TB.
  - 931 to 969 would test “negative.”
  - Of those, 0 to 28 would have TB.
- The proof strength was very low for finding TB and moderate for ruling it out.
- There was not enough proof to judge this test as a screen.

Limits of the data:
- Many studies used more symptoms than the ones listed above.
- Symptom words did not match across studies.
- Some studies used symptoms or x-ray both in the screen and in the “proof.” This can make a screen look better than it is.

What this means for patients and care:
- In kids who are close contacts or who live with HIV, a symptom check or a chest x-ray can help. These screens can find many kids who need more tests. Some kids with TB will still be missed. So follow-up tests are key.
- There is not enough proof to back Xpert MTB/RIF as a stand-alone screen in kids.
- We need new studies that test screens in a clear, careful way.

Bottom line:
- Screens can help find kids who need fast care or TB prevention. This is vital in places with few resources. Real-world, simple plans are needed now while we wait for stronger proof.","Screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children
Why is improving screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in children important? 
Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Most children who die from tuberculosis are never diagnosed or treated. Screening may be useful to identify children with possible tuberculosis and refer them for further testing. As well, screening could be used to identify children without tuberculosis, who should be considered for preventive treatment. A false‐positive result means that children may undergo unnecessary testing and treatment and may not receive preventive treatment promptly. A false‐negative result means that children have tuberculosis, but may miss further testing to confirm the diagnosis. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the accuracy of screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children in high‐risk groups, such as children with HIV and close contacts of people with tuberculosis. 
What was studied in this review? 
Screening tests were: one tuberculosis symptom; one or more of a combination of tuberculosis symptoms; the World Health Organization (WHO) four‐symptom screen (one or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis contact) in children with HIV, recommended at each healthcare visit; chest radiography (CXR); and Xpert MTB/RIF. 
What are the main results in this review? 
Nineteen studies assessed the following screening tests: one symptom (15 studies, 10,097 participants); more than one symptom (12 studies, 29,889 participants); CXR (10 studies, 7146 participants); and Xpert MTB/RIF (two studies, 787 participants). 
Symptom screening 
For every 1000 children screened, if 50 had tuberculosis according to the reference standard: 
One or more of cough, fever, or poor weight gain in tuberculosis contacts (composite reference standard (CRS) (4 studies) 
– 339 would screen positive, of whom 294 (87%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 661 would screen negative, of whom 5 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
One or more of cough, fever, or decreased playfulness in children under five, inpatient or outpatient (CRS) (3 studies) 
– 251 to 636 would screen positive, of whom 219 to 598 (87% to 94%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 364 to 749 would screen negative, of whom 12 to 18 (2% to 3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). 
One or more of cough, fever, poor weight gain, or tuberculosis close contact (WHO four‐symptom screen) in children with HIV, outpatient (CRS) (2 studies) 
– 88 would screen positive, of which 57 (65%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive).
– 912 would screen negative, of which 19 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
Abnormal CXR in tuberculosis contacts (CRS) (8 studies) 
– 63 would screen positive, of whom 19 (30%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive).
– 937 would screen negative, of whom 6 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false negative).
Xpert MTB/RIF in children, inpatient or outpatient microbiologic reference standard (MRS) (2 studies) 
– 31 to 69 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐positive, of whom 9 to 19 (28% to 29%) would not have tuberculosis (false positive). 
– 931 to 969 would be Xpert MTB/RIF‐negative, of whom 0 to 28 (0% to 3%) would have tuberculosis (false negative). 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? 
Diagnosing tuberculosis in children is difficult. This may lead to screening tests appearing more or less accurate than they actually are. For Xpert MTB/RIF, there were few studies and children tested to be confident about results. 
Who do the results of this review apply to? 
Children at risk for pulmonary tuberculosis. Results likely do not apply to children in the general population. Studies mainly took place in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis. 
What are the implications of this review? 
In children who are tuberculosis contacts or living with HIV, screening tests using symptoms or CXR may be useful. However, symptoms and CXR formed part of the reference standard, which may falsely elevate the accuracy of the results. We urgently need better screening tests for tuberculosis in children to better identify children who should be considered for tuberculosis preventive treatment and to increase the timeliness of treatment in those with tuberculosis disease. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
To 14 February 2020.

Abdominal aortic graft infections are a major complication following abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery, with high morbidity and mortality rates. They can be treated surgically or conservatively using medical management. The two most common surgical techniques are in situ replacement of the graft and extra‐anatomical bypass. Medical management most commonly consists of a course of long‐term antibiotics. There is currently no consensus on which intervention (extra‐anatomical bypass, in situ replacement, or medical) is the most effective in managing abdominal aortic graft infections. Whilst in emergency or complex situations such as graft rupture surgical management is the only option, in non‐emergency situations it is often personal preference that influences the clinician's decision‐making. 
Objectives
To assess and compare the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 2 December 2019. We also reviewed the bibliographies of the studies identified by the search and contacted specialists in the field and study authors to request information on any possible unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We aimed to include all randomised controlled trials that used surgical or medical interventions to treat abdominal aortic graft infections. The definitions of abdominal aortic graft infections were accepted as presented in the individual studies, and included secondary infection due to aortoenteric fistula. We excluded studies presenting data on prosthetic graft infections in general, unless data specific to abdominal aortic graft infections could be isolated. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed all studies identified by the search. We planned to independently assess risk of bias of the included trials and to evaluate the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Our main outcomes were overall mortality, amputation, graft re‐infection, overall graft‐related complications, graft‐related mortality, acute limb ischaemia, and re‐intervention. 
Main results
We identified no randomised controlled trials to conduct meta‐analysis.
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions to support any treatment over the other. Multicentre clinical trials are required to compare different treatments for the condition.

Which treatment works best for belly artery graft infection?

Rationale
Some people have a weak spot in the main body artery. Doctors call this an aneurysm. They fix it with a plastic tube, called a graft. This is in the belly area. A graft can get a bad germ, and then get infected.

An infected graft can make people very sick. It can cause pain, fever, and blood loss. It can even lead to death. This makes care for this a top need. We must learn what care works best.

Doctors use two main types of surgery for this. One is to swap the graft in the same spot. The other is to make a new blood path around it. Some doctors use drug care with long use of antibiotic pills. Antibiotic pills kill germs in the body.

We do not know which plan helps most. In a rush case, surgery is the only choice. This can be when the graft breaks open. In non rush cases, the choice can vary. It can depend on the doctor and the place.

Trial Design
This study is a wide look at all fair tests. A fair test puts people in groups by chance. The team tried to find these tests for this graft germ. They looked in many large study lists and trial sites. They searched big data banks and trial sites to Dec 2, 2019.

They set clear rules for which tests to include. Tests had to look at surgery or drug care for this infection. They could include cases with a link from the artery to the gut. This link lets germs get in and cause harm. They left out tests on other types of grafts.

Two team members checked each study on their own. They planned to rate study quality in a set way. They also set what to track in each test. These end points were death, limb loss, new graft germ, and graft problems. They would also track low leg blood flow and need for more care.

But they found no fair tests to include. No test put people in groups by chance. So they could not review and compare the plans. They could not add up results across tests. There were no trials that met the rules.

Results
They did not find any trials that fit the plan. So they could not weigh one care plan against one more. They could not say which plan helps the most. There is no hard proof to pick one best plan. We still do not know which care helps most.

What does this mean for you? If you have this type of graft germ, talk with your team. In rush cases, surgery is still the only way. In non rush cases, the plan may be less clear. Your case, your risk, and your goals will guide the choice.

This study shows a big gap in what we know. We need large, joint trials across many sites. These trials should put people in groups by chance. They should track death, limb loss, and new germ in the graft. They should track low leg blood flow and need for more care.

This will help find the best and safest care. For now, there is no clear best plan. Each choice has pros and cons. Ask your team to share what they know and do not know. Share what matters most to you.

The study team gave this clear end note. We do not have strong proof to back one plan. We need large, good trials to guide care. This will help patients and doctors make wise choices. Until then, care must fit each person and each case.","Surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections
Background 
Abdominal aortic graft infections are a serious complication following aortic aneurysm surgery. They can be managed in two ways: either with surgery or medical management. Surgery is currently the mainstay of treatment and is usually performed by two methods, one of which involves removing and replacing the infected graft, and the other bypassing the infected graft. Medical management commonly involves a long‐term course of antibiotics. Medical management avoids the risk of potential complications of surgery, but requires use of antibiotics for several months, or even lifelong. There is currently no agreement on which intervention (surgical or medical) is the most effective in managing abdominal aortic graft infections. In emergency or complex situations such as graft rupture, surgical management is the only option, whilst for those unfit for surgery, medical management is the preferred option. However, in non‐emergency situations, it is often personal preference that influences the healthcare provider's decision‐making. This review aimed to assess and compare the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. 
Study characteristics and key results 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) to December 2019. We found no trials that met our inclusion criteria. Hence there is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions relating to the effects of surgical and medical interventions for abdominal aortic graft infections. 
Conclusion 
Multicentre randomised controlled trials are required to identify the most effective method of treating aortic graft infection. By doing this, 'gold standard' guidelines can be formulated so that all patients can receive the same level of treatment without regard for where they are being treated.

10.1002-14651858.CD010299.pub2,"Benefits of patient‐reported measures of health and well‐being versus traditional follow‐up after treatment of gynaecological cancer 
Background 
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. The traditional method of follow‐up involves multiple visits to the hospital to check, for example, whether the cancer has come back (recurrence). This may cause anxiety among the patients and its cost effectiveness is questionable. Clinician and patient groups have asked for a consideration of alternative model approaches; since most recurrences are symptomatic, follow‐up of patients after treatment for gynaecological cancer may be accomplished by patient‐related outcome measures (PROMs) rather than routine follow‐up visits. PROMs is an umbrella term that covers a range of potential types of measurements, but is used specifically to refer to self reports by the patient of their health and well‐being. Use of PROMs as alternatives to follow‐up may have immense psychological benefits for the patient and cost benefit to the healthcare system. There is currently no evidence to determine whether PROMs are better or worse in helping women to live longer and better after gynaecological cancer rather than follow‐up visits. It is also unclear whether PROMs are  beneficial in terms of patient satisfaction or quality of life. 
Study Characteristics 
We performed an extensive literature search to identify randomised controlled studies that compared PROMs to routine follow up. 
Key findings 
No studies suitable for inclusion in our review were found. This highlights the need for good‐quality studies comparing PROMs to standard follow‐up. Evidence from adequately‐powered studies at low risk of bias are needed. 
","1. Plain Title
Can self-reported health check-ins replace routine clinic visits after women’s cancer?

2. Rationale
Gynaecological cancer is cancer in the female reproductive organs. After treatment, women have follow-up care. Doctors check for signs that the cancer has come back. This return of cancer is called recurrence.

Many women find these visits hard. The trips take time and money. The visits can raise fear and worry. The value for the health system is also not clear.

Most recurrences cause signs or symptoms. That means women often feel that something is wrong. Because of this, some groups suggest a new way to follow care. They ask if self check-ins by patients could work as well.

We call these self check-ins patient-reported outcome measures, or PROMs. PROMs are simple health reports from the patient. Women tell the team about symptoms and daily well-being. They may use forms, calls, or secure online tools.

PROMs may help in many ways. They may cut fear tied to clinic trips. They may be quick and easy to do at home. They may help staff spot problems when women speak up. They may also lower costs for care.

But we do not know if PROMs are as good as clinic visits. We do not know if they help women live longer. We do not know if they improve quality of life or care joy. This study set out to look for strong proof.

3. Trial Design
This was not a new patient trial. It was a study of past research. The team did a wide search of the medical literature. They looked for fair tests that compared PROMs to routine clinic follow-up.

They sought randomized controlled trials. In such trials, people go into groups by chance. One group would use PROMs as follow-up. The other group would have the usual clinic visits.

They aimed to study women who had finished treatment for gynaecological cancer. The trials would need to track health and well-being. They would look at life span and daily life. The abstract did not list the age range.

This review did not enroll patients. It used past trials, if any. So there was no set time in the study for a person. The team planned to include any trials that fit their rules.

4. Results
The key finding was clear. The search found no trials that fit. There were no randomized studies that tested PROMs against routine visits. So there is no direct proof to guide care.

Because of this, we cannot say if PROMs help women live longer. We also cannot say if PROMs improve daily life or care joy. We do not know if PROMs cut worry or costs. We cannot judge if PROMs are better, worse, or the same.

This gap in proof matters. Many groups wish to change follow-up care. PROMs sound helpful and kind to patients. But we need strong tests before wide use.

The authors call for good, fair trials. These trials should lower bias. Bias means a tilt in how results look. Trials should be “well powered.” That means large enough to spot real effects.

Future trials should track key results. These include life span and time to recurrence. They should track symptoms, worry, and daily well-being. They should also track use of care and cost.

What does this mean for patients now? For now, usual follow-up plans still guide care. If clinic visits cause stress, talk with your care team. Ask how to share symptoms and concerns between visits. Ask if PROM tools can support your care now.

In sum, PROMs may help, but we do not yet know. This review found no trials to prove benefit or harm. We need strong, fair studies to test PROMs against routine visits. Until then, teams should use current plans and patient-centered care.","Benefits of patient‐reported measures of health and well‐being versus traditional follow‐up after treatment of gynaecological cancer

10.1002-14651858.CD015085.pub2,"Background
Starting in late 2019, COVID‐19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2, spread around the world. Long‐term care facilities are at particularly high risk of outbreaks, and the burden of morbidity and mortality is very high among residents living in these facilities. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological measures implemented in long‐term care facilities to prevent or reduce the transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection among residents, staff, and visitors. 
Search methods
On 22 January 2021, we searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, Web of Science, and CINAHL. 
We also conducted backward citation searches of existing reviews.
Selection criteria
We considered experimental, quasi‐experimental, observational and modelling studies that assessed the effects of the measures implemented in long‐term care facilities to protect residents and staff against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Primary outcomes were infections, hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID‐19, contaminations of and outbreaks in long‐term care facilities, and adverse health effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author performed data extractions, risk of bias assessments and quality appraisals, and at least one other author checked their accuracy. Risk of bias and quality assessments were conducted using the ROBINS‐I tool for cohort and interrupted‐time‐series studies, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for case‐control studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively, focusing on the direction of effect. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, with the author team critically discussing the ratings. 
Main results
We included 11 observational studies and 11 modelling studies in the analysis. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. 
Most studies compared outcomes in long‐term care facilities that implemented the measures with predicted or observed control scenarios without the measure (but often with baseline infection control measures also in place). Several modelling studies assessed additional comparator scenarios, such as comparing higher with lower rates of testing. 
There were serious concerns regarding risk of bias in almost all observational studies and major or critical concerns regarding the quality of many modelling studies. Most observational studies did not adequately control for confounding. Many modelling studies used inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of the models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. 
Overall, we identified five intervention domains, each including a number of specific measures. 
Entry regulation measures (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies)Self‐confinement of staff with residents may reduce the number of infections, probability of facility contamination, and number of deaths. Quarantine for new admissions may reduce the number of infections. Testing of new admissions and intensified testing of residents and of staff after holidays may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain regarding whether restricting admissions of new residents reduces the number of infections, but the measure may reduce the probability of facility contamination. Visiting restrictions may reduce the number of infections and deaths. Furthermore, it may increase the probability of facility contamination, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is very uncertain how visiting restrictions may adversely affect the mental health of residents. 
Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies)Barrier nursing may increase the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent cleaning and environmental hygiene measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear how contact reduction measures affect the probability of outbreaks. These measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. Personal hygiene measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Mask and personal protective equipment usage may reduce the number of infections, the probability of outbreaks, and the number of deaths, but the evidence is very uncertain. Cohorting residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, although evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent contact ‐regulating and transmission ‐reducing measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
Surveillance measures (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies)Routine testing of residents and staff independent of symptoms may reduce the number of infections. It may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Evidence from one observational study suggests that the measure may reduce, while the evidence from one modelling study suggests that it probably reduces hospitalisations. The measure may reduce the number of deaths among residents, but the evidence on deaths among staff is unclear. Symptom‐based surveillance testing may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
Outbreak control measures (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies)Separating infected and non‐infected residents or staff caring for them may reduce the number of infections. The measure may reduce the probability of outbreaks and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. Isolation of cases may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. 
Multicomponent measures (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study)A combination of multiple infection‐control measures, including various combinations of the above categories, may reduce the number of infections and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides a comprehensive framework and synthesis of a range of non‐pharmacological measures implemented in long‐term care facilities. These may prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infections and their consequences. However, the certainty of evidence is predominantly low to very low, due to the limited availability of evidence and the design and quality of available studies. Therefore, true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. 
Overall, more studies producing stronger evidence on the effects of non‐pharmacological measures are needed, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries and on possible unintended consequences of these measures. Future research should explore the reasons behind the paucity of evidence to guide pandemic research priority setting in the future.

What steps in long‑term care homes may slow COVID‑19 spread

Rationale
COVID‑19 is an illness caused by a new virus. It began to spread worldwide in late 2019. People in long‑term care homes face high risk. Many are older and have other health needs. Outbreaks in these homes can lead to many hospital stays and deaths.

Homes used many steps to try to slow spread. These steps do not use drugs or shots. Examples are testing, masks, and limits on visits. We call these “non‑drug steps.” This review asked which steps might help.

We also asked what harms these steps may cause. For example, strict visit rules may affect mood. We wanted to see what the research shows so far. This can guide homes during a pandemic.

Trial Design
This was a review of prior studies. The team looked for studies on care homes. They searched several large sources on January 22, 2021. They also checked past reviews for more studies.

The team included two kinds of studies. Some looked at real homes and real events. These are “observational studies.” Others used computer models to test “what if” cases. These are “modelling studies.” The review found 11 studies of each kind. All were from high‑income countries.

The people in the studies were home residents, staff, and visitors. The main outcomes were virus spread in the home, hospital stays, and deaths. The team also looked for harms, like effects on mental health.

Two team members checked each study. They also judged study quality. Many studies had limits or risks of bias. Many models used weak input data. They often did not show how sure the results were.

This review did not enroll people. No one had to spend time in a study. It pulled together results from past reports.

Results
Big picture
Non‑drug steps may help. But proof is weak. Many results are uncertain. True effects could be higher or lower. More strong studies are needed. This is key in low‑ and middle‑income countries.

Steps at the door (entry rules)
- Some staff lived on site with residents for a time. This may have cut infections and deaths. It may have lowered the chance the virus got into the home.
- New residents who stayed alone for a time after they arrived may have had fewer infections.
- Testing new residents, and more testing of staff after holidays, may have cut infections. But this is very uncertain.
- Stopping all new entries may or may not cut infections. It may lower the chance the virus gets into the home.
- Visit limits may cut infections and deaths. But they could raise the chance the virus gets in. This is very uncertain. We do not know how visit limits affect mood and mental health.

Steps to limit close contact and spread
- Strict in‑room care rules, called “barrier nursing,” may have raised infections. This is very uncertain.
- Better cleaning and air rules may cut infections. This is very uncertain.
- Cutting group contact, like fewer group meals or events, may cut infections. We do not know for sure.
- Good hand and cough care may cut outbreaks. This is very uncertain.
- Masks and other gear for staff may cut infections, outbreaks, and deaths. This is very uncertain.
- Grouping the same staff with the same residents may cut infections. This is very uncertain.
- Using many of these contact steps at once may cut outbreaks. This is very uncertain.

Steps to find cases early (surveillance)
- Regular testing of both residents and staff, even with no symptoms, may cut infections. It may also cut outbreaks, but this is very uncertain.
- One study of real events found fewer hospital stays with regular testing. One computer study also found fewer stays. Regular testing may cut deaths in residents. Effects on staff deaths are not clear.
- Testing only when a person has symptoms may cut infections and outbreaks. This is very uncertain.

Steps once an outbreak starts (outbreak control)
- Keeping people with the virus apart from those without it may cut infections. Assigning staff to only one group may also help. This may cut outbreaks. It may also cut deaths, but this is very uncertain.
- Keeping sick people alone, called “isolation,” may cut infections and outbreaks. This is very uncertain.

Many steps used together (multicomponent plans)
- Using many steps at once may cut infections. It may also cut deaths. But the proof for fewer deaths is very uncertain.

What this means for patients and families
Homes can take steps that may help. Masks, testing, and smart staff plans look helpful. Visit rules may help, but they can also cause harm. We do not yet know the size of the trade‑offs.

The evidence is weak in many places. Many studies did not control for other factors. Many models used inputs that may not match real life. So, the true effects could differ from what we saw.

What comes next
We need more strong research. We need studies from more parts of the world. We also need to track harms, like mood and social effects. Better proof will help homes choose the right mix of steps.

Investigator conclusions
Non‑drug steps in care homes may lower spread and its harms. But the certainty is low to very low. Results may change with better studies. More high‑quality work is needed to guide care in future outbreaks.","Can non‐medicinal measures prevent or reduce SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in long term care facilities? 
Key messages 
• Non‐medicinal measures (e.g. visiting restrictions or regular testing) may prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (causing COVID‐19 disease) in residents and staff in long term care facilities, but we have concerns about the reliability of the findings. 
• More high‐quality studies on real‐world experiences are needed, in particular.
• More research is also needed on measures in facilities where most residents and staff are vaccinated, as well as regions other than North America and Europe. 
What are non‐medicinal measures? 
Non‐medicinal measures are ways of preventing or reducing disease without using medicine, such as vaccines. These include controlling people's movements and contacts, using personal protective equipment (PPE), or regular testing for infection. 
SARS‐CoV‐2 is very infectious. Elderly or disabled people, who live in care homes (long‐term care facilities), are vulnerable to infection because they live in close contact with other people, with carers and visitors entering and leaving the facility. Due to age and underlying health conditions, care home residents have an increased risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID‐19 and dying from the disease. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out how effective non‐medicinal measures are in preventing residents and staff in long‐term care facilities from becoming infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and in reducing the spread of the infection. We focused on all types of long‐term care facilities for adults, such as nursing homes for the elderly and skilled nursing facilities for people living with disabilities. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated the effects of non‐medicinal measures in long‐term care facilities. To be included, studies had to report how many infections, hospitalisations or deaths the measures prevented in residents or staff, or whether the measures prevented the introduction of the virus into the facilities or prevented outbreaks within facilities. We included any type of study, including observational studies that used ‘real‐world’ data, or modelling studies based on assumed data from computer‐generated simulations. 
What did we find? 
We found 22 studies, 11 observational and 11 modelling studies. All studies were conducted in North America or Europe. 
There were four main types of measures.
1.Entry regulation measures to prevent residents, staff or visitors introducing the virus into the facility. Measures included staff confining themselves with residents, quarantine for newly‐admitted residents, testing new admissions, not allowing the admission of new residents, and preventing visitors from entering facilities. 
2. Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures to prevent people passing on the virus. Measures included wearing masks or PPE, social distancing, extra cleaning, reducing contact between residents and among staff, and placing residents and staff in care groups and limiting contact between groups. 
3. Surveillance measures designed to identify an outbreak early. Measures included regular testing of residents or staff regardless of symptoms, and symptom‐based testing. 
4. Outbreak control measures to reduce the consequences of an outbreak. Measures included isolation of infected residents, and separating infected and non‐infected residents or staff caring for them. 
Some studies used a combination of these measures.
Main results 
Entry regulation measures  (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies) 
Most studies showed that such measures were beneficial, but some studies found no effects or unwanted effects, such as depression and delirium among residents in the context of visiting restrictions. 
Contact‐regulating and transmission‐reducing measures  (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies) 
Some measures may be beneficial, but often the evidence is very uncertain.
Surveillance measures  (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies) 
Routine testing of residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, hospitalisations and deaths among residents, although the evidence on the number of deaths among staff was less clear. Testing more often, getting test results faster, and using more accurate tests were predicted to have more beneficial effects. 
Outbreak control measures  (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies) 
These measures may reduce the number of infections and the risk of outbreaks in facilities, but often the evidence is very uncertain. 
Combination measures  (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study) 
A combination of different measures may be effective in reducing the number of infections and deaths. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in these results is limited. Many studies used mathematical prediction rather than real‐world data, and we cannot be confident that the model assumptions are accurate. Most observational studies did not use the most reliable methods. This means we cannot be confident that the measure caused the effect, for example, that testing of residents reduced the number of deaths. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
This review includes studies published up to 22 January 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013483.pub2,"Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs mostly in people with chronic liver disease. Worldwide, it ranks sixth in terms of incidence of cancer, and fourth in terms of cancer‐related deaths. Contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is used as an add‐on test to confirm the presence of focal liver lesions suspected as hepatocellular carcinoma after prior diagnostic tests such as abdominal ultrasound or measurement of alpha‐foetoprotein, or both. According to guidelines, a single contrast‐enhanced imaging investigation, with either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may show the typical hepatocellular carcinoma hallmarks in people with cirrhosis, which will be sufficient to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma. However, a significant number of hepatocellular carcinomas show atypical imaging features, and therefore, are missed at imaging. 
Dynamic CEUS images are obtained similarly to CT and MRI images. CEUS differentiates between arterial and portal venous phases, in which sonographic hepatocellular carcinoma hallmarks, such as arterial hyperenhancement and subsequent washout appearance, are investigated. The advantages of CEUS over CT and MRI include real‐time imaging, use of contrast agents that do not contain iodine and are not nephrotoxic, and quick image acquisition. Despite the advantages, the use of CEUS in the diagnostic algorithm for HCC remains controversial, with disagreement on relevant guidelines. 
There is no clear evidence of the benefit of surveillance programmes in terms of overall survival as the conflicting results can be a consequence of an inaccurate detection, ineffective treatment, or both. Therefore, assessing the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS may clarify whether the absence of benefit could be related to underdiagnosis. Furthermore, an assessment of the accuracy of CEUS for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is needed for either diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma or ruling it out in people with chronic liver disease who are not included in surveillance programmes. 
Objectives
1. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and at any stage in adults with chronic liver disease, in a surveillance programme or in a clinical setting. 
2. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS for the diagnosis of resectable hepatocellular carcinoma in people with chronic liver disease and identify potential sources of heterogeneity in the results. 
Search methods
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The last date of search was 5 November 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease, with cross‐sectional designs, using one of the acceptable reference standards, such as pathology of the explanted liver, and histology of resected or biopsied focal liver lesion with at least a six‐month follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods to screen studies, extract data, and assess the risk of bias and applicability concerns, using the QUADAS‐2 checklist. We used the bivariate model and provided estimates of summary sensitivity and specificity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We presented uncertainty‐of‐the‐accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Main results
We included 23 studies with 6546 participants. Studies were published between 2001 and 2021. We judged all 23 studies at high‐risk of bias in at least one domain, and 13/23 studies at high concern for applicability. Most studies used different reference standards to exclude the presence of the target condition. The time interval between the index test and the reference standard was rarely defined. We also had major concerns on their applicability due to the characteristics of the participants. 
– CEUS for hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and stage: sensitivity 77.8% (95% CI 69.4% to 84.4%) and specificity 93.8% (95% CI 89.1% to 96.6%) (23 studies, 6546 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
– CEUS for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: sensitivity 77.5% (95% CI 62.9% to 87.6%) and specificity 92.7% (95% CI 86.8% to 96.1%) (13 studies, 1257 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
The observed heterogeneity in the results remains unexplained. The sensitivity analyses, including only studies with clearly prespecified positivity criteria and only studies in which the reference standard results were interpreted with no knowledge of the results about the index test, showed no differences in the results. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that by using CEUS, as an add‐on test following abdominal ultrasound, to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and stage, 22% of people with hepatocellular carcinoma would be missed, and 6% of people without hepatocellular carcinoma would unnecessarily undergo further testing or inappropriate treatment. As to resectable hepatocellular carcinoma, we found that 23% of people with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma would incorrectly be unresected, while 8% of people without hepatocellular carcinoma would undergo further inappropriate testing or treatment. The uncertainty resulting from the high risk of bias of the included studies, heterogeneity, and imprecision of the results and concerns on their applicability limit our ability to draw confident conclusions.

How well contrast ultrasound finds liver cancer in people with long-term liver disease

Rationale
Liver cancer, also called HCC, often grows in a scarred liver. It is common around the world. It causes many deaths. Doctors want to find it early.

Scans can help. CT and MRI can show classic signs of this cancer. But some tumors do not look classic. Then the scan may miss them.

Contrast ultrasound (CEUS) is another scan. It uses sound waves and a tiny gas bubble dye. It shows blood flow in real time. It does not use iodine. It is fast and easier on the kidneys.

Rules for care do not agree on this test. Some say to use it. Some say not to use it. We need to know how well it works. The main question was: Does CEUS give the right answer? The team also looked at tumors that a surgeon can cut out.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team used strict Cochrane steps. They looked for all good studies up to early November 2021. They found 23 studies from the years 2001 to 2021.

The studies had 6,546 adults with long-term liver disease. Some were in clinic care. Some were in watch programs. All had CEUS to check a spot in the liver. The true answer came from lab study of tissue from surgery or a needle. Some had check visits for at least six months to be sure.

These were cross-section tests. That means the scan and the truth check were done close in time. Many papers did not state the time gap. The summary did not report age ranges or gender mix. The scan visit was short. Some people then had months of follow-up.

Results
First, the team asked about any liver tumor size or stage. They asked, “How many with cancer will CEUS find?” Out of 100 people who do have liver cancer, CEUS found about 78. It missed about 22 out of 100.

They also asked, “How many without cancer will CEUS clear?” Out of 100 people who do not have liver cancer, CEUS gave the all clear to about 94. About 6 out of 100 would be told they may have cancer, when they do not. Those people could get more tests or treatment they do not need.

Next, the team looked at tumors a surgeon can cut out. Out of 100 people who do have a tumor that can be cut out, CEUS found about 78. It missed about 23 out of 100. Out of 100 people who do not have liver cancer, CEUS gave the all clear to about 93. About 8 out of 100 would be told they may have cancer, when they do not.

In many places, doctors use CEUS after a first liver ultrasound. This adds more detail in real time. The numbers above reflect CEUS used in this way. In short, CEUS helps many people. But it can still miss some tumors. It can also give some people a false alarm.

Why do these numbers matter? If CEUS misses a tumor, care may be late. If CEUS gives a false alarm, a person may get more tests or even treatment they do not need. So, it is key to know these trade-offs.

How sure are we about these results? The team had low trust in the numbers. Many of the 23 studies had flaws. The people in the studies were not all the same. The test rules were not always clear. The time gap from test to truth check was often not stated. These things can change how well a test seems to work.

The results also varied across studies. The team could not find a clear reason for this. They tried checks that used stricter rules. The results did not change much. Still, because of the study flaws and the mix of people, we must be careful in how we use these numbers.

What does this mean for patients? CEUS has real strengths. It is fast. It shows blood flow in real time. It avoids iodine and is easier on the kidneys. For many people, it can help doctors make a choice on next steps. But CEUS alone may not be enough to rule in or rule out liver cancer for all. Some people may still need CT, MRI, a biopsy, or time on follow-up.

What does this mean for the field? We need better studies. Future work should use clear test rules. It should report the time from scan to truth check. It should include a clear mix of patients. It should state who was in the study. With stronger data, we can know the true value of CEUS.

In sum, CEUS can help, but it is not perfect. Out of 100 people with liver cancer, about 22 may be missed. Out of 100 people without liver cancer, about 6 to 8 may get a false alarm. Doctors should weigh these facts. They should use CEUS with care and with other tests when needed.","How accurate are contrast‐enhanced ultrasound scans for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma?
Key messages 
In adults with chronic liver disease, contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can miss diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma in around 22.2% of people who would not then receive timely or appropriate treatment, and would fail to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma in 6.2% of people who could receive unnecessary further testing or treatment. 
In the subset of people who are able have the hepatocellular carcinoma removed by surgery, CEUS probably misses hepatocellular carcinoma in 22.5% of people who could undergo surgery to remove part of their liver while it would erroneously find cancer in 7.3% of people who would undergo unnecessary further test or surgery. 
As there were some problems with the way the studies were conducted, CEUS to detect hepatocellular carcinoma may appear more accurate than it actually is. 
Why is improving the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma important? 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is cancer originating in the liver. It is sixth in terms of occurrences of cancer and fourth in terms of cancer‐related deaths worldwide. It occurs mostly in people with chronic liver disease regardless of the exact cause. People with blood test or ultrasound results that suggest they may have hepatocellular carcinoma may go on to have further tests, such as imaging or a biopsy (where a small piece of the liver is removed and examined). If the cancer is detected early, people may have part of the liver removed or have a liver transplant. In advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, they may need chemotherapy. If hepatocellular carcinoma is missed at diagnostic testing, people will not receive appropriate treatment. However, incorrectly diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma when it is not present means that people may undergo unnecessary testing or treatment. 
What is contrast‐enhanced ultrasound and how can it diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma? 
CEUS can detect abnormalities in the liver that might be due to cancer and, using contrast agents, confirm the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. These contrast agents are safe. CEUS is used in clinical practice to confirm the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in people in whom suspicion was raised by prior performed abdominal ultrasound or a blood test to measure alpha‐foetoprotein. 
The role of CEUS in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma remains controversial between guidelines. Previous systematic reviews have assessed the performance of CEUS in detecting hepatocellular carcinoma but they have included different studies and found different results. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if CEUS is accurate enough to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease (a progressive deterioration of liver functions for more than six months). We were interested first in hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and severity and, second, in hepatocellular carcinomas that were suitable for surgical removal (resection). 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the accuracy of diagnostic tests of CEUS scans compared to the best available tests to confirm hepatocellular carcinoma in adults with chronic liver disease. The best available test is examination of the liver, or part of it, under a microscope. 
What did we find? 
We found 23 studies with 6546 adults.
Around 690 (69%) out of 1000 adults with chronic liver disease had a confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and severity. Considering these 1000 people, CEUS: 
– correctly detected liver cancer in 537 people;
– missed liver cancer in 153 people;
– incorrectly detected cancer in 19 people;
– correctly detected no cancer in 291 people.
Around 690 (69%) out of 1000 adults with chronic liver disease had a confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma that could be removed by surgery. Considering these 1000 people, CEUS: 
– correctly detected liver cancer in 535 people;
– missed liver cancer in 155 people;
– incorrectly detected cancer in 23 people;
– correctly detected no cancer in 287 people.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is limited as the studies used different methods to select study participants and used different reference standards. This means that CEUS scans may be more or less accurate than what the evidence suggests. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 5 November 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD011683.pub2,"Targeted mass media interventions to encourage healthier behaviours in adult, ethnic minorities 
Background and review question 
Health authorities and non‐governmental organisations often use mass media interventions (e.g. leaflets, radio and TV advertisements, posters and social media) to encourage healthier behaviours related to physical activity, dietary patterns, tobacco use or alcohol consumption, among others. In this review, we consider the effects of mass media interventions targeted towards ethnic minorities. A targeted intervention is designed for and considers the characteristics of a specific group, ideally providing ethnic minority groups equal opportunities and resources to access information, life skills, and opportunities to make healthier choices. However, we do not know whether targeted mass media strategies are more effective in reaching and influencing ethnic minorities than mass media strategies developed for the general population. 
Study characteristics 
We found six studies, all from the USA, four of which targeted African Americans and two which targeted Latino or Chinese immigrants. Of the studies, four were experimental (1693 volunteers) and two reported the results of large, targeted campaigns run in whole communities and cities. The evidence is current to August 2016. 
Key results 
The available evidence is insufficient to conclude whether targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups are more, less or equally effective in changing health behaviours than general mass media interventions. Only one study compared participants' smoking habits and intentions to quit following the receipt of either a culturally adapted smoking advice booklet or a booklet developed for the general population. They found little or no differences in smoking behaviours between the groups. 
When compared to no mass media intervention, a targeted mass media intervention may increase the number of calls to smoking quit lines, but the effect on health behaviours is unclear. This conclusion is based on findings from three studies. One study gave participants access to a series of 12 live shows on cable TV with information on how to maintain a healthy weight through diet and physical activity. Compared to women who did not watch the shows, participants reported slightly increased physical activity and some positive changes to their dietary patterns; however, their body weight was no different over time. Two other studies were large‐scale targeted campaigns in which smokers were encouraged to call a quit line for smoking cessation advice. The number of telephone calls from the target population increased considerably during the campaign. 
This review also compared targeted mass media interventions versus mass media interventions with added personal interactions. These findings, based on three studies, were inconclusive. 
None of the studies reported whether the interventions could have had any adverse effects, such as possible stigmatisation or increased resistance to messages. 
Further studies directly comparing targeted mass media interventions with general mass media interventions would be useful. Few studies have investigated the effects of targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups who primarily speak a non‐dominant language. 
Quality of the evidence 
Our confidence in the evidence of effect on all main outcomes is low to very low. This means that the true effect may be different or substantially different from the results presented in this review. We have moderate confidence in the estimated increase in the number of calls to smoking quit lines. 
","1. Plain Title
Do targeted health ads help adults in minority groups change habits?

2. Rationale
Good health habits can be hard to start and keep. These habits include more movement, better food, less smoking, and low alcohol use. Poor habits can lead to heart disease, stroke, cancer, and other serious illness. This harm can be worse in some minority groups.

Health groups use many tools to share health tips. These tools include TV, radio, leaflets, posters, and social media. We call this “mass media.” Some messages try to fit a group’s culture and needs. We call these “targeted” messages. They aim to use the right tone, words, images, and places.

Many people hope that targeted media works better than messages for all people. The idea is that people pay more attention when the message feels like “me.” It may be easier to act when the advice fits daily life. This review asked if that hope is true.

We need clear answers. Health groups spend time and money on these ads. They want to help people of many races, roots, and tongues. This study looked at what we know so far. It also looked at what we still do not know.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of six studies. All six took place in the United States. Four trials worked with African American adults. Two trials worked with Latino or Chinese adult immigrants.

Four studies were tests with set groups. In those four, there were 1,693 volunteers in total. Two studies were large city or community campaigns. The media used were booklets, TV shows, and ads that urged calls to quit lines.

All people in the studies were adults. The abstract did not give an age range. It did not report the mix of women and men. The amount of time people took part was not clear in the abstract. The review used studies found up to August of 2016.

The review asked three main “How do they match up?” questions:
- Targeted media versus general media for all people.
- Targeted media versus no media at all.
- Targeted media alone versus targeted media plus in‑person contact.

The review also looked for any harms. Harms could include stigma or push back from the ads.

4. Results
First, the big picture. We cannot tell if targeted media works better than general media. The proof we have is not strong. The real effect could be very different.

Only one study made a head‑to‑head match. It gave one group a quit‑smoking booklet made for their culture. It gave the other group a booklet made for the full public. People in both groups had about the same smoking habits. They also had about the same plans to quit.

When we look at targeted media versus no media, we see one clear thing. Targeted media may lead to more calls to quit lines. A quit line is a free phone help line for people who want to stop smoking. Three studies back this point. We have some trust in this call boost result. But we still do not know if more calls mean more people who quit.

One of the studies used TV. It ran 12 live cable shows. The shows gave tips on food and movement to help keep a healthy weight. Women who saw the shows said they moved a bit more. They also said they ate in a better way. But their weight did not change over time.

Two other studies were large city campaigns. They urged smokers in the target group to call a quit line. During the campaigns, calls from the target group went up a lot. That shows these ads can help people reach support. But we still do not know if people then quit more.

What about adding in‑person help to targeted media? Three studies looked at this. The results were mixed and not clear. We cannot say if the add‑on helps more than media alone.

No study in the review checked for harms. We do not know if any ad caused stigma. We do not know if people pushed back against the message. This is an important gap.

The proof in this field is weak over all. For most results, our trust is low or very low. That means the true effect may be different, or very different, from what we saw. We have more trust, but not full trust, that the ads can raise calls to quit lines.

This review points to needs for the future. We need more trials that match targeted media with general media. We need more work with groups who speak a non‑mainstream tongue. We also need to track harm, not just help. And we need to track if people change habits, not just if they call a number or say they plan to change.

What does this mean for patients and the public? Targeted ads can help people find help lines. They may help some people get started. But we do not yet know if they change core habits more than general ads. We need better and larger studies to guide what to do next.","Targeted mass media interventions to encourage healthier behaviours in adult, ethnic minorities

10.1002-14651858.CD011357.pub2,"Antibiotics for bacterial infection in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms 
What is the issue? Bacteria in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms of urine infection is called asymptomatic bacteriuria. Up to one in two people with a kidney transplant will develop a bacterial infection of the urine (bacteriuria) at some point after transplantation. Bacteriuria with symptoms like fever, chills, painful urination, abdominal pain and blood in urine is a urinary tract infection (UTI). Bacteriuria often occurs without symptoms and it is frequently treated with antibiotics with the idea this might help avoid subsequent UTI. Avoiding UTI might improve patient and transplant survival. However, it is unclear how many people with asymptomatic bacteriuria go on to develop UTI symptoms; whether treatment with antibiotics truly avoids UTI; or whether treatment when asymptomatic improves survival of both patient and kidney. Also, there can be downsides to taking antibiotics. Taking regular antibiotics might mean that bacteria resistant to antibiotics are encouraged, and taking antibiotics might cause diarrhoea and other adverse events. There are also antibiotic costs to consider. This review looked at whether treating with antibiotics is beneficial of harmful. 
What did we do? 
We searched the literature up to September 2017 and identified two studies (212 participants) that were evaluated in this review. These studies compared antibiotics versus no treatment. 
What did we find? The bacterial infection of the urine often persisted, whether antibiotics were given or not. It was uncertain whether antibiotics prevented symptomatic urinary infection or increased the risk of selecting bacteria resistant to antibiotics, because there were too few data and several limitations in the included studies. Also, it was unclear whether the use of antibiotics in case of urinary infection without symptoms reduced the risks of graft rejection, need for hospitalisation due to symptoms of urinary infection, or mortality, or whether antibiotics improved the function of the kidney transplant. One study with 112 participants suggested there were no severe harmful reactions caused by the antibiotic treatment, and non‐severe adverse events appeared to be rare. 
Conclusions It is uncertain whether antibiotics are beneficial in kidney transplant recipients with bacteria in their urine but no symptoms. In one study, participants were assigned to antibiotics or no therapy by a method that was not random (i.e. according to patients' transplant code). In both studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving (i.e. antibiotics or no therapy), which may have influenced the results. Last, we had not enough data to estimate with precision some effects of antibiotics. More research is needed. 
","Plain Title
Should people with a kidney transplant take antibiotics for urine germs when they feel fine?

Rationale
Many people with a new kidney get germs in their urine. This is common. It can happen at any time after the transplant. 
Urine germs can cause a urinary tract infection, or UTI. A UTI can cause fever, chills, pain with pee, belly pain, or blood in pee.
But many people have urine germs and feel fine. This is called “asymptomatic bacteriuria.” That means there are germs in the urine, but no signs of infection.

Some doctors give antibiotics when people feel fine. They hope this will stop a later UTI. They also hope it will help the new kidney last and help the person live longer.
Antibiotics can kill germs. So they may help. But it is not clear if they do help in this case.
Antibiotics can also harm. They can cause side effects. One side effect is diarrhea. Another risk is “antibiotic resistance.” That means germs can learn to fight the drug. If that happens, the drug may not work later. Antibiotics also cost money.

This review asked a key question. Do antibiotics help people with a kidney transplant who have urine germs but no symptoms? Or do they do more harm than good?
We need good proof to guide care for these patients. That is why this study was done.

Trial Design
This was a review of past research, not one new trial. The team searched medical papers up to September 2017.
They found two studies. Together, these studies had 212 people. All had a kidney transplant. All had germs in their urine but no symptoms of UTI.

The two studies compared two plans:
- Give antibiotics.
- Do not give antibiotics.

In one study with 112 people, the way they chose treatment was not by chance. People got a plan based on their transplant code. In both studies, people knew their plan. So did the doctors. This can affect results.
The studies did not give details on age or gender. The time each person stayed in the study was not clear in the review.
So, this review looked at what we can learn from those two studies, with those limits in mind.

- Urine germs often stayed, even if people took antibiotics. The germs did not always go away.
- We do not know if antibiotics stop UTIs with symptoms. The studies were too small to be sure.
- We do not know if antibiotics make germs more drug resistant. There was not enough good data.
- We do not know if antibiotics lower the chance of the body attacking the new kidney. This is called rejection. The studies did not show clear answers.
- We do not know if antibiotics cut the need to go to the hospital for a UTI later. The data were not clear.
- We do not know if antibiotics help the new kidney work better. That was not proven.
- We do not know if antibiotics lower the risk of death. That was not shown.

What about side effects?
One study with 112 people did not find severe side effects due to antibiotics. Mild side effects were rare. But we need more data to be sure about safety.

What limits were there?
There were few people in these studies. That makes it hard to give firm answers.
In one study, people were not picked by chance for a plan. That can cause bias. Bias means the way the study was done can tilt the results.
In both studies, people knew if they took antibiotics. This can also affect results.
There was not enough good data to make strong claims.

What do these results mean for patients?
Right now, we do not know if antibiotics help when there are urine germs but no symptoms after a kidney transplant.
Antibiotics may not clear the germs. They may not stop a later UTI. They may not protect the new kidney or help people live longer.
Antibiotics can have side effects. They can also make germs harder to treat in the future.
So, the choice to treat should be careful and personal.

How is this study useful for the field?
It shows we need better trials. We need trials where people are picked by chance for each plan. We need trials where people and doctors do not know the plan during the study. We need more people in the trials. We also need clear data on safety and on drug resistance.

Conclusions from the investigators
It is not clear that antibiotics help people with a kidney transplant who have urine germs but no symptoms. It is also not clear that antibiotics cause harm in this case. We need more and better research to know what to do.

What should patients do now?
If you have a kidney transplant and urine germs but feel fine, ask your care team about these results. Ask about your own risks. Ask about signs to watch for, like fever or pain with pee. Ask if and when you should take antibiotics. Your care plan should fit you and your health.","Antibiotics for bacterial infection in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms 
What is the issue? Bacteria in the urine in kidney transplant recipients when there are no symptoms of urine infection is called asymptomatic bacteriuria. Up to one in two people with a kidney transplant will develop a bacterial infection of the urine (bacteriuria) at some point after transplantation. Bacteriuria with symptoms like fever, chills, painful urination, abdominal pain and blood in urine is a urinary tract infection (UTI). Bacteriuria often occurs without symptoms and it is frequently treated with antibiotics with the idea this might help avoid subsequent UTI. Avoiding UTI might improve patient and transplant survival. However, it is unclear how many people with asymptomatic bacteriuria go on to develop UTI symptoms; whether treatment with antibiotics truly avoids UTI; or whether treatment when asymptomatic improves survival of both patient and kidney. Also, there can be downsides to taking antibiotics. Taking regular antibiotics might mean that bacteria resistant to antibiotics are encouraged, and taking antibiotics might cause diarrhoea and other adverse events. There are also antibiotic costs to consider. This review looked at whether treating with antibiotics is beneficial of harmful. 
What did we do? 
We searched the literature up to September 2017 and identified two studies (212 participants) that were evaluated in this review. These studies compared antibiotics versus no treatment. 
What did we find? The bacterial infection of the urine often persisted, whether antibiotics were given or not. It was uncertain whether antibiotics prevented symptomatic urinary infection or increased the risk of selecting bacteria resistant to antibiotics, because there were too few data and several limitations in the included studies. Also, it was unclear whether the use of antibiotics in case of urinary infection without symptoms reduced the risks of graft rejection, need for hospitalisation due to symptoms of urinary infection, or mortality, or whether antibiotics improved the function of the kidney transplant. One study with 112 participants suggested there were no severe harmful reactions caused by the antibiotic treatment, and non‐severe adverse events appeared to be rare. 
Conclusions It is uncertain whether antibiotics are beneficial in kidney transplant recipients with bacteria in their urine but no symptoms. In one study, participants were assigned to antibiotics or no therapy by a method that was not random (i.e. according to patients' transplant code). In both studies, participants knew which treatment they were receiving (i.e. antibiotics or no therapy), which may have influenced the results. Last, we had not enough data to estimate with precision some effects of antibiotics. More research is needed.

10.1002-14651858.CD007565.pub2,"Clear survival benefit is achieved if all or most (< 1 cm remaining) of the tumour after primary surgical treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer is removed 
Ovarian cancer is a cancerous growth arising from different parts of the ovary. It is the sixth most common cancer among women. Most ovarian cancers are classified as epithelial. Ovarian epithelial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissue covering the ovary and most cases are epithelial. Primary surgery is performed to achieve optimal cytoreduction (surgical efforts aiming at removing the bulk of the tumour) as the amount of tumour that remains after surgery (residual disease) is one of the most important factors that is taken into account when determining a prognosis (prognostic factor) for survival of epithelial ovarian cancer. Optimal cytoreductive surgery remains a subject of controversy to many practising obstetric gynaecologists who specialise in the diagnosis and treatment of women with cancer of the reproductive organs (gynae‐oncologists). The Gynaecologic Oncology Group (GOG) currently defines 'optimal' as having a small aggregation of remaining cancer cells after surgery (residual tumour nodules) each measuring 1 cm or less in maximum diameter, with complete cytoreduction (microscopic disease) being the ideal surgical outcome. Although the size of residual tumour masses after surgery has been shown to be an important prognostic factor for advanced ovarian cancer, there is limited evidence to support the conclusion that the surgical procedure is directly responsible for the superior outcome associated with less residual disease. This review assessed overall and progression‐free survival of optimal primary cytoreductive surgery for women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stages III and IV). We found 11 retrospective studies that included more than 100 women and used a multivariate analysis (used statistical adjustment for important prognostic factors) and met our inclusion criteria. Analyses showed the prognostic importance of complete cytoreduction, where the residual disease is microscopic with no visible disease, as overall (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) were significantly prolonged in these groups of women. PFS was not reported in all of the studies but was sufficiently documented to allow firm conclusions to be drawn. When we compared suboptimal (> 1 cm) versus optimal (< 1 cm) cytoreduction the survival estimates were attenuated but remained statistically significant in favour of the lower volume disease group, but there was no significant difference in OS and only a borderline difference in PFS when residual disease of > 2 cm and < 2 cm were compared. There was a high risk of bias due to the retrospective nature of these studies. Adverse events, quality of life (QoL) and cost‐effectiveness were not reported by treatment arm or to a satisfactory level in any of the studies. During primary surgery for advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer, all attempts should be made to achieve complete cytoreduction. When this is not achievable, the surgical goal should be optimal (< 1 cm) residual disease. Due to the high risk of bias in the current evidence, randomised controlled trials should be performed to determine whether it is the surgical intervention or patient‐related and disease‐related factors that are associated with the improved survival in these groups of women.

First surgery for advanced ovarian cancer: less cancer left behind, longer life

Rationale
Ovarian cancer starts in a woman’s ovary. Most cases begin in the thin outer layer, or “epithelium.” Many women learn they have it after it has spread.

Doctors treat it with surgery and drugs. In surgery, the team tries to take out all cancer seen. Doctors call this “cytoreduction.” Any cancer left after surgery is “residual disease.”

Why does this matter? Cancer left behind can grow. It can make later care harder. Many doctors think women live longer when very little is left. But some still question how sure we are.

This study looked at that question. It asked: do women live longer when no cancer, or very little, is left after the first surgery? It also asked how long it takes before the cancer grows again.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies, not one new trial. The team looked back at 11 studies. Each study had more than 100 women. All women had advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. These were stage 3 or stage 4 cases.

All the studies were “retrospective.” That means the teams looked at old health records. They did not assign care at the time. The studies used math to adjust for other health and cancer traits.

The review grouped women by how much cancer was left after surgery. One group had no cancer seen. Only tiny cells might remain, seen only under a microscope. Another group had very small spots left. Each spot was less than 1 centimeter in size. Many experts call that “optimal.” A third group had bigger spots left. Some studies also looked at a 2 centimeter cut point.

The women were adults. All were women with this type of cancer. The review did not give their ages. The review did not follow people in real time. So it did not report how long each person was in a study.

The team looked at two key results. One was overall survival. That is how long women lived after care. The other was time without the cancer growing again. Doctors call this “progression‑free survival.”

Results
Women with no cancer seen at the end of surgery lived longer. They also went longer before the cancer grew again. This was true across the studies in the review.

Women with very small spots left, less than 1 centimeter, also did better than those with larger spots left. They lived longer and had a longer time before the cancer grew again. The gain was smaller than in the “no cancer seen” group. But it was still clear.

Some studies used a 2 centimeter cut point. When the team compared less than 2 centimeters to more than 2 centimeters, the results were mixed. There was no clear gain in how long women lived. There was only a small edge in time before the cancer grew again.

What do these results mean for care? Surgeons should try to remove all cancer they can see. That is the best goal. If that is not possible, they should aim to leave less than 1 centimeter behind. This plan may help women live longer and feel better for more time.

There are limits to this review. All the studies looked back at past care. They did not assign the type of surgery at random. This can bring in bias. For example, women in better health may be more likely to have more cancer removed. Their longer life may be due, in part, to those other traits. This makes cause and effect less clear.

The review also had gaps. It did not give results on side effects in each group. It did not report on quality of life in a clear way. It did not report costs in a clear way. These are key parts of care choices.

Even with these limits, the pattern was strong. No cancer seen after surgery linked to the best results. Very small spots left, less than 1 centimeter, also linked to better results than larger spots. The link with a 2 centimeter cut point was weaker.

In short, take out all cancer you can see during the first surgery. That is linked to the longest life. If that is not possible, leaving less than 1 centimeter is the next best goal.

What comes next? The field needs strong trials that assign care at random. These trials can test if surgery itself, and not other traits, drives the gains. They should also track side effects, daily life, and costs. This will help women and doctors choose the best plan.

This review supports a clear care goal today. Aim for complete removal of all cancer seen. If not possible, aim for less than 1 centimeter left behind. This offers the best chance for longer life and more time without cancer growth.","Clear survival benefit is achieved if all or most (< 1 cm remaining) of the tumour after primary surgical treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer is removed

10.1002-14651858.CD013315,"Background
High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of mainly cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 2500 metres (˜ 8200 feet). Acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE), and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as potential medical problems associated with high altitude ascent. In this, the third of a series of three reviews about preventive strategies for HAI, we assessed the effectiveness of miscellaneous and non‐pharmacological interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of miscellaneous and non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI in people who are at risk of developing high altitude illness in any setting. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) in January 2019. We adapted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other databases. We used a combination of thesaurus‐based and free‐text search terms. We scanned the reference lists and citations of included trials and any relevant systematic reviews that we identified for further references to additional trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials conducted in any setting where non‐pharmacological and miscellaneous interventions were employed to prevent acute HAI, including preacclimatization measures and the administration of non‐pharmacological supplements. We included trials involving participants who are at risk of developing high altitude illness (AMS or HACE, or HAPE, or both). We included participants with, and without, a history of high altitude illness. We applied no age or gender restrictions. We included trials where the relevant intervention was administered before the beginning of ascent. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures employed by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 20 studies (1406 participants, 21 references) in this review. Thirty studies (14 ongoing, and 16 pending classification (awaiting)) will be considered in future versions of this suite of three reviews as appropriate. We report the results for the primary outcome of this review (risk of AMS) by each group of assessed interventions. 
Group 1. Preacclimatization and other measures based on pressure 
Use of simulated altitude or remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) might not improve the risk of AMS on subsequent exposure to altitude, but this effect is uncertain (simulated altitude: risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.71; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 140 participants; low‐quality evidence. RIPC: RR 3.0, 95% CI 0.69 to 13.12; 1 trial, 40 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement of this risk using positive end‐expiratory pressure (PEEP), but this information was derived from a cross‐over trial with a limited number of participants (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.38 to 9.76; 1 trial, 8 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. 
Group 2. Supplements and vitamins 
Supplementation of antioxidants, medroxyprogesterone, iron or Rhodiola crenulata might not improve the risk of AMS on exposure to high altitude, but this effect is uncertain (antioxidants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.03; 1 trial, 18 participants; low‐quality evidence. Medroxyprogesterone: RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.05; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 32 participants; low‐quality evidence. Iron: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.11; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 65 participants; low‐quality evidence. R crenulata: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.29; 1 trial, 125 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement of this risk with the administration of erythropoietin, but this information was extracted from a trial with issues related to risk of bias and imprecision (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.84; 1 trial, 39 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Regarding administration of ginkgo biloba, we did not perform a pooled estimation of RR for AMS due to considerable heterogeneity between the included studies (I² = 65%). RR estimates from the individual studies were conflicting (from 0.05 to 1.03; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. 
Group 3. Other comparisons 
We found heterogeneous evidence regarding the risk of AMS when ginkgo biloba was compared with acetazolamide (I² = 63%). RR estimates from the individual studies were conflicting (estimations from 0.11 (95% CI 0.01 to 1.86) to 2.97 (95% CI 1.70 to 5.21); low‐quality evidence). We found evidence of improvement when ginkgo biloba was administered along with acetazolamide, but this information was derived from a single trial with issues associated to risk of bias (compared to ginkgo biloba alone: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.71; 1 trial, 311 participants; low‐quality evidence). Administration of medroxyprogesterone plus acetazolamide did not improve the risk of AMS when compared to administration of medroxyprogesterone or acetazolamide alone (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.55; 1 trial, 12 participants; low‐quality evidence). We found scarcity of evidence about the risk of adverse events for these interventions. 
Authors' conclusions
This Cochrane Review is the final in a series of three providing relevant information to clinicians, and other interested parties, on how to prevent high altitude illness. The assessment of non‐pharmacological and miscellaneous interventions suggests that there is heterogeneous and even contradictory evidence related to the effectiveness of these prophylactic strategies. Safety of these interventions remains as an unclear issue due to lack of assessment. Overall, the evidence is limited due to its quality (low to very low), the relative paucity of that evidence and the number of studies pending classification for the three reviews belonging to this series (30 studies either awaiting classification or ongoing). Additional studies, especially those comparing with pharmacological alternatives (such as acetazolamide) are required, in order to establish or refute the strategies evaluated in this review.

Do non-drug steps help prevent altitude sickness?

Rationale
High places can make people sick. This is called high altitude illness. It can start with headache, nausea, and poor sleep. This early type is called acute mountain sickness. In rare cases, the brain can swell. That is high altitude cerebral edema. The lungs can also fill with fluid. That is high altitude pulmonary edema.

Many people travel, work, or climb at high places. This can be a big burden. People want safe, simple ways to lower their risk. Non-drug steps may help. These can include training at fake high altitude, special breathing devices, or herbs and vitamins.

The team asked a clear question. Do non-drug steps prevent altitude sickness? They thought some steps might help. They also wanted to know about side effects. They looked at all the best tests they could find.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. A review like this joins many small tests. Most tests put people into groups by chance. That is a fair way to compare choices. The team searched for trials in many large medical lists in early 2019.

They looked for trials that gave the step before the climb. People could have had altitude sickness before or not. There were no age or gender limits. The people were at risk for altitude sickness. The time spent in each trial was not clear for many trials.

The review included 20 trials with 1406 people. It also found 30 more trials. Those were not ready or still going on. The steps tested fell into three groups. The team looked for benefits and harms.

Results
Big picture
The results were mixed. Many trials were small. Many had design limits. Reports of side effects were rare. So, safety is not clear. We need more and better trials.

Group 1: Training and pressure based steps
Some people trained at fake high altitude. Others tried a method that briefly stops blood flow to an arm. This is called remote preconditioning. The results did not show clear help. We cannot say if these steps work.

One tiny trial used a breathing device. It adds a little pressure when you breathe out. This might have helped in that trial. But it had only eight people. We need larger tests to be sure.

Group 2: Supplements and vitamins
People tried many pills and herbs. These included antioxidants. These are vitamins that fight cell damage. People also tried iron, a hormone pill called medroxyprogesterone, and an herb called Rhodiola. None showed clear help across the trials.

One small trial tested erythropoietin. This is a medicine that raises red blood cells. It looked helpful in that trial. But the trial had design problems. So we are not sure if it truly helps.

Several trials tested ginkgo biloba, an herbal product. The trials did not agree. Some seemed to show help. Others did not. The mixed results mean we cannot trust any one answer.

Group 3: Other head-to-head tests
Some trials compared ginkgo to a common drug called acetazolamide. That drug is often used to prevent altitude sickness. The results were mixed again. Some trials seemed to favor the drug. Others did not show a clear winner.

One larger trial tested ginkgo with acetazolamide versus ginkgo alone. The mix looked better than ginkgo alone. But the trial had limits in how it was run. So we need care in reading that result. One small trial tested medroxyprogesterone with acetazolamide. It was not better than either by itself.

What this means for patients
Today, we do not have strong proof that non-drug steps help. Some steps may help a few people. But the trials are small and not alike. Side effects were not well tracked. So we also do not know how safe these steps are.

This review matters for people who plan to go high. It shows where proof is weak. It points to what to study next. We need new and larger trials. These trials should use fair methods. They should track side effects well. They should also compare steps to known drugs, like acetazolamide.

Conclusions from the study team
The team said the proof is limited. The quality was low or very low. The results were mixed or did not agree. Safety was not clear. Many new trials are in progress. We should wait for those results.

For now, talk with your doctor before you go high. Ask what steps fit your health and plans. Ask about the pros and cons. This can help you choose a safe plan for your trip.","Diverse strategies for preventing high altitude illness
Background 
The term high altitude illness (HAI) is used to describe a group of brain and lung conditions that can occur when people travel to altitudes above approximately 2500 metres (approximately 8200 feet). Individuals can respond to high altitudes in different ways and experience a variety of symptoms. These include HAI‐related headache, nausea, vomiting and tiredness, often called acute mountain sickness. Drowsiness, confusion or unconsciousness can occur when the brain is particularly affected (high altitude cerebral oedema or HACE), and cough or breathlessness when it is the lungs (high altitude pulmonary oedema or HAPE). A number of different strategies are used to prevent HAI. In this review we assessed the evidence from randomized controlled trials on whether various approaches could prevent the onset of high altitude illness, with a focus on non‐drug approaches, herbs and natural supplements. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to January 2019. We included 20 randomized controlled studies involving 1406 participants. The studies looked at diverse approaches to HAI prevention. These approaches included strategies to acclimatize to high altitudes by mimicking quick ascents by reducing levels of oxygen in the air that participants are breathing, and herbal products or vitamin supplements available without a prescription. 
The participants ranged in age between 17 and 65 years. Only one study included people at high risk of developing HAI as they had a history of HAI. Four trials provided the intervention between one to three days before making the ascent (20% of the studies), and eight between four to 30 days before departure for the ascent (40% of the studies). The participants in all these studies reached a final altitude of between 3500 and 5500 metres above sea level. Most of the studies did not provide clear information on how they were funded (55% of studies). Thirty additional studies were classified as either ongoing (14 studies), or awaiting classification (16 studies), and they will be considered in future versions of this suite of three reviews as appropriate. 
Key results 
The evidence for any benefit of the various strategies is inconclusive, and even contradictory among the included studies. 
In three studies comparing normal levels of oxygen with low oxygen levels as a way of acclimatization before leaving for high altitudes, we found no differences in the risk of developing acute mountain sickness (3 trials, 140 participants; low‐quality evidence). Adverse events were not reported, nor were high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) or pulmonary oedema (HAPE). 
Ginkgo biloba was compared with taking an inactive placebo in seven studies (523 participants) looking at acute mountain sickness. There was no difference between ginkgo biloba and placebo in terms of the risk of developing HACE (3 studies, 371 participants), or in the risk of developing tingling or pricking, often described as 'pins and needles', as a side effect of treatment (2 studies, 352 participants). No HAPE events were reported (3 studies, 371 participants). 
Ginkgo biloba was compared with acetazolamide, which is a drug used to prevent acute mountain sickness, in four studies (397 participants). The findings differed between the studies, and no conclusions could be drawn. Acetazolamide increased the risk of developing pins and needles in two studies (354 participants). No HAPE or HACE events were reported. Overall, the limited information on the safety of the various interventions means that their safety remains unclear. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was low to very low. We could not obtain the full text reports of some of the studies we had identified, which limited the number of studies included in the review. Many of the studies had small numbers of participants; and for some outcomes few events occurred so that any findings were uncertain. Additional research is needed to clarify the effectiveness and safety of the various strategies to reduce HAI.

Systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), also referred to as hormone therapy, has long been the primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Additional agents have been reserved for the castrate‐resistant disease stage when ADT start becoming less effective. Abiraterone is an agent with an established role in that disease stage, which has only recently been evaluated in the hormone‐sensitive setting. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of early abiraterone acetate, in combination with systemic ADT, for newly diagnosed metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, two trials registries, grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to 15 May 2020. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials, in which men diagnosed with hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer were administered abiraterone acetate and prednisolone with ADT or ADT alone. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analysesusing a random‐effects model. We rated the quality of evidence according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results
The search identified two randomized controlled trials (RCT), with 2201 men, who were assigned to receive either abiraterone acetate 1000 mg once daily and low dose prednisone (5mg) in addition to ADT, or ADT alone. In the LATITUDE trial, the median age and range of men in the intervention group was 68 (38 to 89) years, and 67 (33 to 92) years in the control group. Nearly all of the men in this study (97.6%) had prostate cancer with a Gleason score of at least 8 (ISUP grade group 4). 
Primary outcomes 
The addition of abiraterone acetate to ADT reduces the probability of death from any cause compared to ADT alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 0.73; 2 RCTs, 2201 men; high certainty of evidence); this corresponds to 163 fewer deaths per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (210 fewer to 115 fewer) at five years. 
Abiraterone acetate in addition to ADT probably results in little to no difference in quality of life compared to ADT alone, measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐prostate total score (FACT‐P; range 0 to 156; higher values indicates better quality of life), at 12 months (mean difference [MD] 2.90 points, 95% CI 0.11 to 5.60; 1 RCT, 838 men; moderate certainty of evidence). 
Secondary outcomes 
Abiraterone plus ADT increases the risk of grades III to V adverse events compared to ADT alone (risk ratio [RR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.47; 1 RCT, 1199 men; high certainty of evidence); this corresponds to 162 more grade III to V events per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (105 more to 224 more) at a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
Abiraterone acetate in addition to ADT probably reduces the probability of death due to prostate cancer compared to ADT alone (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.68; 2 RCTs, 2201 men; moderate certainty of evidence). This corresponds to 120 fewer death from prostate cancer per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (95% CI 145 fewer to 90 fewer) after a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
The addition of abiraterone acetate to ADT probably decreases the probability of disease progression compared to ADT alone (HR 0.35, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.49; 2 RCTs, 2097 men; moderate certainty of evidence). This corresponds to 369 fewer incidences of disease progression per 1000 men with hormone‐sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (456 fewer to 256 fewer) after a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
The addition of abiraterone acetate to ADT probably increases the risk of discontinuing treatment due to adverse events compared to ADT alone (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.92; 1 RCT, 1199 men; moderate certainty of evidence). This corresponds to 51 more men (95% CI 17 more to 93 more) discontinuing treatment because of adverse events per 1000 men treated with abiraterone acetate and ADT compared to ADT alone after a median follow‐up of 30 months. 
Authors' conclusions
The addition of abiraterone acetate to androgen deprivation therapy improves overall survival but probably not quality of life. It probably also extends disease‐specific survival, and delays disease progression compared to androgen deprivation therapy alone. However, the risk of grades III to V adverse events is increased, and probably, so is the risk of discontinuing treatment due to adverse events.

Starting abiraterone early, with hormone therapy, for prostate cancer that has spread

Rationale
Prostate cancer can spread to other parts of the body. Doctors call this “advanced” or “metastatic.” This kind of cancer uses male hormones, like testosterone, to grow. This can cause pain, weak bones, and other health problems.

Most men start with hormone therapy. Doctors also call this androgen deprivation therapy, or ADT. ADT lowers testosterone. When the cancer still responds to low testosterone, we say it is “hormone‑sensitive.”

Abiraterone is a pill. It blocks the body from making male hormones. Men take it with a low dose of a steroid called prednisone. In the past, doctors used abiraterone later, after the cancer stopped responding to ADT. This study asked a key question. Does starting abiraterone early, together with ADT, help men live longer and stay well longer?

This study is needed because many men still get sick even on ADT. If early abiraterone helps, many men may gain time. But we must also weigh side effects. This review looked at both.

Trial Design
This report is a careful review of research. The team searched many medical sources up to mid‑May 2020. They found two randomized trials. In a randomized trial, a computer assigns men to one of two groups. This helps make fair comparisons.

In total, 2,201 men took part. All had new, advanced, hormone‑sensitive prostate cancer. One group took abiraterone each day at a dose of 1000 milligrams. They also took low dose prednisone, 5 milligrams a day. They stayed on standard ADT. The other group took ADT alone.

Men in one trial were about 68 years old, on average. In that trial, most men had fast‑growing cancer. Men stayed in the studies for about two and a half years, on average. Some results also looked at five‑year outcomes. Quality of life was checked at 12 months.

Results
Main finding: adding abiraterone to ADT helped men live longer. Over five years, out of 1000 men, 163 fewer men died when they took abiraterone with ADT, compared to ADT alone. The studies that support this are large and well done.

Abiraterone also helped men avoid death due to prostate cancer. After about two and a half years, out of 1000 men, 120 fewer men died from prostate cancer with abiraterone plus ADT, compared to ADT alone.

Abiraterone slowed cancer growth. After about two and a half years, out of 1000 men, 369 fewer men had cancer that grew or spread when they took abiraterone with ADT, compared to ADT alone. This means many men gained more time before the cancer got worse.

Quality of life was about the same at one year. The studies used a common survey of well‑being in men with prostate cancer. Scores were close in both groups. This means most men did not feel better or worse overall at 12 months when abiraterone was added. The main gain was more time and slower cancer growth.

Side effects did increase. Serious side effects were more common with abiraterone plus ADT. Serious means bad enough to need a hospital stay or can be life‑threatening. After about two and a half years, out of 1000 men, there were 162 more serious side effects with abiraterone plus ADT than with ADT alone.

Stopping treatment due to side effects was also more common. After about two and a half years, out of 1000 men, 51 more men stopped treatment due to side effects in the abiraterone group than in the ADT‑alone group.

What do these results mean?
- Benefits: More men lived longer. More men avoided death from prostate cancer. More men had longer time before the cancer got worse.
- Trade‑offs: More men had serious side effects. More men stopped treatment because of side effects.
- Day‑to‑day life: At one year, overall quality of life was about the same with or without abiraterone.

Why is this important?
For men with new, advanced, hormone‑sensitive prostate cancer, starting abiraterone with ADT can add time. It also delays cancer growth. Many men may want this choice. But men and doctors should watch for side effects. Some side effects can be serious. Care teams can check blood tests, blood pressure, and other signs. They can treat side effects early or adjust the plan if needed.

Conclusions from the researchers
Adding abiraterone to ADT improves how long men live. It also lowers deaths from prostate cancer and delays cancer growth. Quality of life at one year is about the same. The risk of serious side effects is higher, and more men stop the drug because of side effects. Men should talk with their care team about these trade‑offs. This can help each man choose the plan that fits his goals and health.","Adding abiraterone acetate to androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of metastatic hormone‐sensitive prostate cancer 
Review question 
The aim of this review was to find out what the effect of adding abiraterone was, in men with prostate cancer, who were receiving and still responding to hormone therapy. 
Background 
Abiraterone acetate is a medication that blocks the effect of male sex hormones, and thereby, slows down prostate cancer growth.  
More than 15% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer present with disease that has spread beyond the prostate. Another 15% to 30% of men who undergo primary treatment will experience a return of their cancer. Hormone therapy (drugs to reduce the level of male hormones) has been the main treatment for advanced disease, but this does not work forever. Recent studies have looked at whether drugs that block the growth of prostate cancer cells, such as abiraterone acetate, can improve how men do. 
Study characteristics 
We found two studies (specifically, studies in which 'chance' decided what treatment men got), with a total of 2201 men. The studies compared abiraterone acetate and hormone therapy to hormone therapy alone. In one of the studies, most of the included men had high risk prostate cancer, and had previously undergone local treatment. In the other study, most men had not had previous treatment to their prostate. The evidence is current to 15 May 2020. 
Key results 
Adding abiraterone acetate to hormone therapy improves overall survival but probably not quality of life. It probably improves cancer‐specific survival and reduces disease progression. However, there is also an increase in severe and life‐threatening side effects, likely leading to discontinued treatment, with the addition of abiraterone acetate. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the evidence to be high for overall survival (time to death from any cause), and severe and life‐threatening side effects. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the actual effect for these outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was moderate for quality of life, cancer‐specific survival (time to death from prostate cancer), time to disease progression, and discontinued treatment due to adverse events. This means that our estimates are likely to be close to the actual effect, but there were some limitations in the studies that reduced our confidence in the results.

This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of acupuncture on osteoarthritis. 
The review shows that in people with osteoarthritis, 
‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 8 weeks. 
‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 26 weeks. 
We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects of acupuncture treatment include minor bruising and bleeding at the site of needle insertion. 
What is osteoarthritis and what is acupuncture? 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as your knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try and repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen and make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect your physical function or ability to use your knee. 
According to the philosophy of traditional acupuncture, energy circulates in 'meridians' located throughout the body.  Pain or ill health happens when something occurs to cause this meridian energy circulation to be blocked. The way to restore health is to stimulate the appropriate combination of acupuncture points in the body by inserting very thin needles.  Sometimes in painful conditions, electrical stimulation along with the needles is also used.  According to acupuncture theory, one way you can tell that acupuncture is relieving pain is that you may feel numbness or tingling, called de qi, where the needle is inserted. 
Best estimate of what happens to people with osteoarthritis who have acupuncture: 
Pain after 8 weeks: 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 4 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. 
‐People who received acupuncture had a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.  (5% absolute improvement). 
Pain after 26 weeks: 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly more than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly less than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. 
‐People who received acupuncture had under a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.  (2% absolute improvement).  
Physical function after 8 weeks : 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 8 points on a scale of 0 to 68. 
‐People who received acupuncture had about a 3 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐68.  (4% absolute improvement)  
Physical function after 26 weeks : 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 10 points on a scale of 0 to 68. 
‐People who received acupuncture had about a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐68.  (2% absolute improvement)

Acupuncture for sore joints from osteoarthritis: what the research shows

Rationale
Osteoarthritis is wear and tear of a joint. It often affects the knee or hip. The smooth cover of the joint, called cartilage, gets thin. The bone then grows in odd ways. This can lead to pain and stiff moves.

Pain and stiff moves can limit daily life. Tasks like walking, stairs, and sleep can be hard. Many people look for safe pain relief. Drugs can help, but may have side effects. So people also try care like acupuncture.

Acupuncture uses very thin needles placed in the skin. The needles go in set spots on the body. Some clinics add a mild electric pulse to the needles. Some people feel a dull ache or a tingle. These signs can mean the spot is active.

This review asked a clear question. Does acupuncture help pain and daily moves in osteoarthritis? It also looked at safety. The hope was that acupuncture could ease pain and help people move.

Trial Design
This was a review of many research studies. It comes from the Cochrane group. They looked at people with osteoarthritis. Most had pain in joints like the knee or hip. The studies compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture.

Sham means a pretend treatment. It may use fake points or shallow needles. Sham helps us see the true effect of the real needles. People did not know which one they got. This helps keep the tests fair.

The studies checked pain and daily moves. They used simple number scales. They looked at change after 8 weeks. They also looked again after 26 weeks.

The review also looked at side effects. It noted mild harms seen in clinics. It also checked if rare, serious harms were known. The data on rare harms was not clear.

Results
After 8 weeks, people who got acupuncture had a small drop in pain. On a 0 to 20 pain scale, pain fell by about 4 points. People who got sham had pain fall by about 3 points. So acupuncture led to about 1 more point of pain relief. This is a small extra gain.

After 26 weeks, pain still showed a small edge. With acupuncture, pain fell by a bit over 3 points. With sham, pain fell by a bit under 3 points. The extra gain was less than 1 point. This is also a small change.

Daily moves also showed small gains at 8 weeks. On a 0 to 68 function scale, scores improved by about 11 points with acupuncture. Scores improved by about 8 points with sham. So acupuncture led to about 3 more points of gain. This is a small extra boost.

At 26 weeks, the edge was even smaller. Function improved by about 11 points with acupuncture. It improved by about 10 points with sham. So acupuncture led to about 1 more point of gain. Again, this is a small change.

What do these numbers mean for you? Some people may feel a bit less pain. Some may move a bit better. But the extra gain from acupuncture was small. Not all people will feel a clear change.

The studies also looked at safety. Some people had small bruises where needles went in. Some had light bleeding at the skin. We do not have clear facts on rare, serious harms. So we cannot say how often those happen.

Why does this matter? Many people live with osteoarthritis pain each day. Even a small gain may help some people. Others may not find it worth the time or cost. This review helps you weigh that choice.

What did the team conclude? Acupuncture may help a little with pain and moves. The effect was small at 8 weeks. The effect was still small at 26 weeks. The safety data on rare harms is not clear.

What should you do next? Talk with your care team. Share what matters to you. Ask about your goals, cost, and time. Ask about other care that may help, too. Acupuncture is one option among many.

In short, here is the key point. For osteoarthritis, acupuncture gave small extra gains. These gains were over fake treatment. The gains were small for pain and for moves. Safety looks okay for minor harms. Data on rare harms is not clear.","Acupuncture for osteoarthritis

10.1002-14651858.CD013103.pub2,"Background
Hepatorenal syndrome is defined as renal failure in people with cirrhosis in the absence of other causes. In addition to supportive treatment such as albumin to restore fluid balance, the other potential treatments include systemic vasoconstrictor drugs (such as vasopressin analogues or noradrenaline), renal vasodilator drugs (such as dopamine), transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and liver support with molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS). There is uncertainty over the best treatment regimen for hepatorenal syndrome. 
Objectives
To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for hepatorenal syndrome in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trial registers until December 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials on hepatorenal syndrome in people with cirrhosis. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in adults with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently identified eligible trials and collected data. The outcomes for this review included mortality, serious adverse events, any adverse events, resolution of hepatorenal syndrome, liver transplantation, and other decompensation events. We performed a network meta‐analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio (OR), rate ratio, hazard ratio (HR), and mean difference (MD) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available‐case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. 
Main results
We included a total of 25 trials (1263 participants; 12 interventions) in the review. Twenty‐three trials (1185 participants) were included in one or more outcomes. All the trials but two were at high risk of bias, and all the evidence was of low or very low certainty. The trials included participants with liver cirrhosis of varied aetiologies as well as a mixture of type I hepatorenal syndrome only, type II hepatorenal syndrome only, or people with both type I and type II hepatorenal syndrome. Participant age ranged from 42 to 60 years, and the proportion of females ranged from 5.8% to 61.5% in the trials that reported this information. The follow‐up in the trials ranged from one week to six months. Overall, 59% of participants died during this period and about 35% of participants recovered from hepatorenal syndrome. The most common interventions compared were albumin plus terlipressin, albumin plus noradrenaline, and albumin alone. 
There was no evidence of a difference in mortality (22 trials; 1153 participants) at maximal follow‐up between the different interventions. None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life. There was no evidence of differences in the proportion of people with serious adverse events (three trials; 428 participants), number of participants with serious adverse events per participant (two trials; 166 participants), proportion of participants with any adverse events (four trials; 402 participants), the proportion of people who underwent liver transplantation at maximal follow‐up (four trials; 342 participants), or other features of decompensation at maximal follow‐up (one trial; 466 participants). Five trials (293 participants) reported number of any adverse events, and five trials (219 participants) reported treatment costs. Albumin plus noradrenaline had fewer numbers of adverse events per participant (rate ratio 0.51, 95% CrI 0.28 to 0.87). Eighteen trials (1047 participants) reported recovery from hepatorenal syndrome (as per definition of hepatorenal syndrome). In terms of recovery from hepatorenal syndrome, in the direct comparisons, albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin plus octreotide had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome than albumin plus terlipressin (HR 0.04; 95% CrI 0.00 to 0.25 and HR 0.26, 95% CrI 0.07 to 0.80 respectively). There was no evidence of differences between the groups in any of the other direct comparisons. In the network meta‐analysis, albumin and albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome compared with albumin plus terlipressin. 
Funding: two trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies; five trials were funded by parties who had no vested interest in the results of the trial; and 18 trials did not report the source of funding. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on very low‐certainty evidence, there is no evidence of benefit or harm of any of the interventions for hepatorenal syndrome with regards to the following outcomes: all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events (proportion), number of serious adverse events per participant, any adverse events (proportion), liver transplantation, or other decompensation events. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that albumin plus noradrenaline had fewer 'any adverse events per participant' than albumin plus terlipressin. Low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence also found that albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome compared with albumin plus terlipressin. 
Future randomised clinical trials should be adequately powered; employ blinding, avoid post‐randomisation dropouts or planned cross‐overs (or perform an intention‐to‐treat analysis); and report clinically important outcomes such as mortality, health‐related quality of life, adverse events, and recovery from hepatorenal syndrome. Albumin plus noradrenaline and albumin plus terlipressin appear to be the interventions that should be compared in future trials.

Which treatments help kidney failure from severe liver disease?

2. Rationale
Cirrhosis is bad scarring of the liver. It can cause kidney failure. This is called hepatorenal syndrome, or HRS. HRS is very serious. Many people with HRS die.

Doctors use many tools to treat HRS. One tool is albumin. Albumin is a blood protein. It helps keep fluid in the blood. Other tools are drugs that make blood vessels tighten. This may raise blood flow to the kidneys. These drugs include terlipressin and noradrenaline. Some doctors use midodrine and octreotide with albumin. Other options try to lower liver pressure or give liver support. These include a TIPS shunt and a MARS machine.

But we do not know the best plan. Past trials were small and not clear. The goal of this study was to compare all these options. The team asked which treatment helps most and is safest. They looked at death, side effects, recovery from HRS, and liver transplant.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of past clinical trials. In these trials, people joined by chance to one of two or more groups. This helps make fair tests. The team searched many medical lists up to late 2018. They looked only at adult patients with cirrhosis and HRS. They left out people who had a liver transplant before.

They found 25 trials with 1,263 people. Of these, 23 trials gave data for at least one result. The people were age 42 to 60 years on average. Both men and women took part. In some trials, about 1 in 20 were women. In others, about 6 in 10 were women. Some trials had people with fast HRS. Some had slow HRS. Some had both types.

The trials tested 12 treatments. The most common were:
- Albumin plus terlipressin
- Albumin plus noradrenaline
- Albumin alone

The time in each trial ran from one week to six months. The team checked death, side effects, HRS recovery, transplant, and other health events. No trial in this review reported quality of life.

The team used a method that lets you compare many treatments at once. It draws links across many trials.

4. Results
Key facts across the trials:
- About 6 in 10 people died during the study time.
- About 3 in 10 people got better from HRS.

Death
- There was no clear difference in death rates between the treatments.
- This was true at the last follow-up time in each trial.

Recovery from HRS
- Albumin plus terlipressin helped more people recover than albumin alone.
- Albumin plus terlipressin also helped more people recover than albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide.
- There were no clear differences between other pairs of treatments.

Side effects
- The number of people with serious side effects looked much the same across groups.
- The number of people with any side effect also looked much the same.
- One drug mix, albumin plus noradrenaline, had fewer side effects per person than albumin plus terlipressin.

Liver transplant and other health events
- There was no clear difference in how many people got a liver transplant.
- There was no clear difference in other illness events linked to cirrhosis.

Quality of life and costs
- No trial reported quality of life.
- Some trials reported costs, but the review did not judge these.

What this means for patients
This review did not find a clear best plan for saving lives. Many people still died in a short time. Albumin plus terlipressin helped more people recover kidney function than albumin alone. It also did better than the mix of albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide. Albumin plus noradrenaline led to fewer side effects per person than albumin plus terlipressin. These results may guide care while we wait for better trials.

How sure are these results?
The proof is weak. Most trials had limits. Many were small. Many had methods that raise doubt. This means the true effect may be different. Better trials can change these findings.

What should future trials do?
Future trials should be larger. They should hide group choice well and keep people in their groups. They should report death, quality of life, side effects, and HRS recovery. Two plans need a clear head-to-head test: albumin plus noradrenaline versus albumin plus terlipressin.

Funding
Two trials had drug company funds. Five had funds from groups with no stake in the result. Most trials did not report who paid.

Bottom line
- We do not see a clear drop in deaths with any one plan.
- Albumin plus terlipressin helped more people recover from HRS than albumin alone, and more than albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide.
- Albumin plus noradrenaline caused fewer side effects per person than albumin plus terlipressin.
- The proof is not strong. Better trials are needed.","Treatment of hepatorenal syndrome
What is the aim of this Cochrane review? 
To find out the best treatment for decreased kidney function (hepatorenal syndrome) in people with liver cirrhosis (a form of advanced liver disease with scarring of the liver) with complications. The authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 25 randomised controlled trials (participants receive the treatment based on method similar to coin toss or lottery; this is to ensure that the people who receive the different treatments are similar in all aspects except the treatment, so that any differences in the results between the treatments can be attributed to the treatment rather than differences in the type of people who received the treatment). During analysis of data, authors used standard Cochrane techniques, which allows comparison of two treatments at a time. Authors also used advanced techniques, that allow comparison of many treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network meta‐analysis' or 'multiple treatment comparisons'). The aim is to gather reliable evidence on the relative benefits and harms of the different treatments. 
Date of literature search December 2018 
Key messages Only two studies were conducted well. The remaining studies had one or more flaws. Therefore, there is high uncertainty in the results of the analysis. The authors could not recommend one treatment over another on the basis of risk of death, serious complications, percentage of people who developed any complication, percentage of participants who underwent liver transplantation (replacement of a diseased liver with a healthy one), or the number of other liver failure events. Health‐related quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. The number of complications of any severity was lower with albumin plus noradrenaline than albumin plus terlipressin. Recovery from hepatorenal syndrome may be lower with albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone than albumin plus terlipressin and albumin plus noradrenaline. 
Funding source was unclear in 18 studies. Industrial organisations funded two studies and the remaining five studies did not receive any funding from industrial organisations. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review studied people of any sex, age, and origin, having advanced liver disease due to various causes, and who had developed hepatorenal syndrome. People were administered different treatments. The review authors excluded studies with liver‐transplanted participants. Participants age, when reported, ranged from 42 to 60 years. The number of females ranged from 6 to 62 out of 100 in the studies that reported this information. The main treatments compared were albumin alone, albumin plus terlipressin, and albumin plus noradrenaline. The authors gathered and analysed data on death, quality of life, serious and non‐serious complications, time to liver transplantation, recovery from hepatorenal syndrome, and disappearance of symptoms. 
What were the main results of the review? 
The 25 studies included a small number of participants (1263 participants). Study data were sparse. Twenty‐three studies with 1185 participants provided data for analyses. The follow‐up in the trials ranged from one week to six months. The review shows that: 
‐ About 60 out of every 100 people died within three months, and 35 out of every 100 people recovered from hepatorenal syndrome. 
‐ The provided treatment may make no difference to the percentage of people who died or developed serious complications, number of serious complications per person, percentage of people who developed complications of any severity, or the percentage of people undergoing liver transplantation. 
‐ None of the trials reported health‐related quality of life.
‐ The number of complications of any severity was lower with albumin plus noradrenaline than albumin plus terlipressin. 
‐ Recovery from hepatorenal syndrome may be lower with albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone than albumin plus terlipressin and albumin plus noradrenaline. 
‐ We have very low confidence in the overall results.
‐ Future trials with proper design and quality are needed to clarify the best treatment for people with advanced liver disease having hepatorenal syndrome.

It is common for people not to take antidepressant medication as prescribed, with around 50% of people likely to prematurely discontinue taking their medication after six months. Community pharmacists may be well placed to have a role in antidepressant management because of their unique pharmacotherapeutic knowledge and ease of access for people. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to offer proactive interventions to people with depression or depressive symptoms. However, the effectiveness and acceptability of existing pharmacist‐based interventions is not yet well understood. The degree to which a pharmacy‐based management approach might be beneficial, acceptable to people, and effective as part of the overall management for those with depression is, to date, unclear. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) will help answer these questions and add important knowledge to the currently sparse evidence base.

To examine the effects of pharmacy‐based management interventions compared with active control (e.g. patient information materials or any other active intervention delivered by someone other than the pharmacist or the pharmacy team), waiting list, or treatment as usual (e.g. standard pharmacist advice or antidepressant education, signposting to support available in primary care services, brief medication counselling, and/or (self‐)monitoring of medication adherence offered by a healthcare professional outside the pharmacy team) at improving depression outcomes in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD‐CTR) to June 2016; the Cochrane Library (Issue 11, 2018); and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to December 2018. We searched theses and dissertation databases and international trial registers for unpublished/ongoing trials. We applied no restrictions on date, language, or publication status to the searches.  
Selection criteria
We included all RCTs and cluster‐RCTs where a pharmacy‐based intervention was compared with treatment as usual, waiting list, or an alternative intervention in the management of depression in adults over 16 years of age. Eligible studies had to report at least one of the following outcomes at any time point: depression symptom change, acceptability of the intervention, diagnosis of depression, non‐adherence to medication, frequency of primary care appointments, quality of life, social functioning, or adverse events.  
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently, and in duplicate, conducted all stages of study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment (including GRADE). We discussed disagreements within the team until we reached consensus. Where data did not allow meta‐analyses, we synthesised results narratively.  
Main results
Twelve studies (2215 participants) met the inclusion criteria and compared pharmacy‐based management with treatment as usual. Two studies (291 participants) also included an active control (both used patient information leaflets providing information about the prescribed antidepressant). Neither of these studies reported depression symptom change. A narrative synthesis of results on acceptability of the intervention was inconclusive, with one study reporting better acceptability of pharmacy‐based management and the other better acceptability of the active control. One study reported that participants in the pharmacy‐based management group had better medication adherence than the control participants. One study reported adverse events with no difference between groups. The studies reported no other outcomes. 
Meta‐analyses comparing pharmacy‐based management with treatment as usual showed no evidence of a difference in the effect of the intervention on depression symptom change (dichotomous data; improvement in symptoms yes/no: risk ratio (RR), 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 4 RCTs, 475 participants; moderate‐quality evidence; continuous data: standard mean difference (SMD) ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.10; 5 RCTs, 718 participants; high‐certainty evidence), or acceptability of the intervention (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.45; 12 RCTs, 2072 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The risk of non‐adherence was reduced in participants receiving pharmacy‐based management (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87; 6 RCTs, 911 participants; high‐certainty evidence). We were unable to meta‐analyse data on diagnosis of depression, frequency of primary care appointments, quality of life, or social functioning. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence of a difference between pharmacy‐based management for depression in adults compared with treatment as usual in facilitating depression symptom change. Based on numbers of participants leaving the trials early, there may be no difference in acceptability between pharmacy‐based management and controls. However, there was uncertainty due to the low‐certainty evidence.

Can extra help from a pharmacist aid people with depression?

Rationale
Depression is a long, low mood that hurts daily life. It can cause sleep loss, low energy, and sad thoughts. Many people take pills for low mood. But many stop the pills too soon.

About half stop by the six month mark. This can lead to harm and a return of symptoms. A pharmacist sees people often and knows a lot about pills. So, a pharmacist may help people stay on track.

Pharmacy help can include advice, check‑ins, and support with pill use. It may also include tips on side effects and when to see a doctor. This kind of help may keep people on their pills. It may also help mood and daily life.

But we do not know if this help works well. Past work was small or mixed. This study set out to gather all the best trials. The main goal was to see if pharmacy help improves mood in adults.

Trial Design
This was a review of trials. It looked at trials where people got extra help at a drug store. The team placed people into groups by chance in those trials. Adults age 16 and up took part.

People had low mood or signs of low mood. Both men and women were in the trials. The team looked at many study lists up to late 2018. They also looked for work not yet in print.

The review found 12 trials with 2215 people. Most trials compared pharmacy help to usual care. Two trials also used a paper info sheet as an extra group. The trials took place in the community.

The team looked at change in mood. They also looked at how many left the study early. They checked if people took pills as told. One trial also checked for bad effects.

The time in each trial was not clear in the abstract. So we do not know how long each person stayed. The review did not give that detail. It focused on the results across trials.

Results
When the team looked at the trials as a group, mood did not change more with pharmacy help. In short, mood scores were about the same as with usual care. This means extra help did not lift mood more than usual steps. This was true across many people.

The team also looked at how many left the trials early. This tells us if people stayed with the help or not. There may be no real gap between pharmacy help and usual care. But the proof here was not strong, so we are not sure.

Pill use told a more clear story. People who got pharmacy help took their pills more often as told. This result came from six trials with 911 people. In those trials, fewer people missed pills when they got pharmacy help.

Two trials also used an info sheet group. These two did not report mood change. One trial said people liked the pharmacy help more. The other said people liked the info sheet more. So, views on help were mixed.

One trial checked for bad effects. It found no extra harm with pharmacy help. This is good news, but it is just one trial. More trials should check this point.

Some other parts were not clear. Trials did not report the same way on new cases of low mood. They also did not match well on clinic visits, life quality, or social life. So the team could not draw firm lines on those parts.

What does this mean for care? Extra help from a pharmacist did not lift mood more than usual care. But it did help many people take pills as told. Good pill use can still help mood and health in time. It may also lower the risk of a return of low mood.

Why does this matter? Many people stop pills too soon. A plan that helps people stay on pills can help care. Pharmacies are easy to reach and can offer this help.

What should come next? We need more good, clear trials. Trials should test what kind of pharmacy help works best. They should also track mood, life quality, and any harm. Clear reports will help teams and patients choose the best help.

In sum, pharmacy help seems safe and helps pill use. It did not beat usual care for mood change in these trials. Still, this help may fit well as part of whole care. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist to learn what may help you.","Pharmacies might be able to support people with their depression medicines
Background 
Some people with depression find it difficult to take their depression medicines (often called 'antidepressants') as prescribed by their doctor. This can mean that the medicines do not work properly and people might not get better or might even get worse. It could be that pharmacists and their teams can help people with their depression treatment in ways that their family doctor (general practitioner (GP)) cannot. Pharmacies are based within the community, easier to get to, and people may feel more comfortable telling a pharmacist about their mood. However, there are not many studies to tell us if this works. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases for well‐designed studies that compared a group of adults with depression who received additional help with their depression medicines from their pharmacy with a group of adults with depression who received their treatment as usual. 
The evidence is current to 14 December 2018.
Key results and certainty of the evidence 
We found 12 studies with over 2000 adults taking part. They compared pharmacy‐based support with treatment as usual, for example, basic information about their medicines or signposting to other services only. We found that additional support given by the pharmacist was no better at reducing people's depression than their treatment as usual. The studies also showed that people may have liked both approaches the same, although we are uncertain about the results as the evidence was of low certainty. 
The studies did show that people who received support from their pharmacy were more likely to take their antidepressants as prescribed. We were not able to combine information from the included studies on other outcomes we were interested in (diagnosis of depression, frequency of healthcare appointments, quality of life, social functioning, or side effects). 
We found no difference in effectiveness when people with depression received additional support from a pharmacist compared with treatment as usual.

Surgery is the cornerstone in curative treatment of colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, surgery itself can adversely affect patient health. 'Enhanced Recovery After Surgery' programmes, which include multimodal interventions, have improved patient outcomes substantially. However, these are mainly applied peri‐ and postoperatively. Multimodal prehabilitation includes multiple preoperative interventions to prepare patients for surgery with the aim of increasing resilience, thereby improving postoperative outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of multimodal prehabilitation programmes on functional capacity, postoperative complications, and quality of life in adult patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO in January 2021. We also searched trial registries up to March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adult patients with non‐metastatic colorectal cancer, scheduled for surgery, comparing multimodal prehabilitation programmes (defined as comprising at least two preoperative interventions) with no prehabilitation. We focused on the following outcomes: functional capacity (i.e. 6‐minute walk test, VO2peak, handgrip strength), postoperative outcomes (i.e. complications, mortality, length of hospital stay, emergency department visits, re‐admissions), health‐related quality of life, compliance, safety of prehabilitation, and return to normal activities. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Any disagreements were solved with discussion and consensus. We pooled data to perform meta‐analyses, where possible. 
Main results
We included three RCTs that enrolled 250 participants with non‐metastatic colorectal cancer, scheduled for elective (mainly laparoscopic) surgery. Included trials were conducted in tertiary care centres and recruited patients during periods ranging from 17 months to 45 months. A total of 130 participants enrolled in a preoperative four‐week trimodal prehabilitation programme consisting of exercise, nutritional intervention, and anxiety reduction techniques. Outcomes of these participants were compared to those of 120 participants who started an identical but postoperative programme. 
Postoperatively, prehabilitation may improve functional capacity, determined with the 6‐minute walk test at four and eight weeks (mean difference (MD) 26.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐13.81 to 65.85; 2 studies; n = 131; and MD 26.58, 95% CI ‐8.88 to 62.04; 2 studies; n = 140); however, the certainty of evidence is low and very low, respectively, due to serious risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. After prehabilitation, the functional capacity before surgery improved, with a clinically relevant mean difference of 24.91 metres (95% CI 11.24 to 38.57; 3 studies; n = 225). The certainty of evidence was moderate due to downgrading for serious risk of bias. Prehabilitation may also result in fewer complications (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.29; 3 studies; n = 250) and fewer emergency department visits (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.32; 3 studies; n = 250). The certainty of evidence was low due to downgrading for serious risk of bias and imprecision. On the other hand, prehabilitation may also result in a higher re‐admission rate (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.65; 3 studies; n = 250). The certainty of evidence was again low due to downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision. The effect on VO2peak, handgrip strength, length of hospital stay, mortality rate, health‐related quality of life, return to normal activities, safety of the programme, and compliance rate could not be analysed quantitatively due to missing or insufficient data. The included studies did not report a difference between groups for health‐related quality of life and length of hospital stay. Data on remaining outcomes were not reported or were reported inadequately in the included studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Prehabilitation may result in an improved functional capacity, determined with the 6‐minute walk test both preoperatively and postoperatively. Complication rates and the number of emergency department visits postoperatively may also diminish due to a prehabilitation programme, while the number of re‐admissions may be higher in the prehabilitation group. The certainty of evidence ranges from moderate to very low, due to downgrading for serious risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. In addition, only three heterogeneous studies were included in this review. Therefore, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Numerous relevant RCTs are ongoing and will be included in a future update of this review.

Getting ready before bowel cancer surgery: does a 4‑week plan help?

Rationale
Bowel cancer means cancer of the colon or rectum. Surgery is the main way to cure it. But surgery is hard on the body. It can slow you down and cause problems after the operation.

Doctors use plans to help people heal after surgery. These plans often start around or after the operation. A newer idea is to start before surgery. This is called prehabilitation, or “prehab.”

Prehab can include three parts. These are exercise, better food, and ways to ease worry. The goal is to build strength and calm, so your body can handle surgery better. This review asked if a short prehab plan helps people with bowel cancer.

Trial Design
This study was a review of past trials. The team looked for the best type of trials. These are trials where people are picked by chance to get one plan or another. The team searched medical papers and trial lists up to March 2021.

The review found three trials. They took place in large hospitals. The trials enrolled 250 adults with bowel cancer. The cancer had not spread. All were set to have planned surgery. Most had keyhole surgery, also called laparoscopic surgery.

People in the trials did a three-part prehab plan. The plan lasted four weeks before surgery. It had exercise, better food advice, and stress or anxiety relief. The control group did the same three-part plan, but they started it after surgery.

The trials measured how well people could move. One main test was a six‑minute walk. In this test, you walk for six minutes. The team notes how far you go. Some trials also looked at grip strength and heart‑lung fitness. The trials checked people again at four weeks and eight weeks after surgery.

Results
Before surgery, people who did prehab walked farther in six minutes. On average, they walked about 25 meters more. This gain is likely to matter in real life. It suggests better strength and stamina before the operation.

After surgery, people who did prehab may also walk a bit farther. This was seen at four and eight weeks after the operation. But we are less sure about this result. The trials were small, and the findings varied.

Prehab may lower problems after surgery. People may have fewer issues and fewer trips to the emergency room. But this is not certain. The number of people in the trials was small, and results were not firm.

Prehab may also link to more returns to the hospital after going home. We do not know why this may be. It could be due to how care was set up. Or it could be by chance. Again, we are not sure because the numbers were small.

There was no clear change in time spent in the hospital. The trials did not show a clear difference between groups for this. Quality of life scores did not differ between groups in the data that were shared.

The trials did not give enough good data on some other points. These include heart‑lung fitness, grip strength, death after surgery, safety of the plan, how well people stuck to the plan, or time to return to normal life. Because of this, we cannot draw firm answers on these points.

How sure are we about the results? We are more sure about the gain in the six‑minute walk before surgery. We are less sure about the other results. The trials had few people. The trial methods and results were not all the same. These limits make it hard to be very sure.

What does this mean for patients? A four‑week prehab plan before bowel cancer surgery may help you move better before the operation. It may also help you move a bit better after surgery. It may lower some problems, but it could raise the chance of going back to the hospital. We do not know for sure yet.

Why is this work important? Many people have bowel cancer surgery each year. Even small gains in strength and recovery can help daily life. Prehab is a low‑risk idea that you can do at home with support. It may be a useful add‑on to care for some people.

What should come next? We need bigger and better trials. They should track safety, hospital use, return to normal life, and quality of life. Many such trials are now underway. Their results will help us know who benefits most, and how.

Bottom line
A short, three‑part prehab plan before bowel cancer surgery can boost how far people can walk before surgery. It may also help some early recovery steps. But we need more strong data to be sure about all benefits and any risks. Talk with your care team to see if a prehab plan is right for you.","Preparing a patient with bowel cancer for surgery with multiple interventions
Aim of this review 
The aim of this review is to find out whether multiple interventions introduced in the period prior to surgery for bowel cancer could prepare a patient by increasing the patient's overall fitness, and thus improve outcomes after surgery. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all available randomised controlled trials on this topic. 
Key messages 
Only three studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, information was not available for all outcomes and the overall certainty of evidence was very low to moderate. More and larger studies are needed to gather evidence on this topic. 
What was studied in the review? 
Surgery is often given to cure patients diagnosed with early stage bowel cancer. Surgery has a negative impact on the overall fitness of the patient. The energy level decreases, patients are more dependent in their daily living activities, and quality of life decreases. Furthermore, complications may occur after surgery causing a further decrease of fitness. Preoperative interventions, such as exercise programmes, nutritional advice and supplements, as well as mental support, may increase the fitness of the patient, prior to surgery. This concept is called prehabilitation. The impact of surgery is diminished and consequently results in faster and better recovery. Combining such preoperative interventions results in better preparation for surgery because each interventions may help to strengthen the effects of the others. The review authors aimed to study the effect of such multiple‐intervention preparation programmes before surgery for patients with bowel cancer. The review authors focused on these outcomes: physical fitness, number of complications after surgery, death rate, quality of life (assessed with questionnaires), length of stay in the hospital, number of emergency department visits, number of re‐admissions after surgery, safety of the programme and adherence to the programme. They compared groups with prehabilitation programmes to groups not receiving any preparation prior to surgery, other than standard care. 
Main results of this review 
The review authors found three studies with 250 participants with bowel cancer, without metastases, scheduled for surgery. Studies were conducted in Canada. A total of 130 participants followed four‐week prehabilitation programmes prior to surgery, which included exercises, nutritional advice and supplements, as well as techniques to reduce anxiety about their cancer and its treatment. Another 120 participants followed identical programmes, but only started them after the surgery, when they were discharged from hospital. 
Overall, the review authors did not find an improvement in either group of participants. The certainty of evidence was very low to moderate, mainly because of the small numbers of studies and participants included in the review. Physical fitness potentially improves and the number of complications and emergency department visits may diminish in patients receiving prehabilitation programmes prior to surgery. On the other hand, more re‐admissions to the hospital occurred after prehabilitation programmes. Because data on death rates, quality of life, length of stay in the hospital, safety of the programme and adherence to the programme was not complete or not reported, the review authors did not analyse these outcomes. Due to the mostly low or very low certainty of the evidence, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to January 2021 and also looked for unpublished, ongoing studies up to March 2021. In a future update of this review, many ongoing studies will likely have been completed, which can be included to collect more evidence on this subject.

Dialysis treatments weigh heavily on patients' physical and psychosocial health. Multiple studies have assessed the potential for exercise training to improve outcomes in adults undergoing dialysis. However, uncertainties exist in its relevance and sustainable benefits for patient‐important outcomes. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and safety of regular structured exercise training in adults undergoing dialysis on patient‐important outcomes including death, cardiovascular events, fatigue, functional capacity, pain, and depression. We also aimed to define the optimal prescription of exercise in adults undergoing dialysis. 
Search methods
In this update, we conducted a systematic search of the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 23 December 2020. The Register includes studies identified from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov as well as kidney‐related journals and the proceedings of major kidney conferences. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of any structured exercise programs of eight weeks or more in adults undergoing maintenance dialysis compared to no exercise or sham exercise. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the search results for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Whenever appropriate, we performed random‐effects meta‐analyses of the mean difference in outcomes. The primary outcomes were death (any cause), cardiovascular events and fatigue. Secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), depression, pain, functional capacity, blood pressure, adherence to the exercise program, and intervention‐related adverse events. 
Main results
We identified 89 studies involving 4291 randomised participants, of which 77 studies (3846 participants) contributed to the meta‐analyses. Seven studies included adults undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Fifty‐six studies reported aerobic exercise interventions, 21 resistance exercise interventions and 19 combined aerobic and resistance training within the same study arm. The interventions lasted from eight weeks to two years and most often took place thrice weekly during dialysis treatments. A single study reported death and no study reported long‐term cardiovascular events. Five studies directly assessed fatigue, 46 reported HRQoL and 16 reported fatigue or pain through their assessment of HRQoL. Thirty‐five studies assessed functional capacity, and 21 reported resting peripheral blood pressure. Twelve studies reported adherence to exercise sessions, and nine reported exercise‐related adverse events. Overall, the quality of the included studies was low and blinding of the participants was generally not feasible due to the nature of the intervention. 
Exercise had uncertain effects on death, cardiovascular events, and the mental component of HRQoL due to the very low certainty of evidence. Compared with sham or no exercise, exercise training for two to 12 months may improve fatigue in adults undergoing dialysis, however, a meta‐analysis could not be conducted. Any exercise training for two to 12 months may improve the physical component of HRQoL (17 studies, 656 participants: MD 4.12, 95% CI 1.88 to 6.37 points on 100 points‐scale; I² = 49%; low certainty evidence). Any exercise training for two to 12 months probably improves depressive symptoms (10 studies, 441 participants: SMD ‐0.65, 95% CI ‐1.07 to ‐0.22; I² = 77%; moderate certainty evidence) and the magnitude of the effect may be greater when maintaining the exercise beyond four months (6 studies, 311 participants: SMD ‐0.30, 95% CI 0.14 to ‐0.74; I² = 71%). Any exercise training for three to 12 months may improve pain (15 studies, 872 participants: MD 5.28 95% CI ‐0.12 to 10.69 points on 100 points‐scale; I² = 63%: low certainty evidence) however, the 95% CI indicates that exercise training may make little or no difference in the level of pain. Any exercise training for two to six months probably improves functional capacity as it increased the distance reached during six minutes of walking (19 studies, 827 participants: MD 49.91 metres, 95% CI 37.22 to 62.59; I² = 34%; moderate certainty evidence) and the number of sit‐to‐stand cycles performed in 30 seconds (MD 2.33 cycles, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.96; moderate certainty evidence). There was insufficient evidence to assess the safety of exercise training for adults undergoing maintenance dialysis. The results were similar for aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and a combination of both aerobic and resistance exercise. 
Authors' conclusions
It is uncertain whether exercise training improves death, cardiovascular events, or the mental component of HRQoL in adults undergoing maintenance dialysis. Exercise training probably improves depressive symptoms, particularly when the intervention is maintained beyond four months. Exercise training is also likely to improve functional capacity. Low certainty evidence suggested that exercise training may improve fatigue, the physical component of quality of life, and pain. The safety of exercise training for adults undergoing dialysis remains uncertain.

Can regular exercise help adults on dialysis feel and function better?

Rationale
Dialysis is a treatment for kidney failure. A machine or fluid cleans the blood. This care can be hard on the body and mind. People may feel very tired, weak, sad, or in pain.

Exercise may help. Moving the body can build strength and heart health. It may lift low mood and ease tiredness. Many small studies have tested exercise during dialysis. But we still need clear answers.

This review looked for those answers. The goal was to see if regular, planned exercise helps people on dialysis. The team also asked what type of exercise works best. They checked for both benefits and harms.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. The team searched medical lists through December 2020. They looked for good quality trials that used chance to pick who exercised. They only included plans that lasted eight weeks or more.

The people in the trials were adults on long-term dialysis. Some used a machine at a clinic. Some used fluid in the belly, called peritoneal dialysis. The studies compared exercise with no exercise or a fake plan.

In all, the review found 89 studies. These studies had 4,291 people. Of these, 77 studies could be combined for results. Seven studies included people on peritoneal dialysis.

The exercise plans were not all the same. Many used “aerobic” work, like walking or cycling. That means steady movement that raises the heart rate. Some used “resistance” work, like weights or bands. That means moves that build muscle. Some mixed both types in one plan.

Most plans took place three times a week. Many happened during dialysis sessions. The plans lasted from eight weeks to two years.

Results
The review looked at key health results. The team checked death, heart problems, tiredness, pain, mood, and daily function. They also tried to check safety. Many studies were small. Many could not hide who did the exercise. This makes the proof less sure.

Death and heart problems: We do not know if exercise helps people live longer. We also do not know if it lowers heart problems. Too few studies tracked these results for long enough.

Tiredness: Exercise may help people feel less tired. A few studies looked at tiredness as the main point. The results leaned toward benefit. But the team could not combine the data in one number.

Quality of life: This means how you feel and do each day. Exercise may help the physical part a little. People may feel they can do more daily tasks. We do not know if it helps the mental part. The proof for the mental part was not clear.

Mood and depression: Exercise likely helps low mood. The proof was stronger here than for other results. People felt better when they kept moving for over four months. Longer plans seemed to help more.

Pain: Exercise may ease pain a little. But it may also make little or no change. The results were mixed. We cannot be sure there is a clear effect.

Body function: Exercise helped people move better. In many studies, people could walk farther in six minutes. The gain was about 50 meters more. People could also stand up and sit down more times in 30 seconds. On average, they did about two more cycles. These gains suggest stronger legs and better stamina.

Safety: We cannot tell if exercise is fully safe in this group. Few studies tracked harms in detail. Some reported events, but the data were not enough. We need better tracking of harms in the future.

What this means: For adults on dialysis, exercise seems to help mood and how the body works. It may help tiredness and daily life tasks. The effect on pain is not clear. We do not know if exercise changes the risk of death or heart problems. We also lack clear data on harms.

What kind of exercise: Aerobic work, resistance work, or both all showed similar trends. Plans that lasted more than four months seemed to help mood more. Many plans used three sessions a week, often during dialysis.

What comes next: We need larger and longer trials. We need better tracking of harms. We also need to learn the best mix of type, time, and dose of exercise.

What you can do: If you are on dialysis, ask your care team about safe ways to move. A simple plan may start slow and build up. Exercise during dialysis may be an option in some clinics. Your team can help choose moves that fit your health and goals.

Investigator conclusion: Exercise likely helps mood and function in adults on dialysis. It may help tiredness and the body part of daily life. The effect on pain is not clear. We do not know about death or heart events yet. Safety needs more study.","Exercise training for adults receiving dialysis treatments
What is the issue? 
People undergoing dialysis treatments are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and depression, have a lower quality of life and limited survival than the general population. Furthermore, many people undergoing dialysis have difficulty performing daily activities because they lack the physical capacity and strength to do so. Multiple trials have assessed the potential for exercise training to improve the condition of adults undergoing dialysis, but no consensus has been reached. 
What did we do? 
We searched the medical literature for all randomised trials that assessed structured exercise programs in people undergoing dialysis. We then assessed the quality of those studies and combined their results to draw conclusions regarding the effect of exercise training to improve aspects of physical and mental health that are important to patients undergoing dialysis. 
What did we find? 
We found 89 studies involving 4291 participants. The exercise training programs lasted from eight weeks to two years and most often took place three times a week during the dialysis treatment. We could not determine the impact of exercise training on death, cardiovascular events (such as a heart attack) or mental well‐being. Moderate certainty evidence suggested that exercise training of any type is likely to improve depressive symptoms in adults undergoing dialysis, particularly when the exercise was maintained for longer than four months. Moderate quality evidence also suggested that exercise training may improve people's capacity to perform activities and tasks through the improvement of their capacity to walk and the strength and endurance of their legs. Exercise training may also improve fatigue and the physical aspects of quality of life, but the quality of the evidence was low. We could not conclude on the effect of exercise training on a person's mental well‐being. 
ConclusionsExercise training for people undergoing maintenance dialysis is likely to improve depression and their capacity to perform activities and tasks. Exercise training may also improve fatigue and pain sightly. Exercise training may improve the physical aspects of quality of life, but it is unclear whether it improves a person's mental well‐being. It is unclear whether exercise training reduces the number of deaths or cardiovascular events.

Exercise training is commonly recommended for individuals with fibromyalgia. This review is one of a series of reviews about exercise training for fibromyalgia that will replace the review titled ""Exercise for treating fibromyalgia syndrome"", which was first published in 2002. 
Objectives
To evaluate the benefits and harms of mixed exercise training protocols that include two or more types of exercise (aerobic, resistance, flexibility) for adults with fibromyalgia against control (treatment as usual, wait list control), non exercise (e.g. biofeedback), or other exercise (e.g. mixed versus flexibility) interventions. Specific comparisons involving mixed exercise versus other exercises (e.g. resistance, aquatic, aerobic, flexibility, and whole body vibration exercises) were not assessed.

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Thesis and Dissertations Abstracts, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Physiotherapy Evidence Databese (PEDro), Current Controlled Trials (to 2013), WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to December 2017, unrestricted by language, to identify all potentially relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia that compared mixed exercise interventions with other or no exercise interventions. Major outcomes were health‐related quality of life (HRQL), pain, stiffness, fatigue, physical function, withdrawals, and adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the quality of evidence for major outcomes using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 29 RCTs (2088 participants; 98% female; average age 51 years) that compared mixed exercise interventions (including at least two of the following: aerobic or cardiorespiratory, resistance or muscle strengthening exercise, and flexibility exercise) versus control (e.g. wait list), non‐exercise (e.g. biofeedback), and other exercise interventions. Design flaws across studies led to selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting biases. We prioritised the findings of mixed exercise compared to control and present them fully here. 
Twenty‐one trials (1253 participants) provided moderate‐quality evidence for all major outcomes but stiffness (low quality). With the exception of withdrawals and adverse events, major outcome measures were self‐reported and expressed on a 0 to 100 scale (lower values are best, negative mean differences (MDs) indicate improvement; we used a clinically important difference between groups of 15% relative difference). Results for mixed exercise versus control show that mean HRQL was 56 and 49 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (13 studies; 610 participants) with absolute improvement of 7% (3% better to 11% better) and relative improvement of 12% (6% better to 18% better). Mean pain was 58.6 and 53 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (15 studies; 832 participants) with absolute improvement of 5% (1% better to 9% better) and relative improvement of 9% (3% better to 15% better). Mean fatigue was 72 and 59 points in the control and exercise groups, respectively (1 study; 493 participants) with absolute improvement of 13% (8% better to 18% better) and relative improvement of 18% (11% better to 24% better). Mean stiffness was 68 and 61 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (5 studies; 261 participants) with absolute improvement of 7% (1% better to 12% better) and relative improvement of 9% (1% better to 17% better). Mean physical function was 49 and 38 in the control and exercise groups, respectively (9 studies; 477 participants) with absolute improvement of 11% (7% better to 15% better) and relative improvement of 22% (14% better to 30% better). Pooled analysis resulted in a moderate‐quality risk ratio for all‐cause withdrawals with similar rates across groups (11 per 100 and 12 per 100 in the control and intervention groups, respectively) (19 studies; 1065 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.51) with an absolute change of 1% (3% fewer to 5% more) and a relative change of 11% (28% fewer to 47% more). Across all 21 studies, no injuries or other adverse events were reported; however some participants experienced increased fibromyalgia symptoms (pain, soreness, or tiredness) during or after exercise. However due to low event rates, we are uncertain of the precise risks with exercise. Mixed exercise may improve HRQL and physical function and may decrease pain and fatigue; all‐cause withdrawal was similar across groups, and mixed exercises may slightly reduce stiffness. For fatigue, physical function, HRQL, and stiffness, we cannot rule in or out a clinically relevant change, as the confidence intervals include both clinically important and unimportant effects. 
We found very low‐quality evidence on long‐term effects. In eight trials, HRQL, fatigue, and physical function improvement persisted at 6 to 52 or more weeks post intervention but improvements in stiffness and pain did not persist. Withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. 
It is uncertain whether mixed versus other non‐exercise or other exercise interventions improve HRQL and physical function or decrease symptoms because the quality of evidence was very low. The interventions were heterogeneous, and results were often based on small single studies. Adverse events with these interventions were not measured, and thus uncertainty surrounds the risk of adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared to control, moderate‐quality evidence indicates that mixed exercise probably improves HRQL, physical function, and fatigue, but this improvement may be small and clinically unimportant for some participants; physical function shows improvement in all participants. Withdrawal was similar across groups. Low‐quality evidence suggests that mixed exercise may slightly improve stiffness. Very low‐quality evidence indicates that we are 'uncertain' whether the long‐term effects of mixed exercise are maintained for all outcomes; all‐cause withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. Compared to other exercise or non‐exercise interventions, we are uncertain about the effects of mixed exercise because we found only very low‐quality evidence obtained from small, very heterogeneous trials. Although mixed exercise appears to be well tolerated (similar withdrawal rates across groups), evidence on adverse events is scarce, so we are uncertain about its safety. We downgraded the evidence from these trials due to imprecision (small trials), selection bias (e.g. allocation), blinding of participants and care providers or outcome assessors, and selective reporting. 
","1. Plain Title
Do mixed types of exercise help adults with fibromyalgia?

2. Rationale
Fibromyalgia is a long-term pain problem. It can also cause tiredness and poor sleep. Many people feel stiff and have trouble with daily tasks. This harms life quality.

Doctors often suggest exercise for this condition. Exercise may lower pain and boost strength and mood. Mixing types of exercise may help even more. This means doing two or more kinds, like heart and lung work, muscle work, and stretching.

This study asked a clear question. Does mixed exercise help adults with fibromyalgia? It also asked if any harms occur. We need this review to guide safe care and set real goals.

3. Trial Design
This study looked at many past trials. These trials randomly put people into groups. Some did mixed exercise. Others had usual care, no exercise, or other help. The review used only adult studies.

The review found 29 trials with 2,088 adults. Almost all were women. The average age was 51 years. Mixed exercise used at least two types: heart and lung exercise, muscle strengthening, and stretching.

Trials measured pain, tiredness, stiffness, life quality, and daily tasks. Life quality means how people feel and live day to day. Time in the trials was not the same. Some checked people again 6 to 52 weeks later, or longer.

4. Results
Overall, mixed exercise helped many people a small amount. The gains were most clear for daily tasks and life quality. For some, the gains may feel small. For others, they may feel worth it.

People rated results on a 0 to 100 scale. Lower scores mean better results. Life quality scores were about 56 with no exercise. They were about 49 with mixed exercise. This shows better life quality with mixed exercise.

Pain scores were about 59 with no exercise. They were about 53 with mixed exercise. This shows a small drop in pain. Some people may feel this change. Others may not.

Tiredness scores were about 72 with no exercise. They were about 59 with mixed exercise. This suggests less tiredness with mixed exercise. Only one large trial gave this number.

Stiffness scores were about 68 with no exercise. They were about 61 with mixed exercise. This suggests a slight drop in stiffness. We are less sure about this result.

Daily task scores were about 49 with no exercise. They were about 38 with mixed exercise. This means people could do daily tasks a bit better. This result was seen across all people.

About the same number of people stopped the study in each group. It was about 11 in 100 with no exercise. It was about 12 in 100 with mixed exercise. This suggests people can stick with mixed exercise.

No injuries were reported in these trials. Some people felt more pain, soreness, or tiredness during or after a session. The number of these events was low. We cannot tell the exact risk.

We also looked at how long results last. In some trials, gains in life quality, tiredness, and daily tasks stayed. This lasted from about 6 weeks up to about a year. Gains in pain and stiffness did not last. Safety was not checked in these longer follow-ups.

We do not know if mixed exercise works better than one type of exercise. Trials that tested this were small and not alike. We also do not know if mixed exercise is better than other non-exercise help. The data were too weak to say.

Many trials had design limits. They were small or did not hide group plans well. Some did not mask the people rating the results. Some did not report all results. This lowers how sure we can be.

What does this mean for people with fibromyalgia? Mixed exercise likely helps daily life a bit. It may also help pain and tiredness a bit. Stiffness may improve a little. The size of the change can feel small. But it may still matter to you.

In short, mixed exercise seems okay to try. It appears safe based on what was reported. We still need better data on harms. We also need larger, well-run trials. These should track people for longer.

If you plan to try mixed exercise, start slow. Use two or more types: heart and lung work, muscle work, and stretching. Watch how your body feels during and after sessions. Adjust time, effort, and rest as needed. Consider help from a trained coach or therapist.","Mixed exercise programmes for adults with fibromyalgia
What is fibromyalgia and what is mixed exercise? 
Fibromyalgia is a condition causing chronic pain and soreness throughout the body. People with this condition often feel depressed, tired, and stiff, and have difficulty sleeping. Mixed exercise is defined as regular sessions of two or more types of exercise including aerobic (walking or cycling), strengthening (lifting weights or pulling against resistance bands), or flexibility (stretching) exercise. 
Study characteristics 
Reviewers searched for studies until December 2017, and found 29 studies (2088 people) conducted in 12 different countries. The average age of study participants was 51 years, and 98% were female. The average exercise programme was 14 weeks long with three sessions of 50 to 60 minutes per week. All exercise programmes were fully or partially supervised. Reviewers were most interested in comparing mixed exercise groups to control groups (19 studies; 1065 people). People in control groups either received no treatment or continued their usual care. 
Key results – mixed exercise vs control 
Each outcome below is measured on a scale that goes from 0 to 100, where lower scores are better. 
Health‐related quality of life (HRQL)  
After 5 to 26 weeks, people who exercised were 7% better (3% better to 11% better) or improved by 7 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their HRQL at 49 points.
People in the control group rated their HRQL at 56 points.
Pain  
After 5 to 26 weeks, people who exercised had 5% less pain (1% better to 9% better) or improved by 5 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their pain at 53 points.
People in the control group rated their pain at 58.6 points.
Tiredness  
After 14 to 24 weeks, people who exercised were 13% less tired (8% better to 18% better) or improved by 13 points on a 100 point scale 
People who exercised rated their tiredness at 59 points.
People in the control group rated their tiredness at 72 points.
Stiffness  
After 16 weeks, people who exercised were 7% less stiff (1% better 1 to 12% better) or improved by 7 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their stiffness at 61 points.
People in the control group rated their stiffness at 68 points.
Ability to do daily activities (physical function)  
After 8 to 24 weeks, people who exercised were 11% better (7% to 15%) or improved by 11 points on a 100 point scale. 
People who exercised rated their physical function at 38 points.
People in the control group rated their physical function at 49 points.
Harms ‐ Some participants experienced increased pain, soreness, or tiredness during or after exercise. Studies reported no injuries or other harms. However, reporting of harms was missing or incomplete in many studies. We are uncertain whether risk is increased with exercise. 
Leaving the study early – 11% of control participants left the study early compared with 12% of exercisers. 
Long‐term effects ‐ Analysis of long‐term effects of HRQL showed maintenance of mixed exercise effects at 6 to 12 weeks and at 13 to 26 weeks but not at 27 to 52 weeks. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that it is uncertain whether mixed exercises improve HRQL in the long term. Withdrawals and adverse events were not measured. 
Other ‐ Reviewers found no evidence that the benefits and harms of mixed exercise were any different from education programmes, cognitive‐behavioural training, biofeedback, medication, or other types of exercise. 
Conclusions and quality of evidence 
Mixed exercise may improve HRQL and the ability to do daily activities, may decrease pain and tiredness, and may be acceptable to individuals with fibromyalgia. Low‐quality evidence suggests that mixed exercise may slightly improve stiffness. When compared to other exercise or non‐exercise interventions, we are uncertain about the effects of mixed exercise. Although mixed exercise appears to be well tolerated (similar numbers of people leaving the study across groups), evidence on harms was scarce, so we are uncertain about its safety. Reviewers considered the quality of evidence to be low to moderate because of small numbers of people in the studies, some issues involving study design, and the low quality of results.

10.1002-14651858.CD013792.pub2,"Background
Miscarriage, defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks’ gestation, is common with approximately 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime, and 15% to 20% of pregnancies ending in a miscarriage. Progesterone has an important role in maintaining a pregnancy, and supplementation with different progestogens in early pregnancy has been attempted to rescue a pregnancy in women with early pregnancy bleeding (threatened miscarriage), and to prevent miscarriages in asymptomatic women who have a history of three or more previous miscarriages (recurrent miscarriage). 
Objectives
To estimate the relative effectiveness and safety profiles for the different progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage, and provide rankings of the available treatments according to their effectiveness, safety, and side‐effect profile. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to 15 December 2020: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE(R), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness or safety of progestogen treatment for the prevention of miscarriage. Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Randomised trials published only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information could be retrieved. We excluded quasi‐ and non‐randomised trials. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We performed pairwise meta‐analyses and indirect comparisons, where possible, to determine the relative effects of all available treatments, but due to the limited number of included studies only direct or indirect comparisons were possible. We estimated the relative effects for the primary outcome of live birth and the secondary outcomes including miscarriage (< 24 weeks of gestation), preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy, congenital abnormalities, and adverse drug events. Relative effects for all outcomes are reported separately by the type of miscarriage (threatened and recurrent miscarriage). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
Our meta‐analysis included seven randomised trials involving 5,682 women, and all provided data for meta‐analysis. All trials were conducted in hospital settings. Across seven trials (14 treatment arms), the following treatments were used: three arms (21%) used vaginal micronized progesterone; three arms (21%) used dydrogesterone; one arm (7%) used oral micronized progesterone; one arm (7%) used 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone, and six arms (43%) used placebo. 
Women with threatened miscarriage  
Based on the relative effects from the pairwise meta‐analysis, vaginal micronized progesterone (two trials, 4090 women, risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.07, high‐certainty evidence), and dydrogesterone (one trial, 406 women, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.07, moderate‐certainty evidence) probably make little or no difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo for women with threatened miscarriage. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with threatened miscarriage. 
The pre‐specified subgroup analysis by number of previous miscarriages is only possible for vaginal micronized progesterone in women with threatened miscarriage. In women with no previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, there is probably little or no improvement in the live birth rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04, high‐certainty evidence) when treated with vaginal micronized progesterone compared to placebo. However, for women with one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, vaginal micronized progesterone increases the live birth rate compared to placebo (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15, high‐certainty evidence). 
Women with recurrent miscarriage  
Based on the results from one trial (826 women) vaginal micronized progesterone (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.15, high‐certainty evidence) probably makes little or no difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage. The evidence for dydrogesterone compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage is of very low‐certainty evidence, therefore the effects remain unclear. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage. 
Additional outcomes  
All progestogen treatments have a wide range of effects on the other pre‐specified outcomes (miscarriage (< 24 weeks of gestation), preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy) in comparison to placebo for both threatened and recurrent miscarriage. Moderate‐ and low‐certainty evidence with a wide range of effects suggests that there is probably no difference in congenital abnormalities and adverse drug events with vaginal micronized progesterone for threatened (congenital abnormalities RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.46, moderate‐certainty evidence; adverse drug events RR 1.07 95% CI 0.81 to 1.39, moderate‐certainty evidence) or recurrent miscarriage (congenital abnormalities 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.85, low‐certainty evidence; adverse drug events RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.29, moderate‐certainty evidence) compared with placebo. There are limited data and very low‐certainty evidence on congenital abnormalities and adverse drug events for the other progestogens. 
Authors' conclusions
The overall available evidence suggests that progestogens probably make little or no difference to live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. However, vaginal micronized progesterone may increase the live birth rate for women with a history of one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, with likely no difference in adverse events. There is still uncertainty over the effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage.

Do hormone medicines help prevent miscarriage?

Rationale
A miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before week 24.
It is common. About one in four women has one in life.
About two in ten pregnancies end this way.
Miscarriage can cause deep pain and fear in a next pregnancy.

The body makes a hormone called progesterone.
This hormone helps the womb hold the pregnancy.
Some early studies raised hope that extra progesterone may help.
Doctors can give this hormone as a pill, gel, or other forms.

But many forms of this hormone exist.
We do not know which one works best, or is most safe.
This study asked a clear question.
Do these hormone drugs help women keep the pregnancy and have a live birth?
The team also looked at side effects and birth defects.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials.
The team searched big medical lists for trials up to mid‑December 2020.
They only used trials where chance chose who got the drug or a dummy pill.
A dummy pill (placebo) looks the same but has no drug.

They found seven trials.
These trials took place in hospitals.
In all, 5,682 women took part.
The trials had 14 groups that got one of these: vaginal progesterone, dydrogesterone, oral progesterone, 17‑alpha hydroxyprogesterone, or a dummy pill.

The women were in two main groups.
One group had bleeding in early pregnancy.
This is called a threatened miscarriage.
The other group had a past history of three or more miscarriages.
This is called recurrent miscarriage.

The trials compared how many women had a live birth.
A live birth means the baby was born alive.
The trials also tracked other events.
These were miscarriage, birth that came too soon, stillbirth, pregnancy outside the womb, birth defects, and drug side effects.
Each trial followed women through the pregnancy to birth.

Results
Women with bleeding in early pregnancy
Vaginal progesterone is a form you place in the vagina.
Across two large trials, it made little or no change in live births for most women.
One trial of a pill called dydrogesterone also showed little or no change.
For two other forms (oral progesterone and 17‑alpha hydroxyprogesterone), there were no live birth data in this group.

The team also looked at women with bleeding now who had at least one past miscarriage.
In this subgroup, vaginal progesterone did help.
More babies were born alive with the drug than with the dummy pill.
This finding had high trust.

Women with a past history of three or more miscarriages
One trial tested vaginal progesterone in this group.
It showed little or no change in live births.
For dydrogesterone, the data were not clear.
For oral progesterone and 17‑alpha hydroxyprogesterone, there were no live birth data in this group.

Other outcomes
The trials also looked at other outcomes.
These include miscarriage, birth that came too soon, stillbirth, and pregnancy outside the womb.
Across drug types, the results for these were mixed and not clear.
For many of these, the drug seemed to make little or no clear change.

Safety
Vaginal progesterone did not raise the risk of birth defects.
It also did not raise side effects compared to a dummy pill.
This was true for women with bleeding and for those with past losses.
For the other forms of the drug, there were few data, so safety is not clear.

What this means for patients
For most women with early bleeding, progesterone drugs do not help more babies be born alive.
One clear group may gain.
Vaginal progesterone can help women who bleed early and have had at least one past miscarriage.
For women with three or more past miscarriages and no bleeding now, vaginal progesterone did not help.

These results can guide care.
They suggest we should target treatment to the group most likely to gain.
They also show we need more good trials.
We need to know if other forms help, and if they are safe.

Study limits and next steps
The review used seven trials.
Some drugs had very few or no trials for key outcomes.
So, for some drugs, we still do not know if they work or are safe.
New trials should test those drugs and include live birth.

Take‑home message
Progesterone drugs, as a group, likely do not help most women avoid miscarriage.
Vaginal progesterone can help women who bleed early and had at least one past loss.
This use did not show more side effects or birth defects.
For other forms, we still need clear proof.","Are progestogen treatments effective in preventing miscarriage?
We set out to find out which progestogen treatment is most effective, safe, and has fewer side‐effects for preventing miscarriage in women with threatened and with recurrent miscarriage, using evidence from randomised controlled trials. We looked at the number of women who went on to have a live birth, or miscarriage. 
What is the issue? 
Miscarriage is the most common cause of early pregnancy loss in the first 24 weeks and one of the most common complications in early pregnancy. An estimated 15% to 20% of pregnancies will end in a miscarriage, with 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. Women can be at risk of a miscarriage if they experience early pregnancy bleeding, or if they have a history of previous miscarriages. 
Why is this important? 
Progesterone is an important pregnancy hormone that helps to maintain a pregnancy. A variety of different progesterone‐like treatments (known as progestogens) have been used to treat women with early pregnancy bleeding. They are also used to prevent miscarriage in women with a history of previous miscarriages. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness, safety, and side‐effects of the available progestogens for preventing miscarriage in these different groups of women. We wanted to find out which, if any, of the treatments is the most effective and safest. We collected and analysed all the relevant studies to answer this question. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence in December 2020 and identified seven studies involving 5,682 women. All women were managed in hospitals. Women were diagnosed with early pregnancy bleeding (known as threatened miscarriage), or had a history of three or more previous miscarriages (known as recurrent miscarriage). Four different progestogen treatments were used: vaginal micronized progesterone, oral dydrogesterone, oral micronized progesterone and 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone injected into muscle. In six of the studies the treatments were compared to inactive placebo. 
Three studies involved 4496 women with threatened miscarriage, some of whom had previously experienced a miscarriage. Overall, vaginal micronized progesterone (high‐quality evidence) and oral dydrogesterone (moderate‐quality evidence) made little difference to the number of women who went on to have a live birth when compared with placebo. We further studied the women who had experienced a previous miscarriage, were now presenting with a threatened miscarriage, and were given vaginal micronized progesterone or placebo. For women with one or more previous miscarriages, vaginal micronized progesterone increased the live birth rate compared to placebo (high‐quality evidence). Those women who had no previous miscarriages, but were now presenting with early pregnancy bleeding showed no improvement in live birth rate (high‐certainty evidence). 
For women with recurrent miscarriage, we based our findings on one study involving 826 women. Overall, vaginal micronized progesterone made little difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo. The evidence for dydrogesterone compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage is of very low‐certainty evidence, therefore the effects remain unclear. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17‐α‐hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage. 
From the available data, there are likely no differences in adverse events associated with vaginal micronized progesterone. There was no difference in birth defects and side effects with vaginal micronized progesterone when compared with placebo. There was not enough information about safety and birth defects for us to analyse for all the other treatments. 
What does this mean? 
The overall available evidence suggests that progestogens probably make little or no difference to live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. Vaginal micronized progesterone may increase the live birth rate for women who are experiencing early pregnancy bleeding and have a history of one or more previous miscarriages, with likely no difference in adverse events. There is still uncertainty over the effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage. 
"
10.1002-14651858.CD014955,"Background
Drowning is responsible for an estimated 320,000 deaths a year, and over 90% of drowning mortality occurs in low‐ to middle‐income countries (LMICs), with peak drowning rates among children aged 1 to 4 years. In this age group, mortality due to drowning is particularly common in rural settings and about 75% of drowning accidents happen in natural bodies of water close to the home. Providing adequate child supervision can protect children from drowning, and organized formal day care programs could offer a way to achieve this. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
• To assess the effects of day care programs for children under 6 years of age on drowning‐related mortality or morbidity, or on total drowning accidents (fatal and non‐fatal), in LMICs, compared to no day care programs or other drowning prevention interventions 
Secondary objectives 
• To assess the effects of day care programs in LMICs for children under 6 years of age on unsafe water exposure 
• To assess safety within these programs (e.g. transmission of infection within day care, physical or sexual abuse of children within day care) 
• To assess the incidence of unintentional injury within these programs
• To describe the cost‐effectiveness of such programs, in relation to averted drowning‐related mortality or morbidity 
Search methods
On November 23, 2019, and for an update on August 18, 2020, we searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, CENTRAL, ERIC, and CINAHL, as well as two trial registries. On December 16, 2019, and for an update on February 9, 2021, we searched 12 other resources, including websites of organizations that develop programs targeted to children. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized, quasi‐randomized, and non‐randomized controlled studies (with explicitly listed specific study design features) that implemented formal day care programs as a single program or combined with additional out‐of‐day care components (such as educational activities aimed at preventing injury or drowning or early childhood development activities) for children of preschool age (below 6 years of age) in LMICs for comparison with no such programs or with other drowning prevention interventions. Studies had to report at least one outcome related to drowning or injury prevention for the children enrolled. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection and data extraction, as well as risk of bias and GRADE assessment. 
Main results
Two non‐randomized observational studies, conducted in rural Bangladesh, involving a total of 252,631 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review. One of these studies compared a formal day care program combined with parent education, playpens provided to parents, and community‐based activities as additional out‐of‐day care components versus no such program. Overall we assessed this study to be at moderate risk of bias (moderate risk of bias due to confounding, low risk of bias for other domains). This study showed that implementation of a formal day care program combined with parent education, provision of playpens to parents, and community‐based activities, in a rural area with a high drowning incidence, likely reduces the risk of death from drowning over the study period of 4 years and 8 months compared to no day care program (hazard ratio 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06 to 0.58; 1 study, 136,577 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Drowning morbidity (non‐fatal drowning resulting in complications), total drowning (fatal and non‐fatal), unsafe water exposure, and program safety (e.g. transmission of infection within day care, physical or sexual abuse of children within day care) were not reported, nor was the incidence of other unintentional injuries. Cost‐effectiveness was reported as 812 USD (95% CI 589 to 1777) per disability‐adjusted life‐year averted as a consequence of drowning (moderate‐certainty evidence). The second study compared day care programs with or without playpens provided to parents as an additional component versus only playpens provided to parents as an alternative drowning prevention intervention. Overall we assessed the study to be at critical risk of bias because we judged bias due to confounding to be at critical risk. As the certainty of evidence was very low, we are uncertain about the effects on drowning mortality rate of implementing a day care program compared to providing playpens (rate ratio 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study; 76,575 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Likewise, we are uncertain about the effects of a day care program with playpens provided as an additional component versus playpens provided alone (rate ratio 0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.12; 1 study, 45,460 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The other outcomes of interest ‐ drowning morbidity, total drowning, unsafe water exposure, program safety, incidence of other unintentional injuries, and cost‐effectiveness ‐ were not reported. 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides evidence suggesting that a day care program with additional out‐of‐day care components such as community‐based education, parent education, and playpens provided to parents likely reduces the drowning mortality risk in regions with a high burden of drowning compared to no intervention.

Drowning takes many young lives each year. About 320,000 people die this way. Most deaths are in countries with less money. The highest risk is for children ages one to four.

Many families live near ponds, ditches, and rivers. These places are often close to the home. Many drownings happen there. They often happen when parents must work.

Close watch can prevent many drownings. Day care gives safe watch in the day. Staff can also teach safety to parents and children. This may keep kids away from water.

This review asked a clear question. Do day care plans lower drowning in young kids? It looked at plans in countries with less money. It also looked at safety and cost.

Trial Design
The team did a review of the evidence. They searched many sources in 2019 and 2021. They looked for studies on day care for kids under six. The studies had to report drowning or injury results.

They found two studies that fit the plan. Both took place in rural Bangladesh. The studies watched what happened in real life. They did not assign families by chance.

The two studies had 252,631 children. One study ran for four years and eight months. The other study did not give the time. Both compared day care with other choices.

One study added parent class, playpens, and village events. It compared this plan to no plan. The other compared day care to playpens at home. A playpen is a small, fenced safe space.

Results
In the first study, day care with extra parts likely saved lives. The plan also used parent class and village work. Families also got playpens for home use. This was in a high risk area.

Children in the plan had fewer drowning deaths. Their chance of death was about one fifth. This was compared to no program at all. The time in the study was almost five years.

That study did not report on non fatal drowning. It did not report total drowning events. It did not report other injuries to children. It did not report on day care safety checks.

That study did report cost in simple terms. The plan cost about 812 US dollars. That amount gained one year of healthy life. This can guide health budget plans.

The second study gave less clear news. It tested day care against playpens at home. It also tested day care plus playpens against playpens alone. The playpen is a small safe space for a child.

The study methods had big limits. The way groups were made was not by chance. This makes the results hard to trust. So we cannot say if day care helped more.

That study also did not track key signs. It did not track non fatal drowning events. It did not track water exposure or safety in care. It did not report costs.

So what do these studies mean for families? Day care with parent class and village work may help. It likely cut deaths from drowning in that place. It may help most where water is near the home.

The review shows both hope and gaps. It found a plan that likely saves young lives. But it found little on harms or safety in care. It also found little on other injuries.

All studies took place in rural Bangladesh. We did not find studies in other places. So we do not know what will happen elsewhere. More research can test this in other lands.

The big take home is clear. Good day care in the day can keep kids safe. It can work with parent class, playpens, and village action. Leaders can use this to plan care.

The authors drew a careful close. A day care plan with these extra parts likely helps. It can lower deaths from drowning in high risk rural areas. More strong studies are still needed.","Can day care programs for children under 6 years of age in low‐ to middle‐income countries reduce their risk of drowning? 
Key message 
A day care program with extra features such as community‐based education, parent education, and playpens provided to parents outside the day care facility probably reduces the risk of death by drowning for children under 6 years living in areas where large numbers of children drown each year. 
Why did we do this Cochrane Review? 
Children living in rural areas near open water are at risk of drowning, particularly if they are not attending school or are left unsupervised. Child supervision is recommended to prevent drowning accidents, and organized day care at a center outside the home could help. 
We wanted to know if a day care program for children under 6 years of age in low‐ to middle‐income countries might help to reduce the number of drowning accidents (fatal and non‐fatal). 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at the effects of a day care program on drowning accidents in children under 6 years of age. The day care program could include features such as educational activities aimed at preventing injuries or drowning and early childhood development activities. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We included evidence published up to August 18, 2020.
What did we find? 
We found 2 studies that involved 252,631 children and took place in rural Bangladesh.
One study lasted 4 years and 8 months. It assessed the effects of a day care program that combined parent education, playpens provided to parents, and community education as compared to the effects of no day care program. 
The other study lasted 3 years and 4 months. The effects of a day care program alone and the effects of a combined program of day care with playpens provided to parents were each compared with the effects of only playpens provided to parents. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Compared with no day care program, a day care program for children under 6 years of age, combined with parent education, playpens for parents, and community education, probably reduces the risk of death from drowning (evidence from 1 study in 136,577 children). For every 100,000 children under 6 years of age who were not in the day care program, 77 children might die from drowning, compared with 14 children included in the day care program. 
Providing this day care program with additional activities was cheaper than the cost of every year lost to illness, disability, or early death by drowning (evidence from 1 study in 136,577 children). 
We are uncertain about the effects of a day care program when compared with playpens provided to parents, and we are uncertain about the effects of a day care program combined with playpens for parents when compared with playpens alone. 
Neither study reported results on non‐fatal drowning accidents, unsafe water exposure, the safety of the program, or other accidental injuries. 
Limitations of the evidence 
The results were from two observational studies in which researchers observed the effects of a factor (such as a day care program) without trying to change who did, or did not, experience it. Evidence from observational studies is not as reliable as evidence from randomized controlled studies, in which the programs people receive are decided at random. 
We are moderately confident about the effects of a day care program (with extra features) on the risk of death by drowning in children under 6 years of age. Further research is likely to increase our confidence in these results.

10.1002-14651858.CD013485.pub2,"Background
Asthma is a respiratory disease characterised by variable airflow limitation and the presence of respiratory symptoms including wheeze, chest tightness, cough and/or dyspnoea. Exercise training is beneficial for people with asthma; however, the response to conventional models of pulmonary rehabilitation is less clear. 
Objectives
To evaluate, in adults with asthma, the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care on exercise performance, asthma control, and quality of life (co‐primary outcomes), incidence of severe asthma exacerbations/hospitalisations, mental health, muscle strength, physical activity levels, inflammatory biomarkers, and adverse events. 
Search methods
We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, from their inception to May 2021, as well as the reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials in which pulmonary rehabilitation was compared to usual care in adults with asthma. Pulmonary rehabilitation must have included a minimum of four weeks (or eight sessions) aerobic training and education or self‐management. Co‐interventions were permitted; however, exercise training alone was not.  
Data collection and analysis
Following the use of Cochrane's Screen4Me workflow, two review authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, extracted study characteristics and outcome data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We contacted study authors to retrieve missing data. We calculated between‐group effects via mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) using a random‐effects model. We evaluated the certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology. 
Main results
We included 10 studies involving 894 participants (range 24 to 412 participants (n = 2 studies involving n > 100, one contributing to meta‐analysis), mean age range 27 to 54 years). We identified one ongoing study and three studies awaiting classification. One study was synthesised narratively, and another involved participants specifically with asthma‐COPD overlap. Most programmes were outpatient‐based, lasting from three to four weeks (inpatient) or eight to 12 weeks (outpatient). Education or self‐management components included breathing retraining and relaxation, nutritional advice and psychological counselling. One programme was specifically tailored for people with severe asthma.  
Pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care may increase maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) after programme completion, but the evidence is very uncertain for data derived using mL/kg/min (MD between groups of 3.63 mL/kg/min, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48 to 5.77; 3 studies; n = 129) and uncertain for data derived from % predicted VO2 max (MD 14.88%, 95% CI 9.66 to 20.1%; 2 studies; n = 60). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care on incremental shuttle walk test distance (MD between groups 74.0 metres, 95% CI 26.4 to 121.4; 1 study; n = 30). Pulmonary rehabilitation may have little to no effect on VO2 max at longer‐term follow up (9 to 12 months), but the evidence is very uncertain (MD −0.69 mL/kg/min, 95% CI −4.79 to 3.42; I2 = 49%; 3 studies; n = 66). 
Pulmonary rehabilitation likely improves functional exercise capacity as measured by 6‐minute walk distance, with MD between groups after programme completion of 79.8 metres (95% CI 66.5 to 93.1; 5 studies; n = 529; moderate certainty evidence). This magnitude of mean change exceeds the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) threshold for people with chronic respiratory disease. The evidence is very uncertain about the longer‐term effects one year after pulmonary rehabilitation for this outcome (MD 52.29 metres, 95% CI 0.7 to 103.88; 2 studies; n = 42). 
Pulmonary rehabilitation may result in a small improvement in asthma control compared to usual care as measured by Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), with an MD between groups of −0.46 (95% CI −0.76 to −0.17; 2 studies; n = 93; low certainty evidence); however, data derived from the Asthma Control Test were very uncertain (MD between groups 3.34, 95% CI −2.32 to 9.01; 2 studies; n = 442). The ACQ finding approximates the MCID of 0.5 points. Pulmonary rehabilitation results in little to no difference in asthma control as measured by ACQ at nine to 12 months follow‐up (MD 0.09, 95% CI −0.35 to 0.53; 2 studies; n = 48; low certainty evidence). 
Pulmonary rehabilitation likely results in a large improvement in quality of life as assessed by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (MD −18.51, 95% CI −20.77 to −16.25; 2 studies; n = 440; moderate certainty evidence), with this magnitude of change exceeding the MCID. However, pulmonary rehabilitation may have little to no effect on Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) total scores, with the evidence being very uncertain (MD 0.87, 95% CI −0.13 to 1.86; 2 studies; n = 442). Longer‐term follow‐up data suggested improvements in quality of life may occur as measured by SGRQ (MD −13.4, 95% CI −15.93 to −10.88; 2 studies; n = 430) but not AQLQ (MD 0.58, 95% CI −0.23 to 1.38; 2 studies; n = 435); however, the evidence is very uncertain. 
One study reported no difference between groups in the proportion of participants who experienced an asthma exacerbation during the intervention period. Data from one study suggest adverse events attributable to the intervention are rare.  
Overall risk of bias was most commonly impacted by performance bias attributed to a lack of participant blinding to knowledge of the intervention. This is inherently challenging to overcome in rehabilitation studies.  
Authors' conclusions
Moderate certainty evidence shows that pulmonary rehabilitation is probably associated with clinically meaningful improvements in functional exercise capacity and quality of life upon programme completion in adults with asthma. The certainty of evidence relating to maximal exercise capacity was very low to low. Pulmonary rehabilitation appears to confer minimal effect on asthma control, although the certainty of evidence is very low to low. Unclear reporting of study methods and small sample sizes limits our certainty in the overall body of evidence, whilst heterogenous study designs and interventions likely contribute to inconsistent findings across clinical outcomes and studies. There remains considerable scope for future research.

Breathing and exercise programs for adults with asthma: what do trials show?

Rationale
Asthma makes it hard to breathe. It can cause wheeze, chest tightness, and cough. Many people also feel short of breath with daily tasks or with play or work. This can lower mood, sleep, and day to day life.

Exercise can help people with asthma. But we do not know how well a full “pulmonary rehab” plan works. Pulmonary rehab is a set plan of exercise and learning. It can include breath training, calm and relax work, food advice, and support.

This kind of plan may build strength and stamina. It may also help people know how to live with asthma. This review asked if these plans help adults move more, feel better, and manage asthma. It also asked if they cut bad flare-ups or cause harms.

Trial Design
This study was a review of past trials. It looked for high quality trials that used chance to pick groups. One group had pulmonary rehab. The other group had usual care. Usual care means the care people already get from their clinic.

The team found 10 trials. These trials had 894 adults with asthma. Most people were in their 20s to 50s. One trial was in people with both asthma and lung disease called COPD.

Most plans took place in out-patient clinics. Some plans were in the hospital. Plans ran from 3 to 4 weeks in the hospital. Out-patient plans ran 8 to 12 weeks. Each plan had at least 4 weeks or 8 sessions.

Plans had exercise and learning. Exercise was often brisk walk or bike. Learning could include breath retrain, relax skills, food advice, and talk time with a coach. One plan was for people with bad or “severe” asthma.

Some trials checked people again 9 to 12 months later. The review looked at how far people could walk in 6 minutes. It also looked at asthma control, and how people felt about life. It checked flare-ups, hospital stays, and harms when these were shared.

Results
Key point: people who took part in pulmonary rehab could walk farther. On a six minute walk test, they did much better. This gain was large enough to matter in real life. We are fairly sure about this result at the end of the program.

We do not know if gains last a year. A few small trials checked a year later. Those results were not clear.

Pulmonary rehab may help a little with asthma control. Asthma control means how often and how bad symptoms are. Two trials found a small gain at the end of the plan. But this small gain did not seem to last at 9 to 12 months.

We are not sure if pulmonary rehab raises top fitness. Top fitness means how well the body uses oxygen at peak effort. Some trials showed a gain right after the plan. But the proof was weak or mixed. We also do not know if gains last over time.

Quality of life showed a clear rise on one survey. This survey asks how lung signs affect daily life. On that survey, people felt a lot better after the plan. This change also seemed to last in some groups. A second survey, made just for asthma, did not show a clear change. This mix of results means some ways of asking show gains, but others do not.

One trial looked at bad asthma flare-ups during the plan. A bad flare-up can need steroids or a hospital stay. That trial found no clear change between groups. We need more trials to know if the plans cut flare-ups.

Harms from the plans were rare in one trial that shared this. The review found no sign of common harms. Still, not all trials shared harms in detail. So we need more info on safety.

What limits these results? People knew if they were in the plan. That is hard to avoid in exercise trials. Trials were small, and plans were not all the same. These facts can make results less sure. Some trials did not share all methods or outcomes.

What do these results mean for people with asthma? A set plan of exercise and learning can help you move more. It can help you feel better about day to day life. Gains are most clear right after the plan. Gains may fade with time without follow up support. We do not know yet if these plans cut bad flare-ups. Harms seem rare, but we need more data.

In short, pulmonary rehab likely helps adults with asthma walk farther. It likely helps many feel better in daily life. It may help a little with symptom control. It may not change flare-ups. The proof is stronger for walk gains and life quality. The proof is weaker for peak fitness and long term change. More large, clear trials are needed to guide care.","What are the benefits of supervised programmes of exercise and education (known as pulmonary rehabilitation) compared with usual care for adults with asthma? 
Key messages  
‐ We found that people with asthma who take part in supervised programmes of exercise and education (known as pulmonary rehabilitation) are likely to get fitter (can walk further) and have better wellbeing immediately after completing these programmes compared to those who receive usual care. However, we are not certain if these benefits persist up to one year later. 
‐ Due to a lack of evidence, the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on outcomes such as rates of asthma attacks or hospitalisations, anxiety and depression, or physical activity levels is unclear.  
‐ Larger, well‐designed studies are needed to better estimate the true benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation for adults with asthma. 
What is asthma? 
Asthma is a common lung disease where the breathing tubes can become inflamed and narrowed and may produce extra mucus. People with asthma can experience cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and breathlessness, with those most severely affected experiencing difficulty going about their everyday lives.  
Asthma cannot be cured, but symptoms can be controlled. Different medications can help keep symptoms under control, whilst physical exercise can also help. However, some people with asthma may find it challenging to undertake comprehensive exercise programmes. 
What is pulmonary rehabilitation? 
Supervised programmes of exercise and education (called pulmonary rehabilitation) are commonly used for people with chronic lung conditions and help improve breathing, fitness, and wellbeing. These programmes may be based at hospitals, outpatient clinics, or even at home.  
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a recommended standard of care for many chronic lung conditions; however, its effects in adults with asthma are less clear. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to see how pulmonary rehabilitation affects physical fitness, control of asthma symptoms, and wellbeing of adults with asthma compared to usual clinical care involving no pulmonary rehabilitation. We also wanted to learn how it affects the rate of severe asthma attacks/hospitalisations, mental health (anxiety and depression), muscle strength, physical activity levels, and markers of inflammation (in sputum or blood). Finally, we wanted to see whether it is associated with any unwanted effects.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared pulmonary rehabilitation to usual care in adults with asthma. Treatment must have lasted at least four weeks (or eight or more sessions) and must have included aerobic exercises (such as walking or cycling) and education or self‐management.  
We compared and summarised findings across all eligible studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and size. 
What did we find? 
‐ We found 10 studies involving 894 adults with asthma. 
‐ The studies ranged in size from 24 to 412 people. 
‐ Most studies were conducted in Europe. 
‐ Where reported, most study participants were female, with the average age ranging from 27 to 54 years.  
‐ One study specifically included people with severe forms of asthma. Another study specifically included people who had a condition involving overlapping features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
‐ The way pulmonary rehabilitation was delivered varied across studies. Inpatient programmes lasted 3 to 4 weeks, whilst outpatient programmes lasted 8 to 12 weeks. 
‐ The specific nature of exercise or education components amongst the included studies varied widely. 
Main results 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation probably causes a large increase in physical fitness immediately after completion of the programme, resulting in an ability to walk an average of 80 metres further in 6 minutes than in people who receive usual care. There may be little to no effect on physical fitness measured up to one year later. 
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation may result in small improvements in or little to no impact on asthma control immediately after completion of the programme or up to one year later compared to usual care.  
‐ Pulmonary rehabilitation probably causes a large improvement in wellbeing as measured by the St George’s Respiratory Disease Questionnaire immediately after completion of the programme. Results may differ slightly according to different quality of life instruments. The effects potentially last up to one year, but results are very uncertain. 
‐ Little to no effect on wellbeing was observed after programme completion or up to nine months follow‐up when the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire was used.  
‐ There was very limited evidence to determine the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on rates of asthma attacks/hospitalisations, measures of anxiety and depression, limb muscle strength, levels of physical activity, or markers of inflammation in the blood or sputum.  
‐ Data from one study suggested pulmonary rehabilitation resulted in no direct unwanted or harmful effects. 
Limitations of the evidence  
Our confidence in the evidence relating to outcomes such as physical fitness, wellbeing, and asthma control is limited due to concerns regarding unclear methods in some studies, the potential for participants or assessors (or both) to have influenced outcomes due to the awareness of assigned treatments, and the varied ways in which pulmonary rehabilitation was delivered. 
The evidence is up‐to‐date to May 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD012470.pub2,"Interventions for treating wrist fractures (broken wrists) in children
Background and aim 
Wrist fractures are the most common bone injury in children. Most are buckle (or torus) fractures, where the bone surface bulges out. These minor fractures heal well. They are often treated with a wrist splint or a below‐elbow plaster cast.  More serious fractures are where the bone breaks, generally resulting in displacement of the bone parts. Usually the bone is manipulated back into place ('reduction'), followed by cast immobilisation, often with an above‐elbow cast including the elbow. When considered, surgery generally involves placing wires through the skin and into the bone (percutaneous wiring). 
We aimed to assess the best‐quality evidence for different treatments of wrist fractures in children. 
Results of the search 
We searched medical databases up to May 2018 and included 30 studies with 2930 children. Studies included more male children and reported mean ages between eight and 10 years. We summarise the results from five key comparisons. 
Key results 
Six studies compared a removable splint with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. One study found there may be little or no difference between the two devices in physical function at four weeks. Few children needed a change or reapplication of either splint or cast (4 studies). There were no refractures. We are uncertain whether there is any difference in pain during device use. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate time to return to former activities (recovery time), minor complications, and child or parent satisfaction. Two studies found lower healthcare costs for splints. 
Four studies compared a soft or elasticated bandage with a below‐elbow cast for buckle fractures. We are uncertain if there is less disability at four weeks after bandaging. Few children changed device or needed extended immobilisation (3 studies). There were no serious adverse events. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate recovery time, wrist pain, minor complications, and satisfaction. Children found the bandage more convenient (1 study). 
Two studies (mainly buckle fractures) compared cast removal at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (a cast saw was not required for home removal). All had recovered function at four weeks (1 study). There were few treatment changes and no serious adverse effects. Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There may be no difference in pain at four weeks (1 study). There may be greater parental satisfaction for cast removal at home (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. 
Four studies compared below‐elbow versus above‐elbow casts in usually displaced fractures. We are uncertain if children are less dependent on help when using below‐elbow casts. We are uncertain if there is a difference between the two casts in physical function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain about the finding that all children with above‐elbow casts needed another fracture reduction. There were no serious adverse events. Recovery time and minor complications were not reported. There may be little difference in needing physiotherapy for stiffness. Pain at one week may be less for below‐elbow casts (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for below‐elbow casts. 
Five studies compared percutaneous wiring and above‐elbow cast immobilisation versus above‐elbow cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures. Short‐term physical function was not reported. There may be no between‐group difference in function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain whether surgery reduces the risk of treatment failure, defined as early or difficult removal of wires, and remanipulation for loss in position. We are uncertain whether there are fewer serious adverse events with surgery. Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There may be less need for physiotherapy after surgery. One USA study found treatment costs were similar. 
Quality of the evidence 
All 30 studies had weaknesses that could affect the reliability of their results. We considered the evidence for all outcomes to be low or very low quality. 
Conclusion 
There is not enough evidence to determine the best ways of treating different types of wrist fractures in children. However, the review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for buckle fractures.

How to treat a child’s broken wrist

2. Rationale
A broken wrist is the most common bone injury in kids. Many kids have a “buckle” break. In a buckle break, the bone bulges but does not snap. These tend to heal well. Some kids have a more serious break. In these, the bone parts move out of line.

There are many ways to treat these breaks. Choices include a splint, a soft bandage, or a hard cast. Some casts cover the elbow. Some stop below the elbow. Some children also have surgery. In that case, thin wires go through the skin into the bone to hold it.

Families want care that is safe and easy. They want less pain and a fast return to play. Doctors also hope to cut cost when they can. This study asked which care helps the most. It also asked which care is safe and good value. The team wanted clear facts to guide parents and doctors.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of many past studies. The team searched health papers up to May 2018. They found 30 studies. These studies had 2,930 children in total. More boys took part than girls. The average age was 8 to 10 years.

The review looked at five main care choices. These were:
- Splint versus below‑elbow cast for buckle breaks.
- Soft or elastic bandage versus below‑elbow cast for buckle breaks.
- Home cast removal by parents versus removal at the clinic.
- Below‑elbow cast versus above‑elbow cast for moved breaks.
- Surgery with wires plus an above‑elbow cast versus an above‑elbow cast alone, after the bone was put back in line.

Some studies checked results at one week. Some checked at four weeks. One study checked at six months. Not all studies looked at the same things. Many had gaps in what they measured.

4. Results
Buckle breaks: splint versus cast
Six studies looked at this. One study found kids used the arm about the same at four weeks. Only a few kids needed a change of device. No child broke the wrist again. We do not know if pain was the same or not. Two studies found splints cost less for health care.

Buckle breaks: soft bandage versus cast
Four studies looked at this. We do not know if bandage led to less trouble at four weeks. Only a few kids needed to switch or wear the device for longer. No serious harms were seen. One study found kids felt the bandage was more handy. We do not know the effect on pain, small harms, or time to get back to play.

Buckle breaks: home removal of cast versus clinic removal
Two studies looked at this. In one study, all kids got back their arm use by four weeks. Few needed a change in care. There were no serious harms. One study found pain was much the same at four weeks. One study found parents were more happy with home removal. One study found home removal cost less. A saw was not needed at home.

Moved breaks: below‑elbow cast versus above‑elbow cast
Four studies looked at this. We do not know if kids needed less help with a below‑elbow cast. One study found arm use at six months was much the same with both casts. One study said all kids with casts over the elbow needed the bone moved back again. We are not sure this is true. There were no serious harms. Pain at one week may be less with a below‑elbow cast. One study found lower cost with a below‑elbow cast.

Moved breaks after bone set: surgery with wires plus cast versus cast alone
Five studies looked at this. Short‑term arm use was not reported. One study found arm use at six months was much the same. We do not know if surgery lowers the chance that care will fail. We also do not know if surgery leads to fewer serious harms. Kids who had surgery may need less therapy after. One study in the USA found the total cost was about the same.

Quality of the evidence
All 30 studies had weak points. These could change the results. Many key points were not well measured. So the proof for all main points was low or very low. This means we must be careful when we use these results.

What this means for patients and families
For buckle breaks, a splint or a soft bandage may be good options. These seem as safe as a cast in the short term. They may cost less. Kids and parents may find them more handy. For moved breaks, a cast that stops below the elbow may help with pain in the first week. It may also cost less. But we need better tests to be sure. For surgery with wires after the bone is set, we do not know if it helps more than a cast alone. It may reduce the need for therapy, but total cost may be the same.

Bottom line
We do not yet know the best care for each type of child wrist break. The proof so far is weak. Still, these results support a move away from hard casts for buckle breaks. More high‑quality studies are needed. These should track pain, arm use, time to get back to play, harms, and cost. This will help families and doctors choose the right care.","Interventions for treating wrist fractures (broken wrists) in children

We are uncertain about the finding that all children with above‐elbow casts needed another fracture reduction. There were no serious adverse events. Recovery time and minor complications were not reported. There may be little difference in needing physiotherapy for stiffness. Pain at one week may be less for below‐elbow casts (1 study). One study found lower healthcare costs for below‐elbow casts. 
Five studies compared percutaneous wiring and above‐elbow cast immobilisation versus above‐elbow cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures. Short‐term physical function was not reported. There may be no between‐group difference in function at six months (1 study). We are uncertain whether surgery reduces the risk of treatment failure, defined as early or difficult removal of wires, and remanipulation for loss in position. We are uncertain whether there are fewer serious adverse events with surgery. Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There may be less need for physiotherapy after surgery. One USA study found treatment costs were similar. 
Quality of the evidence 
All 30 studies had weaknesses that could affect the reliability of their results. We considered the evidence for all outcomes to be low or very low quality. 
Conclusion 
There is not enough evidence to determine the best ways of treating different types of wrist fractures in children. However, the review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for buckle fractures.

Hip fractures are a major healthcare problem, presenting a considerable challenge and burden to individuals and healthcare systems. The number of hip fractures globally is rising rapidly. The majority of intracapsular hip fractures are treated surgically. 
Objectives
To assess the relative effects (benefits and harms) of all surgical treatments used in the management of intracapsular hip fractures in older adults, using a network meta‐analysis of randomised trials, and to generate a hierarchy of interventions according to their outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and five other databases in July 2020. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, reference lists of retrieved articles and conducted backward‐citation searches. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing different treatments for fragility intracapsular hip fractures in older adults. We included total hip arthroplasties (THAs), hemiarthroplasties (HAs), internal fixation, and non‐operative treatments. We excluded studies of people with hip fracture with specific pathologies other than osteoporosis or resulting from high‐energy trauma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. One review author completed data extraction which was checked by a second review author. We collected data for three outcomes at different time points: mortality and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) ‐ both reported within 4 months, at 12 months, and after 24 months of surgery, and unplanned return to theatre (at end of study follow‐up). 
We performed a network meta‐analysis (NMA) with Stata software, using frequentist methods, and calculated the differences between treatments using risk ratios (RRs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also performed direct comparisons using the same codes. 
Main results
We included 119 studies (102 RCTS, 17 quasi‐RCTs) with 17,653 participants with 17,669 intracapsular fractures in the review; 83% of fractures were displaced. The mean participant age ranged from 60 to 87 years and 73% were women.  
After discussion with clinical experts, we selected 12 nodes that represented the best balance between clinical plausibility and efficiency of the networks: cemented modern unipolar HA, dynamic fixed angle plate, uncemented first‐generation bipolar HA, uncemented modern bipolar HA, cemented modern bipolar HA, uncemented first‐generation unipolar HA, uncemented modern unipolar HA, THA with single articulation, dual‐mobility THA, pins, screws, and non‐operative treatment. Seventy‐five studies (with 11,855 participants) with data for at least two of these treatments contributed to the NMA. 
We selected cemented modern unipolar HA as a reference treatment against which other treatments were compared. This was a common treatment in the networks, providing a clinically appropriate comparison. In order to provide a concise summary of the results, we report only network estimates when there was evidence of difference between treatments. 
We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for serious and very serious risks of bias and when estimates included possible transitivity, particularly for internal fixation which included more undisplaced fractures. We also downgraded for incoherence, or inconsistency in indirect estimates, although this affected few estimates. Most estimates included the possibility of benefits and harms, and we downgraded the evidence for these treatments for imprecision.  
We found that cemented modern unipolar HA, dynamic fixed angle plate and pins seemed to have the greatest likelihood of reducing mortality at 12 months. Overall, 23.5% of participants who received the reference treatment died within 12 months of surgery. Uncemented modern bipolar HA had higher mortality than the reference treatment (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.85; derived only from indirect evidence; low‐certainty evidence), and THA with single articulation also had higher mortality (network estimate RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.32; derived from direct evidence from 2 studies with 225 participants, and indirect evidence; very low‐certainty evidence). In the remaining treatments, the certainty of the evidence ranged from low to very low, and we noted no evidence of any differences in mortality at 12 months.  
We found that THA (single articulation), cemented modern bipolar HA and uncemented modern bipolar HA seemed to have the greatest likelihood of improving HRQoL at 12 months. This network was comparatively sparse compared to other outcomes and the certainty of the evidence of differences between treatments was very low. We noted no evidence of any differences in HRQoL at 12 months, although estimates were imprecise. 
We found that arthroplasty treatments seemed to have a greater likelihood of reducing unplanned return to theatre than internal fixation and non‐operative treatment. We estimated that 4.3% of participants who received the reference treatment returned to theatre during the study follow‐up. Compared to this treatment, we found low‐certainty evidence that more participants returned to theatre if they were treated with a dynamic fixed angle plate (network estimate RR 4.63, 95% CI 2.94 to 7.30; from direct evidence from 1 study with 190 participants, and indirect evidence). We found very low‐certainty evidence that more participants returned to theatre when treated with pins (RR 4.16, 95% CI 2.53 to 6.84; only from indirect evidence), screws (network estimate RR 5.04, 95% CI 3.25 to 7.82; from direct evidence from 2 studies with 278 participants, and indirect evidence), and non‐operative treatment (RR 5.41, 95% CI 1.80 to 16.26; only from indirect evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence of a tendency for an increased risk of unplanned return to theatre for all of the arthroplasty treatments, and in particular for THA, compared with cemented modern unipolar HA, with little evidence to suggest the size of this difference varied strongly between the arthroplasty treatments. 
Authors' conclusions
There was considerable variability in the ranking of each treatment such that there was no one outstanding, or subset of outstanding, superior treatments. However, cemented modern arthroplasties tended to more often yield better outcomes than alternative treatments and may be a more successful approach than internal fixation. There is no evidence of a difference between THA (single articulation) and cemented modern unipolar HA in the outcomes measured in this review. THA may be an appropriate treatment for a subset of people with intracapsular fracture but we have not explored this further.

Which hip surgery works best for a break inside the hip joint in older adults?

Rationale
A hip break is common in older adults. Many breaks happen from a minor fall. This can cause pain, loss of movement, and loss of independence. It can also raise the risk of early death.

A break inside the hip joint is called an intracapsular fracture. This is a break at the top of the thigh bone, near the hip joint. Doctors can treat it with a hip replace or with repair using metal parts. Choices include a half hip replace, a full hip replace, or repair with screws, pins, or plates.

Doctors want to know which surgery helps most and harms least. This study looked at many past trials at once. It set out to compare all the main surgery types. The goal was to see which options help people live, feel well, and avoid more surgery.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team pulled together 119 studies of older adults with this type of hip break. Of these, 102 were randomised trials. Seventeen used a near‑random method.

In total, 17,653 people took part across all trials. Most were women. Ages ran from about 60 to 87 years. Most had a break where the bone ends had moved out of place.

The study compared these choices:
- Half hip replace (hemiarthroplasty). This swaps the ball of the hip. It may use bone cement to hold it, or not. The ball may be one piece (unipolar) or two piece (bipolar).
- Full hip replace (total hip arthroplasty). This swaps both the ball and the socket. It may use a single joint or a dual‑mobility joint.
- Fix the break with metal parts. These include screws, pins, or a plate.
- No surgery.

The team looked at three key results. These were death, quality of life, and unplanned extra surgery. They looked at results within 4 months, at 12 months, and after 24 months. Many trials followed people for at least one year.

Results
No single surgery was best for all people and all goals. Results varied by outcome. Many findings had limits. In many cases, the data were weak or not exact. So, we should be careful when we judge size of effect.

Death at one year:
- In the “reference” group, about 1 in 4 people died by one year.
- Some options seemed to do as well or maybe better than this. These were a cemented modern half hip replace, a fixed angle plate, and pins. But we are not very sure about this.
- Some options seemed to do worse than the reference group. A modern uncemented two‑piece half hip replace had more deaths. A full hip replace with a single joint also had more deaths. We have low to very low confidence in these two results.

Quality of life at one year:
- A full hip replace with a single joint, and modern half hip replaces, seemed most likely to help quality of life. This means how well people can move and do daily tasks.
- But the data for this were sparse. We are not very sure. The true effects may be small or none.

Need for unplanned extra surgery:
- Half or full hip replace, as a group, seemed to lead to fewer extra surgeries than repair with screws, pins, or plates, or no surgery.
- In the reference group, about 1 in 25 people needed extra surgery.
- Compared with this, people with a fixed angle plate were about five times more likely to need more surgery. With pins, it was about four times more likely. With screws, it was about five times more likely. With no surgery, it was about five times more likely. We are more sure about the plate and screws results than the others.
- Within the hip replace group, a cemented modern half hip replace tended to do well. Some full hip replaces may have had a higher chance of extra surgery than this, but we are not very sure.

What this means for patients:
- There was no clear “best” surgery for all. Choices have trade‑offs.
- Modern hip replace with bone cement often did well across outcomes. It may be more reliable than repair with screws, pins, or plates.
- A full hip replace did not show clear gains over a cemented modern half hip replace in this review. It might be right for some people, but this review did not study who those people are.
- Many results had low or very low certainty. This means the true effect may be different.

How to use these results:
- Your age, bone health, and how far the bone moved can guide the choice.
- Your goals matter. Is the top goal to avoid extra surgery? To walk well? To lower risk of death?
- Talk with your surgeon about these trade‑offs. Ask about a cemented modern half hip replace as a common option. Ask how a full hip replace may help or harm in your case. Ask about the chance you would need more surgery with screws, pins, or plates.

In sum, this review suggests that a modern cemented half hip replace is a steady choice for many older adults with this kind of hip break. Repair with screws, pins, or plates may lead to more extra surgeries. A full hip replace is not clearly better for most people in these trials. More and better studies could help tailor the choice to each person.","Which are the best treatments for hip fractures in older adults?
Why is this question important? 
A hip fracture is a break at the top of the leg bone. We included people with a break just below the ball and socket joint. These types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. They often happen after a fall from a standing or sitting position. The broken hip can be treated in different ways, and we don't know whether some treatments are better than others. 
What are the treatments? 
‐ Replacing the broken hip with an artificial one. This can be done using a hemiarthroplasty (HA), which replaces only the ball part of the joint, and can be unipolar (a single artificial joint) or bipolar which has an additional joint within the HA. A total hip arthroplasty (THA) replaces all of the hip joint, including the socket, and usually has just one artifical joint between the ball and the socket (single articulation) or sometimes two (dual‐mobility). All types of artificial joints can be fixed in place with or without bone cement. 
‐ Using metal implants to fix the broken parts of the bones. Pins or screws may be inserted through the two parts of broken bone, or the surgeon may use a 'fixed angle plate' which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone and is attached to the bone with screws or pins.  
‐ Treatment without an operation, usually requiring a period of rest in bed whilst the leg is held in position using traction with weights. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared one or more of these treatments. We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of these different treatments. We combined the findings from studies, and created a 'network' (which is used when researchers perform a 'network meta‐analysis' on the results from studies) to see if we could find out if some treatments were better than others. 
What did we find? 
We found 119 studies, involving 17,653 participants with 17,669 fractures. The average age of study participants ranged from 60 to 87 years; 73% were women, which is usual for people who have this type of hip fracture. We included 75 of these studies in our 'network'. 
We found that a modern design of unipolar HA fixed with bone cement, or some of the metal implants (fixed angle plates and pins), seem to have the greatest chance of reducing the number of deaths within 12 months of injury. Compared to people having these treatments, more people who were treated with an uncemented modern bipolar design of HA or with a THA (single articulation) died.  
We didn't find as many studies to include in our 'network' for health‐related quality of life, and none of the treatments made a meaningful improvement to people's quality of life.  
We also found that people treated with any of the hip replacements were less likely to need additional surgery on their broken hip than people treated with metal implants or treated without an operation. Amongst all the designs of hip replacements, fewer people needed additional surgery after treatment with a cemented modern unipolar design of HA ‐ but there was not a big difference in the findings for these hip replacement treatments. 
So, overall, cemented modern hip replacements tended to produce better outcomes and may be a more successful approach than attempting to fix the broken bone. THA (single articulation) may have increased the risk of death compared with cemented HA, without leading to an important difference in quality of life ‐ but we are not sure about this finding. This type of THA may be an appropriate treatment for some people with these fractures, but we have not studied this in this review. 
Are we confident in what we found? 
The true effects of these treatments might be very different to what we have found in this review. Many of the studies in this review were published before general reporting standards for research were improved, and so we could not be certain whether or not these studies were well‐conducted. Sometimes, the types of fractures were different (particularly between participants treated with metal implants and those treated with hip replacements), and this might have affected the results in the 'network'. We also found that the results included risks of potential benefits and harms, and this is often because there are not enough study participants to find a precise result.

The detection and diagnosis of caries at the earliest opportunity is fundamental to the preservation of tooth tissue and maintenance of oral health. Radiographs have traditionally been used to supplement the conventional visual‐tactile clinical examination. Accurate, timely detection and diagnosis of early signs of disease could afford patients the opportunity of less invasive treatment with less destruction of tooth tissue, reduce the need for treatment with aerosol‐generating procedures, and potentially result in a reduced cost of care to the patient and to healthcare services. 
Objectives
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of different dental imaging methods to inform the detection and diagnosis of non‐cavitated enamel only coronal dental caries. 
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist undertook a search of the following databases: MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 31 December 2018); Embase Ovid (1980 to 31 December 2018); US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov, to 31 December 2018); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 31 December 2018). We studied reference lists as well as published systematic review articles. 
Selection criteria
We included diagnostic accuracy study designs that compared a dental imaging method with a reference standard (histology, excavation, enhanced visual examination), studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of single index tests, and studies that directly compared two or more index tests. Studies reporting at both the patient or tooth surface level were included. In vitro and in vivo studies were eligible for inclusion. Studies that explicitly recruited participants with more advanced lesions that were obviously into dentine or frankly cavitated were excluded. We also excluded studies that artificially created carious lesions and those that used an index test during the excavation of dental caries to ascertain the optimum depth of excavation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data independently and in duplicate using a standardised data extraction form and quality assessment based on QUADAS‐2 specific to the clinical context. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy were determined using the bivariate hierarchical method to produce summary points of sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence regions. Comparative accuracy of different radiograph methods was conducted based on indirect and direct comparisons between methods. Potential sources of heterogeneity were pre‐specified and explored visually and more formally through meta‐regression. 
Main results
We included 104 datasets from 77 studies reporting a total of 15,518 tooth sites or surfaces. The most frequently reported imaging methods were analogue radiographs (55 datasets from 51 studies) and digital radiographs (42 datasets from 40 studies) followed by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) (7 datasets from 7 studies). Only 17 studies were of an in vivo study design, carried out in a clinical setting. No studies were considered to be at low risk of bias across all four domains but 16 studies were judged to have low concern for applicability across all domains. The patient selection domain had the largest number of studies judged to be at high risk of bias (43 studies); the index test, reference standard, and flow and timing domains were judged to be at high risk of bias in 30, 12, and 7 studies respectively. 
Studies were synthesised using a hierarchical bivariate method for meta‐analysis. There was substantial variability in the results of the individual studies, with sensitivities that ranged from 0 to 0.96 and specificities from 0 to 1.00. For all imaging methods the estimated summary sensitivity and specificity point was 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.53) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.92), respectively. In a cohort of 1000 tooth surfaces with a prevalence of enamel caries of 63%, this would result in 337 tooth surfaces being classified as disease free when enamel caries was truly present (false negatives), and 43 tooth surfaces being classified as diseased in the absence of enamel caries (false positives). Meta‐regression indicated that measures of accuracy differed according to the imaging method (Chi2(4) = 32.44, P < 0.001), with the highest sensitivity observed for CBCT, and the highest specificity observed for analogue radiographs. None of the specified potential sources of heterogeneity were able to explain the variability in results. No studies included restored teeth in their sample or reported the inclusion of sealants. 
We rated the certainty of the evidence as low for sensitivity and specificity and downgraded two levels in total for risk of bias due to limitations in the design and conduct of the included studies, indirectness arising from the in vitro studies, and the observed inconsistency of the results. 
Authors' conclusions
The design and conduct of studies to determine the diagnostic accuracy of methods to detect and diagnose caries in situ are particularly challenging. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that imaging for the detection or diagnosis of early caries may have poor sensitivity but acceptable specificity, resulting in a relatively high number of false‐negative results with the potential for early disease to progress. If left untreated, the opportunity to provide professional or self‐care practices to arrest or reverse early caries lesions will be missed. The specificity of lesion detection is however relatively high, and one could argue that initiation of non‐invasive management (such as the use of topical fluoride), is probably of low risk. 
CBCT showed superior sensitivity to analogue or digital radiographs but has very limited applicability to the general dental practitioner. However, given the high‐radiation dose, and potential for caries‐like artefacts from existing restorations, its use cannot be justified in routine caries detection. Nonetheless, if early incidental carious lesions are detected in CBCT scans taken for other purposes, these should be reported. CBCT has the potential to be used as a reference standard in diagnostic studies of this type. 
Despite the robust methodology applied in this comprehensive review, the results should be interpreted with some caution due to shortcomings in the design and execution of many of the included studies. Future research should evaluate the comparative accuracy of different methods, be undertaken in a clinical setting, and focus on minimising bias arising from the use of imperfect reference standards in clinical studies.

How well dental X-rays find early tooth decay

Rationale
Tooth decay is common. It can cause pain, infection, and tooth loss. Early decay starts in the hard outer layer of the tooth, called enamel. It often hides between teeth and is hard to see.

Dentists look and feel the teeth. They also use pictures of teeth, called X-rays. There are film X-rays, digital X-rays, and 3D scans. A 3D scan is called CBCT. It uses a higher dose of radiation.

Finding decay early can help stop or slow it. This can avoid drilling and shots. Care may be simple, like a fluoride varnish. The team wanted to learn how well these pictures find early decay. They also wanted to see which picture type works best. This helps dentists and patients choose wise care.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team searched for studies through the end of 2018. They used big medical libraries and trial lists. They set clear rules on which studies to include. They checked each study for quality.

The review looked at studies that tested an image against a “true check.” A true check means a strong way to tell if decay is there. Examples are a lab exam of the tooth, a careful exam by the dentist, or removal of soft tooth tissue to confirm. The studies had to focus on early decay in enamel only. Studies with deep holes were not in this review.

The studies looked at tooth sites, not whole mouths. Many studies used teeth in a lab. Some took place in dental clinics with people. Ages and sex were not clear. Teeth with fillings or sealants were not in the sample.

The review used 77 studies. It had 104 data sets. In total, it included over 15,000 tooth sites. No new people joined this review. So there was no study visit time for patients.

Results
The main question was simple. How well do dental pictures find early decay? The studies did not all agree. Some found many spots. Some found few. When the team put the data together, one clear point stood out.

On average, the tests found about 5 out of 10 early spots. They also said “no decay” correctly in about 9 out of 10 tooth sites that were healthy. Here is one way to see this. Picture 1,000 tooth sides. About 630 of them have early decay. The tests would miss about 337 of those 630 that truly have decay. The tests would also say “decay” in about 43 that do not have decay.

What does this mean for you? A “yes, decay” result is often right. But a “no decay” result can be wrong quite often when decay is small and early. If a small spot is missed, it can grow. Later, you may need a drill and a filling. Early care may have stopped it.

The review also looked at types of images. The 3D scan (CBCT) found more early spots than film or digital X-rays. But CBCT has a higher radiation dose. It can also show fake “decay-like” shadows near fillings. Because of this, the review does not support CBCT for routine decay checks. If you had a CBCT for other reasons, and it shows a small spot, your dentist should tell you.

Film X-rays and digital X-rays did better at saying “no decay” when none was there. They were not as good at finding all early spots. This supports what many dentists do now. They use both an exam and X-rays. They also look at risk factors, like sugar in the diet and dry mouth.

How sure are these results? The team had some concerns. Many studies took place in a lab, not a clinic. Many had limits in how they chose teeth and checked results. Because of this, we have low confidence in the exact numbers. The true results may be a bit better or worse. More good clinic studies are needed.

What can patients take from this? First, early decay can be hard to spot on pictures. A clean bill on an X-ray does not always mean “no decay.” Second, a positive X-ray is often right. In many cases, it is safe to start simple care. This can be fluoride varnish, paste, or mouth rinse. It can also be diet change and better home care. These steps have low risk and can help stop early spots.

This review helps the field. It shows the limits of current picture tests for early decay. It warns against the routine use of CBCT for this task. It also points to the need for better clinic studies. These should test the tools head to head in real care.

In short, dental pictures can help. But they may miss many early spots. A mix of tools, plus your risk level, guides the best care. Talk with your dentist about what the results mean for you. If you are at high risk, you may need close watch and simple, non-invasive care.","Dental imaging methods for the detection of early tooth decay
Why is it important to improve the detection of dental caries (tooth decay)? Dentists often aim to identify tooth decay that has already advanced to a level which needs a filling. If dentists were able to find tooth decay when it has only affected the outer layer of the tooth (enamel) then it is possible to stop the decay from spreading any further and prevent the need for fillings. It is also important to avoid a false‐positive result, when treatment may be given when caries is absent. 
What is the aim of this review?This Cochrane Review aimed to find out how accurate X‐ray images and other types of dental imaging are for detecting early tooth decay as part of the dental 'check‐up' for children and adults who visit their general dentist. Researchers in Cochrane included 77 studies published between 1986 and 2018 to answer this question. 
What was studied in the review?Three main types of dental imaging were studied in this review: analogue or digital radiographs (X‐rays) and three‐dimensional (3D) imaging (cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)). We studied decay on the occlusal surfaces (biting surfaces of the back teeth), the proximal surfaces (tooth surfaces that are next to each other), and smooth surfaces. 
What are the main results of the review?Researchers in Cochrane included 77 studies with a total of 15,518 tooth sites or surfaces, where typically 63% of tooth sites or surfaces had enamel caries. Some of these studies reported on more than one type of imaging, on both the permanent and primary ('milk') teeth or different tooth surfaces, and this gave us 104 sets of data to use. If these methods were to be used by a dentist for a routine dental examination, out of 1000 tooth sites or surfaces seen:• the use of these methods will indicate that 336 tooth sites or surfaces will have early tooth decay, and of these, 43 (13%) will have no disease (incorrect diagnosis ‐ false positive);• of the 664 tooth sites with a result indicating that early tooth decay is absent, 337 (51%) will have early tooth decay (incorrect diagnosis ‐ false negative).This high proportion of false‐negative results means that early signs of decay will be missed. We found evidence that 3D imaging methods were better than analogue or digital radiographs at identifying early disease but that analogue radiographs were better at identifying disease‐free tooth surfaces. 
Please see oralhealth.cochrane.org/imaging-modalities-inform-detection-and-diagnosis-early-caries. 
How reliable are the results of the studies in this review?We only included studies that assessed healthy teeth or those that were thought to have early tooth decay. This is because teeth with deep tooth decay would be easier to identify. However, there were some problems with how the studies were conducted. This may result in these methods appearing more accurate than they are, increasing the number of correct results. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low due to how the studies selected their participants and the large number of studies that were carried out in a laboratory setting on extracted teeth, and the variation in the results. 
Who do the results of this review apply to?Studies included in the review were carried out in South America, Europe, Asia, and the US. A large number of studies examined extracted teeth, while clinical studies were completed in dental hospitals or general dental practices. 
What are the implications of this review?Low‐certainty evidence suggests that imaging for the detection or diagnosis of early tooth decay may result in a relatively high proportion of false‐negative results, with the potential for early disease to become more advanced. If left untreated, the opportunity to provide professional or self‐care practices to arrest or reverse early tooth decay will be missed. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?The electronic searches retrieved used studies published up to 31 December 2018.

Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is characterized by tachypnea and signs of respiratory distress. Transient tachypnea typically appears within the first two hours of life in term and late preterm newborns. Supportive management might be sufficient. Non‐invasive (i.e. without endotracheal intubation) respiratory support may, however, be administered to reduce respiratory distress during TTN. In addition, non‐invasive respiratory support might improve clearance of lung liquid thus reducing the effort required to breathe, improving respiratory distress and potentially reducing the duration of tachypnea. 
Objectives
To assess benefits and harms of non‐invasive respiratory support for the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1996 to 19 February 2019), Embase (1980 to 19 February 2019) and CINAHL (1982 to 19 February 2019). We applied no language restrictions. We searched clinical trial registries for ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials, quasi‐randomized controlled trials and cluster trials on non‐invasive respiratory support provided to infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age or more and less than three days of age with transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Data collection and analysis
For each of the included trials, two review authors independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, duration of oxygen therapy, need for continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] and need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, etc.) and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomization, blinding, completeness of follow‐up). The primary outcomes considered in this review were need for mechanical ventilation and pneumothorax. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included three trials (150 infants) comparing either CPAP to free‐flow oxygen, nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation to nasal CPAP, or nasal high‐frequency percussive ventilation versus nasal CPAP. Due to these different comparisons and to high clinical heterogeneity in the baseline clinical characteristics, we did not pool the three studies. The use of CPAP versus free oxygen did not improve the primary outcomes of this review: need for mechanical ventilation (risk ratio [RR] 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01 to 6.99; 1 study, 64 participants); and pneumothorax (not estimable, no cases occurred). Among secondary outcomes, CPAP reduced the duration of tachypnea as compared to free oxygen (mean difference [MD] −21.10 hours, 95% CI −22.92 to −19.28; 1 study, 64 participants). Nasal intermittent ventilation did not reduce the need for mechanical ventilation as compared with CPAP (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 32.72; 1 study, 40 participants) or the incidence of pneumothorax (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.90; 1 study, 40 participants); duration of tachypnea did not differ (MD 4.30, 95% CI −19.14 to 27.74; 1 study, 40 participants). In the study comparing nasal high‐frequency ventilation to CPAP, no cases of mechanical ventilation of pneumothorax occurred (not estimable; 1 study, 46 participants); duration of tachypnea was reduced in the nasal high‐frequency ventilation group (MD −4.53, 95% CI −5.64 to −3.42; 1 study, 46 participants). The quality of the evidence was very low due to the imprecision of the estimates and unclear risk of bias for detection bias and high risk of bias for reporting bias. Tests for heterogeneity were not applicable for any of the analyses as no studies were pooled. Two trials are ongoing. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to establish the benefit and harms of non‐invasive respiratory support in the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. Though two of the included trials showed a shorter duration of tachypnea, clinically relevant outcomes did not differ amongst the groups. Given the limited and low quality of the evidence available, it was impossible to determine whether non‐invasive respiratory support was safe or effective for the treatment of transient tachypnea of the newborn.

Gentle breathing help for newborns with fast breathing

Rationale
Some newborns breathe too fast soon after birth. Doctors call this transient tachypnea of the newborn, or TTN. TTN means the baby has fast breaths and signs of work to breathe. It starts in the first hours of life.

TTN can worry parents. It can make feeding hard. It can mean time in the nursery or NICU. Most babies need only close care and time. Some babies may need extra help to breathe.

Doctors can give gentle breathing help without a tube in the windpipe. This is called non‑invasive support. It may use soft prongs or a mask on the nose. It may help clear extra fluid in the lungs. It may lower the work to breathe. The hope is that it can ease distress and shorten fast breathing.

The goal of this study was to test that hope. The team asked: does gentle breathing help do more good than harm in TTN?

Trial Design
This was a review of clinical trials. The team looked for the best kind of trials. These trials assign babies to a group at random. That helps make the groups fair and alike.

They searched many large medical libraries. They looked at CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. They looked for trials up to February 19, 2019. They did not limit by language. They also checked trial registries for studies still in progress.

The trials had newborns with TTN. The babies were born at 34 weeks of pregnancy or later. The babies were less than three days old when they took part. The trials did not report gender details.

The review found three trials with 150 babies. Each trial tested a different type of gentle help. One trial tested CPAP versus oxygen by face mask. CPAP is steady, gentle air pressure given through the nose. One trial tested nasal intermittent ventilation versus CPAP. This gives small extra breaths at set times through the nose. One trial tested nasal high‑frequency percussive ventilation versus CPAP. This gives many tiny puffs of air through the nose.

The teams watched the babies during the first days after birth. They checked if a baby then needed a breathing tube and a machine to breathe. That is called mechanical ventilation. They also checked for a lung air leak, called a pneumothorax. They tracked how long the fast breathing lasted.

Results
Across the three trials, the key results were mixed. The trials were small. Each trial tested a different device. So the review did not combine the data into one number.

CPAP versus oxygen by mask: This trial had 64 babies. CPAP did not change the chance that a baby later needed a breathing tube. There were no lung air leaks in either group. CPAP did shorten fast breathing. On average, fast breathing was about 21 hours shorter with CPAP.

Nasal intermittent ventilation versus CPAP: This trial had 40 babies. There was no clear difference in the need for a breathing tube. There was no clear difference in lung air leaks. The length of fast breathing was about the same in both groups.

Nasal high‑frequency ventilation versus CPAP: This trial had 46 babies. No babies in either group needed a breathing tube. No babies in either group had a lung air leak. Fast breathing was shorter with the high‑frequency device. On average, it was about four and a half hours shorter.

What do these results mean for care? A few devices seemed to shorten fast breathing. But the trials did not show clear gains in the major outcomes. Those major outcomes were the need for a breathing tube or a lung air leak. The review could not show that any device kept babies safer in those ways.

How sure are we about the results? Not very sure. The review rated the proof as very low. The trials were small. The estimates were not precise. Some trial reports left out details. Because of this, the review team could not be confident in the results.

What is the bottom line? We do not have enough good proof to say that non‑invasive help is safe or that it works for TTN. Two more trials are still in progress. Better and larger trials are needed. These future trials should test what matters most to families. That includes the need for a breathing tube, air leaks, and time to get well.

For now, gentle breathing help may ease fast breathing for some babies. It may shorten the time of fast breaths. But we do not know if it changes serious outcomes. Doctors will weigh the risks and possible gains for each baby. This review helps show where we need more answers.","The use of respiratory support without endotracheal tube (i.e. non‐invasive) in babies to manage rapid breathing (transient tachypnea of the newborn) 
Review question 
Does the use of respiratory support without endotracheal tube (i.e. non‐invasive) in babies with rapid breathing (transient tachypnea of the newborn) improve lung function and reduce the need for invasive respiratory support with an endotracheal tube? 
Background 
Transient tachypnea (abnormally rapid breathing) of the newborn is characterized by high respiratory rate (more than 60 breaths per minute) and signs of respiratory distress (difficulty in breathing). It typically appears within the first two hours of life in infants born at or after 34 weeks' gestational age. Although transient tachypnea of the newborn usually improves without treatment, it might be associated with wheezing in late childhood. The idea behind using non‐invasive respiratory support for transient tachypnea of the newborn consists of reducing fluid from small cavities within the lungs called the alveoli and providing support to the baby with breathing difficulties. This review reports and critically analyzes the available evidence on the benefit and harms of non‐invasive respiratory support in the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
Study characteristics 
We identified and included three studies (150 newborns in total) comparing the use of non‐invasive respiratory support with oxygen (one study), or different types of non‐invasive respiratory support (two studies). We found two ongoing studies. Evidence is up to date as of February 2019. 
Results 
The very limited available evidence cannot answer our review question. Non‐invasive respiratory support did not improve lung function or reduce the need for respiratory support.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication amongst people who are critically ill, and it is associated with an increased risk of death. For people with severe AKI, continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT), which is delivered over 24 hours, is needed when they become haemodynamically unstable. When CKRT is interrupted due to clotting of the extracorporeal circuit, the delivered dose is decreased and thus leading to undertreatment. 
Objectives
This review assessed the efficacy of non‐pharmacological measures to maintain circuit patency in CKRT. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 January 2021 which includes records identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (parallel‐group and cross‐over studies), cluster RCTs and quasi‐RCTs that examined non‐pharmacological interventions to prevent clotting of extracorporeal circuits during CKRT.  
Data collection and analysis
Three pairs of review authors independently extracted information including participants, interventions/comparators, outcomes, study methods, and risk of bias. The primary outcomes were circuit lifespan and death due to any cause at day 28. We used a random‐effects model to perform quantitative synthesis (meta‐analysis). We assessed the risk of bias in included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing the risk of bias. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
Main results
A total of 20 studies involving 1143 randomised participants were included in the review. The methodological quality of the included studies was low, mainly due to the unclear randomisation process and blinding of the intervention. We found evidence on the following 11 comparisons: (i) continuous venovenous haemodialysis (CVVHD) versus continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) or continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF); (ii) CVVHDF versus CVVH; (iii) higher blood flow (≥ 250 mL/minute) versus standard blood flow (< 250 mL/minute); (iv) AN69 membrane (AN69ST) versus other membranes; (v) pre‐dilution versus post‐dilution; (vi) a longer catheter (> 20 cm) placing the tip targeting the right atrium versus a shorter catheter (≤ 20 cm) placing the tip in the superior vena cava; (vii) surface‐modified double‐lumen catheter versus standard double‐lumen catheter with identical geometry and flow design; (viii) single‐site infusion anticoagulation versus double‐site infusion anticoagulation; (ix) flat plate filter versus hollow fibre filter of the same membrane type; (x) a filter with a larger membrane surface area versus a smaller one; and (xi) a filter with more and shorter hollow fibre versus a standard filter of the same membrane type. 
Circuit lifespan was reported in 9 comparisons. Low certainty evidence indicated that CVVHDF (versus CVVH: MD 10.15 hours, 95% CI 5.15 to 15.15; 1 study, 62 circuits), pre‐dilution haemofiltration (versus post‐dilution haemofiltration: MD 9.34 hours, 95% CI ‐2.60 to 21.29; 2 studies, 47 circuits; I² = 13%), placing the tip of a longer catheter targeting the right atrium (versus placing a shorter catheter targeting the tip in the superior vena cava: MD 6.50 hours, 95% CI 1.48 to 11.52; 1 study, 420 circuits), and surface‐modified double‐lumen catheter (versus standard double‐lumen catheter: MD 16.00 hours, 95% CI 13.49 to 18.51; 1 study, 262 circuits) may prolong circuit lifespan. However, higher blood flow may not increase circuit lifespan (versus standard blood flow: MD 0.64, 95% CI ‐3.37 to 4.64; 2 studies, 499 circuits; I² = 70%). More and shorter hollow fibre filters (versus standard filters: MD ‐5.87 hours, 95% CI ‐10.18 to ‐1.56; 1 study, 6 circuits) may reduce circuit lifespan. 
Death from any cause was reported in four comparisons We are uncertain whether CVVHDF versus CVVH, CVVHD versus CVVH or CVVHDF, longer versus a shorter catheter, or surface‐modified double‐lumen catheters versus standard double‐lumen catheters reduced death due to any cause, in very low certainty evidence. 
Recovery of kidney function was reported in three comparisons. We are uncertain whether CVVHD versus CVVH or CVVHDF, CVVHDF versus CVVH, or surface‐modified double‐lumen catheters versus standard double‐lumen catheters increased recovery of kidney function. 
Vascular access complications were reported in two comparisons. Low certainty evidence indicated using a longer catheter (versus a shorter catheter: RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.74) may reduce vascular access complications, however, the use of surface‐modified double lumen catheters versus standard double‐lumen catheters may make little or no difference to vascular access complications. 
Authors' conclusions
The use of CVVHDF as compared with CVVH, pre‐dilution haemofiltration, a longer catheter, and surface‐modified double‐lumen catheter may prolong the circuit lifespan, while higher blood flow and more and shorter hollow fibre filter may reduce circuit life. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed to be low to very low due to the small sample size of the included studies. 
Data from future rigorous and transparent research are much needed in order to fully understand the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions in preventing circuit coagulation amongst people with AKI receiving CKRT.

Keeping kidney machines running for very sick people: what helps and what does not

Rationale
A sudden drop in kidney work is called acute kidney injury. It can happen when people are very ill. It can lead to fluid build up and waste in the blood. It can raise the risk of death.

Some people with this problem need help from a kidney machine. One type runs all day and night. Doctors call it continuous kidney replacement therapy, or CKRT. It moves blood through a tube and a filter, then back to the body.

Blood can clot in the tube or filter. When that happens, the machine must stop. Care teams then need to set up a new tube and filter. This takes time. It gives less of the planned treatment.

There are drug steps to lower clot risk. There are also non‑drug steps. This study looked at the non‑drug steps. The goal was to learn which steps help keep the circuit open. The hope is to give steady care and avoid delays.

Trial Design
This work was a review of past trials. The team looked for trials up to late January 2021. They used large medical databases and trial lists.

They found 20 trials with 1143 people. All people were very ill and had acute kidney injury. All needed CKRT. The abstract did not give age or sex details.

In most trials, people went into groups by chance. This is called random. The teams then used one non‑drug step or another. They checked how long the tube and filter stayed open. Many trials also tracked who died by day 28. Some looked at kidney recovery. Each trial had its own time frame. The review pooled the results.

The review team also rated how sure the proof is. When they say low or very low, it means we are not very sure. New trials may change what we think.

Results
What steps seemed to help the machine run longer?
- One setting did better than another. A mix of clean fluid and filter work kept the circuit open longer. It added about 10 hours of run time, in one small trial.
- Adding clean fluid before the filter may help a bit more than after. The gain was about 9 hours. But this was not clear across trials.
- A longer soft tube in a large vein, with the tip near the heart, helped. It added about 6 hours of run time, in one trial. It also led to fewer line problems.
- A soft tube with a special smooth coat helped. It added about 16 hours of run time, in one trial. It did not change line problems.

What steps did not help or may hurt?
- Pushing blood through the circuit faster did not help. It did not add run time.
- A filter packed with more short fibers did worse. It cut run time by about 6 hours, in one small trial.

Did these steps help people live longer?
We do not know. The trials that looked at death by day 28 were small. The review found no clear link between any step and fewer deaths. We need more and larger trials.

Did these steps help kidneys heal?
We do not know. A few trials looked at kidney recovery. None showed a clear gain. The proof here is very weak.

How sure are we about these results?
Not very sure. Many trials were small. Some did not hide group choice well. Some did not blind the staff. This can bias results. So the proof is low to very low. New, good trials may show a different story.

What do these results mean for patients and care teams?
When drug steps to thin blood are not a good fit, some non‑drug steps may help. A longer tube in the right spot may help the machine run longer. A tube with a smooth coat may help, too. A filter choice and machine setting may also help. On the other hand, more blood flow did not help. A filter with a lot of short fibers may hurt.

Longer run time can mean fewer stops. It can mean fewer tube swaps. It may help give the planned dose. But we do not know if it helps people live or heal. The proof is not strong.

Conclusions from the investigators
Some non‑drug steps may keep the circuit open longer. These include a longer vein tube, a smooth‑coat tube, and some machine settings. Some steps do not help. Some may hurt.

We do not know if any step helps people live longer or get kidney work back. Better trials are needed. They should be large and clear. They should report how long the circuit runs and how people do. Until then, care teams can weigh these steps case by case. They can match the step to the person and the care plan.","Non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing clotting of extracorporeal circuits during continuous kidney replacement therapy 
What is the issue? 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major problem in people with severe illness. In cases of severe AKI, kidney replacement therapy/dialysis (KRT) using circuits is necessary. Continuous kidney replacement therapy is performed continuously over 24 hours. Clotting of the CKRT circuit can interfere with this treatment. To prevent this, a variety of non‐pharmacological (not using medication) interventions have been studied. We aimed to summarise current evidence regarding the efficacy of non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing clotting of extracorporeal circuits during CKRT. 
What did we do? 
We searched for available evidence from the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 25 January 2021. Our review summarised the results of 20 randomised studies involving a total of 1143 people. 
What did we find? 
We found that the quality of the 20 included studies was low, and the number randomised was small. The majority of the included studies did not report death as an outcome. We found that continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), as compared with continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH), may prolong circuit lifespan. In addition, pre‐dilution haemofiltration, as compared with post‐dilution haemofiltration, a longer catheter placing the tip at the right atrium, as compared with a shorter catheter placing the tip in the superior vena cava, and surface‐modified double lumen catheter, as compared with standard double lumen catheter, may extend the circuit lifespan. However, higher blood flow compared to standard blood flow rate might not affect circuit lifespan. Overall, the data was limited and of very low certainty. 
Conclusions 
We found that the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions in people with AKI receiving CKRT remain unclear. There is a need for studies assessing CKRT circuit lifespan as well as other clinically important outcomes.

Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is the third leading cause of neonatal mortality globally constituting 13% of overall neonatal mortality. Despite the high burden of neonatal sepsis, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. Due to the diagnostic challenges of sepsis and the relative immunosuppression of the newborn, many neonates receive antibiotics for suspected sepsis. Antibiotics have become the most used therapeutics in neonatal intensive care units, and observational studies in high‐income countries suggest that 83% to 94% of newborns treated with antibiotics for suspected sepsis have negative blood cultures. The last Cochrane Review was updated in 2005. There is a need for an updated systematic review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Objectives
To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL (2021, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase Ovid; CINAHL; LILACS; Science Citation Index EXPANDED and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science on 12 March 2021. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. We included participants older than 72 hours of life at randomisation, suspected or diagnosed with neonatal sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, or necrotising enterocolitis. We excluded trials that assessed treatment of fungal infections. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcome was all‐cause mortality, and our secondary outcomes were: serious adverse events, respiratory support, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, necrotising enterocolitis, and ototoxicity. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow‐up. 
Main results
We included five RCTs (580 participants). All trials were at high risk of bias, and had very low‐certainty evidence. 
The five included trials assessed five different comparisons of antibiotics.
We did not conduct a meta‐analysis due to lack of relevant data.
Of the five included trials one trial compared cefazolin plus amikacin with vancomycin plus amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with flucloxacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared cloxacillin plus amikacin with cefotaxime plus gentamicin; one trial compared meropenem with standard care (ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime plus gentamicin); and one trial compared vancomycin plus gentamicin with vancomycin plus aztreonam. 
None of the five comparisons found any evidence of a difference when assessing all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, or necrotising enterocolitis; however, none of the trials were near an information size that could contribute significantly to the evidence of the comparative benefits and risks of any particular antibiotic regimen. 
None of the trials assessed respiratory support or ototoxicity.
The benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the lack of well‐powered trials and the high risk of systematic errors. 
Authors' conclusions
Current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. RCTs assessing different antibiotic regimens in late‐onset neonatal sepsis with low risks of bias are warranted. 
","1. Plain Title
Which antibiotic plans work best for blood infection in newborns after day three?

2. Rationale
Sepsis is a severe blood infection. It can lead to death in newborns. It is a top three cause of newborn death worldwide. It is a big health burden for families.

Sepsis is hard to spot in newborns. Their defense system is not fully ready. So, many newborns get antibiotics when doctors fear sepsis. Often, blood tests do not find any germs.

Doctors use many different antibiotic plans. We still do not know which plan works best. An older review could not answer this. This study aimed to give an update.

The main question was clear. Do some antibiotic plans help more than others? Do they cause more harm? The goal was to look at both benefits and harms.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of prior trials. The team looked for trials in many data sources. They searched up to March 12, 2021. They also checked trial lists and paper lists for more studies.

The team only used trials that gave drug plans by chance. These are called randomized trials. This design helps make fair tests. It lowers the chance that one group is sicker at the start.

The babies were more than three days old. Doctors thought they had sepsis, or had it for sure. Some had other bad infections. These were infections of the brain lining, bone, heart, or gut.

The review left out fungal infections. The team looked at a main result and other results. The main result was death from any cause. They also looked at bad side effects and other health needs.

Other results were very key. These were serious bad events. They also looked at help for blood flow, harm to the kidneys, and harm to brain growth. They looked at gut injury and hearing harm. They planned to note breathing help, too.

Three team members checked each study. They picked which trials to include. They took out the data. They judged how much we can trust the results.

They looked at results at the last check for each baby. The time each baby stayed in a trial was not clear. The studies did not report if sex or gender made a difference. The babies’ exact time in the trials was not given.

4. Results
The review found five trials. In all, 580 babies took part. Each trial tested a different antibiotic mix. Because of this, the team did not add the data together.

The trials did not find a clear winner. No drug plan showed lower death. No plan showed fewer serious bad events. No plan had clear gains for blood flow help.

They also did not see clear gaps in kidney harm. They did not see clear gaps in brain growth harms. They did not see clear gaps in gut injury. So, no plan stood out as best.

Two results were not in any trial. These were need for breathing support and harm to hearing. So, we do not know about those harms or needs.

Study quality was a problem. All five trials had study problems. These problems can skew results. Also, each trial was small.

Because of this, the proof is very unsure. We cannot say one plan is better. We also cannot say one plan is safer. The real best plan may still be unknown.

What does this mean for care now? Doctors must weigh choices with care. They should watch each baby closely. They should change plans if the baby does not get better.

What does this mean for future research? We need better and larger trials. The trials should use fair and clear methods. They should test key results that matter to families.

Future trials should follow babies long term. They should check hearing and breathing needs. They should track brain growth and kidney health. They should report time in the trial.

In sum, the review asked a key question. It looked at the best proof we have now. It did not find a best antibiotic plan yet. We need new, strong trials to guide care.","Antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis
Review question 
We reviewed the available evidence on different antibiotic regimens for newborns (from 72 hours of life to one month of life) with late‐onset sepsis. 
Background 
Sepsis in newborns is a severe and potential lethal condition, caused by the body's response to an infection. Neonatal sepsis is the third leading cause of neonatal death globally. Despite this high burden of sepsis in newborns, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. This Cochrane Review was originally published in 2005. To identify the most appropriate antibiotic policies for neonatal sepsis, there is a need to base these policies on an updated well‐conducted review. Therefore, there is a need for such a review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for late‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to March 2021. We included five trials randomising 580 participants. The five trials compared five different antibiotic regimens. 
Key results 
We included five trials: one trial compared cefazolin plus amikacin with vancomycin plus amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with flucloxacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared cloxacillin plus amikacin with cefotaxime plus gentamicin; one trial compared meropenem with standard care (ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime plus gentamicin); and one trial compared vancomycin plus gentamicin with vancomycin plus aztreonam. 
None of the five antibiotic comparisons showed that the choice of antibiotics influenced the effects on death from all‐causes, serious adverse events (i.e. major complications), circulatory support, nephrotoxicity (toxicity in the kidneys), neurological developmental impairment (disabilities in the functioning of the brain that affect a child's behaviour, memory, or ability to learn), or necrotising enterocolitis (tissues in the gut become inflamed and start to die). Current evidence cannot confirm or reject, one antibiotic regimen being superior to another due to scarce data. 
Quality of the evidence 
Our conclusions are based on very low‐quality evidence. The five trials were at high risk of bias (i.e. the trials were conducted in a way that may have skewed results to the positive side). In addition, the five trials included few participants, making the results of this review imprecise.

The role of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment for COVID‐19 has been a subject of considerable discussion. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for COVID‐19 based on randomised controlled trials is required. 
Objectives
To assess whether vitamin D supplementation is effective and safe for the treatment of COVID‐19 in comparison to an active comparator, placebo, or standard of care alone, and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions to 11 March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. 
We excluded studies investigating preventive effects, or studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)). 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following prioritised outcome categories: individuals with moderate or severe COVID‐19: all‐cause mortality, clinical status, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events, and for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease: all‐cause mortality, development of severe clinical COVID‐19 symptoms, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events. 
Main results
We identified three RCTs with 356 participants, of whom 183 received vitamin D. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical progression scale, two studies investigated participants with moderate or severe disease, and one study individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease. The control groups consisted of placebo treatment or standard of care alone. 
Effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19 and moderate to severe disease 
We included two studies with 313 participants. Due to substantial clinical and methodological diversity of both studies, we were not able to pool data. Vitamin D status was unknown in one study, whereas the other study reported data for vitamin D deficient participants. One study administered multiple doses of oral calcifediol at days 1, 3 and 7,  whereas the other study gave a single high dose of oral cholecalciferol at baseline. We assessed one study with low risk of bias for effectiveness outcomes, and the other with some concerns about randomisation and selective reporting. 
All‐cause mortality at hospital discharge (313 participants) 
We found two studies reporting data for this outcome. One study reported no deaths when treated with vitamin D out of 50 participants, compared to two deaths out of 26 participants in the control group (Risk ratio (RR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.13). The other study reported nine deaths out of 119 individuals in the vitamin D group, whereas six participants out of 118 died in the placebo group (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.04]. We are very uncertain whether vitamin D has an effect on all‐cause mortality at hospital discharge (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Clinical status assessed by the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (237 participants) 
We found one study reporting data for this outcome. Nine out of 119 participants needed invasive mechanical ventilation when treated with vitamin D, compared to 17 out of 118 participants in the placebo group (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.13). Vitamin D supplementation may decrease need for invasive mechanical ventilation, but the evidence is uncertain (low‐certainty evidence). 
Quality of life

Safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19 and moderate to severe disease 
We did not include data from one study, because assessment of serious adverse events was not described and we are concerned that data might have been inconsistently measured. This study reported vomiting in one out of 119 participants immediately after vitamin D intake (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.30). We are very uncertain whether vitamin D supplementation is associated with higher risk for adverse events (very low‐certainty). 
Effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID‐19 and asymptomatic or mild disease 
We found one study including 40 individuals, which did not report our prioritised outcomes, but instead data for viral clearance, inflammatory markers, and vitamin D serum levels. The authors reported no events of hypercalcaemia, but recording and assessment of further adverse events remains unclear. Authors administered oral cholecalciferol in daily doses for at least 14 days, and continued with weekly doses if vitamin D blood levels were > 50 ng/mL. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment of COVID‐19. The evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of COVID‐19 is very uncertain. Moreover, we found only limited safety information, and were concerned about consistency in measurement and recording of these outcomes. 
There was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity of included studies, mainly because of different supplementation strategies, formulations, vitamin D status of participants, and reported outcomes. 
There is an urgent need for well‐designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with an appropriate randomisation procedure, comparability of study arms and preferably double‐blinding. We identified 21 ongoing and three completed studies without published results, which indicates that these needs will be addressed and that our findings are subject to change in the future. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically.

Vitamin D to treat COVID-19: what we know so far

Rationale
COVID-19 is an illness from a virus. It can harm the lungs. It can lead to a stay in the hospital. It can lead to death. Many people want safe, low cost care that can help.

Vitamin D is a vitamin our body needs. Sun and some foods give us vitamin D. It helps bones. It also helps the immune system fight germs. Some think vitamin D might help people with COVID-19 get well.

We need to test this idea in a fair way. A fair test is called a randomized trial. In such a trial, people get picked for a group by chance, like a coin toss. One group gets the study drug. The other group gets a “placebo” (a look‑alike pill with no drug) or usual care. This helps us see if the pill truly works.

The goal of this review was to see if vitamin D helps treat COVID-19. The team also looked at safety. They asked, does vitamin D lower deaths? Does it cut the need for a breathing machine? Does it cause harm?

Trial Design
This was a “living” review. That means the team keeps it up to date as new trials come out. The team searched large study lists to March 11, 2021. They did not limit by language.

They looked for randomized trials that used vitamin D to treat people who already had COVID-19. They included people of any age, sex, or race. They did not include trials that tried to prevent COVID-19. They did not include trials in other virus types, like SARS or MERS.

They found three trials with 356 people. Of these, 183 got vitamin D. Two trials took place in people in the hospital with moderate or severe COVID-19. One trial was in people with mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.

The control groups got a placebo or the usual care the hospital gives. Trials used different types and doses of vitamin D. One trial gave a form that acts fast, more than one time in the first week. One trial gave one large dose of regular vitamin D at the start. The third trial gave vitamin D each day for at least 14 days. Some people then got weekly doses after that.

The main things the team looked at were death, need for a breathing machine, side effects, and life quality. For people with mild or no symptoms, they also looked at who went on to get very sick. Some outcomes were checked by the time people left the hospital. The time each person stayed in a trial was not clear in this report.

Results
Here is what the trials in the hospital found. Two trials (313 people) looked at death by the time people left the hospital. In one trial, none of 50 people on vitamin D died. In that same trial, 2 of 26 people in the control group died. In the other trial, 9 of 119 people on vitamin D died. In that trial, 6 of 118 people on placebo died. These mixed results mean we cannot tell if vitamin D lowers deaths.

One trial (237 people) looked at who needed a breathing machine. Nine of 119 people on vitamin D needed a breathing machine. Seventeen of 118 people on placebo needed one. This could mean fewer people needed a breathing machine with vitamin D. But the data are not strong. We cannot be sure this was due to vitamin D.

We did not find data on life quality in the hospital trials. This means we do not know if people felt better day to day with vitamin D.

What about side effects? One hospital trial said one person threw up right after they took vitamin D. That was 1 out of 119 people. That trial did not give clear details on other harms. The other hospital trial did not give clear safety details either. With so little and unclear data, we cannot judge safety well.

Now, here is what the trial in people with mild or no symptoms found. That trial had 40 people. It did not report on death, on who got very sick, or on life quality. It looked at virus tests and blood signs of swelling in the body. It also checked vitamin D levels in the blood. The authors said they saw no cases of high blood calcium in that trial. High blood calcium can be a harm from too much vitamin D. But other side effects were not clear.

Across all three trials, the doses and forms of vitamin D were not the same. Some people may have had low vitamin D at the start, but one trial did not report baseline levels. This makes it hard to compare results. The trials were also small. The total number of people was 356. That is not enough to give firm answers.

What does this mean for patients? Right now, we do not have enough proof that vitamin D helps treat COVID-19. We also do not have enough proof that it is safe for this use. Some results look hopeful, like fewer people on a breathing machine in one trial. But other results do not match this. So we cannot say that vitamin D helps people with COVID-19 get well.

More and better trials are on the way. The team found 21 trials still in progress. They also found 3 more trials that were done but had no results out yet. These new data may change what we know. The review team plans to keep checking and will add new results over time.

If you have COVID-19, talk with your care team before you take vitamin D for treatment. Do not start or stop any drug on your own. Your care team can help you choose the best and safest care for you.","Is vitamin D an effective and safe treatment for COVID‐19?
Key messages 
‐ We did not find enough, good‐quality evidence to judge whether vitamin D is an effective or safe treatment for adults with COVID‐19. 
‐ We need more research on this topic. Future research should focus on well‐designed studies with robust methods. 
‐ We identified 21 studies on this topic that are ongoing. We will update this review when more evidence becomes available. 
What is the link between vitamin D and COVID‐19? 
Some studies have shown that people who are in hospital with severe COVID‐19 also have low levels of  vitamin D (vitamin D deficiency). However, the risk factors for developing severe COVID‐19 are the same as those for developing vitamin D deficiency, so it is difficult to tell if vitamin D deficiency itself is a risk factor for severe COVID‐19. Risk factors include general ill‐health, a poor diet, and pre‐existing health conditions, such as diabetes, and liver and kidney disease. 
Vitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. It helps to regulate blood sugar, the heart and blood vessels, and the lungs and airways. It also has a role in boosting the body’s immune system. These are areas affected by COVID‐19, so giving vitamin D to people with COVID‐19 might help them to recover more quickly or have the disease less severely. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out the effects of giving vitamin D to adults with confirmed COVID‐19 on the following: 
‐ death from any cause;
‐ improvement or worsening of the patient’s condition;
‐ unwanted effects; and
‐ quality of life.
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the use of vitamin D as a treatment for adults with confirmed COVID‐19 compared with a placebo (sham treatment) or another treatment. Vitamin D could be given in any form and in any dose. 
We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found three studies with 356 participants. One study took place in Brazil, and the other two in Spain. Two studies had participants with severe COVID‐19 and one had participants with mild COVID‐19 or with no symptoms. All the participants tested positive for COVID‐19 with a laboratory test called ‘PCR’, which is currently the most accurate test available. 
The studies gave their participants different doses of vitamin D. They used different timings from each other, from one large dose in one study to several smaller doses over 14 days in another study. Only two studies said that their participants were vitamin D‐deficient. The other study did not say anything about their participants’ vitamin D status. 
Deaths from any causeWe do not know whether vitamin D helps to prevent death from COVID‐19. Two studies (in participants with severe COVID‐19) provided evidence about deaths from any cause. One reported no deaths in the 50 participants who had received vitamin D, but two  deaths in the 26 participants who received the hospital’s usual COVID‐19 treatment. The other study reported nine deaths in 119 participants who had been given vitamin D and six deaths in the 118 participants given placebo. These studies were too different from each other to allow us to draw any conclusions. 
Patient’s conditionVitamin D may reduce the need for patients to be put on a ventilator to help them breathe, but the evidence is uncertain. One study (in participants with severe COVID‐19) reported that nine out of 119 participants given vitamin D had to be put on a ventilator and 17 out of 118 given a placebo needed a ventilator. 
Unwanted effectsWe do not know whether vitamin D causes unwanted effects. Only one study (in participants with severe COVID‐19) reported data on unwanted effects in a way that we could use. It found that one participant out of 119 vomited shortly after being given vitamin D. 
Quality of lifeNone of the studies reported quality of life. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence is very limited because the studies gave different doses of vitamin D at different times from each other, did not all report participants’ vitamin D status, and did not measure and record their results using consistent methods. 
We found little evidence on unwanted effects and none on quality of life.  
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 11 March 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD010613.pub2,"Intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury
What is the issue? 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is very common among patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), it is associated with a high death rated and characterised by the rapid loss of the kidney function. Patients with AKI show increased levels of serum uraemic toxins (creatinine and urea), serum potassium and metabolic acids, accumulation of water and in the most cases a reduction in urine output. In this population these chemicals and fluid overload are related to increased rates of death. Theoretically, effective removal of toxins and excess water from the bloodstream might improve patient outcomes (such as mortality rate and recovery of kidney function). 
Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a blood purification technique that enables removal of excess water and toxins. CRRT involves blood being diverted from the patient via a catheter (a hollow, flexible tube placed into a vein) through a filtering system which continuously and steadily removes excess water and toxins; purified blood is then returned to the patient via the catheter. Higher intensity CRRT improves the removal of toxins and excess water. The aim of this review was to investigate the effect of different intensities of CRRT (intensive or less intensive) on death, recovery of kidney function, and adverse events in people with AKI who are critically ill. 
What did we do? 
We searched the literature up until February 2016 and identified six studies enrolling 3185 patients with AKI that were evaluated in this review. 
What did we find? 
Six randomised studies enrolling 3185 participants were included in our review. Compared to less intensive CRRT, intensive CRRT did not reduce the risk of death, improve the recovery of kidney function, or reduce the risk of adverse events (such as bleeding) in patients with AKI. Intensive CRRT was associated with an increased risk of low blood phosphate levels.

Do stronger kidney filters help very sick people with sudden kidney injury?

Rationale
Your kidneys clean your blood. They remove waste and extra water. They also help keep the right balance of salts and acids.

In sudden kidney injury, the kidneys slow or stop fast. Waste builds up in the blood. Urine may drop. Water can build up in the body.

This build‑up can be hard on the body. It can raise the chance of death. Doctors want to lower waste and extra water to help people live and heal.

A slow, steady blood filter can help. Doctors call it continuous renal replacement therapy. It is a gentle, all‑day form of dialysis. Blood goes through a tube to a filter. The filter removes waste and water. The clean blood then goes back in.

A stronger filter should remove more waste and water. Some hoped this would help people live and help kidneys heal. This review asked a simple question. Does a stronger filter work better than a standard filter for these very sick people?

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team looked for all good trials on this topic. They searched the medical literature up to February 2016. They looked for trials that used chance to place people in groups.

They found six randomized trials. These trials had 3,185 people in total. All people were very sick in the hospital. All had sudden kidney injury.

Each trial compared two ways to use the filter. One group got a stronger filter plan. One group got a less strong, standard plan. The filter worked through a tube in a large vein. It ran steady for long hours each day.

The people in the trials were very ill. They needed close care. The exact time in each trial was not the same. The review did not report one set time on the filter for all trials.

Results
The review looked for three key results. First, did more people live with the stronger filter? Second, did kidneys heal more often with the stronger filter? Third, were side effects less with the stronger filter?

Across the six trials, the stronger filter did not help people live longer. It did not help the kidneys heal more often. It did not lower side effects like bleeding.

One harm stood out. The stronger filter raised the chance of low blood phosphate. Phosphate is a mineral in the blood. Your body needs it for energy and strong bones. Very low phosphate can cause weak muscles and trouble breathing. The review found the stronger filter made low phosphate more likely.

What does this mean for patients and families? Using a stronger filter did not add benefit. It did not lower death. It did not help kidney recovery. It did not lower harms like bleeding. But it did add a new risk. It made low phosphate more likely.

These results came from six trials with many very sick people. This makes the findings strong. The people in these trials were like many people in real hospitals. They had sudden kidney injury and needed a blood filter.

So, what is the take‑home message? A stronger filter removes more waste and water. But removing more did not help people live or heal. It did add a risk of low phosphate. Based on these trials, a standard filter plan seems as good or better. It may be safer for phosphate levels.

Talk with your care team if you or a loved one needs this filter. Ask about goals, risks, and benefits. Ask how they will watch phosphate and other salts in the blood. Ask what signs to watch for, like muscle weakness or cramps.

In sum, this careful review did not find proof that a stronger filter helps. It found a clear risk of low phosphate. The results can help guide care for very sick people with sudden kidney injury.","Intensity of continuous renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury

High intake of added sugar have been suggested to impact the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Knowledge on the subject can contribute to preventing CVD. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of a high versus low‐added sugar consumption for primary prevention of CVD in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S) on 2 July 2021. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal for ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was performed together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no restriction on language of publication or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials, that compared different levels of added sugar intake. Exclusion criteria were: participants aged below 18 years; diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2); and previous CVD. Primary outcomes were incident cardiovascular events (coronary, carotid, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease) and all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL‐cholesterol, HDL‐cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and adverse events (gastrointestinal symptoms and impaired dental health). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 21 RCTs (1110 participants completing the interventions) examining the effects of different levels of added sugar intake with a mean duration of 14 weeks. The study participants were generally described as healthy and the mean age ranged from 22 to 57 years. 
No studies reported on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality. There was minimal effect of low intake of added sugar on total cholesterol levels (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21; I² = 0%; 16 studies; 763 participants; low certainty of evidence) and triglycerides (MD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17; I² = 3%; 14 studies; 725 participants) but no evidence of effect on LDL‐cholesterol and HDL‐cholesterol. There was minimal effect on diastolic blood pressure (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.37; I² = 0%; 13 studies; 873 participants) and on systolic blood pressure (MD 1.44, 95% 0.08 to 2.80; I² = 27%, 14 studies; 873 participants; low certainty of evidence), but no evidence of effect on fasting plasma glucose. 
Only one study reported on dental health, with no events. No other trials reported adverse events (impaired dental health or gastrointestinal symptoms). 
All results were judged as low‐quality evidence according to GRADE. The risk of bias was generally unclear, five studies were classified at an overall low risk of bias (low risk in at least four domains, not including other bias). 
Authors' conclusions
No trials investigating the effect of added sugar on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality were identified in our searches. Evidence is uncertain whether low intake of added sugar has an effect on risk factors for CVD; the effect was small and the clinical relevance is, therefore, uncertain. Practical ways to achieve reductions in dietary added sugar includes following current dietary recommendations. 
Future trials should have longer follow‐up time and report on all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular events in order to clarify the effect of added sugar on these outcomes. Future trials should also aim for more direct interventions and preferably be more independent of industry funding.

Does cutting added sugar help heart health?

2. Rationale
Heart and blood vessel disease is common. It can lead to heart attack and stroke. It can cause pain, worry, and high health costs.

Many people eat a lot of added sugar. Added sugar is sugar put into food and drink. It is not the sugar that is part of whole fruit or milk.

Some experts think added sugar may harm the heart. It may raise blood fats and blood pressure. If that is true, eating less added sugar may help prevent disease.

This study asked a clear question. Does eating less added sugar, compared to more, lower the risk of heart disease? The team also looked at signs linked to risk, like blood fats and blood pressure.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. In each trial, people ate more or less added sugar. The trials used chance to assign the groups. That means each person had equal chance to get either diet.

The review found 21 trials. A total of 1,110 people finished the diet plans. Most people were healthy adults. The average age in the trials ranged from 22 to 57 years. People with diabetes were not in these trials. People with past heart disease were not in these trials. No one under age 18 was in these trials.

Most trials lasted a short time. On average, each trial ran about 14 weeks. That is a little over three months. This is a short time to see heart disease. So the trials focused on risk signs in the blood and body.

The main things the team hoped to see were big health events. These were heart attacks, strokes, or death from any cause. The trials also checked blood pressure, blood fats, blood sugar, and side effects. Blood fats include total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides. Triglycerides are another kind of blood fat.

4. Results
No trial reported on heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. The time in each trial was likely too short. So we cannot say if less added sugar lowers those events.

The review did find small changes in some risk signs. When people ate less added sugar, total cholesterol changed a little. Triglycerides also changed a little. There was no clear change in LDL, the “bad” cholesterol. There was no clear change in HDL, the “good” cholesterol.

Blood pressure also changed a small amount. Systolic pressure is the top number. Diastolic pressure is the bottom number. Both shifted a little with less sugar. These shifts were small.

There was no clear change in fasting blood sugar. That is the blood sugar after not eating overnight. So, eating less added sugar did not show a clear effect there.

Side effects were rare in the trials. Only one trial checked dental health. It found no dental problems. No trial reported stomach side effects. This may be due to the short time in the trials.

How sure are we about these results? The authors judged the proof as low quality. Some trials did not report all details. Some trials had design issues. The trials were also short. This makes it hard to know the true, long term effect.

What does this mean for you? Cutting added sugar may cause small changes in blood fats and pressure. We do not know if this leads to fewer heart attacks or strokes. The changes seen were small. The real health impact is not clear.

The study adds to our knowledge. It shows we need better and longer trials. We need trials that last years, not weeks. We need trials that track heart attacks, strokes, and death. We also need trials that are more clear and more free from outside influence.

What can you do now? You can aim to follow current diet advice to lower added sugar. That may mean fewer sweet drinks and sweets. Many people feel better when they do this. It may also help with weight. But this review cannot prove it will prevent heart disease on its own.

In short, here is what we know. Less added sugar caused small shifts in some risk signs. We do not know if it prevents heart events. We need longer and stronger trials to be sure.","Low levels of sugar to prevent cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels and the number one cause of death worldwide. It is important to detect modifiable risk factors and find strategies to prevent CVD. There are several established modifiable risk factors for developing CVD, one of them being eating an unhealthy diet rich in sugar. Sugar can be divided in two categories; sugars naturally occurring in food and sugars that are added to food. A high level of added sugar intake is suggested to cause weight gain and affect blood lipids, increasing the risk of CVD. This review assessed different levels of added sugars in the diet and the effect on cardiovascular events (e.g. heart attack or stroke), death, and CVD risk factors in healthy adults. 
Study characteristics 
Databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials in which participants are randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control treatment) were searched. The trials that were included compared different levels of added sugar intake and its effect on risk factors for CVD in healthy adults. People with previous CVD or diabetes were not included in the review. 
Key results 
Twenty‐one trials were found with 1110 participants. None of the trials looked at cardiovascular events or death. The trials reported on blood pressure, blood lipid levels and blood sugar levels. The review found that low levels of added sugar intake led to a small reduction in blood pressure and blood lipid levels, but no effect was seen on blood sugar. The evidence is current to July 2021. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies included in the review provide low‐quality evidence that low levels of added sugar in the diet indirectly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. More long‐term studies of high quality assessing effects of different levels of sugar on CVD risk factors, cardiovascular events and death are needed.

Inability to communicate in a manner that can be understood causes extreme distress for people requiring an artificial airway and has implications for care quality and patient safety. Options for aided communication include non‐vocal, speech‐generating, and voice‐enabling aids. 
Objectives
To assess effectiveness of communication aids for people requiring an artificial airway (endotracheal or tracheostomy tube), defined as the proportion of people able to: use a non‐vocal communication aid to communicate at least one symptom, need, or preference; or use a voice‐enabling communication aid to phonate to produce at least one intelligible word. 
To assess time to communication/phonation; perceptions of communication; communication quality/success; quality of life; psychological distress; length of stay and costs; and adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (Wiley version), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), three other databases, and grey literature from inception to 30 July 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs, controlled non‐randomised parallel group, and before‐after studies evaluating communication aids used in adults with an artificial airway. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 11 studies (1931 participants) conducted in intensive care units (ICUs). Eight evaluated non‐vocal communication aids and three voice‐enabling aids. Usual care was the comparator for all. For six studies, this comprised no aid; usual care in the remaining five studies comprised use of various communication aids. 
Overall, our confidence in results regarding effectiveness of communication interventions was very low due to imprecision, measurement heterogeneity, inconsistency in results, and most studies at high or unclear risk of bias across multiple domains. 
No non‐vocal aid studies reported our primary outcome. We are uncertain of the effects of early use of a voice‐enabling aid compared to routine use on ability to phonate at least one intelligible word (risk ratio (RR) 3.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 50.08; 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Compared to usual care without aids, we are uncertain about effects of a non‐vocal aid (communication board) on patient satisfaction (standardised mean difference (SMD) 2.92, 95% CI 1.52 to 4.33; 4 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). 
No studies of non‐vocal aids reported quality of life. Low‐certainty evidence from two studies suggests early use of a voice‐enabling aid may have no effect on quality of life (MD 2.27, 95% CI –7.21 to 11.75). Conceptual differences in measures of psychological distress precluded data pooling; however, intervention arm participants reported less distress suggesting there might be benefit, but our certainty in the evidence is very low. 
Low‐certainty evidence suggest voice‐enabling aids have little or no effect on ICU length of stay; we were unable to determine effects of non‐vocal aids. Three studies reported different adverse events (physical restraint use, bleeding following tracheostomy, and respiratory parameters indicating respiratory decompensation). Adverse event rates were similar between arms in all three studies. However, uncertainty remains as to any harm associated with communication aids. 
Authors' conclusions
Due to a lack of high‐quality studies, imprecision, inconsistency of results, and measurement heterogeneity,  the evidence provides insufficient information to guide practice as to which communication aid is more appropriate and when to use them. Understanding effectiveness of communication aids would benefit from development of a core outcome measurement set.

Ways to help people with breathing tubes speak and share needs

Rationale
Many people in the ICU have a breathing tube. The tube can go in the mouth or the neck. With a tube, they cannot talk in a clear way. This can cause fear, pain, and stress. It can also harm care and safety.

Tools may help people share their needs. Some tools do not use voice, like boards or writing. Some tools help make sound, so a word can be said. Some are speech devices that make words. These tools may help people feel in control.

The team wanted to test these tools. They asked if people could share one need with a tool. Or if they could say one clear word with a voice tool. They also looked at time to speak or share. They looked at how people felt, and harms.

Trial Design
This was a study of studies. The team looked for all past tests of these tools. They used large medical libraries. They searched up to late July 2020. They used set rules to pick and review each study.

They chose tests in adults in the ICU. ICU is a part of the hospital with close watch. Adults had a tube in the mouth or neck to breathe. The studies took place while people had the tube in. All people were in the hospital ICU.

In total, there were 11 studies with 1,931 people. Eight studies used tools with no voice. Three studies used tools that help voice. A usual care group was in each study. Usual care means the normal care given at that hospital.

Some usual care groups had no tool. Some usual care groups had mixed tools. The summary did not give age or say if people were men or women. It did not say how long each person took part.

Results
The proof from these studies was weak. Many had small numbers or unclear methods. Measures were not the same across studies. Results did not match well. So we cannot tell which tool is best.

Non‑voice tools did not report the main goal. We do not know if they helped share one need. Voice tools used early had unclear results. We do not know if they helped say one clear word. We need better tests to know this.

Some people used a board to share needs. They may have felt more pleased with care. But the proof was very weak. So we cannot be sure. The team could not add the data into one group.

For day to day life, results were mixed. Non‑voice tools did not report on life quality. Two voice tool studies found no clear change. So day to day life may stay the same. We need more data here.

For mood and stress, results were hard to add. Some people who got tools felt less stress. But the proof was very weak. We cannot know the true effect. The team could not add the scores.

Voice tools did not change ICU days by much. For non‑voice tools, we cannot tell. The summary did not report costs. We also need better data on time to speak. We do not know the best time to start.

Three studies looked for harm. They tracked use of straps to stop pulling at tubes. They tracked bleeding after the neck tube surgery. They tracked signs of breathing trouble. Harm rates were close in both groups.

But we still cannot rule out harm. We need close watch when we use these tools. We also need clear and shared ways to measure results. This will help us learn what works, and when.

What does this mean for care? These tools may help people feel heard. They may help staff learn needs and give safe care. But the best tool and time to use it are not clear. We need stronger, well run studies with shared measures.","Strategies to help adults with a breathing tube to communicate
What is the issue? 
Patients needing a machine to support breathing cannot speak due to a tube delivering gas to the lungs bypassing their voice box. Patients mouth words, gesture, and use facial expressions. However, these are very difficult to understand. Weakened muscles and difficulty concentrating, which are common in critical illness, makes using aids such as writing equipment or communication boards difficult. Consistent evidence on which communication aids are effective is lacking. 
Why is this important? 
Difficulty communicating places people at increased risk of harm, causes distress to patients and family, and causes stress for healthcare staff. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies (to 30 July 2020) exploring aids used to help people with a breathing tube to communicate. We found 11 studies involving 1931 participants admitted to intensive care units. We also looked for studies involving people needing a breathing tube and living at home or in long‐term care, but found none. Eight studies used communication boards or apps. Three studies used aids that help a patient to speak with the breathing tube in place. All studies compared the communication aid to routine communication practices. For six studies, routine practice did not include use of any type of communication aid. For the remaining five studies, usual care comprised a range of communication aids routinely used in the participating intensive care units including a communication board, paper notepad, and routine timing of the use of speech aids. We are unsure about whether the early use of aids to help with speaking may increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood or shorten the time to be able to speak. The evidence was of very low quality. 
Similarly, compared to routine care in which an aid is not used, we are uncertain about the effects of communication boards on patient satisfaction. We are not sure about the effect on psychological distress and quality of life due to uncertainty in the evidence. Communication aids that help people to speak may have little or no effect on intensive care unit length of stay (low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of possible harms  with use of communication aids as only three studies reported this, and all measured different adverse events, and two were very small studies. 
What does this mean? 
We are unsure whether using speaking aids in intensive care might increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood. Use of communication boards may increase patient satisfaction, but we are not sure of these findings because of very low‐quality evidence. This means further studies are likely to change our understanding of the effects of communication aids. More studies are needed to understand the effects of communication aids, particularly effects on psychological well‐being and people's ability to communicate.

10.1002-14651858.CD013243.pub2,"Background
Dementia is a chronic condition which progressively affects memory and other cognitive functions, social behaviour, and ability to carry out daily activities. To date, no treatment is clearly effective in preventing progression of the disease, and most treatments are symptomatic, often aiming to improve people's psychological symptoms or behaviours which are challenging for carers. A range of new therapeutic strategies has been evaluated in research, and the use of trained animals in therapy sessions, termed animal‐assisted therapy (AAT), is receiving increasing attention. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of animal‐assisted therapy for people with dementia.
Search methods
We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register on 5 September 2019. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of major healthcare databases, trial registries, and grey literature sources. We also searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), ISI Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO's trial registry portal. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials, and randomised cross‐over trials that compared AAT versus no AAT, AAT using live animals versus alternatives such as robots or toys, or AAT versus any other active intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data using the standard methods of Cochrane Dementia. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the retrieved records. We expressed our results using mean difference (MD), standardised mean difference (SMD), and risk ratio (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) where appropriate. 
Main results
We included nine RCTs from 10 reports. All nine studies were conducted in Europe and the US. Six studies were parallel‐group, individually randomised RCTs; one was a randomised cross‐over trial; and two were cluster‐RCTs that were possibly related where randomisation took place at the level of the day care and nursing home. We identified two ongoing trials from trial registries. 
There were three comparisons: AAT versus no AAT (standard care or various non‐animal‐related activities), AAT using live animals versus robotic animals, and AAT using live animals versus the use of a soft animal toy. The studies evaluated 305 participants with dementia. One study used horses and the remainder used dogs as the therapy animal. The duration of the intervention ranged from six weeks to six months, and the therapy sessions lasted between 10 and 90 minutes each, with a frequency ranging from one session every two weeks to two sessions per week. There was a wide variety of instruments used to measure the outcomes. All studies were at high risk of performance bias and unclear risk of selection bias. Our certainty about the results for all major outcomes was very low to moderate. 
Comparing AAT versus no AAT, participants who received AAT may be slightly less depressed after the intervention (MD –2.87, 95% CI –5.24 to –0.50; 2 studies, 83 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but they did not appear to have improved quality of life (MD 0.45, 95% CI –1.28 to 2.18; 3 studies, 164 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no clear differences in all other major outcomes, including social functioning (MD –0.40, 95% CI –3.41 to 2.61; 1 study, 58 participants; low‐certainty evidence), problematic behaviour (SMD –0.34, 95% CI –0.98 to 0.30; 3 studies, 142 participants; very‐low‐certainty evidence), agitation (SMD –0.39, 95% CI –0.89 to 0.10; 3 studies, 143 participants; very‐low‐certainty evidence), activities of daily living (MD 4.65, 95% CI –16.05 to 25.35; 1 study, 37 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and self‐care ability (MD 2.20, 95% CI –1.23 to 5.63; 1 study, 58 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There were no data on adverse events. 
Comparing AAT using live animals versus robotic animals, one study (68 participants) found mixed effects on social function, with longer duration of physical contact but shorter duration of talking in participants who received AAT using live animals versus robotic animals (median: 93 seconds with live versus 28 seconds with robotic for physical contact; 164 seconds with live versus 206 seconds with robotic for talk directed at a person; 263 seconds with live versus 307 seconds with robotic for talk in total). Another study showed no clear differences between groups in behaviour measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MD –6.96, 95% CI –14.58 to 0.66; 78 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or quality of life (MD –2.42, 95% CI –5.71 to 0.87; 78 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There were no data on the other outcomes. 
Comparing AAT using live animals versus a soft toy cat, one study (64 participants) evaluated only social functioning, in the form of duration of contact and talking. The data were expressed as median and interquartile ranges. Duration of contact was slightly longer in participants in the AAT group and duration of talking slightly longer in those exposed to the toy cat. This was low‐certainty evidence. 
Authors' conclusions
We found low‐certainty evidence that AAT may slightly reduce depressive symptoms in people with dementia. We found no clear evidence that AAT affects other outcomes in this population, with our certainty in the evidence ranging from very‐low to moderate depending on the outcome. We found no evidence on safety or effects on the animals. Therefore, clear conclusions cannot yet be drawn about the overall benefits and risks of AAT in people with dementia. Further well‐conducted RCTs are needed to improve the certainty of the evidence. In view of the difficulty in achieving blinding of participants and personnel in such trials, future RCTs should work on blinding outcome assessors, document allocation methods clearly, and include major patient‐important outcomes such as affect, emotional and social functioning, quality of life, adverse events, and outcomes for animals.

Do therapy animals help people with dementia?

Rationale
Dementia harms memory, thinking, and daily life. It can change mood and social life. It is hard for the person and for family and carers. There is no cure yet. Most care aims to ease day to day problems.

Some people hope animals can help. This is called animal‑assisted therapy, or AAT. In AAT, a trained dog or horse takes part in set visits. The aim is to lift mood and help social ties. This review asked if AAT helps and if it is safe.

Trial Design
This was a review of fair tests, also called trials. In most trials, people were put into groups by chance. One group met a live animal. The other group did not. Some trials used a robot pet or a soft toy for the other group.

The review found nine trials. They took place in Europe and the United States. In total, 305 people with dementia took part. Some lived in care homes. Some went to day care. Most trials used dogs. One trial used horses.

The time in a trial was six weeks to six months. A visit could last 10 to 90 minutes. Visits could be one every two weeks or up to two each week. The trials checked mood, daily life, and how people act and talk. The trials also looked at social time and touch.

Results
AAT may help with low mood. In two trials, people who met animals felt a bit less low. The change was small. We are not very sure about it. The trials were small and ran in one area.

AAT did not seem to change life quality. Three trials looked at this. The scores were about the same in both groups. AAT also did not show clear change in daily tasks. One trial checked how well people did daily care. It did not show a clear gain.

There was no clear change in how people acted. Three trials looked at hard acts, like restlessness or upset acts. The groups looked much the same. Three trials looked at how often people seemed “on edge.” They did not see a clear change. One trial looked at social life. It did not find a clear gain.

Some trials used robot pets as a match group. One trial found mixed social signs. With live animals, people touched more. In that trial, people had contact for 93 seconds with a live animal. With the robot pet, it was 28 seconds. But people spoke for a bit more time with the robot pet. They spoke for 206 seconds with the robot, and 164 seconds with a live animal. A second trial found no clear change in how people acted or in life quality with live animals versus robot pets.

One trial used a soft toy cat as a match group. People touched a bit more with live animals. They spoke a bit more with the toy. These were small shifts.

The trials did not report on harms to people. They also did not report on harms to animals. So we do not know if bad events took place. This is key to know.

We also have limits to what we can say. Many trials were small. Many tools to rate change were not the same. In most trials, people knew which group they were in. That can sway results. For these reasons, we are not very sure of the true effect.

What does this mean for people and carers? AAT may help low mood a bit. It did not show clear gains in life quality, daily tasks, or hard acts. A robot pet or a soft toy may also help with talk or touch. We do not know if AAT is safe in all cases. We also do not know how it affects the animals.

What should come next? We need more strong trials. These trials should track mood, social life, life quality, and daily tasks. They should also track bad events for people and for animals. The tests should use the same tools. People who rate the results should not know the group. This can make the results more fair.

In short, AAT looks hopeful for low mood. But we do not have clear proof yet. If you wish to try AAT, talk with your care team. Ask about goals, visit plans, and safety steps. Ask how you and the animal will be kept safe.","Animal‐assisted therapy for people with dementia
Review question 
Do therapy sessions that involve live animals help people with dementia?
Background 
Dementia is an increasingly common condition across the world. People with dementia have progressive loss of the ability to think, remember, and communicate; to manage their daily activities; and to mix successfully with other people. Many people with dementia also develop depression and related problems. To date, no treatment has proven able to cure the disease or stop it from getting worse. However, many treatments are in use which aim to improve the well‐being of people with dementia and the people who look after them. Animal‐assisted therapy (AAT) is one of the types of treatment that has been studied. It is thought that animals could help people with dementia by providing companionship and support in daily activities and that this might lead to improvements in physical and mental health, including better mood and fewer problematic behaviours. 
Search date 
We searched medical databases to September 2019.
Key characteristics of included studies 
We included nine randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), involving 305 people with dementia, which compared AAT to a control treatment (either usual care or an alternative treatment). All studies took place in Europe or the US. Seven studies compared AAT to usual care or to another activity which had nothing to do with animals. Two studies compared AAT (using live animals) to the use of robotic animals. One study compared AAT to the use of a soft toy cat. There were some features of the studies which could have biased the results. Study participants and care staff knew what treatment a person was receiving and this might have affected some results. Also, it was not always clear that the randomisation to treatments had been done as well as possible. 
Funding sources 
The studies received funding from various sources, including research grants (four studies), personal donation (one study), and support from an institute that promotes AAT (two studies). Two studies did not describe how they were funded. 
Key results 
We found evidence from two studies with 83 participants that people with dementia who had AAT were possibly slightly less depressed at the end of treatment than people who had standard care or other interventions not related to animals. We also found evidence from three studies with 164 participants that people who received AAT had no clear difference in their quality of life compared to those who did not. However, we found no evidence of an effect on social functioning (interactions with their environment and families), behaviour, agitation, activities of daily living, self‐care ability or balance. There were no clear differences when AAT was compared with the use of a robotic animal in two studies with 156 participants (in social functioning, behaviour, and quality of life), or with the use of a soft toy cat in one study with 64 participants (in social functioning). There were no data on harmful effects of the treatment on the participants and nothing was reported about the effect on the animals in any study. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We took several factors into account when deciding how certain we could be of our results. In this review, two main factors reduced our level of certainty. First, for all the outcomes we looked at, there was only a small number of studies and participants. Second, we thought there was a significant risk that all of the results could have been biased by the way the studies were designed or conducted. For a few outcomes, our confidence was also reduced by inconsistent results between studies. Overall, our certainty about the results ranged from very low to moderate. 
Conclusions 
AAT may slightly reduce depressive symptoms. Otherwise, no conclusions can yet be drawn on whether AAT is beneficial or safe for people with dementia. The small size of the included studies, and the diversity of outcomes and outcome measures, were major issues. We recommend further well‐conducted studies with the inclusion of important outcomes such as emotional and social well‐being, quality of life, side effects, and effects on the animals.

10.1002-14651858.CD007492.pub2,"Healthcare services for adults with an intellectual disability
Background 
Adults with an intellectual disability often have difficulty in receiving the healthcare they need. Compared to other adults who do not have an intellectual disability, they have poorer health and have more difficulty finding, getting to, and paying for healthcare. This happens for both physical and mental healthcare needs. 
Review question 
We conducted a review of the literature to assess the effects of different ways to organise services. This is the first update of a previously published review. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all relevant studies until 4 September 2015. We found seven studies, six of which we identified previously and one retrieved for this update. All of the studies assessed the impact of the intervention on the mental health of persons with an intellectual disability; none considered the physical health. Those studies used different interventions, including giving persons with an intellectual disability more health services, psychological support, and treating them at home, instead of at the hospital. Studies mainly looked at how the interventions helped the behavioural problems of those with an intellectual disability, how much burden they caused the care givers, and how much they cost. No study assessed adverse events. 
Key results 
Community‐based behaviour therapy might decrease behavioural problems. We are uncertain whether other interventions make any difference in reducing behavioural problems. There was limited evidence about how those interventions helped care givers to deal with the burden of caring for their relatives with an intellectual disability, or how much they might cost compared with the usual care already provided. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is little information on different ways to organise services for people with intellectual disabilities. Most studies focused on people who had intellectual disabilities and mental health problems. There were no studies on people who had intellectual disabilities and physical problems. 
","1. Plain Title
How to set up care for adults with intellectual disability

2. Rationale
An intellectual disability is a life‑long brain difference. It can make it hard to learn, plan, and cope. Adults with this need more help to get health care. They may need help for the body and the mind.

Many face big barriers to care. They can have trouble finding care. They may have trouble getting to care. They may not have the money for care. Their health is often worse than for other adults.

We need to know how to set up care so it helps. Good set‑up may mean care is close to home. It may mean more support for stress and mood. It may help family and paid helpers as well.

The goal of this work was clear. The team asked, which ways to set up care help the most? They looked for care that may calm hard acts or moods. They also looked at strain on care givers and costs. They wanted to see if care was safe.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. A review pulls facts from many studies. It can show what works and what does not. It can also show where we lack proof.

The team looked for all studies up to 4 September 2015. They found seven studies. Six were from a past review. One was new for this update.

All seven studies looked at mental health care. None looked at care for body health. The people in the studies were adults with an intellectual disability. The studies did not list men and women by number in this text.

The types of care were not all the same. Some gave more health services. Some gave talk and mood support. Some gave care in the home, not in the hospital.

The studies looked at a few main things. They looked at hard acts, like harm to self or others. They looked at how hard the load was on care givers. They looked at how much the care cost. No study in this review wrote about harms or side effects.

A note on time in the studies. The time that each person was in each study was not clear in this text. The review did not give that detail.

4. Results
What did the review find? It found one type of care that may help. Care in the home and in the town, with a plan to shape acts, may help. This is called behavior therapy. It teaches new skills and ways to act. Staff use it where the person lives. It may lower hard acts.

For the other types of care, we are not sure. The review did not find clear proof that they help with hard acts. The size of help, if any, was not clear.

The review also looked at care giver strain. Care givers are family or paid helpers. They often feel tired, sad, or worn out. The proof on ways to ease this load was small. We do not know what helps them the most yet.

The review also asked about costs. Cost matters to people and health plans. The studies gave few cost facts. So we do not know if new set‑ups cost more or less than usual care.

No study wrote about harms. Harms can be bad effects from care. This is a gap. We need to know that care is safe as well as kind and fair.

No study looked at care for body health needs. That is a big gap. Adults with an intellectual disability often have body health needs too. We need studies on set‑ups that help with that care.

What does this mean for patients and care givers? It means we have some hope. Care in the home, with a plan to shape acts, may help calm hard acts. But we still lack clear facts for most care set‑ups. We also lack facts on harm, on care giver strain, and on cost.

What does this mean for the field? We need more good studies. We need larger, well‑done tests of care set‑ups. We need them to track help and harm. We need them to look at mind care and body care. We need to know what helps the person, the family, and the staff.

The team’s main view was this. There is little strong proof on how to set up care for this group. Most work so far is on mental health care, not body health care. We must do more and better work to guide care.

If you are a patient or a care giver, talk with your care team. Ask about care at home with a plan to shape acts. Ask what help is close to you. Ask what support is there for your own stress and needs. This review shows where care may help. It also shows where we still need to learn more.","Healthcare services for adults with an intellectual disability

Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro. The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) replication in early stages of infection. Currently, evidence on ivermectin for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 treatment is conflicting. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo, or any other proven intervention for people with COVID‐19 receiving treatment as inpatients or outpatients, and for prevention of an infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 (postexposure prophylaxis). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science (Emerging Citation Index and Science Citation Index), WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and HTA database weekly to identify completed and ongoing trials without language restrictions to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Co‐interventions had to be the same in both study arms.  
For this review update, we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity: only RCTs prospectively registered in a trial registry according to WHO guidelines for clinical trial registration were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed RCTs for bias, using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for outcomes in the following settings and populations: 1) to treat inpatients with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19, 2) to treat outpatients with mild COVID‐19 (outcomes: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, (serious) adverse events, quality of life, and viral clearance), and 3) to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (outcomes: SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, development of COVID‐19 symptoms, admission to hospital, mortality, adverse events and quality of life). 
Main results
We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review version; six were not prospectively registered and one was non‐randomized. This updated review includes 11 trials with 3409 participants investigating ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo. No trial investigated ivermectin for prevention of infection or compared ivermectin to an intervention with proven efficacy. Five trials treated participants with moderate COVID‐19 (inpatient settings); six treated mild COVID‐19 (outpatient settings). Eight trials were double‐blind and placebo‐controlled, and three were open‐label. We assessed around 50% of the trial results as low risk of bias. 
We identified 31 ongoing trials. In addition, there are 28 potentially eligible trials without publication of results, or with disparities in the reporting of the methods and results, held in ‘awaiting classification’ until the trial authors clarify questions upon request. 
Ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 in inpatient settings with moderate‐to‐severe disease 
We are uncertain whether ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo reduces or increases all‐cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 2.51; 3 trials, 230 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); or clinical worsening, assessed by participants with new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death at day 28 (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.04; 2 trials, 118 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); or serious adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.89; 2 trials, 197 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may have little or no effect on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants discharged alive at day 28 (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 trial, 73 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.79; 3 trials, 228 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at 7 days (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.58; 3 trials, 231 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No trial investigated quality of life at any time point. 
Ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease 
Ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus/minus placebo probably has little or no effect on all‐cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25; 6 trials, 2860 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and little or no effect on quality of life, measured with the PROMIS Global‐10 scale (physical component mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.98 to 0.98; and mental component MD 0.00, 95% CI ‐1.08 to 1.08; 1358 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect on clinical worsening, assessed by admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.02; 2 trials, 590 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on clinical improvement, assessed by the number of participants with all initial symptoms resolved up to 14 days (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36; 2 trials, 478 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on serious adverse events (RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.62 to 8.31; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low‐certainty evidence); on any adverse events during the trial period (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76; 5 trials, 1502 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and on viral clearance at day 7 compared to placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.48; 2 trials, 331 participants; low‐certainty evidence). None of the trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta‐analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
For outpatients, there is currently low‐ to high‐certainty evidence that ivermectin has no beneficial effect for people with COVID‐19. Based on the very low‐certainty evidence for inpatients, we are still uncertain whether ivermectin prevents death or clinical worsening or increases serious adverse events, while there is low‐certainty evidence that it has no beneficial effect regarding clinical improvement, viral clearance and adverse events. No evidence is available on ivermectin to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In this update, certainty of evidence increased through higher quality trials including more participants. According to this review's living approach, we will continually update our search.

Does ivermectin help people with COVID-19? A clear look at the trials

Rationale
COVID-19 is a lung and body illness caused by a new virus. It can lead to fever, cough, and trouble breathing. Some people get very sick and need care in a hospital.

Ivermectin is a drug that treats some worm infections. Lab tests in dishes suggested it might slow the virus that causes COVID-19. Some early reports in people did not agree. So we needed a careful check of the best trials in people.

This study asked a simple question. Does adding ivermectin to usual care help people with COVID-19? The team also looked for proof that ivermectin could stop infection after a close contact. The goal was to see if it helps, harms, or makes no real difference.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. The trials were “randomized.” That means people were put into groups by chance. One group got ivermectin plus usual care. The other group got usual care with or without a “placebo.” A placebo is a look‑alike pill with no drug.

The team searched many medical lists each week. They looked for trials up to mid‑December 2021. They also added very large trials through April 2022. Trials had to be on a public list before they began. This rule helps make sure the trials were planned in a fair way.

The review included 11 trials with 3,409 people. Five trials took place in the hospital in people with moderate to severe illness. Six trials took place in clinics or at home in people with mild or no symptoms. Eight trials hid the group from both patients and staff. Three trials did not. Most trials tracked results up to 28 days. Some looked at virus tests at day 7.

The team also found 31 trials still in progress. They set aside 28 more trials until the authors can clear up questions about methods or results.

Results
Outpatients with mild or no symptoms
For people not in the hospital, ivermectin did not help people live longer by day 28. It did not lower the chance of going to the hospital or dying. It did not help all symptoms go away faster. It did not clear the virus faster by day 7.

People who took ivermectin did not feel better on a standard health survey. On that survey, scores were the same as with no ivermectin. Side effects were about the same in both groups. Serious side effects were rare and seemed similar. The review team judged this evidence as from low to high strength. Taken together, it points to no benefit for people outside the hospital.

Inpatients with moderate to severe illness
For people in the hospital, the results were not clear. The number of people in these trials was small. We do not know if ivermectin lowers deaths by day 28. We also do not know if it lowers the chance of needing a breathing machine.

Ivermectin did not seem to help people leave the hospital sooner by day 28. It did not seem to clear the virus faster by day 7. Side effects and serious side effects looked close between groups. But the strength of this evidence was very low to low. That means we cannot be sure about these results.

Prevention after a close contact
No trials in this review tested ivermectin to stop infection after exposure. So we do not have proof that ivermectin can prevent COVID‑19 in this way.

What this means for patients and care
For people who are not in the hospital, these trials show no benefit from ivermectin. It did not help people live longer. It did not keep people out of the hospital. It did not help them feel better or clear the virus faster.

For people in the hospital, we still do not know if ivermectin helps. Some results suggest no gain in key areas, like time to discharge or clearing the virus. But the number of people studied was small, and the proof is weak. We need larger, careful trials to know more.

Why this review matters
This review used strict rules to include only higher‑quality trials. It raises the strength of what we know. Based on all the trials so far, ivermectin does not help people with mild COVID‑19. In the hospital setting, we do not have clear proof of benefit.

More trials are under way. The review team will keep checking new results as they come out. For now, the main take‑home is simple. Adding ivermectin to usual care did not show clear benefits for people with COVID‑19. No trials showed that it can prevent infection after exposure. If you have questions about your care, please talk with your doctor.","Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID‐19
Is ivermectin effective for COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
We found no evidence to support the use of ivermectin for treating COVID‐19 or preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The evidence base improved slightly in this update, but is still limited. 
Evaluation of ivermectin is continuing in 31 ongoing trials, and we will update this review again when their results become available.  
What is ivermectin? 
Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals, and scabies in humans. It is inexpensive and is widely used in regions of the world where parasitic infestations are common. It has few unwanted effects.  
Medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID‐19.
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID‐19, or is useful in prevention of the infection. We included trials comparing the medicine to placebo (dummy treatment), usual care, or treatments for COVID‐19 that are known to work to some extent, such as dexamethasone. We excluded trials comparing ivermectin to other medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness against COVID‐19 is uncertain. 
We evaluated the effects of ivermectin in infected people on:
– people dying;– whether people's COVID‐19 got better or worse;– quality of life;– serious and non‐serious unwanted effects;– viral clearance. 
For prevention, we sought the effect on preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease. 
What did we do?  
We searched for randomized controlled trials that investigated ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID‐19. People treated in hospital or as outpatients had to have laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19. 
In this update, we also investigated the trustworthiness of the trials and only included them if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria. 
We compared and summarized the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review as these trials did not fulfil the expected ethical and scientific criteria. Together with four new trials, we included 11 trials with 3409 participants that investigated ivermectin combined with any usual care compared to the same usual care or placebo. 
For treatment, there were five trials of people in hospital with moderate COVID‐19 and six trials of outpatients with mild COVID‐19. The trials used different doses of ivermectin and different durations of treatment.  
No trial investigated ivermectin to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.
We also found 31 ongoing trials, and an additional 28 trials still requiring clarification from the authors or not yet published. 
Main results  
Treating people in hospital with COVID‐19 
We do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment: 
– leads to more or fewer deaths (3 trials, 230 people); – worsens or improves patients' condition, assessed by need for ventilation or death (2 trials, 118 people);– increases or reduces serious unwanted events (2 trials, 197 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: 
– improving patients' condition, assessed by discharge from hospital (1 trial, 73 people);– non‐serious unwanted events (3 trials, 228 participants).  
Seven days after treatment, ivermectin may make little or no difference to reduction of negative COVID‐19 tests (3 trials, 231 participants) compared with placebo or usual care. 
Treating outpatients with COVID‐19 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, probably makes little or no difference to people dying (6 trials, 2860 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, makes little or no difference to quality of life (1 trial, 1358 people). 
Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: 
– worsening patients' condition, assessed by admission to hospital or death (2 trials, 590 people);– serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 people); – non‐serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 participants); – improving people's COVID‐19 symptoms in the 14 days after treatment (2 trials, 478 people);– number of people with negative COVID‐19 tests 7 days after treatment (2 trials, 331 people). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review version, because we could look at more participants included in high‐quality trials. Although we are quite certain regarding our results on risk of people dying and quality of life, the confidence in the evidence is still low for many other outpatient and inpatient outcomes because there were only few events measured. The methods differed between trials, and they did not report everything we were interested in, such as relevant outcomes. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The systematic literature search is up to date to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022.

10.1002-14651858.MR000051.pub2,"Background
Trial monitoring is an important component of good clinical practice to ensure the safety and rights of study participants, confidentiality of personal information, and quality of data. However, the effectiveness of various existing monitoring approaches is unclear. Information to guide the choice of monitoring methods in clinical intervention studies may help trialists, support units, and monitors to effectively adjust their approaches to current knowledge and evidence. 
Objectives
To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of different monitoring strategies (including risk‐based strategies and others) for clinical intervention studies examined in prospective comparative studies of monitoring interventions. 
Search methods
We systematically searched CENTRAL, PubMed, and Embase via Elsevier for relevant published literature up to March 2021. We searched the online 'Studies within A Trial' (SWAT) repository, grey literature, and trial registries for ongoing or unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized or non‐randomized prospective, empirical evaluation studies of different monitoring strategies in one or more clinical intervention studies. We applied no restrictions for language or date of publication. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on the evaluated monitoring methods, countries involved, study population, study setting, randomization method, and numbers and proportions in each intervention group. Our primary outcome was critical and major monitoring findings in prospective intervention studies. Monitoring findings were classified according to different error domains (e.g. major eligibility violations) and the primary outcome measure was a composite of these domains. Secondary outcomes were individual error domains, participant recruitment and follow‐up, and resource use. If we identified more than one study for a comparison and outcome definitions were similar across identified studies, we quantitatively summarized effects in a meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model. Otherwise, we qualitatively summarized the results of eligible studies stratified by different comparisons of monitoring strategies. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for different groups of comparisons. 
Main results
We identified eight eligible studies, which we grouped into five comparisons.
1. Risk‐based versus extensive on‐site monitoring: based on two large studies, we found moderate certainty of evidence for the combined primary outcome of major or critical findings that risk‐based monitoring is not inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring. Although the risk ratio was close to 'no difference' (1.03 with a 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.81 to 1.33, below 1.0 in favor of the risk‐based strategy), the high imprecision in one study and the small number of eligible studies resulted in a wide CI of the summary estimate. Low certainty of evidence suggested that monitoring strategies with extensive on‐site monitoring were associated with considerably higher resource use and costs (up to a factor of 3.4). Data on recruitment or retention of trial participants were not available. 
2. Central monitoring with triggered on‐site visits versus regular on‐site visits: combining the results of two eligible studies yielded low certainty of evidence with a risk ratio of 1.83 (95% CI 0.51 to 6.55) in favor of triggered monitoring intervention. Data on recruitment, retention, and resource use were not available. 
3. Central statistical monitoring and local monitoring performed by site staff with annual on‐site visits versus central statistical monitoring and local monitoring only: based on one study, there was moderate certainty of evidence that a small number of major and critical findings were missed with the central monitoring approach without on‐site visits: 3.8% of participants in the group without on‐site visits and 6.4% in the group with on‐site visits had a major or critical monitoring finding (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.7; P = 0.03). The absolute number of monitoring findings was very low, probably because defined major and critical findings were very study specific and central monitoring was present in both intervention groups. Very low certainty of evidence did not suggest a relevant effect on participant retention, and very low‐quality evidence indicated an extra cost for on‐site visits of USD 2,035,392. There were no data on recruitment. 
4. Traditional 100% source data verification (SDV) versus targeted or remote SDV: the two studies assessing targeted and remote SDV reported findings only related to source documents. Compared to the final database obtained using the full SDV monitoring process, only a small proportion of remaining errors on overall data were identified using the targeted SDV process in the MONITORING study (absolute difference 1.47%, 95% CI 1.41% to 1.53%). Targeted SDV was effective in the verification of source documents but increased the workload on data management. The other included study was a pilot study which compared traditional on‐site SDV versus remote SDV and found little difference in monitoring findings and the ability to locate data values despite marked differences in remote access in two clinical trial networks. There were no data on recruitment or retention. 
5. Systematic on‐site initiation visit versus on‐site initiation visit upon request: very low certainty of evidence suggested no difference in retention and recruitment between the two approaches. There were no data on critical and major findings or on resource use. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence base is limited in terms of quantity and quality. Ideally, for each of the five identified comparisons, more prospective, comparative monitoring studies nested in clinical trials and measuring effects on all outcomes specified in this review are necessary to draw more reliable conclusions. However, the results suggesting risk‐based, targeted, and mainly central monitoring as an efficient strategy are promising. The development of reliable triggers for on‐site visits is ongoing; different triggers might be used in different settings. More evidence on risk indicators that identify sites with problems or the prognostic value of triggers is needed to further optimize central monitoring strategies. In particular, approaches with an initial assessment of trial‐specific risks that need to be closely monitored centrally during trial conduct with triggered on‐site visits should be evaluated in future research.

How best to check clinical trials: what works and what it costs

2. Rationale
Clinical trials test if health care helps and is safe. Trials must also guard your rights. Good checks, called “monitoring,” help do this. These checks look for big problems in trials. For example, they look for wrong data or harm.

There are many ways to monitor trials. One way sends staff to each clinic. This is “on‑site” work. Another way checks from a central office. This is “central” work. A third way uses risk. It aims checks at the places most likely to have problems. This is “risk‑based” work.

We need to know which way works best. We also need to know which way uses less time and money. This study looked at past research that compared these ways. The goal was to see the pros and cons of each way.

3. Trial Design
How is this study designed?
This was a review of several studies. The team searched many sources up to March 2021. They looked for studies that planned, in advance, to compare two or more monitoring ways. These studies took place inside active clinical trials. Some used random pick of methods. Some did not.

The studies covered trials in health care. The trials were in more than one country. Details on the age, health issue, or gender of trial patients were not given. Some study parts focused on trial data, not on patients.

The main result was big trial problems found by monitors. These include issues like wrong people in a trial, wrong doses, or missing safety checks. The team also looked at sign‑up, staying in the trial, and costs. The time a person stayed in each trial was not stated. When results were alike, the team added them across studies. When they were not, they summed them in words.

4. Results
What were the main results?
- Risk‑based vs many on‑site visits:
Two large studies found no clear gap in big problems found. In plain terms, risk‑based checks did not do worse. But we still have some doubt. The studies were few. Doing many on‑site visits used far more money. It cost up to about three times more. The studies did not tell us about sign‑up or staying in the trial.

- Central checks with visits only when “flags” appear vs regular on‑site visits:
Two studies looked at this. A “flag” is a warning sign in the data. It can be late data or odd trends. With flags, staff visit only when needed. The results may favor the “flag” plan. But the proof is weak. We are not very sure. The studies did not report costs, sign‑up, or staying in the trial.

- Central stats checks with local site checks and yearly on‑site visits vs the same without on‑site visits:
One study looked at this. Without on‑site visits, a small number of big issues were missed. The total number of big issues was very low in both plans. Both plans used strong central checks. Yearly visits added very high cost. This study found added costs of about two million US dollars. There was no report on sign‑up. There was no clear effect on staying in the trial.

- Check every data point on site (100% source data verification, or SDV) vs targeted or remote SDV:
Two studies looked at this. SDV means you match database facts to the original chart. Targeted SDV checks the most key facts, not every fact. One study found that targeted checks caught only a small share of the extra errors that full checks would find in all data. But targeted checks did work well when they looked at key charts. They also made more work for data staff. Another study tested remote SDV. It found little difference from on‑site SDV in what they could find. This was a small pilot. There was no report on sign‑up or staying in the trial.

- A start‑up on‑site visit at every site vs a start‑up visit only if asked:
One small study looked at this. There was no clear difference in sign‑up or staying in the trial. The study did not report on costs or big problems.

What does this mean for patients and trials?
The proof we have is still limited. The number of good, direct tests is small. The size of many studies was also small. So we should be careful with firm claims.

That said, the results give useful hints. Risk‑based plans seem to work as well as many on‑site visits. They may also save a lot of money and time. Central checks, with visits only when “flags” appear, may also work. But we need stronger proof. Central checks alone may miss a few big issues. Yet the number missed was very low in the study we have. Yearly on‑site visits cost a lot.

Checking every single data item on site may fix more small errors. But it takes more time and cost. Targeted checks focus on what matters most. Remote checks can work in some trial groups.

What do the researchers suggest next?
We need more good studies on this. These should test clear “flags” and risk signs. They should also track costs, sign‑up, and staying in the trial. A smart mix may be best. Start with a risk plan. Watch key risks from a central office. Use on‑site visits only when clear “flags” appear. This may keep people safe, protect rights, and use money well.","New monitoring strategies for clinical trials
Our question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of new monitoring strategies on monitoring findings, participant recruitment, participant follow‐up, and resource use in clinical trials. We also summarized the different components of tested strategies and qualitative evidence from process evaluations. 
Background 
Monitoring a clinical trial is important to ensure the safety of participants and the reliability of results. New methods have been developed for monitoring practices but further assessments of these new methods are needed to see if they do improve effectiveness without being inferior to established methods in terms of patient rights and safety, and quality assurance of trial results. We reviewed studies that examined this question within clinical trials, i.e. studies comparing different monitoring strategies used in clinical trials. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies which covered a variety of monitoring strategies in a wide range of clinical trials, including national and large international trials. They included primary (general), secondary (specialized), and tertiary (highly specialized) health care. The size of the studies ranged from 32 to 4371 participants at one to 196 sites. 
Key results 
We identified five comparisons. The first comparison of risk‐based monitoring versus extensive on‐site monitoring found no evidence that the risk‐based approach is inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring in terms of the proportion of participants with a critical or major monitoring finding not identified by the corresponding method, while resource use was three‐ to five‐fold higher with extensive on‐site monitoring. For the second comparison of central statistical monitoring with triggered on‐site visits versus regular (untriggered) on‐site visits, we found some evidence that central statistical monitoring can identify sites in need of support by an on‐site monitoring intervention. In the third comparison, the evaluation of adding an on‐site visit to local and central monitoring revealed a high percentage of participants with major or critical monitoring findings in the on‐site visit group, but low numbers of absolute monitoring findings in both groups. This means that without on‐site visits, some monitoring findings will be missed, but none of the missed findings had any serious impact on patient safety or the validity of the trial's results. In the fourth comparison, two studies assessed new source data verification processes, which are used to check that data recorded within the trial Case Report Form (CRF) match the primary source data (e.g. medical records), and reported little difference to full source data verification processes for the targeted as well as for the remote approach. In the fifth comparison, one study showed no difference in participant recruitment and participant follow‐up between a monitoring approach with systematic initiation visits versus an approach with initiation visits upon request by study sites. 
Certainty of evidence 
We are moderately certain that risk‐based monitoring is not inferior to extensive on‐site monitoring with respect to critical and major monitoring findings in clinical trials. For the remaining body of evidence, there is low or very low certainty in results due to imprecision, small number of studies, or high risk of bias. Ideally, for each of the five identified comparisons, more high‐quality monitoring studies that measure effects on all outcomes specified in this review are necessary to draw more reliable conclusions.

10.1002-14651858.CD013398.pub3,"Background
Despite being preventable, malaria remains an important public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that overall progress in malaria control has plateaued for the first time since the turn of the century. Researchers and policymakers are therefore exploring alternative and supplementary malaria vector control tools. Research in 1900 indicated that modification of houses may be effective in reducing malaria: this is now being revisited, with new research now examining blocking house mosquito entry points or modifying house construction materials to reduce exposure of inhabitants to infectious bites. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of house modifications on malaria disease and transmission.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CAB) Abstracts (Web of Science); and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS), up to 1 November 2019. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/) to identify ongoing trials up to the same date. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials, including cluster‐randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), cross‐over studies, and stepped‐wedge designs were eligible, as were quasi‐experimental trials, including controlled before‐and‐after studies, controlled interrupted time series, and non‐randomized cross‐over studies. We only considered studies reporting epidemiological outcomes (malaria case incidence, malaria infection incidence or parasite prevalence). We also summarised qualitative studies conducted alongside included studies. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used risk ratios (RR) to compare the effect of the intervention with the control for dichotomous data. For continuous data, we presented the mean difference; and for count and rate data, we used rate ratios. We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Six cRCTs met our inclusion criteria, all conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa; three randomized by household, two by village, and one at the community level. All trials assessed screening of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings or any combination of these; this was either alone, or in combination with eave closure, roof modification or eave tube installation (a ""lure and kill"" device that reduces mosquito entry whilst maintaining some airflow). In two trials, the interventions were insecticide‐based. In five trials, the researchers implemented the interventions. The community implemented the interventions in the sixth trial. 
At the time of writing the review, two of the six trials had published results, both of which compared screened houses (without insecticide) to unscreened houses. One trial in Ethiopia assessed screening of windows and doors. Another trial in the Gambia assessed full screening (screening of eaves, doors and windows), as well as screening of ceilings only. 
Screening may reduce clinical malaria incidence caused by Plasmodium falciparum (rate ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.82; 1 trial, 184 participants, 219.3 person‐years; low‐certainty evidence; Ethiopian study). For malaria parasite prevalence, the point estimate, derived from The Gambia study, was smaller (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.17; 713 participants, 1 trial; low‐certainty evidence), and showed an effect on anaemia (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42, 0.89; 705 participants; 1 trial, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Screening may reduce the entomological inoculation rate (EIR): both trials showed lower estimates in the intervention arm. In the Gambian trial, there was a mean difference in EIR between the control houses and treatment houses ranging from 0.45 to 1.50 (CIs ranged from ‐0.46 to 2.41; low‐certainty evidence), depending on the study year and treatment arm. The Ethiopian trial reported a mean difference in EIR of 4.57, favouring screening (95% CI 3.81 to 5.33; low‐certainty evidence). 
Pooled analysis of the trials showed that individuals living in fully screened houses were slightly less likely to sleep under a bed net (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.09; 2 trials, 203 participants). In one trial, bed net usage was also lower in individuals living in houses with screened ceilings (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95; 1 trial, 135 participants). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the two trials published to date, there is some evidence that screening may reduce malaria transmission and malaria infection in people living in the house. The four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base, and we will add these to this review when they become available.

Simple home fixes to keep out mosquitoes and lower malaria

Rationale
Malaria is still a big problem for many people. It can cause fever, tiredness, and anemia, which is low blood in the body. It can make school and work hard. It can lead to death.

Progress to stop malaria has slowed in recent years. Many people use bed nets and spraying. These help, but they are not enough by themselves. New tools can add more protection.

Mosquitoes enter homes through doors, windows, gaps, and eaves. Eaves are the open space under the roof. Screens and other home fixes can block these entry points. Fewer mosquitoes in homes may mean fewer bites. That may mean fewer malaria cases.

This review looked at home changes that keep mosquitoes out. The main idea: if we block how mosquitoes get in, we can reduce malaria. These changes may last for years and do not depend on daily use.

Trial Design
This was a careful review of past studies. The team searched many medical libraries up to early November of 2019. They looked for fair tests that picked groups by chance. They also looked for strong before-and-after studies.

The review found six trials. All were in sub-Saharan Africa. In three trials, the team assigned by house. In two trials, they assigned by village. In one trial, they assigned by community.

All trials tested some form of screening. This means adding netting to doors, windows, eaves, or ceilings. Some trials also closed eaves, changed roofs, or used eave tubes. Eave tubes are small pipes in the eaves that lure and kill mosquitoes. Two trials used insecticide in the fix. The others did not.

In five trials, research teams put in the home fixes. In one trial, the local community did the work. People who took part were those living in the homes. The abstract did not give their ages or gender. The abstract did not say how long each person stayed in the study.

At the time of this review, only two of the six trials had published results. One was in Ethiopia. It tested screens on windows and doors. One was in The Gambia. It tested full screening of eaves, doors, and windows. It also tested screened ceilings only. Both of these trials used no insecticide in the screening.

Results
The Ethiopia trial found fewer malaria illnesses in screened homes. This means fewer people got sick with malaria where homes had screens. That study had 184 people who gave results.

The Gambia trial had 713 people who gave results. In that trial, people in screened homes had fewer signs of anemia. Anemia is low blood. It can make people weak and short of breath. This finding matters because malaria often causes anemia.

The Gambia trial also tested for malaria parasites in the blood. It was not clear if screening reduced these tests by a lot. The numbers hinted at benefit, but the change was small.

Both trials looked at how many infected mosquito bites happened. In screened homes, fewer infected bites occurred. This supports the main idea. If we block mosquitoes from entering, people get fewer risky bites.

The review also looked at bed net use. In homes with full screening, people tended to use nets less. The same was true in homes with screened ceilings in one trial. This could reduce the good effects of screening. Nets still protect from bites. People should keep using nets, even with screened homes.

What does this mean? These two trials show that screening can help. It may lower malaria illness. It may also lower anemia. It likely cuts the number of infected bites. These are important results for families and for public health.

But we need more proof. Four more trials had not yet shared their results. Those results will add to what we know. The current proof is early, and not yet strong. It points in the right direction, but it is not final.

Why is this relevant? Malaria control needs more tools. Home screening can be part of a mix with nets and spraying. It can fit in many settings. It does not need people to act every night. It can work in homes built with many types of materials.

In short, simple home fixes can help keep out mosquitoes. They may lower malaria and anemia. People should still use bed nets. More trials will tell us more. Researchers will update this review when those results are out.","House modifications for preventing malaria
What is the aim of this review? 
House modifications, such as screening (covering potential house entry points for mosquitoes with netting or mesh), or the use of alternative construction materials, may contribute to reducing the burden of malaria. They work by blocking mosquitoes from entering houses, and reducing the number of bites householders receive indoors. Some of the house modifications under consideration additionally aim to kill any mosquitoes that attempt to enter houses by incorporating insecticide into the modification. 
Key messages 
Screening windows, doors, eaves and ceilings to prevent mosquitoes entering the house may reduce malaria transmission and illness in people living in the house, based on evidence from two studies conducted in Africa. Four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base. 
What was studied in the review? 
This review summarized studies investigating the effects of house modifications on human malaria outcomes. If studies additionally reported the effect of the house modifications on mosquitoes (those with potential to carry malaria), or householders' views, we also summarized this data. After searching for relevant studies, we identified six studies conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa, two of which have published data, and four of which are not yet in the public domain. All trials assessed screening (of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings, or any combination of these), either alone or in combination with eave closure, roof modification, or eave tube installation (a ""lure and kill"" device positioned in eave gaps). 
What are the main results of the review? 
The two trials with published data assessed the effect of screening alone on malaria infection. Both trials showed a reduction in malaria in screened houses, to varying degrees of effect. One trial in Ethiopia showed that people living in screened houses were around 62% less likely to experience an episode of clinical malaria (caused by P falciparum). However, the certainty of this evidence was low due to issues with the study design, and the trial did not study enough people for us to be confident about the results. Another trial in The Gambia showed that people living in screened houses were around 16% less likely to have P falciparum malaria parasites in their blood, and were less likely to experience anaemia. Our confidence in this result was low because the trial did not study enough people. 
How up to date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies available up to 1 November 2019.

Background 
Dementia due to Alzheimer’s and other diseases is a leading cause of disability and an enormous health and societal problem. More than 40 million people in the world currently live with dementia, and this number is expected to increase to more than 115 million by the year 2050. Effective treatments to reduce the burden of dementia are urgently needed. Cognitive training (CT) is a non‐pharmacological form of treatment that focuses on guided practice on tasks that target specific cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, or problem‐solving. Whether CT can help people with mild to moderate dementia maintain or improve their thinking, well‐being, and general functioning remains unclear. 
Main findings 
We analysed data from 33 studies of CT that included a total of approximately 2000 participants and were conducted in 12 countries. We found that, compared with receiving usual treatment or engaging in non‐specific activities, people completing CT may show some benefits in overall cognition, as well as in more specific cognitive abilities such as verbal fluency, and that improvements may last for at least a few months. We did not find any evidence that participating in CT was associated with increased burden for participants. However, we also found no evidence that CT was better than participating in other active treatments. 
Limitations of this review 
The quality of the studies we reviewed varied but overall was not very high, so our certainty in some of these findings is low. Future studies should continue improving on quality, should continue comparing CT with other treatments, and should follow participants for a longer period to understand whether observed benefits for cognition last beyond the short or medium term.

Do brain exercises help people with mild to moderate dementia?

Rationale
Dementia harms memory and clear thought. It can also change mood and day life. It gets worse over time. It is a hard problem for many people and families.

Over 40 million people now live with dementia. By 2050, that number may pass 115 million. This shows a large and growing need. We need more ways to help.

Drugs can help some people. But drugs may not help enough. People also want safe, low cost care.

Cognitive training is a set of brain exercises. A coach or program guides the work. Tasks can build memory, focus, or problem solving. These tasks may help the brain work better.

The idea is simple. Practice can build skills. It may help people keep skills for longer. It may also help with finding words and daily tasks.

This study asked a key question. Do these brain exercises help people who have mild to moderate dementia? The team also asked if gains can last for a while. They also checked if the work adds strain.

Trial Design
This was a review of many studies. The team looked at 33 studies. These studies took place in 12 countries. About 2,000 people took part.

All the people had mild to moderate dementia. The abstract did not list ages or sex. People got brain exercises. They also got regular care or other simple activities.

Some studies also used other active programs. The team then compared results. The abstract did not say how long each study lasted. It did note that some gains lasted a few months.

The team looked at clear thought and word use. They looked at daily life and well-being when they could. They checked if people felt more strain. They also looked at how strong each study was.

Results
The review found a few clear points. Brain exercises may help with clear thought. They may also help with word finding. These gains may last for a few months.

People who did brain exercises did not show more strain. The work did not seem to add harm. This is good news for safety. It means the work is likely safe to try.

Brain exercises did better than regular care or simple activities. People who trained did a bit better in thinking. They also did a bit better at finding words. But the gains were not large.

When brain exercises were matched with other active programs, results were mixed. The team did not see brain exercises clearly win. In those matchups, no one method stood out. This means we still do not know which active method is best.

The team also warned us to be careful. Study quality was not strong in many cases. This lowers how sure we can be. The results may change with better studies.

This work still matters. It shows a low risk way that may help the brain. It may help some people keep skills for a while. That can help daily life and mood.

What does this mean for people with dementia? Brain exercises may help you think a bit more clearly. They may help you find words a bit faster. Gains may last months, not years. The work seems safe for most people.

What does this mean for the field? We need better, longer studies. We need to test brain exercises against other strong methods. We should track people for more time.

Future studies should also use clear plans. They should include more people. They should report ages and sex. They should measure daily life and mood, not just tests.

In short, brain exercises may help a bit. They seem safe and easy to use. But we still need better proof. Your care team can help you decide if this fits your goals.","Cognitive training for people with mild to moderate dementia
Background 
Dementia due to Alzheimer’s and other diseases is a leading cause of disability and an enormous health and societal problem.

10.1002-14651858.CD001218.pub3,"Acupuncture for preventing migraine attacks
Bottom line 
The available evidence suggests that a course of acupuncture consisting of at least six treatment sessions can be a valuable option for people with migraine. 
Background 
Individuals with migraine have repeated attacks of severe headache, usually just on one side and often with vomiting. Acupuncture is a therapy in which thin needles are inserted into the skin at particular points. It originated in China, and is now used in many countries to treat people with migraine. We evaluated whether acupuncture reduces the number of episodes of migraine. We looked at the number of people in whom the number of migraine days per month was reduced by half or more than half. 
Key results 
For this update, we reviewed 22 trials with 4985 people, published up to January 2016. We omitted five trials from the original review because they included people who had had migraine for less than 12 months. We included five new trials in this update. 
In four trials, acupuncture added to usual care or treatment of migraine on onset only (usually with pain‐killers) resulted in 41 in 100 people having the frequency of headaches at least halved, compared to 17 of 100 people given usual care only. 
In 15 trials, acupuncture was compared with 'fake' acupuncture, where needles are inserted at incorrect points or do not penetrate the skin. The frequency of headaches halved in 50 of 100 people receiving true acupuncture, compared with 41 of 100 people receiving 'fake' acupuncture. The results were dominated by three good quality large trials (with about 1200 people) showing that the effect of true acupuncture was still present after six months. There were no differences in the number of side effects of real and 'fake' acupuncture, or the numbers dropping out because of side effects. 
In five trials, acupuncture was compared to a drug proven to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, but only three trials provided useful information. At three months, headache frequency halved in 57 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 46 of 100 people taking the drug. After six months, headache frequency halved in 59 of 100 people receiving acupuncture, compared with 54 of 100 people taking the drug. People receiving acupuncture reported side effects less often than people receiving drugs, and were less likely to drop out of the trial. 
Our findings about the number of days with migraine per month can be summarized as follows. If people have six days with migraine per month on average before starting treatment, this would be reduced to five days in people receiving only usual care, to four days in those receiving fake acupuncture or a prophylactic drug, and to three and a half days in those receiving true acupuncture. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall the quality of the evidence was moderate.

Acupuncture to Help Prevent Migraine Attacks

Rationale
Migraine is bad head pain. It can be on one side. It can make you feel sick or throw up. These attacks can last hours or days. They can stop work, school, or fun.

Many people take a pain pill when an attack starts. Some take a drug each day to try to stop attacks. These drugs can help. But they can also cause side effects. Side effects are unwanted signs or harms from a drug.

Acupuncture is a type of care from China. A trained person puts thin pins in the skin at set spots. This may change how the brain and nerves sense pain. Many people use it for head pain.

The big question is this: Can acupuncture cut the number of migraine days? The idea was that it could cut the days by half in many people. We also ask if it is safe. We need this study to guide choice of care.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. The team looked at 22 trials with 4,985 people. The trials were in print up to January 2016. The trials looked at three main match ups. These were acupuncture plus usual care, acupuncture vs fake acupuncture, and acupuncture vs a proven drug.

The people in the trials had migraine. The team left out five trials that had people with migraine for less than 12 months. The age and sex of the people are not in this text. The trials took place in many places.

The trials used a course of care. A useful course had at least six sessions. People were then watched for three to six months. This let the team see if gains last.

Results
Here is what the team found. When people got acupuncture plus usual care, more people did well. In this group, 41 in 100 had half the head pain days or less. With usual care alone, 17 in 100 did that well. Usual care was most often a pain pill at the start of an attack.

Next, the team looked at true vs fake acupuncture. Fake means pins at wrong spots. Or the pins did not go in the skin. With true acupuncture, 50 in 100 had half the head pain days or less. With fake care, 41 in 100 did that well. Three large and good trials led this result. The gain with true care was still there at six months.

Now, let us look at acupuncture vs a proven drug. At three months, 57 in 100 people on acupuncture did well. In the drug group, 46 in 100 did well. At six months, 59 in 100 on acupuncture did well. In the drug group, 54 in 100 did well. So acupuncture worked at least as well as the drug.

Side effects matter to people. With true vs fake acupuncture, side effects were much the same. The number who had to stop care was also much the same. When we look at acupuncture vs a drug, a new point shows up. People on acupuncture had side effects less often than those on the drug. They were also less likely to stop the trial.

The team also looked at the count of days with migraine. Think of a person who has six days of migraine each month. With usual care alone, that went down to five days. With fake acupuncture or a daily drug, that went down to four days. With true acupuncture, that went down to three and a half days. That is a clear drop in days with pain.

How strong is the proof? The team rated the proof as moderate. This means the results are fairly sure. Still, more good trials could help.

What does this mean for you? A course of at least six sessions of acupuncture can help. It can cut days with pain. It can help more people reach half as many head pain days. It can work as well as some daily drugs. It can have fewer side effects than those drugs.

This study is key for people with migraine. It gives a real choice for care. It also helps doctors plan care with you. If you think about this option, talk with your doctor. Ask about a trained and licensed acupuncturist. Bring your list of drugs and health needs. Share what matters most to you.

In short, acupuncture is a sound choice for many people with migraine. It can be part of your plan to help stop attacks. It may ease pain with few harms. More studies can add to what we know. But the facts we have now are strong enough to guide care.","Acupuncture for preventing migraine attacks

10.1002-14651858.CD013381.pub2,"Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung condition characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and limited lung airflow, dyspnoea and recurrent exacerbations. Suboptimal therapy or non‐adherence may result in limited effectiveness of pharmacological treatments and subsequently poor health outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of interventions intended to improve adherence to single or combined pharmacological treatments compared with usual care or interventions that are not intended to improve adherence in people with COPD. 
Search methods
We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase (search date 1 May 2020). We also searched web‐based clinical trial registers. 
Selection criteria
RCTs included adults with COPD diagnosed by established criteria (e.g. Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease). Interventions included change to pharmacological treatment regimens, adherence aids, education, behavioural or psychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy), communication or follow‐up by a health professional (e.g. telephone, text message or face‐to‐face), multi‐component interventions, and interventions to improve inhaler technique. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Working in pairs, four review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We assessed confidence in the evidence for each primary outcome using GRADE. Primary outcomes were adherence, quality of life and hospital service utilisation. Adherence measures included the Adherence among Patients with Chronic Disease questionnaire (APCD). Quality of life measures included the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ). 
Main results
We included 14 trials (2191 participants) in the analysis with follow‐up ranging from six to 52 weeks. Age ranged from 54 to 75 years, and COPD severity ranged from mild to very severe. Trials were conducted in the USA, Spain, Germany, Japan, Jordan, Northern Ireland, Iran, South Korea, China and Belgium. Risk of bias was high due to lack of blinding. Evidence certainty was downgraded due to imprecision and small participant numbers. 
Single component interventions 
Six studies (55 to 212 participants) reported single component interventions including changes to pharmacological treatment (different roflumilast doses or different inhaler types), adherence aids (Bluetooth inhaler reminder device), educational (comprehensive verbal instruction), behavioural or psychological (motivational interview). 
Change in dose of roflumilast may result in little to no difference in adherence (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.99; studies = 1, participants = 55; low certainty). A Bluetooth inhaler reminder device did not improve adherence, but comprehensive verbal instruction from a health professional did improve mean adherence (prescription refills) (mean difference (MD) 1.00, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.54). Motivational interview improved mean adherence scores on the APCD scale (MD 22.22, 95% CI 8.42 to 36.02). 
Use of a single inhaler compared to two separate inhalers may have little to no impact on quality of life (SGRQ; MD 0.80, 95% CI –3.12 to 4.72; very low certainty). A Bluetooth inhaler monitoring device may provide a small improvement in quality of life on the CCQ (MD 0.40, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.73; very low certainty). 
Single inhaler use may have little to no impact on the number of people admitted to hospital compared to two separate inhalers (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.90; very low certainty). Single component interventions may have little to no impact on the number of people expereincing adverse events (very low certainty evidence from studies of a change in pharmacotherapy or use of adherence aids). A change in pharmacotherapy may have little to no impact on exacerbations or deaths (very low certainty). 
Multi‐component interventions 
Eight studies (30 to 734 participants) reported multi‐component interventions including tailored care package that included adherence support as a key component or included inhaler technique as a component. 
A multi‐component intervention may result in more people adhering to pharmacotherapy compared to control at 40.5 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.37, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.59; studies = 4, participants = 446; I2 = 0%; low certainty). 
There may be little to no impact on quality of life (SGRQ, Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire, CAT) (studies = 3; low to very low certainty). 
Multi‐component interventions may help to reduce the number of people admitted to hospital for any cause (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.63; studies = 2, participants = 877; low certainty), or COPD‐related hospitalisations (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.34; studies = 2, participants = 220; moderate certainty). There may be a small benefit on people experiencing severe exacerbations. 
There may be little to no effect on adverse events, serious adverse events or deaths, but events were infrequently reported and were rare (low to very low certainty). 
Authors' conclusions
Single component interventions (e.g. education or motivational interviewing provided by a health professional) can help to improve adherence to pharmacotherapy (low to very low certainty). There were slight improvements in quality of life with a Bluetooth inhaler device, but evidence is from one study and very low certainty. Change to pharmacotherapy (e.g. single inhaler instead of two, or different doses of roflumilast) has little impact on hospitalisations or exacerbations (very low certainty). There is no difference in people experiencing adverse events (all‐cause or COPD‐related), or deaths (very low certainty). 
Multi‐component interventions may improve adherence with education, motivational or behavioural components delivered by health professionals (low certainty). There is little to no impact on quality of life (low to very low certainty). They may help reduce the number of people admitted to hospital overall (specifically pharmacist‐led approaches) (low certainty), and fewer people may have COPD‐related hospital admissions (moderately certainty). There may be a small reduction in people experiencing severe exacerbations, but evidence is from one study (low certainty). Limited evidence found no difference in people experiencing adverse events, serious adverse events or deaths (low to very low certainty). 
The evidence presented should be interpreted with caution. Larger studies with more intervention types, especially single interventions, are needed. It is unclear which specific COPD subgroups would benefit, therefore discussions between health professionals and patients may help to determine whether they will help to improve health outcomes.

Ways to help people with COPD take their medicine

Rationale
COPD is long-term lung disease. It makes it hard to breathe. People may cough, wheeze, and feel tight in the chest. Bad days, called flare-ups, can send people to the hospital.

Medicine can help. Inhalers and pills can ease breath and cut flare-ups. But many people do not take them as the doctor plans. They may forget doses or use the device the wrong way. This can lead to worse health.

This review asked a clear question. Do tools or support help people take COPD drugs on time and the right way? If so, do people feel better? Do they go to the hospital less? The team also looked at safety.

Taking drugs as planned may help a lot. Good use can help lungs work better and calm swelling. Better use may mean fewer bad days. That may mean fewer trips to the hospital.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. In each trial, people were put into groups by chance. One group got usual care. The other group got care to help them take their drugs. The team then checked how people did.

The review found 14 trials. In total, 2,191 adults took part. Ages ranged from 54 to 75 years. People had mild to very bad COPD. The trials took place in many countries.

People were in a trial for about 6 to 52 weeks. Some trials tested one step, like a new device or a talk. Other trials used a care plan with many steps. The steps could include clear teach-back, a coach call, home or clinic check-ins, help with inhaler use, or a drug plan review.

The one-step trials tested things like a new pill dose, one inhaler instead of two, a blue-tooth reminder device, a clear teach session, or a coach talk to build drive. The many-step trials often used a set plan led by a nurse or a drug expert. Most plans had teach time and follow-up.

Results
First, the team looked at “adherence.” This means taking drugs as the doctor sets. It also means using the inhaler the right way and on time.

One-step help did work in some cases. A clear teach session from a health pro helped people fill scripts on time. A coach talk that built drive also helped people take drugs. A blue-tooth device did not help people take drugs more often.

Swapping two inhalers for one did not change how people felt day to day. A new dose of a COPD pill did not change how well people stuck to the plan. These changes also did not change trips to the hospital.

Many-step care plans helped more people stick to their drug plan. More people took drugs on time in those plans. Plans that had teach time and follow-up seemed to work best. A plan led by a drug expert often helped.

These many-step plans did not change day to day life by much. People’s scores on “how I feel” tests were about the same. But there was a clear gain in some key health events.

Fewer people went to the hospital with the many-step plans. This was true for any cause. It was also true for COPD-linked stays. In some trials, far fewer people had a COPD stay. A few trials also saw fewer bad flare-ups that needed strong care.

Side effects did not change with these plans. Serious harms were rare. Deaths did not change. But not all trials tracked harms well.

What does this mean for you? Help that is simple and clear can help you take your drugs. This may be a short teach talk or a coach chat. A plan that blends teach time, checks on inhaler use, and follow-up may help even more. These plans may keep you out of the hospital.

Not all tools worked. A phone-linked reminder on the inhaler did not help much. A switch to one inhaler, or a pill dose change, did not change key outcomes. Your needs may be unique. What helps one person may not help the next.

How sure are we? Many trials were small. Some did not hide group choice from staff. This can skew results. So we must be careful with the size of the effect. The trends are clear, but the exact size is less sure.

What should patients do now? Ask your care team for teach time on your inhaler. Ask them to watch you use it. Plan follow-up by phone or in the clinic. Ask if a nurse or a drug expert can help make a simple plan. Bring your goals and main fears to the talk. Share what gets in your way at home.

What should doctors do now? Keep care simple. Use teach-back. Offer follow-up. Use team care with nurses and drug experts. Pick the tools that fit the person and their life.

Bottom line: Clear, human help can make it easier to take COPD drugs. A care plan with teach time and follow-up may keep more people out of the hospital. Harms did not go up. We still need larger trials to learn who will gain the most. In the meantime, ask for the help you need, and make a plan together.","Which approaches help people with COPD to maintain taking medication as prescribed?
Review question 
Which approaches help people maintain taking prescribed medication(s), improve quality of life and reduce hospital admissions in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? 
Background 
COPD is a lung condition that can cause long‐term breathing problems and includes symptoms such as shortness of breath. Medications do exist that can help but sometimes people do not take them as prescribed. Different approaches could help people to take their medication as prescribed and help improve symptoms or quality of life and reduce hospital admissions. 
We wanted to find out if any approaches could help people with COPD take their medication(s) as prescribed. 
Studies identified and selected 
We searched databases to find the studies. Four people working in pairs looked at the lists of studies separately and agreed on which ones were included. The latest search for studies was conducted in May 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We included studies comparing simple ways to help improve medication use (e.g. different medication doses or single inhalers instead of two separate inhalers) to usual COPD care. We also included studies that tested combination approaches (e.g. information or training from nurses or pharmacists and monitoring medication use). 
What were the key results? 
We included 14 studies (2191 people) in our analysis. No studies were masked (people knew whether they were receiving an approach to help them with adherence or the alternative). Six studies used simple approaches (e.g. change to medication dosage, change to type of inhaler, or a Bluetooth inhaler reminder device), and eight studies used combined approaches (e.g. nurses or pharmacists giving advice or information about how to improve medication use). 
We were uncertain about the effects of a different medication dose on people adhering to medication because it was no different to usual care (one study). Two separate studies found that a Bluetooth inhaler reminder device or a change in oral medication dose did not help to improve adherence. Health professionals involved in giving information may help to improve adherence (one study). This was measured by prescription refills. Motivating people to change their behaviour could help to improve adherence their medication (one study). This was measured by people completing a questionnaire about adherence to their medication. 
One study found that a Bluetooth inhaler device might help to improve quality of life. There may be little to no difference between those using single inhalers in the number of people admitted to hospital compared to those using two separate inhalers (one study). We found no difference between single approaches and usual care on the number of people who had side effects. 
Combined approaches may help to improve the number of people taking their medication, but we were not confident of this finding (four studies). They may have little to no impact on quality of life (three studies). Combined approaches could be beneficial in reducing the number of people with COPD admitted to hospital for any reason or because of COPD symptoms (two studies). 
There was no difference between combined approaches and in the number of people who had adverse events. 
Take home message 
We could not say for certain that simple approaches are useful to help people with COPD to improve medication use because of very limited information. Combined approaches may help people to take their medication(s) as prescribed and can help to reduce the number of people admitted to hospital, however, more information is needed to help answer this question with confidence.

10.1002-14651858.CD013581,"Anti‐inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain
Review question 
We examined the effect of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen, for people with acute low back pain. Acute low back pain is defined as the presence of pain in the back, below the ribs and above the buttocks, for under 12 weeks. We compared NSAIDs to placebo, paracetamol, other NSAIDs, other drugs, and non‐drug treatments. 
Background 
Acute low back pain is common, and causes pain and disability. Physicians often prescribe NSAIDs to treat acute low back pain. Different types of NSAIDs are available, both over‐the‐counter and as prescription drugs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials that were published or registered before 7 January 2020. We included 32 trials with 5356 participants. Trial participants were 16 to 78 years old and had acute low back pain. Study length varied from one day to six months. The studies took place in many different countries. More than half of the studies was done in Europe and North‐America. 
Key results 
NSAIDs were slightly more effective than placebo for pain reduction in the first three weeks. On average, the pain intensity decreased by 7.3 points on a 100‐point scale. This means there was a small difference between the two treatments, but it was not clinically relevant. People receiving NSAIDs also scored 2.0 points better on a 24‐point disability scale than those receiving placebo. This is unlikely to be of real‐world benefit. There was a similar number of side effects between people receiving NSAIDs and people receiving placebo. However, the type of studies that we investigated are not designed to find side effects. Therefore, we should be careful about drawing conclusions based upon these findings. 
We also compared two different types of NSAIDs; non‐selective NSAIDs versus COX‐2 inhibitors. We found no clear differences in effect. There was also a similar number of reported side effects of the digestive system, such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, or stomach symptoms. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing short‐term pain, and high quality evidence that they are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing disability in acute low back pain. The magnitude of the effect is very small. 
","Plain Title
Do common anti‑inflammatory pain pills help new low back pain?

Rationale
New low back pain is very common. It can make it hard to sit, walk, or work. The pain can last up to 12 weeks. Many people want quick and safe relief.

Doctors often give anti‑inflammatory pain pills for this pain. These are called NSAIDs. They include ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac. These drugs lower swelling and pain, so they may help.

But we need to know how well they work. We also need to know if the help is big enough to matter. This study asked if NSAIDs help more than dummy pills. It also asked which type of NSAID helps more.

Trial Design
This was not one trial. It was a review of many fair tests. In fair tests, people join by choice. A chance method puts them into groups.

The team looked for trials up to early 2020. They found 32 trials. In total, 5356 people took part. The trials took place in many lands.

All people had new low back pain. Their pain was under 12 weeks. People were 16 to 78 years old. Both men and women joined.

Each trial ran for a short or long time. Time in a trial ranged from one day to six months. More than half of the trials were in Europe and North America. The drugs tested were over‑the‑counter or by script.

The trials compared NSAIDs to many things. These were dummy pills with no drug, called placebo. They also compared to paracetamol, a common pain pill. Some trials compared one NSAID to another NSAID.

Results
NSAIDs helped a little more than placebo in the short term. This was in the first three weeks. Pain went down by about 7 points on a 0 to 100 scale. This is a small change.

Daily limits also got a bit better with NSAIDs than with placebo. The change was about 2 points on a 0 to 24 scale. This is also a small change. It may not be felt in day to day life.

The review also looked at two NSAID types. One group was the usual, called non‑selective. The other group was COX‑2 drugs. These aim to be easier on the stomach.

The review found no clear winner between these types. Pain and daily limits were much the same. Stomach side effects were also about the same. These side effects include belly pain, nausea, and loose stool.

Side effects were similar between NSAIDs and placebo in these trials. But these trials were not built to find all side effects. So we must be careful with this point. Rare harms may not show up in such trials.

What do these results mean for you? NSAIDs may give small, short‑term pain relief. They may also ease daily limits by a small amount. But the size of the help is small.

For many people, that small help may not feel worth it. Some may still choose to try them. Some may not. It is a personal choice based on goals and risk.

The quality of proof was moderate for pain. It was high for daily limits. This means we can trust these results to a fair or high degree. Still, the help seen was small.

This review matters for care. It shows that NSAIDs are not a strong fix for new back pain. They can help a little. But they do not give large relief.

Talk with your doctor about your needs and risks. Share what matters most to you. You can also ask about other choices. Some non‑drug care may help and is safe.

In sum, here is the bottom line. NSAIDs give small, short‑term help for new low back pain. They do not seem better than each other. Side effects in these trials looked much the same as placebo. Larger, longer, and safer tests are still needed.","Anti‐inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain
Review question 
We examined the effect of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen, for people with acute low back pain. Acute low back pain is defined as the presence of pain in the back, below the ribs and above the buttocks, for under 12 weeks. We compared NSAIDs to placebo, paracetamol, other NSAIDs, other drugs, and non‐drug treatments. 
Background 
Acute low back pain is common, and causes pain and disability. Physicians often prescribe NSAIDs to treat acute low back pain. Different types of NSAIDs are available, both over‐the‐counter and as prescription drugs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials that were published or registered before 7 January 2020. We included 32 trials with 5356 participants. Trial participants were 16 to 78 years old and had acute low back pain. Study length varied from one day to six months. The studies took place in many different countries. More than half of the studies was done in Europe and North‐America. 
Key results 
NSAIDs were slightly more effective than placebo for pain reduction in the first three weeks. On average, the pain intensity decreased by 7.3 points on a 100‐point scale. This means there was a small difference between the two treatments, but it was not clinically relevant. People receiving NSAIDs also scored 2.0 points better on a 24‐point disability scale than those receiving placebo. This is unlikely to be of real‐world benefit. There was a similar number of side effects between people receiving NSAIDs and people receiving placebo. However, the type of studies that we investigated are not designed to find side effects. Therefore, we should be careful about drawing conclusions based upon these findings. 
We also compared two different types of NSAIDs; non‐selective NSAIDs versus COX‐2 inhibitors. We found no clear differences in effect. There was also a similar number of reported side effects of the digestive system, such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea, or stomach symptoms. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing short‐term pain, and high quality evidence that they are slightly more effective than placebo for reducing disability in acute low back pain. The magnitude of the effect is very small.

10.1002-14651858.CD008819.pub4,"Wearing stockings to provide compression for the treatment of varicose veins
Review question 
What is the effectiveness of compression stockings as the only and initial treatment of varicose veins in people without healed or active venous ulceration (leg ulcers)? 
Background 
Varicose veins are widened veins that twist and turn and are visible under the skin of the legs. They generally do not cause medical problems, although many people seek medical advice. Symptoms may include pain, ankle swelling, tired legs, restless legs, night cramps, heaviness, itching and distress from their cosmetic appearance. Complications such as oedema (build‐up of fluid), pigmentation, inflammation (swelling, redness and pain) and ulceration (sores) can also develop. Compression stockings are often the first line of treatment and come in a variety of lengths from knee‐length to full tights, and apply different pressures to support the flow of blood in the veins. 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 studies involving 1021 participants with varicose veins who had not experienced venous ulceration in this review (search run May 2020). Five studies assessed compression stocking versus no compression stocking (for example no treatment or placebo stocking with no graduated elastic). Three of these studies used knee‐length stockings, one used full‐length stockings and one used full tights. Eight studies compared different types or pressures of knee‐length stockings. The stockings used in the studies exerted different levels of pressure. One study included only pregnant women, while other studies included people who had sought medical intervention for their varicose veins by being on surgical waiting lists, or attending vascular surgery or dermatology (skin care) clinics or outpatient departments. 
Key results 
Participants considered their symptoms had improved when stockings were worn in the nine studies that assessed this outcome, but these assessments were not always made by comparing one treatment group of the trial with a control group in the same study and was therefore subject to bias. 
Two studies comparing stockings with placebo stockings measured physical signs; there was no clear difference between baseline and follow‐up for ankle circumference, while oedema was reduced in the stocking group compared with the placebo stocking group. Generally there were no clear differences between studies comparing two types of stockings for volume reduction and change in diameter (ways to measure oedema). 
Complications or side effects ranged from sweating, itching, irritation, skin dryness and a feeling of tightness. There were no severe or long‐lasting side effects. 
Two studies comparing stockings with different stockings, and four studies comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed compliance (whether the person used the stockings as directed). In the stocking versus different stocking studies, there was no clear difference between the stockings, with generally low levels of compliance reported. In the stocking versus placebo/no treatment group, three studies reported results. Of these, one study reported a high initial dropout rate with generally low levels of compliance. The other two studies reported generally good compliance in the stocking group. Some reasons provided for non‐compliance included discomfort, difficulty in putting the stockings on, appearance, not being effective and causing irritation. 
Four studies that compared stockings with different stockings and two studies that compared stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed comfort, tolerance and acceptability of stockings. Comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment, comfort, tolerance and acceptability was affected by the study population. Compression tights were increasingly rejected by pregnant women as their pregnancy progressed, while in a study of non‐pregnant women, the stockings group showed no more hindrance of normal activities and daytime discomfort when compared with placebo stockings. In the stocking versus different stockings studies, two studies reported similar levels of tolerance and discomfort between the types of stocking. Discomfort was the main reason for indicating a preference for one type of stocking over another. 
One study assessed quality of life, showing no clear differences between the stocking and no stocking groups. 
No conclusions regarding the optimum length or pressure of compression stockings could be made as there were no conclusive results from the included studies.  
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence was low or very low because of risk of bias due to poor reporting, not all studies assessed the same outcomes, they assessed them in different ways, or reported them in a way that they could be combined and analysed with other studies. Evidence from available trials is not sufficient to determine if compression stockings as the only and initial treatment are effective in managing and treating varicose veins in the early stages. 
","Plain Title
Do compression stockings help with varicose veins?

Rationale
Varicose veins are wide, twisted veins you can see under the skin.
They often show on the legs.
They can ache or feel heavy.
Legs may swell, itch, or cramp at night.
Some people feel upset about how their legs look.

In time, other problems can start.
These include skin color change, skin pain, and leg sores.
Leg sores are also called ulcers.
Many people try compression stockings first.
These stockings squeeze the legs to help blood move back to the heart.

Doctors use them a lot.
But we need to know how well they work on their own.
This study asked a key question.
Do stockings, as the first and only treatment, help varicose veins?
The idea was that the squeeze may ease symptoms and swelling.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies.
The team looked for all good trials up to May 2020.
They found 13 studies with 1,021 people.
All had varicose veins.
None had leg sores that were open or had healed.

Five studies compared stockings to no stockings or fake stockings.
A fake stocking looks real but does not squeeze.
Eight studies compared one type of stocking to another.
Most studies used knee-high stockings.
Some used thigh-high stockings or full tights.

Stockings had different squeeze levels.
One study was only in pregnant women.
Other studies were in adults who sought care.
Some were on a surgery wait list.
Others went to vein or skin clinics.

Ages and genders were not fully listed in the abstract.
Time in each study was not clear in the abstract.
So we cannot say how long each person took part.
The review used what each study reported.
The team then summed up what they found.

Results
Many people felt better when they wore stockings.
Nine studies asked people about their symptoms.
People said pain and heaviness eased with use.
But not all of these were fair head‑to‑head tests.
So the findings may not be strong.

Two studies used fake stockings as a match.
They checked ankle size and swelling.
Ankle size did not change in a clear way.
But swelling from fluid, called edema, did improve with real stockings.
This suggests stockings can reduce fluid build‑up.

Some studies compared two kinds of stockings.
They looked at leg volume and vein width.
These are ways to measure swelling.
Across these tests, no clear winner stood out.
One type or squeeze was not better than others.

Side effects did occur.
People noted sweat, itch, or skin sting.
Some had dry skin or a tight feel.
No one had severe or lasting harm from stockings.
This is useful for safety.

How often people wore the stockings varied.
Some used them as told.
Others did not.
In studies that compared two kinds, use was often low.
No clear use difference showed between those types.

In studies with a no‑stocking or fake match, results mixed.
One study had many people stop early and use was low.
Two others found people wore the stockings well.
Why did some not use them?
They felt they were not comfy or hard to put on.
Some did not like the look.
Some felt they did not help or caused skin rub.

Comfort and fit also varied.
Pregnant women rejected tights more as pregnancy went on.
The tights felt less acceptable over time.
In a study of women who were not pregnant, results differed.
Stockings did not block daily tasks more than fake ones.
Daytime comfort looked about the same as fake ones.

Two studies tested comfort between two stocking types.
They found no big comfort gap.
Discomfort drove what people liked best.
One study looked at life quality.
This means how you feel and live day to day.
It found no clear change with stockings.

We still do not know the best length or squeeze level.
The review could not pick a clear best choice.
Why is that?
The proof we have is weak or very weak.
Some studies did not report well.
They did not all ask the same questions.
They measured things in many ways.
This made it hard to add the data together.

What does this mean for you?
Stockings may ease symptoms for some people.
They may also lower leg fluid.
They seem safe, with mild side effects.
But the proof is not strong at this time.
We cannot say that stockings alone will treat early varicose veins.
We also cannot say which stocking works best.

More strong, clear studies are needed.
They should test stockings against no stockings in fair ways.
They should track how people feel and live.
They should also check use and comfort over time.
This will help people and doctors choose well.","Wearing stockings to provide compression for the treatment of varicose veins

10.1002-14651858.CD010789.pub2,"Whole‐body cryotherapy for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise
Background and aim of the review 
Delayed onset muscle soreness describes the muscular pain, tenderness and stiffness experienced after high‐intensity or unaccustomed exercise. Various therapies are in use to prevent or reduce muscle soreness after exercise and to enhance recovery. One more recent therapy that is growing in use is whole‐body cryotherapy (WBC). This involves single or repeated exposure(s) to extremely cold dry air (below ‐100°C) in a specialised chamber or cabin for two to four minutes per exposure. This review aimed to find out whether WBC reduced muscle soreness, improved recovery and was safe for those people for whom it can be used. 
Results of the search 
We searched medical databases up to August 2015 for studies that compared WBC with a control intervention such as passive rest or no treatment; or with another active intervention such as cold water immersion. We found four small studies. These reported results for a total of 64 physically active young adults. All but four participants were male. The studies were very varied such as the type, temperature, duration and frequency of the WBC and the exercises used to induce muscle soreness. There were two comparisons: WBC compared with a control intervention; and WBC compared with far‐infrared therapy. 
Key results 
All four studies compared WBC with either passive rest or no treatment. These provided some evidence that WBC may reduce muscle soreness (pain at rest) at 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours after exercise. However, the evidence also included the possibility that WBC may not make a difference or may make the pain worse. There was some weak evidence that WBC may improve well‐being at 24 hours. There was no report and probably no monitoring of adverse events in these four studies. 
One very small study also compared WBC with far‐infrared therapy and reported lower levels of muscle soreness one hour after the treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
All four studies had aspects that could undermine the reliability of their results. We decided that the evidence was of very low quality for all outcomes. Thus, the findings remain very uncertain and further research may provide evidence that could change our conclusions. 
Conclusions 
The currently available evidence is insufficient to support the use of WBC for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise in adults. Furthermore, the best prescription of WBC and its safety are not known.

Very cold air therapy for sore muscles after exercise

Rationale
Hard or new exercise can cause sore, stiff muscles. The pain often starts a day later. It can make it hard to move and train. It can slow your return to sport or work.

People try many things to ease this pain. Ice baths are one. A newer method is whole body cryotherapy, or WBC. In WBC, you stand in a room with very cold, dry air. The air is colder than minus one hundred degrees Celsius.

Each session lasts two to four minutes. People may have one or more sessions. Very cold air may lower swelling and pain. The hope is that it helps the body heal faster.

This study asked two main things. Does WBC lower sore muscle pain after exercise? Is WBC safe for use in adults?

Trial Design
The team did not run a new trial. They looked for all past trials. They searched medical study lists up to August of 2015. They looked for trials that tested WBC in adults after exercise.

They found four small trials. In all, the trials had 64 young, active adults. Most were men. Only four were women.

The trials were not the same. The cold air level and session time were not the same. The number of sessions was not the same. The type of exercise used to cause pain was not the same.

Most trials compared WBC to rest or no help. One very small trial also tested far infrared light. This is a heat light used for pain. They did not find trials that compared WBC to cold water baths.

People took part for a short time. The trials checked pain and other signs for up to three days. They often checked pain at one, 24, 48, and 72 hours. This shows how people felt over time.

Results
The four trials all compared WBC with rest or no help. The results were mixed. Some data said pain at rest was less after WBC. This was seen at one, 24, 48, and 72 hours.

But other data said there was no change. Some even said pain could be worse. One tiny trial found that WBC beat far infrared light at one hour. People had lower pain then.

One trial found a small lift in well being at 24 hours. This means people felt a bit better. But that sign was weak. It could be due to chance.

None of the trials reported harm from WBC. But most did not watch for harm in clear ways. So we do not know if WBC is safe. We also do not know the best dose or plan.

The trials had many limits. They were small. The set up had problems that can sway results. This lowers trust in what they found.

The team judged that the proof was very weak. Better and larger trials could change what we think. For now, we cannot say that WBC helps sore muscles after exercise. We also do not know if it is safe for adults who try it.

What does this mean for you? WBC may help some people for a short time. It may also do nothing, or even make pain worse. We need more good research to know for sure.

If you plan to try WBC, talk with your health care provider. Ask about the unknowns and the cost. Ask what other safe care may help your muscle pain. Choices may include rest, light move, or cold packs.","Whole‐body cryotherapy for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise

10.1002-14651858.CD013776.pub2,"Background
Disease recurrence and progression remain major challenges in the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Blue light‐enhanced transurethral resection of bladder cancer (TURBT) is an approach to improve staging and achieve a complete resection of NMIBC. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of blue light‐enhanced TURBT compared to white light‐based TURBT in the treatment of NMIBC. 
Search methods
We searched several medical literature databases, including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase, as well as trial registers, including ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We performed a comprehensive search with no restrictions on language of publication or publication status until March 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials using blue light versus white light TURBT. Included participants had a high level of suspicion based on imaging or ‘visible diagnosis’ for primary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder or recurrent urothelial carcinoma of the bladder upon cytoscopy. We excluded studies in which blue light was used in a surveillance setting.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Our primary outcomes were time to disease recurrence, time to disease progression, and serious surgical complications. Secondary outcomes were time to death from bladder cancer, any adverse events, and non‐serious complications. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 16 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 4325 participants in the review. The studies compared blue light versus white light TURBT for treatment of NMIBC.  
Primary outcomes 
Blue light TURBT may reduce the risk of disease recurrence over time (hazard ratio (HR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.81; low‐certainty evidence) depending on baseline risk. For participants with low‐, intermediate‐, and high‐risk NMIBC, this corresponded to 48 (66 fewer to 27 fewer), 109 (152 fewer to 59 fewer), and 147 (211 fewer to 76 fewer) fewer recurrences per 1000 participants when compared to white light TURBT, respectively.  
Blue light TURBT may also reduce the risk of disease progression over time (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.84; low‐certainty evidence) depending on baseline risk. For participants with low‐, intermediate‐, and high‐risk NMIBC, this corresponded to 1 (1 fewer to 0 fewer), 17 (25 fewer to 8 fewer), and 56 (81 fewer to 25 fewer) fewer progressions per 1000 participants when compared to white light TURBT, respectively. 
Blue light TURBT may have little or no effect on serious surgical complications (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.14; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponded to 10 fewer (19 fewer to 25 more) surgical complications per 1000 participants with blue light TURBT.  
Secondary outcomes 
Blue light TURBT may have little or no effect on the risk of death from bladder cancer over time (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.61; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponded to 22 deaths per 1000 participants with white light TURBT and 10 fewer (17 fewer to 13 more) deaths per 1000 participants with blue light TURBT.   
We are very uncertain how blue light TURBT affects the outcome adverse events of any grade (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33; low‐certainty evidence).  
No analysis was possible for the outcome non‐serious surgical complications, as it was not reported by any of the included studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Blue light‐enhanced TURBT for the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer compared to white light‐based TURBT may reduce the risk of disease recurrence and disease progression over time depending on baseline risk. There may be little or no effect on serious surgical complications. The certainty of evidence for our findings was low, meaning that future studies are likely change to the reported estimates of effect. Frequent issues that led to downgrading of the certainty of the evidence were study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision.

Blue light helps doctors find and remove early bladder tumors

Rationale
Bladder cancer can start on the inner wall of the bladder. In many people, it has not yet grown into the muscle. Doctors call this early stage non‑muscle invasive bladder cancer. Even at this early stage, the cancer can come back. It can also get worse and grow deeper.

The main care is to remove the tumor. Doctors use a thin scope put in through the urine tube. They cut out and burn away tumor tissue. This is called transurethral resection of bladder tumor, or TURBT. Under normal white light, some small or flat tumors are hard to see. If the surgeon does not see them, they may not remove them.

Blue light during surgery may help. It makes tumor areas stand out more clearly. Doctors hope this leads to a more complete removal. The idea is that better removal now means the cancer comes back less. It also may slow or stop the cancer from getting worse. This study asked if blue light TURBT works better than white light TURBT. It also asked if it is as safe.

Trial Design
This research was a review of many trials. The team searched medical databases up to March 2021. They also searched trial registries. They looked for randomized trials. In such trials, people are put by chance into one of two groups.

The review included 16 trials with 4,325 people. Each trial compared blue light TURBT to white light TURBT. People had signs of bladder cancer seen on a scope or on imaging. Some had a new tumor. Some had a tumor that came back.

Each trial followed people over time. The teams checked how long it took for the cancer to come back. They also checked how long it took for the cancer to get worse. They looked for bad effects from surgery. The exact follow‑up time was not the same in all trials. It was not stated here.

Results
Main finding: blue light TURBT may help keep the cancer from coming back. People fall into low, medium, or high risk groups. Risk is based on tumor features at the start. In low‑risk cases, blue light may mean 48 fewer people out of 1,000 had the cancer come back. The range was between 66 fewer and 27 fewer out of 1,000.

In medium‑risk cases, blue light may mean 109 fewer people out of 1,000 had the cancer come back. The range was between 152 fewer and 59 fewer out of 1,000. In high‑risk cases, blue light may mean 147 fewer people out of 1,000 had the cancer come back. The range was between 211 fewer and 76 fewer out of 1,000.

Blue light TURBT may also help slow the cancer from getting worse. In low‑risk cases, this was a very small change: about 1 fewer out of 1,000. The range was between 1 fewer and 0 fewer out of 1,000. In medium‑risk cases, there may be 17 fewer out of 1,000 who got worse. The range was between 25 fewer and 8 fewer out of 1,000. In high‑risk cases, there may be 56 fewer out of 1,000 who got worse. The range was between 81 fewer and 25 fewer out of 1,000.

Safety was also reviewed. Blue light TURBT may have little or no change in serious surgery problems. Based on the numbers, about 10 fewer people out of 1,000 had a serious problem. But the range also allows for up to 25 more out of 1,000. In short, the rates looked about the same.

The chance of dying from bladder cancer over time may also be about the same. In white light groups, 22 out of 1,000 died from bladder cancer. With blue light, there may be 10 fewer deaths out of 1,000. But the results for death were very unsure. We cannot say for sure that blue light changes this outcome.

The trials did not report on minor surgery problems in a way that could be pooled. So we do not know if blue light changes minor problems. We are also unsure if blue light changes the chance of any side effect at all. The data for that point were not clear.

What do these results mean for people with bladder cancer? Blue light during surgery may help doctors see and remove more tumor. This may mean the cancer comes back less often. It may also lower the chance that the cancer gets worse. The size of the benefit seems to grow with higher risk at the start.

The safety profile looks much like white light. The chance of a serious problem from surgery seems similar. We do not have clear data on minor problems. We also do not have clear proof that blue light changes the chance of death from bladder cancer.

How sure are we about these results? The review judged the certainty as low. This means the true effect could be different. Future trials may change the numbers. Reasons for low certainty included study limits, mixed results across trials, and wide ranges around the estimates.

In summary, blue light TURBT may help reduce cancer coming back and getting worse. It appears about as safe as white light TURBT. These results can help you and your doctor talk about surgery choices. More strong trials will help confirm how much blue light helps, and for whom.","Blue light‐enhanced versus white light resection in the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer 
Review question 
How does a resection (surgical removal) of bladder cancer supported with a special visualization method (blue light) compare to a standard resection with white light in people in whom a tumor of the inner bladder wall is suspected? 
Background 
In people suspected of having bladder cancer, suspicious tissue is cut from the inner bladder wall using a special instrument inserted through the urethra into the bladder. However, it is sometimes difficult to tell what is normal bladder versus what is cancer. In order to see the tumor better and remove it completely, a substance, or 'contrast agent,' is put into the bladder through a catheter. During surgery, a special light is used that is meant to make the cancerous area light up blue.  
Study characteristics 
We only included randomized controlled trials (a type of study where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) for inclusion in the review, as this type of clinical study is considered to be of the highest quality producing the most reliable results. We included people who were very likely to have had bladder cancer because if had been seen on an imaging study (like a computed tomography (CT) scan) or when looking into the bladder. We included studies of people with newly suspected tumors and those who had been treated for bladder cancer before and there was concern it had come back.  
Key results 
We included 16 studies addressing our review question. Overall, blue light‐enhanced resection of bladder cancer may reduce the risk of disease recurrence over time compared to white light resection (low‐certainty evidence) and may reduce the risk of disease progression over time (low‐certainty evidence). However, whether this effect is big enough to be meaningful to people with bladder cancer depends on whether they belong to the low, intermediate and high risk group for disease recurrence or progression.   
We also found that blue light may have little or no effect on the occurrence of serious surgical complications (low‐certainty evidence) or the risk of death from bladder cancer over time (low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain as to whether blue light TURBT reduces the incidence of unwanted side effects, as the certainty of the evidence was assessed as low. We do not know how non‐serious surgical complications are affected as no data were reported for this outcome. 
Quality of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence was low, meaning that future research would likely change our results.

Hip fractures are a major healthcare problem, presenting a huge challenge and burden to patients, healthcare systems and society. The increased proportion of older adults in the world population means that the absolute number of hip fractures is rising rapidly across the globe. The majority of hip fractures are treated surgically. This review evaluates evidence for types of internal fixation implants used in joint‐preserving surgery for intracapsular hip fractures. 
Objectives
To determine the relative effects (benefits and harms) of different implants for the internal fixation of intracapsular hip fractures in older adults. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Epistemonikos, Proquest Dissertations and Theses, and National Technical Information Service in July 2020. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, reference lists of retrieved articles and conducted backward‐citation searches. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing implants used for internal fixation of fragility intracapsular proximal femoral fractures in older adults. Types of implants were smooth pins (these include pins with fold‐out hooks), screws, or fixed angle plates. We excluded studies in which all or most fractures were caused by specific pathologies other than osteoporosis or were the result of a high energy trauma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. One review author extracted data and assessed risk of bias which was checked by a second review author. We collected data for seven outcomes: activities of daily living (ADL), delirium, functional status, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), mobility, mortality (reported within four months of surgery as early mortality, and at 12 months since surgery), and unplanned return to theatre for treating a complication resulting directly or indirectly from the primary procedure (such as deep infection or non‐union). We assessed the certainty of the evidence for these outcomes using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 38 studies (32 RCTs, six quasi‐RCTs) with 8585 participants with 8590 intracapsular fractures. The mean ages of participants in the studies ranged from 60 to 84 years; 73% were women, and 38% of fractures were undisplaced. 
We report here the findings of the four main comparisons, which were between different categories of implants. 
We downgraded the certainty of the outcomes for imprecision (when data were available from insufficient numbers of participants or the confidence interval (CI) was wide), study limitations (e.g. high or unclear risks of bias), and inconsistency (when we noted substantial levels of statistical heterogeneity). 
Smooth pins versus fixed angle plate (four studies, 1313 participants) 
We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two implant types in independent mobility with no more than one walking stick (1 study, 112 participants), early mortality (1 study, 383 participants), mortality at 12 months (2 studies, 661 participants), and unplanned return to theatre (3 studies, 736 participants). No studies reported on ADL, delirium, functional status, or HRQoL. 
Screws versus fixed angle plates (11 studies, 2471 participants) 
We found low‐certainty evidence of no clinically important differences between the two implant types in functional status using WOMAC (MD ‐3.18, 95% CI ‐6.35 to ‐0.01; 2 studies, 498 participants; range of scores from 0 to 96, lower values indicate better function), and HRQoL using EQ‐5D (MD 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.06; 2 studies, 521 participants; range ‐0.654 (worst), 0 (dead), 1 (best)). We also found low‐certainty evidence showing little or no difference between the two implant types in mortality at 12 months (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.31; 7 studies, 1690 participants), and unplanned return to theatre (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.26; 11 studies, 2321 participants). We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two implant types in independent mobility (1 study, 70 participants), and early mortality (3 studies, 467 participants). No studies reported on ADL or delirium. 
Screws versus smooth pins (seven studies, 1119 participants) 
We found low‐certainty evidence of no or little difference between the two implant types in mortality at 12 months (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.35; 6 studies, 1005 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two implant types in early mortality (3 studies, 584 participants) and unplanned return to theatre (5 studies, 862 participants). No studies reported on ADL, delirium, functional status, HRQoL, or mobility. 
Screws or smooth pins versus fixed angle plates (15 studies, 3784 participants) 
In this comparison, we combined data from the first two comparison groups. We found low‐certainty evidence of no or little difference between the two groups of implants in mortality at 12 months (RR 1.04, 95% CI.083 to 1.31; 7 studies, 1690 participants) and unplanned return to theatre (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18; 14 studies, 3057 participants). We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the two groups of implants in independent mobility (2 studies, 182 participants), and early mortality (4 studies, 850 participants). We found no additional evidence to support the findings for functional status or HRQoL as reported in 'Screws versus fixed angle plates'. No studies reported ADL or delirium. 
Authors' conclusions
There is low‐certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference between screws and fixed angle plates in functional status, HRQoL, mortality at 12 months, or unplanned return to theatre; and between screws and pins in mortality at 12 months. The limited and very low‐certainty evidence for the outcomes for which data were available for the smooth pins versus fixed angle plates comparison, as well as the other outcomes for which data were available for the screws and fixed angle plates, and screws and pins comparisons means we have very little confidence in the estimates of effect for these outcomes. Additional RCTs would increase the certainty of the evidence. We encourage such studies to report outcomes consistent with the core outcome set for hip fracture, including long‐term quality of life indicators such as ADL and mobility.

Pins, screws, or plates for hip breaks: what works best?

Rationale
A hip break is a crack in the top of the thigh bone. This spot sits inside the hip joint. These breaks are common in older adults. They can cause pain and loss of daily life skills. They can lead to a move from home to care. Some people may even die soon after a hip break.

Most people need surgery to fix the bone. Doctors often use metal parts to hold the bone while it heals. These parts include smooth pins, screws, and fixed angle plates. A smooth pin is a thin rod. Some have small hooks that fold out. A screw is like a small bolt. A fixed angle plate is a plate and screw device. The plate keeps the screw at a set angle.

Doctors want to know which option helps most and harms least. The main idea was this: one type might lead to better healing and fewer harms. This review looked at past trials to test that idea. The goal was to guide care for older adults with this kind of hip break.

Trial Design
This was a review of trials. The team looked for trials where people joined by chance. That means each person had an equal chance of any of the study parts. Some trials used a near‑random method. The team searched many study lists in July of 2020.

The review included 38 trials. In all, 8,585 people took part. They had 8,590 hip breaks inside the joint. The average ages in the trials were 60 to 84. About 3 in 4 were women. About 2 in 5 had a crack that did not move out of place.

All people had a “fragility” hip break. That means a low‑energy fall, often due to weak bones. The trials left out breaks from high‑energy injuries or other diseases. The team compared three types of metal parts: smooth pins, screws, and fixed angle plates.

The team tracked these results. They looked at daily life tasks. These are things like washing, dressing, and eating. They looked at sudden confusion, called delirium. They looked at how well people could move and function. They looked at how people felt and lived day to day. This is called quality of life. They looked at walking. They looked at death in two time frames. One was within four months after surgery. The other was at one year. They also looked at a need for a second, unplanned surgery. That means a return to the operating room due to a problem.

Most trials followed people for up to one year. Some results were early, within four months. Not all trials reported on all results.

Results
Here is the main point. Across the trials, no one type of part stood out. In most cases, people did about the same. The chance of death at one year was about the same. The chance of a second surgery was about the same. The team felt low to very low certainty for many results. That means we should be careful when we use these numbers.

Smooth pins versus fixed angle plates (four trials, 1,313 people)
People walked about the same in the one trial that tested walking. Early deaths were about the same. Deaths at one year were about the same. The chance of a second surgery was about the same. The trials did not report on daily life tasks, sudden confusion, function, or quality of life. The team had very low certainty for these results.

Screws versus fixed angle plates (11 trials, 2,471 people)
Function scores were about the same. Quality of life scores were about the same. Deaths at one year were about the same. The chance of a second surgery was about the same. One small trial looked at walking. It found no clear gap. Early deaths were also about the same. Trials did not report on daily life tasks or sudden confusion. The team had low certainty for most of these results. They had very low certainty for walking and early deaths.

Screws versus smooth pins (seven trials, 1,119 people)
Deaths at one year were about the same. Early deaths were about the same. The chance of a second surgery was about the same. Trials did not report on daily life tasks, sudden confusion, function, quality of life, or walking. The team had low certainty for deaths at one year. They had very low certainty for the other results.

Screws or smooth pins versus fixed angle plates (15 trials, 3,784 people)
When the team grouped screws and pins together, the picture stayed the same. Deaths at one year were about the same. The chance of a second surgery was about the same. Walking and early deaths also looked about the same. The team had low certainty for deaths at one year and second surgery. They had very low certainty for walking and early deaths.

What does this mean for patients?
Based on these trials, no one option was better than the others. People did much the same with pins, screws, or fixed angle plates. This was true for death at one year. It was also true for a need for a second surgery. With screws and plates, function and quality of life also looked the same.

But, the proof was not strong. Many trials were small. Some had limits in how they were run. For many key results, trials did not report or did not agree. So we feel unsure about these results. We need more good trials. Future trials should track daily life tasks and walking for the long term.

For now, doctors may choose the part based on the break type. They may also use the person’s health, bone strength, and the surgeon’s skill. You can ask your care team about these options. You can ask how each one fits your case. You can ask about pain, how you may move after surgery, and the chance of a second surgery.

In short, this review found no clear winner. Pins, screws, and fixed angle plates seem to work about the same. Better trials will help us know more.","Metal implants used to fix broken bones in the hip joint in older adults
This review assessed evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs, on the relative benefits and harms of different metal implants used to treat one type of hip fracture in older adults (aged 60 years or over). 
Background 
A hip fracture is a break at the top of the leg bone. We included people with a break just below the ball and socket joint. These types of broken hip are common in older adults whose bones may be fragile because of a condition called osteoporosis. They often happen after a fall from a standing or sitting position. A common way of mending this break is to fix the broken parts of bone with metal implants. During an operation, the surgeon may insert a smooth pin or screw through the two parts of broken bone. A smooth pin is not threaded like a screw but may have extra features such as a fold‐out hook. Alternatively, the surgeon may use a 'fixed angle plate' which sits on the outer edge of the broken bone and is attached to the bone with screws or pins. 
Search date 
We searched for RCTs (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), and quasi‐RCTs (in which people are put into groups by a method which is not randomised, such as date of birth or hospital record number), published up to 6 July 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We included 38 studies, involving 8585 adults with 8590 hip fractures. The average age of study participants ranged from 60 to 84 years; 73% were women, which is usual for people who have this type of hip fracture. 
Key results 
Smooth pins compared with fixed angle plates (four studies, 1313 participants): we are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in improving a person's ability to walk independently (with no more than one walking stick), in the number of people who die early (within four months of surgery) or up to 12 months after surgery, and in how many people need additional surgery (e.g. because of deep infection around the implant). 
Screws compared with fixed angle plates (11 studies, 2471 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in hip function (ability to use the hip), health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), death at 12 months, and additional surgery. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in independent walking, and early deaths. 
Screws compared to smooth pins (seven studies, 1119 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in deaths at 12 months. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between these implants in early deaths and additional surgery. 
Screws or pins compared with fixed angle plates (15 studies, 3784 participants): we found no evidence of difference between these implants in deaths at 12 months, or additional surgery. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between implants in independent walking and early death. We found no additional evidence for hip function or HRQoL. 
No studies in the review reported activities of daily living or delirium.
Certainty of the evidence 
Although there were some large studies, most of the evidence for each outcome came from only a few participants. Many older studies were not well reported. It was not possible to hide from the surgeons what type of fixing was used, which might affect a surgeon's decision on whether someone needed additional surgery. Sometimes, we found differences between the findings of individual studies that we could not explain. 
For these reasons, we assessed the evidence for the outcomes as either low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence. This means we had limited confidence or very little confidence in the results. 
Conclusions 
There may be little or no difference between screws and fixed angle plates in hip function, HRQoL, deaths at 12 months, and additional surgery, and between screws and pins in deaths at 12 months. But we are uncertain of the effects for other outcomes, including those for smooth pins versus fixed angle plates, because the evidence was very low‐certainty. More well‐designed RCTs on metal implants will be helpful.

Heated tobacco products (HTPs) are designed to heat tobacco to a high enough temperature to release aerosol, without burning it or producing smoke. They differ from e‐cigarettes because they heat tobacco leaf/sheet rather than a liquid. Companies who make HTPs claim they produce fewer harmful chemicals than conventional cigarettes. Some people report stopping smoking cigarettes entirely by switching to using HTPs, so clinicians need to know whether they are effective for this purpose and relatively safe. Also, to regulate HTPs appropriately, policymakers should understand their impact on health and on cigarette smoking prevalence. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of HTPs for smoking cessation and the impact of HTPs on smoking prevalence.  
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and six other databases for relevant records to January 2021, together with reference‐checking and contact with study authors and relevant groups. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which people who smoked cigarettes were randomised to switch to exclusive HTP use or a control condition. Eligible outcomes were smoking cessation, adverse events, and selected biomarkers.  RCTs conducted in clinic or in an ambulatory setting were deemed eligible when assessing safety, including those randomising participants to exclusively use HTPs, smoke cigarettes, or attempt abstinence from all tobacco. Time‐series studies were also eligible for inclusion if they examined the population‐level impact of heated tobacco on smoking prevalence or cigarette sales as an indirect measure. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our primary outcome measures were abstinence from smoking at the longest follow‐up point available, adverse events, serious adverse events, and changes in smoking prevalence or cigarette sales. Other outcomes included biomarkers of harm and exposure to toxicants/carcinogens (e.g. NNAL and carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb)). We used a random‐effects Mantel‐Haenszel model to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences on the log‐transformed scale (LMD) with 95% CIs. We pooled data across studies using meta‐analysis where possible. 
Main results
We included 13 completed studies, of which 11 were RCTs assessing safety (2666 participants) and two were time‐series studies. We judged eight RCTs to be at unclear risk of bias and three at high risk. All RCTs were funded by tobacco companies. Median length of follow‐up was 13 weeks. 
No studies reported smoking cessation outcomes. 
There was insufficient evidence for a difference in risk of adverse events between smokers randomised to switch to heated tobacco or continue smoking cigarettes, limited by imprecision and risk of bias (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.15; I2 = 0%; 6 studies, 1713 participants). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether risk of serious adverse events differed between groups due to very serious imprecision and risk of bias (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.94; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 1472 participants). There was moderate‐certainty evidence for lower NNAL and COHb at follow‐up in heated tobacco than cigarette smoking groups, limited by risk of bias (NNAL: LMD −0.81, 95% CI −1.07 to −0.55; I2 = 92%; 10 studies, 1959 participants; COHb: LMD −0.74, 95% CI −0.92 to −0.52; I2 = 96%; 9 studies, 1807 participants). Evidence for additional biomarkers of exposure are reported in the main body of the review. 
There was insufficient evidence for a difference in risk of adverse events in smokers randomised to switch to heated tobacco or attempt abstinence from all tobacco, limited by risk of bias and imprecision (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.46; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 237 participants). Five studies reported that no serious adverse events occurred in either group (533 participants). There was moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, that urine concentrations of NNAL at follow‐up were higher in the heated tobacco use compared with abstinence group (LMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 382 participants). In addition, there was very low‐certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, for higher COHb in the heated tobacco use compared with abstinence group for intention‐to‐treat analyses (LMD 0.69, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.31; 3 studies, 212 participants), but lower COHb in per‐protocol analyses (LMD −0.32, 95% CI −1.04 to 0.39; 2 studies, 170 participants). Evidence concerning additional biomarkers is reported in the main body of the review. 
Data from two time‐series studies showed that the rate of decline in cigarette sales accelerated following the introduction of heated tobacco to market in Japan. This evidence was of very low‐certainty as there was risk of bias, including possible confounding, and cigarette sales are an indirect measure of smoking prevalence. 
Authors' conclusions
No studies reported on cigarette smoking cessation, so the effectiveness of heated tobacco for this purpose remains uncertain. There was insufficient evidence for differences in risk of adverse or serious adverse events between people randomised to switch to heated tobacco, smoke cigarettes, or attempt tobacco abstinence in the short‐term. There was moderate‐certainty evidence that heated tobacco users have lower exposure to toxicants/carcinogens than cigarette smokers and very low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence of higher exposure than those attempting abstinence from  all tobacco. Independently funded research on the effectiveness and safety of HTPs is needed.  
The rate of decline in cigarette sales accelerated after the introduction of heated tobacco to market in Japan but, as data were observational, it is possible other factors caused these changes. Moreover, falls in cigarette sales may not translate to declining smoking prevalence, and changes in Japan may not generalise elsewhere. To clarify the impact of rising heated tobacco use on smoking prevalence, there is a need for time‐series studies that examine this association.

Do heated tobacco products help people quit smoking, and are they safe?

Rationale
Smoking harms the heart, lungs, and many other parts of the body. Many people want to quit, but it is hard. New products claim to help.

Heated tobacco products warm tobacco to make a mist you can inhale. They do not burn the tobacco like a cigarette does. Makers say this can cut harmful chemicals.

Some people say they stop smoking by switching to these products. Doctors and policy makers want to know if this is true. They also need to know if these products are safe.

This research looked for clear answers. It asked two key questions. Do heated tobacco products help people stop smoking? Are they safer than smoking?

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team looked for studies up to January of 2021. They searched many large medical databases.

They found thirteen studies. Eleven were trials where people who smoked were put into groups by chance. Two were studies that tracked sales over time.

In the trials, people either switched to heated tobacco, kept smoking cigarettes, or tried to quit all tobacco. The people in these studies were people who smoked cigarettes. Most trials watched people for about three months.

The trials looked at side effects and signs in the body that show smoke exposure. These signs came from blood or urine tests. The review planned to look at quit rates, side effects, and signs of harm.

Results
No study in this review told us if people quit smoking by using heated tobacco. So, we do not know if these products help people stop. This is a key gap.

In the short term, people who switched to heated tobacco had a similar number of side effects as people who kept smoking. The same was true when compared with people who tried to quit all tobacco. But the data were not strong. The groups were small, and the time was short.

Serious side effects were rare in the trials. The number of serious side effects did not look different between groups. But the data were too small to be sure.

People who used heated tobacco had lower levels of some harmful smoke signs than cigarette smokers. These signs measure exposure to things in smoke that can harm the body. Lower levels may mean less harm than smoking. But this was only in the short term.

People who used heated tobacco had higher levels of these signs than people who used no tobacco at all. This means heated tobacco is not risk free. Not using tobacco is still best for health.

Two studies looked at cigarette sales in Japan over time. After heated tobacco came to market there, cigarette sales fell faster. But sales are not the same as the number of people who smoke. Other things could also cause sales to fall. So we must be careful when we read this.

All eleven trials got money from tobacco makers. This can affect how studies are done or shared. It is one reason we need more work by independent groups.

Most trials ran for about three months. We do not know the long-term risks. We also do not know if heated tobacco helps people quit over time. Longer studies, and studies not paid for by the tobacco industry, are needed.

What does this mean for people who smoke? Heated tobacco may expose you to fewer harmful chemicals than cigarettes, at least in the short term. But we do not know if it helps you quit. We also do not know the long-term safety.

If your goal is to quit all tobacco, that is best for your health. If you cannot quit now, switching may lower some harm compared with smoking. But it still carries risk. Talk with your doctor about proven ways to quit, like counseling and approved quit aids.

In short, this review found:
- No data on quit rates with heated tobacco.
- In the short term, side effects were similar across groups.
- Heated tobacco led to lower smoke exposure than cigarettes, but higher than no tobacco.
- Cigarette sales fell faster in Japan after heated tobacco arrived, but we cannot say why.

The researchers call for more and better studies. These should track quit rates and safety over longer time. They should also come from teams that are not paid by tobacco makers. This will help people and policy makers make informed choices.","Do heated tobacco products help people to quit smoking, are they safe for this purpose, and have they led to falls in smoking rates? 
Key messages 
Heated tobacco probably exposes people to fewer toxins than cigarettes, but possibly more than not using any tobacco. Falls in cigarette sales appeared to speed up following the launch of heated tobacco in Japan, but we are uncertain whether this is caused by people switching from cigarettes to heated tobacco. 
We need more independently funded research into whether heated tobacco helps people stop smoking, whether it results in unwanted effects, and the impact of rising heated tobacco use on smoking rates.  
What are heated tobacco products?  
Heated tobacco products are designed to heat tobacco to a high enough temperature to release vapour, without burning it or producing smoke. They differ from e‐cigarettes because they heat tobacco leaf/sheet rather than a liquid. Many of the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke are created by burning tobacco. So heating not burning tobacco could reduce the amount of chemicals a user ingests. Some people report stopping smoking cigarettes entirely by switching to using heated tobacco. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review  
Because cigarette smoking is addictive, many people find it difficult to stop despite the harm it causes. We aimed to find out whether trying to switch to heated tobacco helps people stop smoking cigarettes, and whether it results in unwanted effects. We also wanted to find out whether rising heated tobacco use has affected smoking rates or cigarette sales. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that reported on the use of heated tobacco for stopping smoking, and on unwanted effects and toxin exposure in people asked to use heated tobacco. Here we only included randomised controlled trials, where treatments were given to people at random. This type of study is considered the most reliable way of determining if a treatment works. Finally, we searched for studies looking at changes in smoking rates and cigarette sales following the launch of heated tobacco to market. We included studies published up to January 2021. 
What we found 
Our search found 13 relevant studies. No studies reported whether heated tobacco helps people stop smoking cigarettes. Eleven trials, all funded by tobacco companies and with 2666 adult smokers, compared unwanted effects and toxin levels in people randomly assigned to use heated tobacco or to continue smoking cigarettes or abstain from tobacco use. 
Two studies looked at how trends in cigarette sales changed following the launch of heated tobacco in Japan. 
What are the results of our review?  
We do not know whether using heated tobacco helps people to stop smoking cigarettes (no studies measured this). 
We are uncertain whether the chances of getting unwanted symptoms from being asked to use heated tobacco are different compared with cigarettes (6 studies, 1713 participants) or no tobacco (2 studies, 237 participants). Serious unwanted symptoms in the short time period studied (average 13 weeks) were rare in all groups, which means we are uncertain about any differences. Toxin levels were probably lower in people using heated tobacco than those smoking cigarettes (10 studies, 1959 participants), but may be higher than in people not using any tobacco products (5 studies, 382 participants). 
The launch of heated tobacco products in Japan may have caused the decline in cigarette sales to speed up over time (two studies), but it is unclear whether the fall in the percentage of people who smoke also sped up because no studies looked at this.  
How reliable are these results? 
Results are based on data from a small number of studies, most of which were funded by tobacco companies.  
Results on unwanted effects are likely to change as more evidence becomes available. However, we are moderately confident that levels of measured toxins are lower in people using heated tobacco than smoking cigarettes, but less confident that levels were higher than in people not using any tobacco. We are also less confident that the launch of heated tobacco caused the fall in cigarette sales to speed up, as results came from a single country.

Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is vastly recommended as the first‐line analgesic for osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. However, there has been controversy about this recommendation given recent studies have revealed small effects of paracetamol when compared with placebo. Nonetheless, past studies have not systematically reviewed and appraised the literature to investigate the effects of this drug on specific osteoarthritis sites, that is, hip or knee, or on the dose used. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of paracetamol compared with placebo in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts to 3 October 2017, and ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal on 20 October 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing paracetamol with placebo in adults with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Major outcomes were pain, function, quality of life, adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and abnormal liver function tests. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors used standard Cochrane methods to collect data, and assess risk of bias and quality of the evidence. For pooling purposes, we converted pain and physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function) scores to a common 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability) scale. 
Main results
We identified 10 randomised placebo‐controlled trials involving 3541 participants with hip or knee osteoarthritis. The paracetamol dose varied from 1.95 g/day to 4 g/day, and the majority of trials followed participants for three months only. Most trials did not clearly report randomisation and concealment methods and were at unclear risk of selection bias. Trials were at low risk of performance, detection, and reporting bias. 
At 3 weeks' to 3 months' follow‐up, there was high‐quality evidence that paracetamol provided no clinically important improvements in pain and physical function. Mean reduction in pain was 23 points (0 to 100 scale, lower scores indicated less pain) with placebo and 3.23 points better (5.43 better to 1.02 better) with paracetamol, an absolute reduction of 3% (1% better to 5% better, minimal clinical important difference 9%) and relative reduction of 5% (2% better to 8% better) (seven trials, 2355 participants). Physical function improved by 12 points on a 0 to 100 scale (lower scores indicated better function) with placebo and was 2.9 points better (0.95 better to 4.89 better) with paracetamol, an absolute improvement of 3% (1% better to 5% better, minimal clinical important difference 10%) and relative improvement of 5% (2% better to 9% better) (7 trials, 2354 participants). 
High‐quality evidence from eight trials indicated that the incidence of adverse events was similar between groups: 515/1586 (325 per 1000) in the placebo group versus 537/1666 (328 per 1000, range 299 to 360) in the paracetamol group (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.11). There was less certainty (moderate‐quality evidence) around the risk of serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and the rate of abnormal liver function tests, due to wide CIs or small event rates, indicating imprecision. Seventeen of 1480 (11 per 1000) people treated with placebo and 28/1729 (16 per 1000, range 8 to 29) people treated with paracetamol experienced serious adverse events (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.53; 6 trials). The incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 65/1000 participants in with placebo and 77/1000 (range 59 to 100) participants with paracetamol (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.55; 7 trials). Abnormal liver function occurred in 18/1000 participants treated with placebo and 70/1000 participants treated with paracetamol (RR 3.79, 95% CI 1.94 to 7.39), but the clinical importance of this effect was uncertain. None of the trials reported quality of life. 
Subgroup analyses indicated that the effects of paracetamol on pain and function did not differ according to the dose of paracetamol (3.0 g/day or less versus 3.9 g/day or greater). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on high‐quality evidence this review confirms that paracetamol provides only minimal improvements in pain and function for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis, with no increased risk of adverse events overall. Subgroup analysis indicates that the effects on pain and function do not differ according to the dose of paracetamol. Due to the small number of events, we are less certain if paracetamol use increases the risk of serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and rate of abnormal liver function tests. 
Current clinical guidelines consistently recommend paracetamol as the first‐line analgesic medication for hip or knee osteoarthritis, given its low absolute frequency of substantive harm. However, our results call for reconsideration of these recommendations.

Does paracetamol help hip or knee arthritis pain?

Rationale
Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease. It can affect the hip or the knee. It causes pain, stiff joints, and trouble moving. This can limit work, self care, and joy in life.

Paracetamol, also called acetaminophen, is a common pain pill. Doctors often suggest it first for this kind of joint pain. It is easy to get and low cost.

But new research raised doubt. Some studies found paracetamol helps only a little. We need to know if it helps enough for people to feel a real change.

This study looked for clear answers. The team asked: Does paracetamol ease pain? Does it help people move better? Is it safe for most people? They also checked if a higher dose works better than a lower dose.

Paracetamol may help by lowering pain signals in the body. It does not treat swelling in the joint. So, any benefit might be small. This review tested that idea in a careful way.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team searched many medical libraries. They looked for all trials up to October 2017. They also checked trial registries.

They included only strong trials. People got paracetamol or a placebo pill. A placebo is a pill with no drug. People went into groups by chance. This helps keep the groups fair and alike.

All people were adults with hip or knee osteoarthritis. Both hip and knee trials were in the mix. The dose of paracetamol was between about 2 grams and 4 grams each day.

The team found 10 trials. They had 3541 people in total. Most trials lasted about three months. Some were as short as three weeks. So we know about short term use. We do not know about the long term.

The team looked at these things:
- Pain
- How well people could move
- Side effects
- Serious side effects
- Leaving the study due to side effects
- Blood tests that can show liver stress
- Quality of life, if a trial reported it

Results
Pain went down in both groups. People on placebo had less pain after some time. People on paracetamol did only a little better than that.

On a 0 to 100 pain scale, lower is better. People on placebo had pain drop by 23 points. Paracetamol did only 3 points better than that. People can feel a change of about 9 points. A 3 point extra drop is below that.

Movement got a bit better in both groups. On a 0 to 100 scale for function, lower is better. People on placebo improved by 12 points. Paracetamol did only 3 points better than that. People can feel a change of about 10 points. Again, a 3 point extra gain is too small to notice.

These pain and function results were “high quality.” That means the team is quite sure about them. The extra help from paracetamol, over placebo, was small. It was not enough for most people to feel.

The team also looked at safety. They found side effects were about the same in both groups. Out of 1000 people on placebo, about 325 had some side effects. Out of 1000 people on paracetamol, about 328 had some side effects. So, common side effects were alike.

Serious side effects were less clear. Out of 1000 people on placebo, about 11 had a serious side effect. Out of 1000 people on paracetamol, about 16 had a serious side effect. The numbers were small. So we cannot be sure if paracetamol raises this risk.

More people stopped the drug due to side effects in the paracetamol group. Out of 1000 people on placebo, about 65 stopped. Out of 1000 people on paracetamol, about 77 stopped. This also had some doubt.

Liver blood tests were more often high with paracetamol. Out of 1000 people on placebo, about 18 had high liver tests. Out of 1000 people on paracetamol, about 70 had high liver tests. We do not know how often this led to real liver harm. But this finding warns us to be careful, and to avoid more than the dose on the label.

No trials in this review reported quality of life. So we do not know if daily life felt better.

The team also checked dose. They asked if a higher dose worked better. Doses at or below 3 grams a day did not work better or worse than doses near 4 grams a day. So a higher dose did not add clear benefit for pain or for movement.

What does this mean for patients?
Paracetamol gave only a small extra drop in pain. It gave only a small extra boost in movement. These changes were too small for most people to feel. Short term side effects were about the same as a placebo. But liver blood tests went up more often with paracetamol. Serious harms were rare, and the numbers were not clear.

Most current guides still list paracetamol as a first choice. They do so because it has few large harms for most people. But this review calls for a new look at those guides. The small benefit may not justify it as the first choice for many adults with hip or knee osteoarthritis.

Talk with your doctor about your goals and your risks. Other options may fit you better. These include exercise, weight loss, joint support, or other pain drugs. If you use paracetamol, use the lowest dose that helps. Do not take more than the label says. If you have liver disease, ask your doctor first.

In short, for hip or knee osteoarthritis, paracetamol helps a little, if at all. It seems safe for short use for most people. But it may not help enough to notice a real change.","Paracetamol for treating people with hip or knee osteoarthritis
Background 
Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee is a progressive disabling disease affecting many people worldwide. Although paracetamol is widely used as a treatment option for this condition, recent studies have called into question how effective this pain relief medication is. 
Search date 
This review includes all trials published up to 3 October 2017.
Study characteristics 
We included randomised clinical trials (where people are randomly put into one of two treatment groups) looking at the effects of paracetamol for people with hip or knee pain due to osteoarthritis against a placebo (a 'sugar tablet' that contains nothing that could act as a medicine). We found 10 trials with 3541 participants. On average, participants in the study were aged between 55 and 70 years, and most presented with knee osteoarthritis. The treatment dose ranged from 1.95 g/day to 4 g/day of paracetamol and participants were followed up between one and 12 weeks in all but one study, which followed people up for 24 weeks. Six trials were funded by companies that produced paracetamol. 
Key results 
Compared with placebo tablets, paracetamol resulted in little benefit at 12 weeks.
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improved by 3% (1% better to 5% better), or 3.2 points (1 better to 5.4 better) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale. 
• People who took paracetamol reported that their pain improved by 26 points.
• People who took placebo reported that their pain improved by 23 points.
Physical function (lower scores mean better function) 
Improved by 3% (1% better to 5% better), or 2.9 points (1.0 better to 4.9 better) on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale. 
• People who took paracetamol reported that their function improved by 15 points.
• People who had placebo reported that their function improved by 12 points.
Side effects (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
No more people had side effects with paracetamol (3% less to 3% more), or 0 more people out of 100. 
• 33 out of 100 people reported a side effect with paracetamol.
• 33 out of 100 people reported a side effect with placebo.
Serious side effects (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
1% more people had serious side effects with paracetamol (0% less to 1% more), or one more person out of 100. 
• Two out of 100 people reported a serious side effect with paracetamol.
• One out of 100 people reported a serious side effect with placebo.
Withdrawals due to adverse events (up to 12 to 24 weeks) 
1% more people withdrew from treatment with paracetamol (1% less to 3% more), or one more person out of 100. 
• Eight out of 100 people withdrew from paracetamol treatment.
• Seven out of 100 people withdrew from placebo treatment.
Abnormal liver function tests (up to 12 to 24 weeks): 
5% more people had abnormal liver function tests (meaning there was some inflammation or damage to the liver) with paracetamol (1% more to 10% more), or five more people out of 100. 
• Seven out of 100 people had an abnormal liver function test with paracetamol.
• Two out of 100 people had an abnormal liver function test with placebo.
Quality of the evidence 
High‐quality evidence indicated that paracetamol provided only minimal improvements in pain and function for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis, with no increased risk of adverse events overall. None of the studies measured quality of life. Due to the small number of events, we were less certain if paracetamol use increased the risk of serious side effects, increased withdrawals due to side effects, and changed the rate of abnormal liver function tests. However, although there may be more abnormal liver function tests with paracetamol, the clinical implications are unknown.

The balance of benefits and harms associated with enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia is not clear. An increasing number of guidelines highlight the lack of evidenced benefit and potential risks of enteral tube feeding. In some areas of the world, the use of enteral tube feeding is decreasing, and in other areas it is increasing. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia who develop problems with eating and swallowing or who have reduced food and fluid intake. 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases and two trials registers on 14 April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or controlled non‐randomised studies. Our population of interest was adults of any age with a diagnosis of primary degenerative dementia of any cause, with severe cognitive and functional impairment, and poor nutritional intake. Eligible studies evaluated the effectiveness and complications of enteral tube feeding via a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, or via jejunal post‐pyloric feeding, in comparison with standard care or enhanced standard care, such as an intervention to promote oral intake. Our primary outcomes were survival time, quality of life, and pressure ulcers. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors screened citations and two review authors assessed full texts of potentially eligible studies against inclusion criteria. One review author extracted data, which were then checked independently by a second review author. We used the 'Risk Of Bias In Non‐randomised Studies of Interventions' (ROBINS‐I) tool to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. Risk of confounding was assessed against a pre‐agreed list of key potential confounding variables. Our primary outcomes were survival time, quality of life, and pressure ulcers. Results were not suitable for meta‐analysis, so we presented them narratively. We presented results separately for studies of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding, nasogastric tube feeding and studies using mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding methods. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall certainty of the evidence related to each outcome for each study. 
Main results
We found no eligible RCTs. We included fourteen controlled, non‐randomised studies. All the included studies compared outcomes between groups of people who had been assigned to enteral tube feeding or oral feeding by prior decision of a healthcare professional. Some studies controlled for a range of confounding factors, but there were high or very high risks of bias due to confounding in all studies, and high or critical risks of selection bias in some studies. 
Four studies with 36,816 participants assessed the effect of PEG feeding on survival time. None found any evidence of effects on survival time (low‐certainty evidence). 
Three of four studies using mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding methods in 310 participants (227 enteral tube feeding, 83 no enteral tube feeding) found them to be associated with longer survival time. The fourth study (1386 participants: 135 enteral tube feeding, 1251 no enteral tube feeding) found no evidence of an effect. The certainty of this body of evidence is very low. 
One study of PEG feeding (4421 participants: 1585 PEG, 2836 no enteral tube feeding) found PEG feeding increased the risk of pressure ulcers (moderate‐certainty evidence). Two of three studies reported an increase in the number of pressure ulcers in those receiving mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding (234 participants: 88 enteral tube feeding, 146 no enteral tube feeding). The third study found no effect (very‐low certainty evidence).  
Two studies of nasogastric tube feeding did not report data on survival time or pressure ulcers. 
None of the included studies assessed quality of life.
Only one study, using mixed methods of enteral tube feeding, reported on pain and comfort, finding no difference between groups. In the same study, a higher proportion of carers reported very heavy burden in the enteral tube feeding group compared to no enteral tube feeding. 
Two studies assessed the effect of nasogastric tube feeding on mortality (236 participants: 144 nasogastric group, 92 no enteral tube feeding). One study of 67 participants (14 nasogastric, 53 no enteral tube feeding) found nasogastric feeding was associated with increased mortality risk. The second study found no difference in mortality between groups. The certainty of this evidence is very low. Results on mortality for those using PEG or mixed methods of enteral tube feeding were mixed and the certainty of evidence was very low. There was some evidence from two studies for enteral tube feeding improving nutritional parameters, but this was very low‐certainty evidence. Five studies reported a variety of harm‐related outcomes with inconsistent results. The balance of evidence suggested increased risk of pneumonia with enteral tube feeding. 
None of the included studies assessed behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence that tube feeding improves survival; improves quality of life; reduces pain; reduces mortality; decreases behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia; leads to better nourishment; improves family or carer outcomes such as depression, anxiety, carer burden, or satisfaction with care; and no indication of harm. We found some evidence that there is a clinically significant risk of pressure ulcers from enteral tube feeding. Future research should focus on better reporting and matching of control and intervention groups, and clearly defined interventions, measuring all the outcomes referred to here.

Do feeding tubes help people with severe dementia?

Rationale
Dementia is a brain disease. It harms memory and daily life. In late stages, people may not eat or drink well. They may choke or cough when they try to swallow.

Some people ask if a feeding tube can help. A feeding tube is a soft tube. It brings liquid food to the stomach or small gut. A “PEG tube” goes through the skin into the stomach. A “NG tube” goes in the nose to the stomach. A tube can seem like it will help keep weight and give strength.

Doctors do not agree on this choice. Some guides say tubes may not help and may harm. Still, use of tubes has gone up in some places. This review asked if tube feeds help people live longer or feel better. It also asked if tubes cause harm.

Trial Design
How is this study designed? This was a review of past studies. The team looked for high quality trials. They found no randomized trials. They did find 14 controlled studies. In each one, a care team had chosen who got a tube, and who did not.

The people were adults with severe dementia. All had big limits in thinking and daily tasks. All had poor food and drink intake. The tube types were PEG, NG, or tubes that went past the stomach. The “no tube” group got mouth feeds and care to help them eat.

The team looked for main results. These were how long people lived, quality of life, and bed sores. Bed sores (also called pressure ulcers) are skin sores. They can form when a person stays in one spot too long. The team also looked at pain, comfort, chest lung infection (pneumonia), and carer strain.

The search took place on April 14, 2021. The time people spent in each study was not the same. The reports did not give one set time for follow up.

Results
We are not very sure of the results. This is due to the type of studies. Doctors chose who got a tube. That can sway results. With that in mind, here is what the team found.

Life span
- Four large studies looked at PEG tubes and life span. They found no gain in how long people lived.
- Four studies looked at mixed or not clear tube types. Three small studies found longer life with tubes. One larger study did not find longer life. We are not sure about these results.
- Two small studies looked at NG tubes and death. One found a higher death rate with NG tubes. The other found no change. We are not sure about these results.

Quality of life, pain, and comfort
- No study measured quality of life. That means we do not know if tubes help people feel better day to day.
- One study checked pain and comfort. It found no change with tube feeds.
- In that same study, more carers said they felt a very heavy load when the person had a tube.

Bed sores and other harms
- One large study found more bed sores with PEG tubes.
- Two of three small studies found more bed sores with mixed or not clear tube types. One study found no change.
- Five studies looked at other harms. The results were not the same across studies. Taken as a whole, the risk of pneumonia may be higher with tube feeds.

Food and water status
- Two studies found some better “food status” signs with tubes. These signs were from blood tests. But we are not sure these gains help with how people feel or live.

What this means
- We found no proof that tube feeds help people with severe dementia live longer.
- We found no proof that tubes help with how a person feels or lives day to day.
- We found some proof that tubes raise the risk of bed sores. There may also be more lung infection.
- We did not find proof that tubes lower pain. We did not find proof that tubes help mood or behavior.
- One study found a higher carer load with tubes.

How sure are we?
The studies were not the best kind for clear answers. Doctors chose who got tubes. People in each group may have been quite different at the start. That makes the results less sure. In many areas, we are not very sure. Better trials are needed.

Conclusions from the study team
Based on what we have now, tube feeds did not show clear help for people with severe dementia. We did see signs of harm, like more bed sores. The team calls for better, fair tests in the future. These tests should track life span, how people feel, pain, skin health, lung health, and the carer load.

What you can do
If you face this choice, ask your care team:
- What are the goals of care?
- Will a tube help meet those goals?
- What are the likely harms, like bed sores or lung infection?
- What care can we give by mouth to keep comfort and dignity?

Each person and family is unique. Talk with your team and loved ones. Set a plan that fits your values and needs.","Enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia
What are the advantages and problems of tube feeding people with severe dementia?  
Key messages 
Tube feeding may not increase the length of time people with severe dementia live compared to no tube feeding. The risk of developing a pressure sore is probably higher with a feeding tube than with no tube. No studies looked at quality of life.We need more and better studies to investigate tube feeding people with severe dementia. Future studies should focus on a broader range of outcomes including, pain, quality of life and the impact on carers 
What is tube feeding? 
Somebody who can’t eat or drink through their mouth may be given liquid food through a tube into their stomach. This is called enteral tube feeding. The tube passes through their nose into their stomach (a nasogastric tube), or is inserted into the stomach through a small cut in their belly (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or PEG).  
Why is this important for people with dementia? 
People with dementia often have difficulties eating and drinking. During the early stages of dementia, they may forget to eat, chew food without swallowing, or be confused at mealtimes. Some people experience changes in the taste and smell of food. In the later stages of dementia, people often have difficulties swallowing.  It can be difficult to ensure they receive appropriate food and fluids.  
People with severe dementia need full‐time care, and it is often their families who care for them. It is difficult to decide whether or not to tube‐feed someone with dementia because the feeding tube can be uncomfortable or even painful, and may cause other unwanted effects such as pneumonia, worsen bowel or bladder control, as well as bleeding, swelling and infection. People with severe dementia may be confused or distressed by the tube and may try to remove it.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether tube feeding helps people with severe dementia who have problems with eating and swallowing.  
We were interested in the effect of tube feeding on:
how long people lived; 
their quality of life (well‐being); and 
the development or healing of pressure sores (also known as bed sores).
What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated whether: 
PEG compared to no tube; a nasogastric tube compared to no tube; orPEG, nasogastric and other types of tube feeding compared to no tube 
was effective and whether tube feeding caused any unwanted effects in adults of any age with severe dementia and poor intake of food and drink.  
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We included 14 studies that included 49,714 participants. Of these, 6203 were tube‐fed and 43,511 were not. Participants with no feeding tube were given standard care or standard care with extra treatments to encourage eating and drinking. 
Main results 
In people with severe dementia, compared to no tube feeding:
PEG may make no difference to how long people live (4 studies, 36,816 people), and leads to a small increase in the chance of developing pressure sores (1 study, 4421 people). we don’t know if nasogastric tube feeding increases the length of time people live or increases their chance of developing pressure sores, because none of our included studies gave information about these points. Studies of people with either PEG or nasogastric tubes showed tube feeding may increase the length of time people live (4 studies, 1696 people), and may slightly increase the chance of developing pressure sores (3 studies, 351 people).  
None of our included studies reported quality of life.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We have moderate confidence in our finding that pressure ulcers were more common in people who were fed with a PEG tube. However, we have little to very little confidence for our other findings.  
Three main factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. Firstly, people in the studies were not randomly placed into different treatment groups. This means that differences between the groups could be due to differences between people rather than between the treatments. However, due to ethical considerations it would be very difficult to do this in future studies. Secondly, results were very inconsistent across the different studies. Finally, some studies were very small.  
The results of further research could differ from the results of this review.
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to 14 April 2021.

Why is this review important? 
The medical profession is recognised for its challenging and demanding nature. Medical students and junior doctors have been identified as having increased personal and professional stressors during their years of training. As a result, they face increased strain on their mental well‐being. It is important that this group is supported in their mental well‐being to ensure an overall balance in health, as well as to aid their responsibilities of patient care and patient safety. Furthermore, medical students and junior doctors are often time‐poor. Therefore, it is important to establish whether mindfulness is an effective intervention which justifies its time commitment. There are no previous Cochrane Reviews examining mindfulness in our target population.  
Who will be interested in this review? 
Medical students and junior doctors; other medical professionals at different levels of training and expertise; and institutions such as universities and hospitals involved in the education and training of medical students.  
What question does this review aim to answer? 
What effects do mindfulness‐based psychological interventions have on the mental well‐being of medical students and junior doctors? 
Which studies were included in this review? 
We searched databases to find all studies of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors published up to October 2021. In order to be included in this review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to groups using a random method). Studies needed to include medical students from any year level or junior doctors in postgraduate years one, two or three. We did not exclude any studies based on participants' age, nationality or pre‐existing health conditions. We included 10 studies with a total of 731 participants in the analysis.  
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
Overall, we did not identify any evidence of an effect of mindfulness‐based interventions on anxiety or depression symptoms. However, mindfulness‐based interventions appeared to have a small positive effect on stress and a borderline positive effect on burnout. We were unable to report if mindfulness‐based interventions had any effect on deliberate self‐harm, suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour as no studies examined these outcomes. Lastly, as many studies lacked longer‐term follow‐up of participants, it is not possible to comment on the long‐term effects of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors.  
We rated the overall certainty of evidence as 'low' or 'very low'. 
What should happen next? 
While there were no strong positive findings from the review, some results regarding mindfulness and stress outcomes suggest that there needs to be further research into mindfulness. Any future research should be rigorously designed, and ideally, include assessments of the longer‐term impact of mindfulness.

Mindfulness classes for medical students and new doctors

Rationale
Training to be a doctor is hard. Long hours and high stakes can strain the mind. Many students and new doctors feel stress day to day. This stress can harm sleep, mood, and focus. It can also affect care for patients.

Mindfulness is a set of skills. It teaches you to notice your breath, body, and thoughts. You learn to bring your mind back to the present, with calm and care. Many people use it to ease stress and feel more steady.

Students and new doctors have little free time. So any class must be worth the time it takes. This review asked a clear question. Do mindfulness classes help the mind health of students and new doctors? The team also looked for harm or no change. No past Cochrane review had asked this for this group.

Trial Design
This was a Cochrane Review. A review pulls data from many trials. It gives a big picture view. The team searched for all trials up to October 2021.

They only used random trials. In a random trial, chance puts people into groups. One group joins a mindfulness class. Another group gets usual care or a different class. This helps make the groups fair to compare.

The review looked at medical students in any year. It also looked at new doctors in years one, two, or three after school. The trials did not set limits for age, country, or health. In total, the review found 10 trials. These trials had 731 people.

The trials used a mix of class types. All aimed to teach mindfulness skills. Most trials checked how people felt soon after the class. Few trials checked months later. So we know less about long term change.

Results
The team asked, what did the trials show? They looked at stress, burnout, low mood, and worry. They also looked for self harm and thoughts of self harm. Here is what they found.

Mindfulness classes had a small link to less stress. People in the classes, on average, felt a bit less tense. The drop in stress was not large. But it was there across the trials.

There was a borderline link to less burnout. Burnout is deep work stress. It can show up as low drive, feeling numb, or worn out. The shift was small and not firm. It hints at help, but is not clear.

The review found no sign of help for low mood or worry. The trials did not show that mindfulness eased signs of depression. They also did not show a drop in signs of anxiety.

No trial in the review looked at self harm, thoughts of self harm, or suicidal acts. So we do not know if mindfulness helps or harms these risks.

Most trials did not track people for long. This means we do not know if any gains last. We also do not know if more class time would help more. Or if a shorter class would work as well.

The team rated how sure we can be about these findings. They judged the proof as low or very low. This means the true effect could be different. With better trials, the results may change.

What does this mean for students and new doctors? Mindfulness may help ease stress a little. It may also help, a bit, with burnout. It did not show help for low mood or worry in these trials. We do not know the long term effects. And we do not know its impact on self harm risks.

What does this mean for schools and hospitals? A mindfulness class may give small stress relief. It is not a stand-alone fix. It may be one tool in a wider plan for staff well being. That plan could include fair hours, kind team support, and good sleep time.

What should happen next? We need more strong trials. Future trials should use fair, random group plans. They should also check how people do months after the class. Trials should track low mood, worry, stress, burnout, and safety. They should also report any harms or downsides.

In short, this review gives a careful, early view. Mindfulness may bring small stress gains for this group. It does not yet show help for low mood or worry. We lack data on self harm risks. The proof is not strong at this time. More and better trials can guide schools, hospitals, and trainees on how to use these classes well.","Mindfulness for improving mental well‐being in medical students and junior doctors
Why is this review important? 
The medical profession is recognised for its challenging and demanding nature. Medical students and junior doctors have been identified as having increased personal and professional stressors during their years of training. As a result, they face increased strain on their mental well‐being. It is important that this group is supported in their mental well‐being to ensure an overall balance in health, as well as to aid their responsibilities of patient care and patient safety. Furthermore, medical students and junior doctors are often time‐poor. Therefore, it is important to establish whether mindfulness is an effective intervention which justifies its time commitment. There are no previous Cochrane Reviews examining mindfulness in our target population.  
Who will be interested in this review? 
Medical students and junior doctors; other medical professionals at different levels of training and expertise; and institutions such as universities and hospitals involved in the education and training of medical students.  
What question does this review aim to answer? 
What effects do mindfulness‐based psychological interventions have on the mental well‐being of medical students and junior doctors? 
Which studies were included in this review? 
We searched databases to find all studies of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors published up to October 2021. In order to be included in this review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to groups using a random method). Studies needed to include medical students from any year level or junior doctors in postgraduate years one, two or three. We did not exclude any studies based on participants' age, nationality or pre‐existing health conditions. We included 10 studies with a total of 731 participants in the analysis.  
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
Overall, we did not identify any evidence of an effect of mindfulness‐based interventions on anxiety or depression symptoms. However, mindfulness‐based interventions appeared to have a small positive effect on stress and a borderline positive effect on burnout. We were unable to report if mindfulness‐based interventions had any effect on deliberate self‐harm, suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour as no studies examined these outcomes. Lastly, as many studies lacked longer‐term follow‐up of participants, it is not possible to comment on the long‐term effects of mindfulness in medical students and junior doctors.  
We rated the overall certainty of evidence as 'low' or 'very low'. 
What should happen next? 
While there were no strong positive findings from the review, some results regarding mindfulness and stress outcomes suggest that there needs to be further research into mindfulness. Any future research should be rigorously designed, and ideally, include assessments of the longer‐term impact of mindfulness.

Review question 
We sought to determine if any advanced sperm selection techniques used for assisted reproduction, except for ultra‐high magnification, alter the rates of live birth, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, or foetal abnormalities. 
Background 
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a commonly used treatment for subfertile couples. It is thought that the selection of high‐quality sperm may improve outcomes for these couples. Advanced sperm selection techniques use complex methods to select healthy, mature, and structurally sound sperm for fertilisation. Despite the use of these techniques in many centres worldwide, their effectiveness is unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) with a total of 4147 women. Four studies evaluated sperm selection by their ability to bind to hyaluronic acid during the ICSI process (HA‐ICSI) against ICSI. One study compared HA‐ICSI versus SpermSlow. One study compared HA‐ICSI versus magnetic‐activated cell sorting (MACS) versus ICSI. Three studies compared MACS versus ICSI. One study compared sperm selection by surface charge Zeta potential versus ICSI. Six of the included studies reported rates of live birth; seven reported clinical pregnancy; six reported miscarriage per clinical pregnancy and per woman randomly assigned; and none reported on foetal abnormalities. 
Key results 
The current evidence suggests that advanced sperm selection strategies in assisted reproductive technologist (ART) may not result in an increase in the likelihood of live birth. The only sperm selection technique that potentially increases live birth and clinical pregnancy rates is Zeta sperm selection, yet these results were of very low quality and derived from a single study, therefore we are uncertain of the effect. There is low‐quality evidence that HA‐ICSI decreases miscarriage rates when compared with ICSI. We are uncertain whether the other sperm selection techniques alter clinical pregnancy or miscarriage rates. No studies reported on foetal abnormalities, and further studies of suitable quality are required before any of these advanced sperm selection techniques can be recommended for use in clinical practice. 
Evidence quality 
The evidence gathered was of very low to low quality. The main limitations were imprecision associated with low numbers of participants or events and high risk of performance bias. Data on important clinical outcomes such as foetal abnormalities were absent. 
","Plain Title
Do newer lab ways to pick sperm help IVF or ICSI?

Rationale
Some couples have trouble having a baby. Doctors may use IVF or ICSI to help. In IVF, egg and sperm meet in a lab dish. In ICSI, a doctor puts one sperm into one egg.

Many think the “best” sperm may help start a healthy pregnancy. New lab ways aim to pick sperm that look mature and sound. These ways look at stickiness, charge, or other sperm traits. Many clinics use them, but we do not know if they help.

This study asked a simple question. Do these newer sperm pick methods help people have a live baby? The study also looked at pregnancy seen on a scan, loss of a pregnancy, and birth defects. The hope was that better sperm might improve these outcomes.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team looked for the best kind of test, called randomized trials. In these trials, people go into groups by chance. This helps make fair checks.

The review found eight such trials. In all, there were 4,147 women having fertility care. Some trials used sperm that stick to a natural egg coat gel. This gel is called hyaluronic acid. Doctors then did ICSI with those sperm. This is called HA-ICSI.

Some trials used a magnet method, called MACS. This lab tool aims to remove sperm that may be damaged. One trial used the “Zeta” method. It picks sperm by their outer electric charge. One trial used a gel called SpermSlow. It slows mature sperm, so staff can pick them.

The trials compared these methods to routine ICSI. Some trials also compared one new method to another. The trials reported live birth, pregnancy seen on scan, and miscarriage. None of the trials gave data on birth defects. The trials did not report how long each person was in the trial.

Results
Across all eight trials, newer sperm pick methods did not raise the chance of live birth. In plain words, most methods did not help more people take a baby home. The one method that might help was Zeta. But this came from one small trial. The proof was very weak.

HA-ICSI may lower the chance of miscarriage, compared to ICSI. This finding had low strength. So, we must be careful. It may be true, or it may be chance. We need more and larger trials to be sure.

For MACS, the results were not clear. We cannot say it helps or harms. The same is true for SpermSlow. We do not know if it changes live birth or miscarriage. None of the trials gave data on birth defects. So we cannot say if any method changes that risk.

Why are we not sure? The proof was low or very low in quality. Many trials had few people or few events. This makes results less certain. Some trials also had a risk of bias. This can sway results. Missing birth defect data is a big gap.

What does this mean for patients? Most newer sperm pick ways do not show clear benefit yet. Zeta may help, but we saw that in one small trial only. HA-ICSI may lower miscarriage. But we need more high-quality trials to be sure. Right now, we cannot advise routine use of these new methods.

What should you do next? Ask your clinic to explain your choices. Ask if a method is part of a trial. Ask what proof backs it. Ask about risks, cost, and time. Standard IVF or ICSI stays the main path for many.

In short, here is what this review found:
- New sperm pick methods did not raise live birth overall.
- Zeta may help live birth and pregnancy, but proof is very weak.
- HA-ICSI may lower miscarriage, but proof is low.
- We do not know the effect of MACS or SpermSlow.
- No data on birth defects were given.
- Better trials are needed before clinics should use these methods as standard.

The study team calls for larger, well-run trials. These trials should track live birth and miscarriage. They should also track birth defects. With stronger proof, patients and doctors can choose with more confidence. For now, the clear gain of most of these lab methods is not shown.","Advanced sperm selection techniques for assisted reproduction

10.1002-14651858.CD013263.pub2,"Background
Postoperative pain is common and may be severe. Postoperative administration of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces patient opioid requirements and, in turn, may reduce the incidence and severity of opioid‐induced adverse events (AEs). 
Objectives
To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single‐dose intravenous ketorolac, compared with placebo or an active comparator, for moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases without language restrictions: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS on 20 April 2020. We checked clinical trials registers and reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized double‐blind trials that compared a single postoperative dose of intravenous ketorolac with placebo or another active treatment, for treating acute postoperative pain in adults following any surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was the number of participants in each arm achieving at least 50% pain relief over a four‐ and six‐hour period.Our secondary outcomes were time to and number of participants using rescue medication; withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and for any other cause; and number of participants experiencing any AE, serious AEs (SAEs), and NSAID‐related or opioid‐related AEs.For subgroup analysis, we planned to analyze different doses of parenteral ketorolac separately and to analyze results based on the type of surgery performed.We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 12 studies, involving 1905 participants undergoing various surgeries (pelvic/abdominal, dental, and orthopedic), with 17 to 83 participants receiving intravenous ketorolac in each study. Mean study population ages ranged from 22.5 years to 67.4 years. Most studies administered a dose of ketorolac of 30 mg; one study assessed 15 mg, and another administered 60 mg. 
Most studies had an unclear risk of bias for some domains, particularly allocation concealment and blinding, and a high risk of bias due to small sample size. The overall certainty of evidence for each outcome ranged from very low to moderate. Reasons for downgrading certainty included serious study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision. 
Ketorolac versus placebo 
Very low‐certainty evidence from eight studies (658 participants) suggests that ketorolac results in a large increase in the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over four hours compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 2.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80 to 4.37). The number needed to treat for one additional participant to benefit (NNTB) was 2.4 (95% CI 1.8 to 3.7). Low‐certainty evidence from 10 studies (914 participants) demonstrates that ketorolac may result in a large increase in the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over six hours compared to placebo (RR 3.26, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.51). The NNTB was 2.5 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.7). 
Among secondary outcomes, for time to rescue medication, moderate‐certainty evidence comparing intravenous ketorolac versus placebo demonstrated a mean median of 271 minutes for ketorolac versus 104 minutes for placebo (6 studies, 633 participants). For the number of participants using rescue medication, very low‐certainty evidence from five studies (417 participants) compared ketorolac with placebo. The RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.00), that is, it did not demonstrate a difference between groups. 
Ketorolac probably results in a slight increase in total adverse event rates compared with placebo (74% versus 65%; 8 studies, 810 participants; RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.19; number needed to treat for an additional harmful event (NNTH) 16.7, 95% CI 8.3 to infinite, moderate‐certainty evidence). Serious AEs were rare. Low‐certainty evidence from eight studies (703 participants) did not demonstrate a difference in rates between ketorolac and placebo (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.03). 
Ketorolac versus NSAIDs Ketorolac was compared to parecoxib in four studies and diclofenac in two studies. For our primary outcome, over both four and six hours there was no evidence of a difference between intravenous ketorolac and another NSAID (low‐certainty and moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively). Over four hours, four studies (337 participants) produced an RR of 1.04 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.21) and over six hours, six studies (603 participants) produced an RR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.19). 
For time to rescue medication, low‐certainty evidence from four studies (427 participants) suggested that participants receiving ketorolac waited an extra 35 minutes (mean median 331 minutes versus 296 minutes). For the number of participants using rescue medication, very low‐certainty evidence from three studies (260 participants) compared ketorolac with another NSAID. The RR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.40), that is, there may be little or no difference between groups.   
Ketorolac probably results in a slight increase in total adverse event rates compared with another NSAID (76% versus 68%, 5 studies, 516 participants; RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.23; NNTH 12.5, 95% CI 6.7 to infinite, moderate‐certainty evidence). Serious AEs were rare. Low‐certainty evidence from five studies (530 participants) did not demonstrate a difference in rates between ketorolac and another NSAID (RR 3.18, 95% CI 0.13 to 76.99). Only one of the five studies reported a single serious AE. 
Authors' conclusions
The amount and certainty of evidence for the use of intravenous ketorolac as a treatment for postoperative pain varies across efficacy and safety outcomes and amongst comparators, from very low to moderate. The available evidence indicates that postoperative intravenous ketorolac administration may offer substantial pain relief for most patients, but further research may impact this estimate. Adverse events appear to occur at a slightly higher rate in comparison to placebo and to other NSAIDs. Insufficient information is available to assess whether intravenous ketorolac has a different rate of gastrointestinal or surgical‐site bleeding, renal dysfunction, or cardiovascular events versus other NSAIDs. There was a lack of studies in cardiovascular surgeries and in elderly populations who may be at increased risk for adverse events. 
","1. Plain Title
One dose of ketorolac for pain after surgery

2. Rationale
Many people have strong pain after surgery. Good pain care helps people heal and move. It can also cut the need for strong opioid pain drugs. Opioids can cause side effects and may lead to other harms.

Ketorolac is a non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug, or NSAID. This kind of drug helps with pain and swelling. A one‑time dose of ketorolac goes into a vein. It may ease pain fast after surgery. This review asked if one IV dose works well and if it is safe.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. The team searched medical lists of studies on April 20, 2020. They looked for trials that put people into groups by chance. Neither the people nor the staff knew who got which drug. Each trial gave one dose of ketorolac into a vein after surgery. They compared it to a dummy shot with no drug (placebo) or to another NSAID.

The review found 12 trials with 1,905 adults. The surgeries were dental, belly or pelvic, and bone and joint. The average ages ran from about 22 years to about 67 years. Men and women took part. Most trials used 30 mg of ketorolac. One used 15 mg. One used 60 mg.

The main outcome was pain relief in the first hours. Trials looked for at least half less pain over 4 hours and over 6 hours. They also tracked when people needed extra pain medicine. They recorded side effects and serious side effects.

4. Results
Pain relief versus placebo (no active drug)
In the first 4 hours, more people who got ketorolac had at least half less pain. For every 2 to 3 people who got ketorolac, one more person had strong pain relief, compared to placebo. In the first 6 hours, ketorolac also helped more people reach at least half less pain. Again, about 2 to 3 people needed the drug for one extra person to benefit. The proof for 4 hours was very uncertain. The proof for 6 hours was low in certainty.

People who got ketorolac waited longer before they needed extra pain drug. The wait was about 4 hours and 30 minutes with ketorolac. It was about 1 hour and 45 minutes with placebo. This finding had moderate certainty. The number of people who needed extra pain drug may be about the same. That proof was very uncertain.

Side effects versus placebo
Side effects were common in both groups. About 3 in 4 people on ketorolac had a side effect. About 2 in 3 people on placebo had a side effect. That means about 1 extra person had a side effect for every 17 people who got ketorolac. Serious side effects were rare. The rates looked similar between ketorolac and placebo. This finding had low certainty.

Pain relief versus other NSAIDs
Ketorolac was also compared to other NSAIDs. The other drugs were parecoxib and diclofenac. Over 4 hours and over 6 hours, pain relief was about the same. There was no clear sign of a difference. People on ketorolac waited a little longer before needing extra pain drug. The extra time was about half an hour. The number of people who needed extra pain drug looked about the same.

Side effects versus other NSAIDs
Side effects were common in both groups. About 3 in 4 people on ketorolac had a side effect. About 2 in 3 people on other NSAIDs had a side effect. That means about 1 extra person had a side effect for every 13 people who got ketorolac. Serious side effects were rare and looked similar. Only one serious side effect was reported in one of the five studies that tracked them.

How sure are these results?
The proof ranged from very low to moderate. Many trials were small. Some did not report methods clearly. Results did not always match across trials. This makes the level of certainty lower.

What this means for patients
A one‑time IV dose of ketorolac may give strong pain relief after surgery. It may help many people in the first 4 to 6 hours. It may let people wait longer before they need extra pain drugs. Pain relief looks about the same as with other NSAIDs.

Side effects may be slightly more common with ketorolac than with placebo and than with other NSAIDs. Serious side effects were rare in these trials. There was not enough proof to tell if ketorolac changes the chance of gut bleed, wound bleed, kidney harm, or heart problems, compared to other NSAIDs. Few or no trials looked at heart surgery. Few trials focused on older adults, who may face higher risks.

Bottom line
One IV dose of ketorolac after surgery may help a lot with pain. The chance of side effects may be a bit higher than with no drug and with some other NSAIDs. Serious harms were rare in the trials. More and larger trials are needed. We need better data in older adults and in people who have heart surgery.","What are the benefits and risks of a single injection of ketorolac (an anti‐inflammation medicine) for relieving short‐term pain after surgery in adults? 
Key messages 
· Ketorolac may reduce short‐term pain after surgery by 50% (half) or more in more people than a placebo (dummy treatment).· There may be little to no difference between ketorolac and other anti‐inflammation medicines in the number of people whose pain is reduced by half or more.· Ketorolac probably causes slightly more unwanted effects than placebo and other anti‐inflammation medicines; more evidence is required to establish if it causes serious unwanted effects. 
Treating short‐term pain after surgery 
It is common for people to feel pain in the short term (within six hours) after surgery. Often, medicines called non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are given to relieve this pain. 
NSAIDS work by stopping the body’s production of chemicals that cause inflammation and pain. A potential advantage of using NSAIDs is that they may limit the need for stronger pain‐relief medicine such as opioids. Opioids can cause unwanted (adverse) events such as nausea and vomiting, constipation, breathing problems and allergic reactions. People may become addicted to opioids if they take a lot of them. 
NSAIDs can also cause unwanted effects. These include bleeding at the site of the surgical wound, and potential injury to the kidneys and gut. It is therefore important to weigh the benefits and risks of NSAIDs when considering using them to reduce pain shortly after surgery. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out about the benefits and risks of using a specific NSAID, ketorolac, for relief of short‐term pain after surgery. Ketorolac can be given as an injection, which may be useful when patients cannot take medicines by mouth. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that involved adults (aged over 18) and compared a single injection of ketorolac against: 
· a placebo (dummy treatment); or· another treatment. 
We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 12 studies that involved 1905 people in total. The studies investigated the treatment of pain after surgery on the abdomen, pelvis, teeth, bones, joints and muscles. Most studies (10) treated people with a dose of 30 milligrams of ketorolac. They compared ketorolac against: 
· a placebo;· another NSAID; or· an opioid. 
Here we present the findings from comparisons between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDs. 
Pain reduction 
The evidence suggests that:
· around three times more people may have their pain reduced by 50% (half) or more within six hours of surgery when treated with ketorolac rather than placebo; and· there could be little to no difference between ketorolac and other NSAIDS in the number of people with pain reduced by 50% or more within four or six hours of surgery. 
Need for extra pain medicines (rescue medication) 
Ketorolac could delay the need for rescue medication compared to placebo or other NSAIDs. The evidence is not robust enough to show if fewer people need rescue medicine when treated with ketorolac. 
Adverse effects 
Ketorolac probably causes slightly more adverse effects than placebo and other NSAIDS. Serious adverse effects (such as blood collecting in the muscles around the abdomen, causing severe pain) were rare in the studies we found; the evidence suggested there may be little to no difference in the number of serious adverse events between ketorolac and placebo or other NSAIDS. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Studies were small, and most may have been conducted in ways that could introduce errors into their results. This limited our confidence in the evidence. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is up to date to April 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD013307.pub3,"Background
Delirium is an acute neuropsychological disorder that is common in hospitalised patients. It can be distressing to patients and carers and it is associated with serious adverse outcomes. Treatment options for established delirium are limited and so prevention of delirium is desirable. Non‐pharmacological interventions are thought to be important in delirium prevention.  
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of non‐pharmacological interventions designed to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients outside intensive care units (ICU). 
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, with additional searches conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization Portal/ICTRP to 16 September 2020. There were no language or date restrictions applied to the electronic searches, and no methodological filters were used to restrict the search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single and multicomponent non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised adults cared for outside intensive care or high dependency settings. We only included non‐pharmacological interventions which were designed and implemented to prevent delirium.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently examined titles and abstracts identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data from full‐text articles. Any disagreements on eligibility and inclusion were resolved by consensus. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcomes were: incidence of delirium; inpatient and later mortality; and new diagnosis of dementia. We included secondary and adverse outcomes as pre‐specified in the review protocol. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes and between‐group mean differences for continuous outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. A complementary exploratory analysis was undertaker using a Bayesian component network meta‐analysis fixed‐effect model to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the individual components of multicomponent interventions and describe which components were most strongly associated with reducing the incidence of delirium. 
Main results
We included 22 RCTs that recruited a total of 5718 adult participants. Fourteen trials compared a multicomponent delirium prevention intervention with usual care. Two trials compared liberal and restrictive blood transfusion thresholds. The remaining six trials each investigated a different non‐pharmacological intervention. Incidence of delirium was reported in all studies.  
Using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, we identified risks of bias in all included trials. All were at high risk of performance bias as participants and personnel were not blinded to the interventions. Nine trials were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors and three more were at unclear risk in this domain.  
Pooled data showed that multi‐component non‐pharmacological interventions probably reduce the incidence of delirium compared to usual care (10.5% incidence in the intervention group, compared to 18.4% in the control group, risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.71, I2 = 39%; 14 studies; 3693 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias).  
There may be little or no effect of multicomponent interventions on inpatient mortality compared to usual care (5.2% in the intervention group, compared to 4.5% in the control group, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.74, I2 = 15%; 10 studies; 2640 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision).  
No studies of multicomponent interventions reported data on new diagnoses of dementia. 
Multicomponent interventions may result in a small reduction of around a day in the duration of a delirium episode (mean difference (MD) ‐0.93, 95% CI ‐2.01 to 0.14 days, I2 = 65%; 351 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of multicomponent interventions on delirium severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.49, 95% CI ‐1.13 to 0.14, I2=64%; 147 participants; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and serious imprecision). Multicomponent interventions may result in a reduction in hospital length of stay compared to usual care (MD ‐1.30 days, 95% CI ‐2.56 to ‐0.04 days, I2=91%; 3351 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and inconsistency), but little to no difference in new care home admission at the time of hospital discharge (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.07; 536 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). Reporting of other adverse outcomes was limited.  
Our exploratory component network meta‐analysis found that re‐orientation (including use of familiar objects), cognitive stimulation and sleep hygiene were associated with reduced risk of incident delirium. Attention to nutrition and hydration, oxygenation, medication review, assessment of mood and bowel and bladder care were probably associated with a reduction in incident delirium but estimates included the possibility of no benefit or harm.  Reducing sensory deprivation, identification of infection, mobilisation and pain control all had summary estimates that suggested potential increases in delirium incidence, but the uncertainty in the estimates was substantial.  
Evidence from two trials suggests that use of a liberal transfusion threshold over a restrictive transfusion threshold probably results in little to no difference in incident delirium (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.36; I2 = 9%; 294 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias).  
Six other interventions were examined, but evidence for each was limited to single studies and we identified no evidence of delirium prevention.  
Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence regarding the benefit of multicomponent non‐pharmacological interventions for the prevention of delirium in hospitalised adults, estimated to reduce incidence by 43% compared to usual care. We found no evidence of an effect on mortality. There is emerging evidence that these interventions may reduce hospital length of stay, with a trend towards reduced delirium duration, although the effect on delirium severity remains uncertain. Further research should focus on implementation and detailed analysis of the components of the interventions to support more effective, tailored practice recommendations.

Simple hospital care steps may help prevent sudden confusion (delirium)

Rationale
Delirium is a sudden change in the mind. A person may feel mixed up, sleepy, or very alert. They may not know where they are. This can be scary for them and their family.

Delirium is common in people who are in the hospital. It can lead to bad outcomes. It can last days or longer. Once delirium starts, there are few good treatments. So, it is best to try to stop it before it starts.

Many hospital care steps do not use pills. These include help with sleep, food and drink, vision and hearing aids, and calm talk to remind a person where they are. These steps may help prevent delirium. This study asked: do such “non‑drug” steps prevent delirium in adults in the hospital?

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. The team looked for high‑quality trials that compare groups by chance. They looked at adults in the hospital, but not in intensive care. Both men and women were in these trials.

The team found 22 trials. These trials had 5,718 adults in total. In many trials, the care team used a plan with several steps at once. We call this a “multi‑step program.” Other trials tested one step at a time. Two trials looked at when to give a blood transfusion, sooner or later.

People stayed in the trials while they were in the hospital. The main thing the trials checked was how many people got delirium. Some trials also checked deaths in the hospital and after. Some trials looked at how long delirium lasted and how long people stayed in the hospital.

Results
Main finding: Multi‑step non‑drug programs probably lower the chance of delirium. With these programs, about 11 out of 100 people got delirium. With usual care, about 18 out of 100 people got delirium. That means about 7 fewer people out of 100 had delirium when the program was used. The team feels fairly sure about this result.

These programs may not change the risk of death in the hospital. In the trials, death in the hospital was about the same with the program and with usual care. The team is less sure about this result.

None of the trials of multi‑step programs reported new cases of dementia after the hospital stay. So we do not know if these programs change the chance of later dementia.

If delirium did happen, the program may help shorten it by about one day. But the team is not very sure about this. We do not know if the program makes delirium milder. The data were small and mixed.

The programs may help people leave the hospital a little sooner. On average, people went home about one day earlier. But results were not the same in all trials. So we should be careful in how we read this.

Moving to a care home at discharge was about the same with or without the program. Few trials checked this. Reports of side effects were also limited.

What parts of a program may help most? An extra analysis looked at single parts in the multi‑step plans. Three parts were linked with less delirium:
- Re‑orienting the person, like with calm talk and familiar objects
- Brain and memory tasks, like simple games or talk
- Good sleep habits, like quiet time at night and light in the day

Other parts may also help, but we are less sure. These include:
- Food and drink support
- Oxygen as needed
- Check of all medicines
- Mood checks
- Bowel and bladder care

Some parts had mixed signs and may or may not help. The data were not clear. These include:
- Help to avoid loss of senses (like hearing or vision)
- Checks for infection
- Help to move more
- Pain control

Two trials tested when to give a blood transfusion. Giving blood sooner versus later did not seem to change how often delirium happened.

Six other single‑step methods were each tested in only one trial. There was no clear proof that any of them alone stopped delirium.

How sure are these results?
Many trials had limits. People and staff knew who got the program. This can affect results. In some trials, the person who checked for delirium also knew who got the program. That can also affect results. Still, the main finding was steady across many trials.

What does this mean for patients and families?
Simple, non‑drug care steps can help. A plan that uses several steps at once seems to work best. These plans can be safe and fit most hospital wards. They may keep the mind clear, shorten the stay, and may shorten delirium if it happens.

Delirium still can happen. These steps do not seem to change the risk of death. We do not know if they change the chance of later dementia. More research can show which steps matter most. It can also show how to make these plans work in real life, for each person.

Bottom line
In adults in the hospital (not in intensive care), a set of simple, non‑drug care steps probably lowers the number of people who get delirium. The best parts seem to be calm re‑orienting, brain and memory tasks, and better sleep. These plans may also help people go home a bit sooner. More study can help fine‑tune these steps for each patient.","Non‐drug approaches for preventing delirium in adults receiving care in hospital outside of intensive care and high dependency units 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for non‐pharmacological (non‐medication‐based) approaches to prevent delirium in adults in hospital, not including those treated in intensive care units (ICU, specialised wards for the care of critically ill patients). 
Background 
Delirium is an important illness which is common among adults, especially older adults who are in hospital. It is sometimes referred to as an 'acute confusional state'. Typically, a person with delirium has sudden onset of confusion, which fluctuates, and often includes impaired concentration, memory and thinking skills; reduced awareness of surroundings; drowsiness or agitation and restlessness; and hallucinations, which are usually visual (seeing things which are not really there). It can be distressing for the individual with delirium and their family. It is also associated with increased risks of complications, such as dying in hospital, having a longer hospital stay, and requiring more care after discharge. Increasingly, there is evidence that delirium is associated with an increased risk of permanent worsening of memory and thinking skills, including development or worsening of dementia.  
Non‐pharmacological approaches are approaches which do not use medications, but which focus on other aspects of care. They are already recognised as important in reducing the risk of delirium, particularly multicomponent interventions which target several of the common risk factors for delirium. It is not known which components of these complex interventions are most important in preventing delirium and this was something we wanted to find out.  
Study characteristics 
We searched up to 16 September 2020 for reports of studies in which people in hospital were randomly allocated to a non‐pharmacological intervention intended to prevent delirium or to usual hospital care.  We found 22 studies with 5718 participants. Fourteen of the studies were of multicomponent approaches; two studies looked at different cut‐offs for giving a blood transfusion after an orthopaedic operation; the remaining six studies all considered different approaches. 
Key findings 
Multicomponent approaches probably reduce occurrence of delirium by 43% compared to usual hospital care. This means that two in five cases of delirium in adults in hospital wards (other than ICU) can be prevented by multicomponent, non‐pharmacological approaches. These interventions may also reduce the length of time people stay in hospital and, if delirium does occur, they may reduce the duration of the delirium episode by about a day. However, these approaches may have little or no effect on the risk of dying in hospital. The studies did not investigate the effect of multicomponent interventions on the development or worsening of dementia. There was little information about whether the interventions had any harmful effects.  
Using a new statistical technique, we found  that the following components within each intervention were most important for preventing delirium:  (a) trying to keep people well‐oriented to their surroundings and making their surroundings more familiar, (b) providing stimulation to memory and thinking skills, and (c) trying to improve sleep (through sleep hygiene measures). We could not be so certain about the effect of other components, largely because not enough evidence was available. More research is needed comparing the specific components included in multicomponent interventions to help determine the most effective and efficient ways to prevent delirium.  
The evidence for other, single‐component, non‐pharmacological interventions was very limited.  
Certainty of the evidence 
There were some limitations in the studies which may affect the results. In many included studies the people in the study and sometimes researchers were aware of who was and was not receiving the intervention.  
There was very little information about people living with dementia, who are at greater risk of experiencing delirium.  
External funding 
Funding to support researchers to undertake this review was received from the National Institute for Health Research (Incentive Award 130725) and Medical Research Scotland (Vacation Scholarship).

10.1002-14651858.CD013218.pub2,"Background
Plasmodium vivax (P vivax) is a focus of malaria elimination. It is important because P vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection are co‐endemic in some areas. There are asymptomatic carriers of P vivax, and the treatment for P vivax and Plasmodium ovale malaria differs from that used in other types of malaria. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) will help distinguish P vivax from other malaria species to help treatment and elimination. There are RDTs available that detect P vivax parasitaemia through the detection of P vivax‐specific lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) antigens. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for detecting P vivax malaria infection in people living in malaria‐endemic areas who present to ambulatory healthcare facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria; and to identify which types and brands of commercial tests best detect P vivax malaria. 
Search methods
We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases up to 30 July 2019: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S), both in the Web of Science. 
Selection criteria
Studies comparing RDTs with a reference standard (microscopy or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) in blood samples from patients attending ambulatory health facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria in P vivax‐endemic areas. 
Data collection and analysis
For each included study, two review authors independently extracted data using a pre‐piloted data extraction form. The methodological quality of the studies were assessed using a tailored Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 (QUADAS‐2) tool. We grouped studies according to commercial brand of the RDT and performed meta‐analysis when appropriate. The results given by the index tests were based on the antibody affinity (referred to as the strength of the bond between an antibody and an antigen) and avidity (referred to as the strength of the overall bond between a multivalent antibody and multiple antigens). All analyses were stratified by the type of reference standard. The bivariate model was used to estimate the pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), this model was simplified when studies were few. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 10 studies that assessed the accuracy of six different RDT brands (CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test, Falcivax Device Rapid test, Immuno‐Rapid Malaria Pf/Pv test, SD Bioline Malaria Ag Pf/Pv test, OnSite Pf/Pv test and Test Malaria Pf/Pv rapid test) for detecting P vivax malaria. One study directly compared the accuracy of two RDT brands. Of the 10 studies, six used microscopy, one used PCR, two used both microscopy and PCR separately and one used microscopy corrected by PCR as the reference standard. Four of the studies were conducted in Ethiopia, two in India, and one each in Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia and Sudan. 
The studies often did not report how patients were selected. In the patient selection domain, we judged the risk of bias as unclear for nine studies. We judged all studies to be of unclear applicability concern. In the index test domain, we judged most studies to be at low risk of bias, but we judged nine studies to be of unclear applicability concern. There was poor reporting on lot testing, how the RDTs were stored, and background parasitaemia density (a key variable determining diagnostic accuracy of RDTs). Only half of the included studies were judged to be at low risk of bias in the reference standard domain, Studies often did not report whether the results of the reference standard could classify the target condition or whether investigators knew the results of the RDT when interpreting the results of the reference standard. All 10 studies were judged to be at low risk of bias in the flow and timing domain. 
Only two brands were evaluated by more than one study. Four studies evaluated the CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test against microscopy and two studies evaluated the Falcivax Device Rapid test against microscopy. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 99% (95% CI 94% to 100%; 251 patients, moderate‐certainty evidence) and 99% (95% CI 99% to 100%; 2147 patients, moderate‐certainty evidence) for CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test. 
For a prevalence of 20%, about 206 people will have a positive CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test result and the remaining 794 people will have a negative result. Of the 206 people with positive results, eight will be incorrect (false positives), and of the 794 people with a negative result, two would be incorrect (false negative). 
For the Falcivax Device Rapid test, the pooled sensitivity was 77% (95% CI: 53% to 91%, 89 patients, low‐certainty evidence) and the pooled specificity was 99% (95% CI: 98% to 100%, 621 patients, moderate‐certainty evidence), respectively. For a prevalence of 20%, about 162 people will have a positive Falcivax Device Rapid test result and the remaining 838 people will have a negative result. Of the 162 people with positive results, eight will be incorrect (false positives), and of the 838 people with a negative result, 46 would be incorrect (false negative). 
Authors' conclusions
The CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test was found to be highly sensitive and specific in comparison to microscopy for detecting P vivax in ambulatory healthcare in endemic settings, with moderate‐certainty evidence. The number of studies included in this review was limited to 10 studies and we were able to estimate the accuracy of 2 out of 6 RDT brands included, the CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test and the Falcivax Device Rapid test. Thus, the differences in sensitivity and specificity between all the RDT brands could not be assessed. More high‐quality studies in endemic field settings are needed to assess and compare the accuracy of RDTs designed to detect P vivax. 
","1. Plain Title
How well do quick blood tests find P. vivax malaria?

2. Rationale
Malaria is an illness spread by a mosquito bite. It can cause fever, chills, and pain. Without care, it can be severe. There are many malaria germs. Two main ones are P. vivax and P. falciparum. In some places, both are common.

Doctors must know which kind a person has. The drugs can be different for each kind. P. vivax can also hide with no clear signs. People can carry it and still spread it. So, fast and correct tests are key.

Quick tests, called rapid tests, use a small blood sample. They look for a tiny protein from the malaria germ. For P. vivax, this protein is from the germ’s LDH. If the test finds that protein, it shows a line on the strip.

This review asked two clear questions. Do these quick tests find P. vivax well in clinics? Which brand works best in real life care?

3. Trial Design
This was a review of past research. The team looked for all good studies up to mid‑2019. They found studies from clinics in six countries. These were Ethiopia, India, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, and Sudan. All sites were in places where P. vivax is common.

People came to a clinic with signs of malaria. A nurse or doctor took a blood sample. Staff ran a quick test to check for P. vivax. Staff also ran a lab check to be sure. The lab check looked at blood under a scope. Some sites also used a DNA test, called PCR.

Each person gave the sample in one clinic visit. The review found 10 studies. They looked at six brands of quick tests. Two brands had more than one study. These were CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo and Falcivax Device Rapid.

The team grouped the studies by brand. They added the results when this made sense. They also rated how much they could trust each study. Many reports left out key facts. This makes trust lower for some results.

4. Results
The main point was how often the test was right. One part asks, does the test find people who have P. vivax? The other asks, does it say no when a person does not have it? The review used simple counts to explain this.

CareStart had very strong results in clinics. It found almost all true cases. It also gave very few wrong yes answers. Here is a way to see this. Think of 1000 people at a clinic. About 200 of them have P. vivax.

With CareStart, about 206 will test yes. About eight of these yes results will be wrong. About 794 will test no. About two of these no results will be wrong. The team feels fairly sure about these CareStart results.

Falcivax had mixed results. It gave few wrong yes answers. But it missed more people who did have P. vivax. Use the same 1000 people idea. Again, about 200 have P. vivax.

With Falcivax, about 162 will test yes. About eight of these yes results will be wrong. About 838 will test no. About 46 of these no results will be wrong. The team is less sure about the Falcivax results.

What do these results mean for you? A good quick test can guide the right drug fast. It can help you feel better sooner. It can also help stop the spread to others. In places with more than one kind of malaria, a right answer matters a lot. It helps staff pick the best care for you.

This review also found some weak points in the reports. Many studies did not say how they chose people. Many did not say how they stored the tests. Few gave the level of germs in the blood. These facts can change how well a test works. So we must be careful when we read the numbers.

Only two brands had enough data to judge well. Four other brands had just one small study each. We cannot rate those brands here. We need more good studies in real clinics. These should report key facts in clear ways.

In short, the CareStart Pf/Pv Combo test worked very well in these clinic studies. The Falcivax Device Rapid test missed more true cases. Other test brands need more study. More clear and careful work will help clinics choose the best test. This can help patients and can aid plans to end P. vivax malaria.","Rapid tests for diagnosing malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax in people living in areas where malaria is very common 
What is the aim of the review? 
Malaria infection is caused mainly by two species of malaria parasite: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The aim of this review was to evaluate rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to diagnose P vivax infection. 
Why are rapid tests for P vivax malaria important? 
For clinical management, knowing which parasite species is causing the malaria is important as the drug treatments differ. For P vivax infection, an additional drug is required to eliminate the infection from the liver. For public health control of malaria, we know that P falciparum is declining over the previous 15 years, and infections from P vivax have therefore increased in importance. 
What was studied in this review? 
RDTs provide results quickly and are often as a dipstick. We studied RDTs that specifically test for P vivax malaria. RDTs are simple to use, point‐of‐care tests. They are suitable for use in rural settings by primary healthcare workers, using drop of blood on the dipstick that causes colour change and a distinct line that indicates a positive test result. Healthcare workers in rural areas can perform RDTs for P vivax without needing a laboratory or special equipment. We wanted to find out which brands of RDTs were the most accurate for diagnosing P vivax malaria. We compared the new tests against the standard form of diagnosis with microscopy, and also more recent methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR): a molecular method to identify P vivax DNA in blood samples. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We included 10 studies that looked at the accuracy of six diagnostic test brands for detecting P vivax malaria in people with suspected malaria symptoms. The studies were conducted in Ethiopia (four studies), India (two studies) and Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, and Sudan (one study each). 
Compared with microscopy, the Care Start Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test performed well with 99% sensitivity and specificity (four studies). This means that: 
• for every 100 people tested who have P vivax malaria, one person will have a negative test result, and might not receive the right treatment soon enough; 
• for every 100 people tested who do not have P vivax malaria, one will have a positive result, and might receive unnecessary treatment. 
Compared with microscopy, the Falcivax Device Rapid test had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 99% (two studies). This means that: 
• For every 100 people tested who have P vivax malaria, 23 people will have a negative test result; and, 
• for every 100 people tested who do not have P vivax malaria, one person will have a positive result. 
We are moderately confident (certain) in the accuracy results for the Care Start Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test. The results are from a small number of studies (four), so our findings may change when results from further studies become available. 
We are less confident in the accuracy results for the Falcivax Device Rapid test, because these came from only two studies. Our findings for this test will probably change when results from further studies become available. 
Our results are based on a small number of studies, so we could not reliably assess all six brands of antibody test or compare their accuracy. Most studies included in this review had limitations: it was not clear how people were selected for testing, or how the study results were assessed and checked, which could have affected the results. Some rapid antibody tests were investigated by only one study. Some studies did not report clearly how common P malaria was in the area where the study was done. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?

10.1002-14651858.CD013339.pub2,"Background
People with dementia in nursing homes often experience pain, but often do not receive adequate pain therapy. The experience of pain has a significant impact on quality of life in people with dementia, and is associated with negative health outcomes. Untreated pain is also considered to be one of the causes of challenging behaviour, such as agitation or aggression, in this population. One approach to reducing pain in people with dementia in nursing homes is an algorithm‐based pain management strategy, i.e. the use of a structured protocol that involves pain assessment and a series of predefined treatment steps consisting of various non‐pharmacological and pharmacological pain management interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of algorithm‐based pain management interventions to reduce pain and challenging behaviour in people with dementia living in nursing homes. 
To describe the components of the interventions and the content of the algorithms.
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 30 June 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of algorithm‐based pain management interventions for people with dementia living in nursing homes. All interventions had to include an initial pain assessment, a treatment algorithm (a treatment plan consisting of at least two different non‐pharmacological or pharmacological treatment steps to reduce pain), and criteria to assess the success of each treatment step. The control groups could receive usual care or an active control intervention. Primary outcomes for this review were pain‐related outcomes, e.g. the number of participants with pain (self‐ or proxy‐rated), challenging behaviour (we used a broad definition that could also include agitation or behavioural and psychological symptoms assessed with any validated instrument), and serious adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected the articles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of all included studies. We reported results narratively as there were too few studies for a meta‐analysis. We used GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the results. 
Main results
We included three cluster‐randomised controlled trials with a total of 808 participants (mean age 82 to 89 years). In two studies, participants had severe cognitive impairment and in one study mild to moderate impairment. The algorithms used in the studies varied in the number of treatment steps. The comparator was pain education for nursing staff in two studies and usual care in one study. 
We judged the risk of detection bias to be high in one study. The risk of selection bias and performance bias was unclear in all studies. 
Self‐rated pain (i.e. pain rated by participants themselves) was reported in two studies. In one study, all residents in the nursing homes were included, but fewer than half of the participants experienced pain at baseline, and the mean values of self‐rated and proxy‐rated pain at baseline and follow‐up in both study groups were below the threshold of pain that may require treatment. We considered the evidence from this study to be very low‐certainty and therefore are uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had an effect on self‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education (MD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.05, 170 participants; Verbal Descriptor Scale, range 0 to 3). In the other study, all participants had mild to moderate pain at baseline. Here, we found low‐certainty evidence that an algorithm‐based pain management intervention may have little to no effect on self‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education (MD 0.4, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 1.38, 246 participants; Iowa Pain Thermometer, range 0 to 12). 
Pain was rated by proxy in all three studies. Again, we considered the evidence from the study in which mean pain scores indicated no pain, or almost no pain, at baseline to be very low‐certainty and were uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had an effect on proxy‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education. For participants with mild to moderate pain at baseline, we found low‐certainty evidence that an algorithm‐based pain management intervention may reduce proxy‐rated pain intensity in comparison with usual care (MD ‐1.49, 95% CI ‐2.11 to ‐0.87, 1 study, 128 participants; Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale‐Chinese version, range 0 to 10), but may not be more effective than pain education (MD ‐0.2, 95% CI ‐0.79 to 0.39, 1 study, 383 participants; Iowa Pain Thermometer, range 0 to 12). 
For challenging behaviour, we found very low‐certainty evidence from one study in which mean pain scores indicated no pain, or almost no pain, at baseline. We were uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had any more effect than education for nursing staff on challenging behaviour of participants (MD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐1.88 to 1.46, 1 study, 170 participants; Cohen‐Mansfield Agitation Inventory‐Chinese version, range 7 to 203). 
None of the studies systematically assessed adverse effects or serious adverse effects and no study reported information about the occurrence of any adverse effect. None of the studies assessed any of the other outcomes of this review. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no clear evidence for a benefit of an algorithm‐based pain management intervention in comparison with pain education for reducing pain intensity or challenging behaviour in people with dementia in nursing homes. We found that the intervention may reduce proxy‐rated pain compared with usual care. However, the certainty of evidence is low because of the small number of studies, small sample sizes, methodological limitations, and the clinical heterogeneity of the study populations (e.g. pain level and cognitive status). The results should be interpreted with caution. Future studies should also focus on the implementation of algorithms and their impact in clinical practice. 
","1. Plain Title
Can a step-by-step pain care plan help people with dementia in nursing homes?

2. Rationale
Dementia makes it hard to think, speak, and remember. Many people with dementia also feel pain. Pain can lower joy in life. It can also lead to hard acts, like pacing, yelling, or harm to self or others.

Staff may miss pain in people with dementia. Some people cannot say they hurt. As a result, pain may not get the right care. Poor pain care is a burden to the person, staff, and family.

A step-by-step pain care plan may help. It starts with a pain check. Then it uses set steps to treat pain. These steps can use non-drug care, drug care, or both. The plan then checks if the steps work. The idea is simple: assess, treat, and check again. This review asked if this kind of plan can ease pain and hard acts in people with dementia in nursing homes.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of research studies. The team looked for the best kind of test. In these tests, groups got care by chance, not by choice. In some tests, whole nursing homes got one way of care or another.

The review found three such tests. In all, the tests had 808 people. Most were age 82 to 89. All lived in nursing homes and had dementia. In two tests, most had severe memory and thinking loss. In one test, people had mild to moderate loss.

Each test used a step-by-step pain care plan. Each plan had a pain check. Each plan used two or more steps to treat pain. Steps could be non-drug care, drug care, or both. The plan also told staff how to see if each step worked.

The tests compared the plan to other care. Two tests compared the plan to staff pain class alone. One test compared the plan to usual care. The time each person was in the tests was not clear in this summary.

The main results looked at pain and hard acts. Pain was rated in two ways. Some people rated their own pain. Staff rated pain for people who could not. Hard acts meant things like unrest, anger, or upset acts.

4. Results
What did the review find? The three tests did not all agree. The people and plans were not the same in each test. Some people had little or no pain at the start. Some had mild to moderate pain. This is key when we read the results.

Self-rated pain means the person rated their own pain. Two tests looked at this. In one test, most people had little or no pain to start. The scores were low in both groups. The plan did not show a clear gain over staff class. In the other test, people had mild to moderate pain to start. The plan did not seem to help more than staff class.

Staff-rated pain means staff rated pain for the person. All three tests looked at this. In people with mild to moderate pain to start, the plan may have helped more than usual care. In a different test, the plan did not seem to help more than staff class. In the test where people had little or no pain to start, we cannot tell if the plan helped.

What about hard acts? One test looked at this. In that test, most people had little or no pain to start. The plan did not seem to help more than staff class. We cannot say if the plan would help people who hurt more at the start.

Were there side effects? The tests did not track side effects in a set way. They did not report any side effects. We cannot say if the plan is safer or less safe than other care.

What do these results mean? A step-by-step pain care plan may help when staff rate pain and people start with pain. It may help more than usual care. But it may not help more than a good staff pain class. When people rate their own pain, the plan did not show clear gains. The plan did not show clear gains for hard acts in the one test that checked this.

We must be careful with these findings. There were only three tests. The tests had small groups. The people and plans were not the same. The way pain was checked was not the same. This makes it hard to be sure.

Why does this matter? Pain care in dementia is hard. Staff need clear tools and steps. A plan can guide care in a busy home. Yet, we need more and better tests. Future work should show how to use these plans in real life. It should track both help and harm. It should also test plans in people who have clear pain at the start.

Bottom line: We do not have clear proof that a step-by-step pain care plan works better than a staff pain class. The plan may help more than usual care when staff rate pain and people start with pain. More high-quality tests are needed to know for sure.","Step‐by‐step (algorithm‐based) pain management for people with dementia living in nursing homes 
What is the aim of this review? 
We were interested in how nurses can best manage pain in people with dementia living in nursing homes. Pain management involves measuring pain and providing pain treatment if necessary. We aimed to find out whether step‐by‐step guidance (an algorithm) for nurses on how to manage pain can reduce pain or behaviours that may indicate someone is in distress (such as hitting, shouting or wandering). 
What was studied in the review? 
People with dementia in nursing homes often experience pain. However, they cannot always tell their caregivers if they are in pain, so it can be difficult to recognise, and we know that nursing home residents with dementia receive less pain medication than those without dementia. Untreated pain can have a negative impact on well‐being and health, and can also be one reason for challenging behaviour, such as aggression. The use of detailed step‐by‐step guidance for nursing staff, in this review called an algorithm, is designed to improve pain management. Algorithms start with a structured pain assessment and then set out different treatment steps, which can be non‐medication or medication treatments for reducing pain. If pain is detected, the treatment described in the first step is applied. If this treatment does not reduce pain, the treatment from the next step is applied, and so on. 
Studies included in the review 
In June 2021 we searched for trials that investigated pain management based on the use of an algorithm. We found three studies including 808 participants. Two of these studies compared algorithm‐based pain management with education for the nursing staff on pain and dementia, and one study compared algorithm‐based pain management with usual care. 
The level of pain and the severity of the participants' dementia differed in the three studies. One study included all the residents in the nursing homes, most of whom had no pain, or almost no pain, at the start of the study (fewer than half of the included people experienced pain), and two studies included only people with mild to moderate pain. In one study the participants' dementia was of mild or moderate severity and in two studies the participants had severe dementia. 
In two studies, those people with dementia who were able to do so reported on their own pain and the nursing staff also judged whether the participants showed signs of pain. In the third study, pain was rated by members of the research team, but not by the participants themselves. The nurses and the researchers used observations of things like facial expressions, gestures and breathing to judge whether someone was in pain. 
What are the key findings? 
When we looked at the study in which people started out on average with no pain, or almost no pain, we could not be certain whether algorithm‐based pain management had an effect on the intensity of pain they experienced during the study. This was true whether the study participants reported on their own pain or whether nurses judged pain intensity. We also could not tell from this study whether algorithm‐based pain management reduced challenging behaviour. 
For people who started out with mild to moderate pain, we found that, compared to education for nursing staff, algorithm‐based pain management may have little or no effect on pain intensity reported by the people themselves (based on the results from one study). When the pain was rated by somebody else (a 'proxy', who was a nurse or research assistant), we found that algorithm‐based pain management may be better than usual care, although it may not be more effective than pain education. However, it is difficult to be sure about the accuracy of pain ratings made by other people. 
Our confidence in the results was limited because of the small number of included studies, the variation in the intensity of pain and in the severity of the participants' dementia at the start of the trials, and the quality of the studies. 
No study looked for harmful effects, and no study described that any harmful effects occurred. 
What is the conclusion? 
We found no good evidence that introducing an algorithm to guide pain management for people with dementia in nursing homes is any better than education for nursing staff for reducing pain or challenging behaviours, but it may be better than usual care at reducing pain (rated by observers). The amount of evidence was small, and we could not be certain of the results. More research in this area would be valuable.

10.1002-14651858.CD013240.pub2,"Background
Endometriosis is known to have an impact on fertility and it is common for women affected by endometriosis to require fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), to improve the chance of pregnancy. It has been postulated that long‐term gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy prior to IVF or ICSI can improve pregnancy outcomes. This systematic review supersedes the previous Cochrane Review on this topic (Sallam 2006). 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of long‐term gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy (minimum 3 months) versus no pretreatment or other pretreatment modalities, such as long‐term continuous combined oral contraception (COC) or surgical therapy of endometrioma, before standard in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women with endometriosis. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases from their inception to 8 January 2019: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL via the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Studies ONLINE (CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We searched trial registries to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We also searched DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), Web of Knowledge, OpenGrey, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), PubMed, Google and reference lists from relevant papers for any other relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving women with surgically diagnosed endometriosis that compared use of any type of GnRH agonist for at least three months before an IVF/ICSI protocol to no pretreatment or other pretreatment modalities, specifically use of long‐term continuous COC (minimum of 6 weeks) or surgical excision of endometrioma within six months prior to standard IVF/ICSI. The primary outcomes were live birth rate and complication rate per woman randomised. 
Data collection and analysis
Two independent review authors assessed studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third review author was consulted, if required. We contacted the study authors, as required. We analysed dichotomous outcomes using Mantel‐Haenszel risk ratios (RRs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and a fixed‐effect model. For small numbers of events, we used a Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI instead. We analysed continuous outcomes using the mean difference (MD) between groups and presented with 95% CIs. We studied heterogeneity of the studies via the I2 statistic. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. 
Main results
We included eight parallel‐design RCTs, involving a total of 640 participants. We did not assess any of the studies as being at low risk of bias across all domains, with the main limitation being lack of blinding. Using GRADE methodology, the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to low quality. 
Long‐term GnRH agonist therapy versus no pretreatment 
We are uncertain whether long‐term GnRH agonist therapy affects the live birth rate (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.87; 1 RCT, n = 147; I2 not calculable; very low‐quality evidence) or the overall complication rate (Peto OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.37; to 4.14; 3 RCTs, n = 318; I2 = 73%; very low‐quality evidence) compared to standard IVF/ICSI. Further, we are uncertain whether this intervention affects the clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.41; 6 RCTs, n = 552, I2 = 66%; very low‐quality evidence), multiple pregnancy rate (Peto OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.56; 2 RCTs, n = 208, I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence), miscarriage rate (Peto OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.00; 2 RCTs, n = 208; I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence), mean number of oocytes (MD 0.72, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.38; 4 RCTs, n = 385; I2 = 81%; very low‐quality evidence) or mean number of embryos (MD ‐0.76, 95% CI ‐1.33 to ‐0.19; 2 RCTs, n = 267; I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). 
Long‐term GnRH agonist therapy versus long‐term continuous COC 
No studies reported on this comparison.
Long‐term GnRH agonist therapy versus surgical therapy of endometrioma 
No studies reported on this comparison.
Authors' conclusions
This review raises important questions regarding the merit of long‐term GnRH agonist therapy compared to no pretreatment prior to standard IVF/ICSI in women with endometriosis. Contrary to previous findings, we are uncertain as to whether long‐term GnRH agonist therapy impacts on the live birth rate or indeed the complication rate compared to standard IVF/ICSI. Further, we are uncertain whether this intervention impacts on the clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, mean number of oocytes and mean number of embryos. In light of the paucity and very low quality of existing data, particularly for the primary outcomes examined, further high‐quality trials are required to definitively determine the impact of long‐term GnRH agonist therapy on IVF/ICSI outcomes, not only compared to no pretreatment, but also compared to other proposed alternatives to endometriosis management.

Do hormone‑quieting drugs before IVF help women with endometriosis?

Rationale
Endometriosis is a long‑term health problem in women. Tissue like the womb lining grows outside the womb. It can cause bad pain. It can also make it hard to get pregnant.

Some women with endometriosis try in vitro fertilization, or IVF. In IVF, doctors join egg and sperm in a lab. Some women also use ICSI. In ICSI, a doctor places one sperm into one egg.

Some doctors give a drug before IVF or ICSI. This drug is called a GnRH agonist. It “quiets” the body’s hormone signals for a time. That may calm endometriosis. The hope is that this may help IVF or ICSI work better.

Past reviews said this drug might help. But new studies came out. The team did this review to test the idea again. They wanted to see if the drug helps more births. They also looked at safety.

Trial Design
This was a review of many fair tests. In these tests, women were put into groups by chance. The team looked for all such tests up to early 2019.

The women in the tests had endometriosis proven by surgery. All were having IVF or ICSI. The main compare was: a GnRH agonist drug for at least three months, before IVF or ICSI, versus no drug before IVF or ICSI.

The team also looked for tests that compared the GnRH drug to other care. This included birth control pills used without a break, or surgery to remove an ovarian cyst from endometriosis. They did not find tests for those compares.

In all, the review found eight tests. These tests had 640 women in total. One test had 147 women and looked at births. The women were adults, and all had endometriosis. The tests took place in fertility clinics.

Women stayed in a test from the start of the pre‑treatment to the end of follow‑up. The drug part lasted at least three months before IVF or ICSI. Follow‑up then went through the IVF or ICSI cycle. It then went on to track pregnancy and birth.

Results
The key question was: does the drug help women take home a baby? The review did not find clear proof that it helps. One test looked at live birth. It did not show a clear gain with the drug. The proof was weak. This means we cannot be sure.

The team also asked: does the drug raise or lower harm? The tests did not give a clear answer. We do not know if the drug raises problems. The proof here was also weak.

The team checked other signs. They looked at how many women got pregnant. They looked at twins or more. They looked at miscarriage. They looked at how many eggs were taken. They looked at how many embryos formed. Across these signs, the results were mixed. The review could not show a clear gain. Here too, the proof was weak.

Why was the proof weak? Many tests were small. Many tests did not “blind” staff or women to care. The tests did not all measure things the same way. This makes it hard to be sure.

What does this mean for women with endometriosis? Right now, we do not know if a long course of a GnRH agonist before IVF or ICSI helps. We also do not know if it harms. Some past work said it helps. This new review calls that into question. More large, fair tests are needed.

What are the choices before IVF or ICSI? Choices may include no pre‑treat drug. They may include birth control pills used without a break. They may include surgery to remove an endometriosis cyst in the ovary. This review found no head‑to‑head tests of the GnRH drug versus those choices. So we cannot say which is best.

How may this help you talk with your doctor? You can ask: What is my stage of endometriosis? Do I need a pre‑treat drug? What are the risks and gains for me? How long would I take the drug? How would it fit with my IVF or ICSI plan?

Bottom line: For women with endometriosis who plan IVF or ICSI, a long course of a GnRH agonist before treatment did not show clear benefit. It also did not show clear harm. The current proof is not strong. Stronger tests are needed to guide care.

If you plan IVF or ICSI, ask your care team to tailor your plan. Your needs, your age, your goals, and your timeline all matter. Shared choice can help you pick the path that is right for you.","Long‐term pituitary down‐regulation before in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for women with endometriosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the efficacy and safety of treating women with known endometriosis (a disease characterised by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the cavity of the womb) with gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist medication for a period of three to six months prior to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We aimed to compare this intervention to no treatment prior to IVF/ICSI, pretreatment with long‐term continuous combined oral contraception (COC) or surgical treatment to remove endometriomas (cysts forming in the ovaries as a consequence of endometriosis). 
Background 
Many women affected by endometriosis suffer with infertility and may, as a result, seek IVF/ICSI treatment. IVF/ICSI is known to be less successful in women with endometriosis and a variety of interventions prior to IVF/ICSI have been proposed to try and improve outcomes. These include long‐term GnRH agonist therapy, long‐term continuous COC therapy or surgery to remove endometriomas. 
Study characteristics 
We found eight randomised controlled trials comparing long‐term GnRH agonist therapy with no pretreatment including a total of 640 women with endometriosis prior to IVF/ICSI. The evidence is current to January 2019. 
Key results 
Compared to no pretreatment, we are uncertain whether long‐term GnRH agonist therapy prior to IVF/ICSI in women with endometriosis affects the live birth rate. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth rate is assumed to be 36% with no pretreatment, the chance following long‐term GnRH agonist therapy would be between 9% and 31%. We are also uncertain whether this intervention affects complication rate, clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, mean number of oocytes and mean number of embryos. No studies compared long‐term GnRH agonist therapy to long‐term continuous COC therapy or surgery to remove endometriomas. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low quality. The main limitations in the evidence were lack of blinding (the process where the women participating in the trial, as well as the research staff, are not aware of the intervention used), inconsistency (differences between different studies) and imprecision (random error and small size of each study).

10.1002-14651858.CD013376.pub2,"Background
Aflatoxins are carcinogenic mycotoxins that contaminate many food crops. Maize and groundnuts are prone to aflatoxin contamination, and are the major sources of human exposure to aflatoxins, due to their high intake as staple foods, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). Observational studies suggest an association between dietary exposure to aflatoxins during pregnancy and early childhood and linear growth in infants and young children. 
Objectives
To assess the effects on pre‐ and postnatal growth outcomes when agricultural and nutritional education interventions during the post‐harvest period that aim to reduce aflatoxin exposure are compared to usual support or no intervention. We assessed this in infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women at the household or community level in LMICs. 
Search methods
In July and August 2019, we searched: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, Africa‐Wide, LILACS, CAB Abstracts, Agricola, and two trials registers. We also checked the bibliographies of the included studies and contacted relevant mycotoxin organisations and researchers for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs of agricultural education and nutritional education interventions of any duration, at the household or community level, aimed at reducing aflatoxin intake by infants, children, and pregnant and lactating women, in LMICs during the post‐harvest period, compared to no intervention or usual support. We excluded studies that followed participants for less than four weeks. We assessed prespecified prenatal (at birth) and postnatal growth outcomes (during infancy, childhood, and adolescence), with linear growth (as the primary outcome), infectious disease morbidity, and unintended consequences. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed study eligibility using prespecified criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included RCTs. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE, and presented the main results in a 'Summary of findings' table. 
Main results
We included three recent cluster‐RCTs reporting the effects of agricultural education plus post‐harvest technologies, compared to usual agricultural support or no intervention. The participants were pregnant women and their children, lactating women and their infants (< 6 months), women of childbearing age, and young children (< 59 months), from rural, subsistence maize‐farming communities in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. 
Two trials randomised villages to the intervention and control groups, including a total of at least 979 mother‐child pairs from 60 villages. The third trial randomised 420 households, including 189 mother‐child pairs and 231 women of childbearing age. Duration of the intervention and follow‐up ranged between five and nine months. Due to risk of attrition bias, the overall risk of bias was unclear in one trial, and high in the other two trials. 
None of the included studies addressed the effects of nutritional education on pre‐ and postnatal growth. 
One trial reported outcomes not prespecified in our review, and we were unable to obtain unpublished growth data from the second trial, even after contacting the authors. The third trial, in lactating women and their infants in Tanzania, reported on the infants' weight‐for‐age z‐score (WAZ) after six months. This trial found that providing agricultural education aimed at changing farmers' post‐harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure, by using demonstrations (e.g. handsorting, de‐hulling of maize, drying sheets, and insecticides), may improve WAZ in infants from these farmers' households, on average, by 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.98; 1 study; 249 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), compared to infants from households where the farmers received routine agricultural extension services. 
Another way of reporting the effect on WAZ is to compare the proportion of underweight infants (WAZ > 2 SD below the reference median value) per group. This trial found that the intervention may reduce the proportion of underweight infants in the intervention households by 6.7% (95% CI ‐12.6 to ‐1.4; 249 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) compared to control households. 
No studies reported on unintended effects of agricultural and nutritional education.
Authors' conclusions
Evidence on the effects on child growth in LMICs of agricultural or nutritional education interventions that reduce aflatoxin exposure was very limited; no included study reported on linear growth. Very low‐certainty evidence suggested that agricultural education aimed at changing farmers' post‐harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure by using demonstrations, may result in an increase in WAZ, when compared to usual or no education.

Can farm and food steps after harvest help babies grow?

2. Rationale
Some foods can grow mold after harvest. This mold can make poisons called aflatoxins. These poisons can get into maize and groundnuts. Many people eat these foods each day.

Aflatoxins can harm health. They can cause illness and cancer over time. They may also harm growth in babies and young children.

Mothers and babies in low and middle income countries face the most risk. This is because maize and groundnuts are staple foods there. We need ways to lower aflatoxins in these foods.

Farm and food steps after harvest may help. Examples are sorting bad grains, removing the husk, drying on sheets, and using insect control. These steps may cut mold and aflatoxins. If aflatoxins drop, babies may grow better. This review asked if farm or food lessons can help growth before and after birth.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team looked for trials done in homes or in whole towns. They looked for trials in low and middle income countries. They included trials that taught farm and food steps after harvest. The goal was to lower aflatoxins in the diet.

They searched many research lists in mid 2019. They also wrote to experts to find more trials. They only included trials that picked who got the lessons by chance. Some trials picked whole villages by chance.

The people in the trials were pregnant women. They were also women who were breastfeeding and their babies under six months old. Some were women who could get pregnant. Some were young children under five years old. All lived in rural maize farm areas.

The trials gave farm lessons and tools. These showed how to sort, de‑hull, dry on sheets, and use insect control. The trials then checked growth in babies and children. Time in the trials ran from five to nine months. The trials compared the lessons to usual farm help or no lessons.

4. Results
The review found three trials. They took place in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. Two trials chose whole villages by chance. One trial chose homes by chance.

The team wanted to see length or height for age. None of the trials gave that result. So we do not know if the lessons helped children grow taller.

One trial from Tanzania looked at baby weight for age. It followed mothers who were breastfeeding and their young babies. It used a growth score called weight for age. This score checks if a baby’s weight fits their age.

In that trial, babies in homes that got farm lessons had higher weight for age. The gain was small to moderate. Fewer babies in the lesson group were underweight. This may mean the lessons helped reduce aflatoxin in food. It may also mean babies grew a bit better.

But our trust in this result is low. Some people left the trials early. Not all planned results were shared. The trials were short. The number of trials was small. Because of this, we cannot be sure.

No trial tested food or diet lessons alone. No trial told us about bad effects from the lessons. So we do not know if any harms took place.

What this means for families
Farm steps after harvest may cut mold and aflatoxins. Teaching and showing these steps may help baby weight in the first months. This could help fewer babies be underweight. This is hopeful news.

But we need more and better trials. We need trials that last longer. We need trials that check length and height. We need trials that share all results. We also need to know if there are any harms.

For now, simple steps may help. Sorting bad grains and drying on sheets are low cost. These steps may help make food safer. They may help babies grow well.

What the researchers say
Evidence is limited. It comes from only three trials. The trials show a possible gain in weight for age. But we have very low certainty. We cannot say for sure if farm lessons help growth.

More good studies are needed. They should test farm and food lessons in real homes. They should follow mothers and children over time. They should check both height and weight. They should also look for any harms.

In short, farm lessons after harvest may help. They may cut aflatoxins in foods. They may aid baby growth. But stronger proof is still needed.","Reducing aflatoxin intake with agricultural and nutritional education to improve growth of infants and children in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
Review question 
Does providing agricultural and nutritional education about how to reduce the intake of aflatoxins (from contaminated food crops) in households and communities in low and middle‐income countries (LMICs) improve the growth of infants and children compared to usual or no education? 
Background 
Aflatoxins are toxins produced by moulds that contaminate food crops. Maize and groundnuts are the major dietary sources of aflatoxins, as they are eaten in large amounts by many people living in LMICs. Some research from LMICs suggests that there may be a link between aflatoxin intake during pregnancy and early childhood, and growth in infants and young children. 
Study Characteristics 
We included three trials, conducted in pregnant and breastfeeding women (1168 mother‐child pairs), women of childbearing age (N = 231), and infants and young children (< 59 months old), from rural, subsistence maize‐farming communities in Kenya, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. One trial in Tanzania, at unclear risk of bias overall, provided data for this review, since one trial did not report any outcomes relevant to this review, and we were unable to obtain unpublished growth data for another, even after contacting the study authors. 
The trial, conducted in breastfeeding women and their babies, studied the effects of agricultural education (demonstrations to change farmers' practices after harvesting their maize crops to reduce aflatoxins (for example, by handsorting and de‐hulling the maize, using drying sheets and insecticides) on the babies' weight, standardised for age (weight‐for‐age z‐score (WAZ)), after six months (the z‐score measures the difference between these babies and the median of a population of similar babies). Farmers in the control group received routine services from agriculture extension workers. 
Key results 
Very low‐certainty evidence from one trial suggested that the WAZ of 128 children from farmers' households who received agricultural education may improve by a z‐score of 0.57, compared to 121 children from households where farmers only received routine services. This means that a baby girl in the intervention group, with a healthy weight, would gain about 450 to 690 grams more weight between three to nine months, compared to a baby girl in the control group. This is a meaningful difference. 
Another way of measuring the effect is to compare the proportion of underweight infants (WAZ ≥ 2 standard deviations below the reference median value) per group, after the intervention. In this case, agricultural education may reduce the proportion of underweight children, on average, by 6.7% (very low‐certainty evidence), compared to routine services. 
None of the included studies addressed the effects of nutritional education on length of height, or on unintended effects of agricultural or nutritional education. 
Evidence about the effects on child growth of agricultural or nutritional education interventions that reduce aflatoxin exposure in LMICs was very limited. Data from one trial suggested that agricultural education, aimed at changing farmers' post‐harvest practices to reduce aflatoxin exposure, may result in the babies' increased weight‐for‐age, compared to usual or no education. 
The literature was searched to August 2019.
Quality of the evidence 
We have very little confidence in the results. The true effect may be substantially different.

10.1002-14651858.CD008011.pub3,"Treatment for cardiac problems caused by anthracycline chemotherapy for childhood cancer 
Anthracyclines are anticancer drugs used in the treatment of different types of childhood cancer. An important adverse effect of anthracyclines is damage to the heart, which can lead to asymptomatic (without complaints) or symptomatic (with complaints) cardiac problems during and after cancer treatment. While there are several drugs available to treat other types of cardiac problems in adults, it is not known if these drugs are beneficial in treating cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines in childhood cancer patients and survivors. A physician confronted with a childhood cancer patient or survivor with anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems should be able to make an informed decision on how to treat this patient based on high‐quality evidence about the beneficial and adverse effects of the treatment options. We searched for and summarised studies that evaluated drugs for treating anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. 
We identified two randomised studies evaluating two different drugs in two different types of patients. One of these drugs, an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril), had a short‐term beneficial effect on heart function in survivors of childhood cancer with asymptomatic cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines compared with placebo. However, the drug had no significant beneficial effect on other important outcomes and was associated with side effects such as dizziness and fatigue. This study was of reasonable/good quality. The other study was of low quality and found no effect of a short treatment with phosphocreatine in childhood leukaemia patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiac problems compared with a control treatment with vitamin C, adenosine triphosphate, vitamin E, and oral coenzyme Q10. 
We could make no definitive conclusions about treatment options for anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. High‐quality studies are needed to determine if there are drugs that improve heart function in these patients.

Medicines to treat heart harm from some chemo drugs in kids

Rationale
Some chemo drugs for kids can hurt the heart. These drugs are called anthracyclines. They help treat many kinds of child cancer. But they can weaken the heart during care and after care.

Heart harm may cause no signs at first. Or it may cause signs like short breath or swell. This harm can worry kids and families. It can also raise the chance of heart illness later in life.

Doctors use many drugs to treat heart illness in adults. But we do not know if these same drugs help heart harm from anthracyclines in kids. We also need to know the risks.

This study looked for answers. The team asked: do heart drugs help these kids and survivors? They also asked: do the drugs cause harm? They hoped to guide doctors and families.

One drug was enalapril. It is a blood pressure drug. It is also called an ACE inhibitor. It can relax blood vessels. It may help the heart pump with less strain. Another drug was phosphocreatine. It helps cells make energy. It might help heart cells work better.

Trial Design
This work was a review of past tests. The team searched for all fair tests. In fair tests, people get a drug or a dummy pill by chance. A dummy pill is a look‑alike pill with no drug. That helps show if a drug truly helps.

They found two such tests. Each test looked at a different drug. Each test had a different group of patients.

One test looked at enalapril. It enrolled people who had cancer as kids. They had changes in the heart from anthracyclines. They felt fine and had no heart signs. Some got enalapril. Some got a dummy pill. The report did not list age or sex. The effect they saw was in the short term.

The other test looked at phosphocreatine. It enrolled kids with leukemia. Some had heart signs. Some did not. They got a short course of phosphocreatine. The other group got a mix of vitamin C, ATP, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10. The report did not list age or sex.

The first test was fairly good in quality. The second test was weak in quality.

Results
What did they find? In the enalapril test, the drug helped heart pump work in the short term. This was in people who felt fine but had heart change. Enalapril did better than the dummy pill for this one heart measure.

But enalapril did not help other key health results. The study did not show gains in how people felt or lived. People on enalapril had some side effects. These were dizzy spells and feeling tired.

In the phosphocreatine test, the drug did not help. It did no better than the mix of vitamins and ATP and coenzyme Q10. This was true for kids with heart signs and for kids with no heart signs. That test was also short and weak.

What does this mean for care? We still do not know the best drug to treat this kind of heart harm in kids. One fairly good test showed a small, short‑term heart pump gain with enalapril. But it did not show gains in other health results. It also had side effects. One weak test showed no gain with phosphocreatine.

So, we cannot make firm advice yet. Doctors and families should talk about the pros and cons. They should watch the heart with care. They should treat signs and risks based on each child’s needs.

Why is this work key? It shows that we need better tests. We need more fair tests in kids and young survivors. These tests should last longer. They should track how people feel and live. They should track side effects in a clear way.

The goal is safe care that helps kids now and later. New high‑quality tests can show if any drug helps the heart after these chemo drugs. Until then, care teams must use the best facts we have. They should share choices in clear words. They should also use heart‑healthy steps, like good food, play as able, and no smoke.

In short, we need more strong proof. Today, enalapril may help one heart measure for a short time. It did not help other key results and did cause some side effects. Phosphocreatine did not help. More and better studies will guide us to the right care.","Treatment for cardiac problems caused by anthracycline chemotherapy for childhood cancer 
Anthracyclines are anticancer drugs used in the treatment of different types of childhood cancer. An important adverse effect of anthracyclines is damage to the heart, which can lead to asymptomatic (without complaints) or symptomatic (with complaints) cardiac problems during and after cancer treatment. While there are several drugs available to treat other types of cardiac problems in adults, it is not known if these drugs are beneficial in treating cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines in childhood cancer patients and survivors. A physician confronted with a childhood cancer patient or survivor with anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems should be able to make an informed decision on how to treat this patient based on high‐quality evidence about the beneficial and adverse effects of the treatment options. We searched for and summarised studies that evaluated drugs for treating anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. 
We identified two randomised studies evaluating two different drugs in two different types of patients. One of these drugs, an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril), had a short‐term beneficial effect on heart function in survivors of childhood cancer with asymptomatic cardiac problems caused by anthracyclines compared with placebo. However, the drug had no significant beneficial effect on other important outcomes and was associated with side effects such as dizziness and fatigue. This study was of reasonable/good quality. The other study was of low quality and found no effect of a short treatment with phosphocreatine in childhood leukaemia patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiac problems compared with a control treatment with vitamin C, adenosine triphosphate, vitamin E, and oral coenzyme Q10. 
We could make no definitive conclusions about treatment options for anthracycline‐induced cardiac problems in childhood cancer patients and survivors. High‐quality studies are needed to determine if there are drugs that improve heart function in these patients.

Injury to the ligaments of the middle joint (proximal interphalangeal joint) of a finger may occur as a result of the finger being forced backwards. This is known as a hyperextension injury. Characteristically, this occurs in sporting accidents, such as where a football strikes an outstretched hand. These injuries are common and typically affect people of working age. Usually, these patients are treated without surgery using a combination of support (splinting/strapping to the adjacent finger) and exercise advice. Use of the hand is commonly encouraged but restricted to some degree by the severity of the injury. By examining the evidence from randomised controlled trials, this review aimed to assess which treatment for hyperextension injuries of the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers results in the best outcome for patients. The outcomes examined included function (including return to work), pain and joint movement. 
Three small studies including a total of 366 patients met the inclusion criteria for the review. The studies, which were all over 15 years old, were prone to bias. None of the studies reported any self assessment of function by participants. One study compared unrestricted mobility with immobilisation. One trial compared protected mobilisation (using a removable support in combination with exercise) with immobilisation. The remaining study compared immobilisation for one week versus three weeks. None of these trials found important differences between their intervention groups in various measures of poor outcome, pain and range of movement at six months follow‐up. 
We concluded that there was a lack of robust evidence to inform on the need for, and the extent and duration of, immobilisation for these injuries.

Do splints or early movement help finger middle joint sprains?

Rationale
A hard hit can bend a finger back too far. This can tear the soft bands that hold the middle finger joint steady. This joint is near the middle of the finger. It helps the finger bend and straighten.

These sprains often happen in sports, like when a ball hits a hand. They are also common in people of work age. The joint can swell and hurt. The finger can feel stiff.

Care often does not need surgery. Doctors may use a splint, which is a stiff support. They may tape the sore finger to the one next to it. They also teach gentle hand moves.

Many people can use the hand while it heals. But the injury can limit what you do. We need to know the best way to treat it. We also want to know how long to keep the finger still.

This review asked a clear question. Which non-surgery care works best for these sprains? The team looked for trials that put people into care groups by chance. They aimed to find what helps pain, motion, and daily use.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team looked for the best kind of trials. In these trials, people went into groups by chance. This helps make the groups fair.

Three small trials met the rules for the review. In total, they included 366 people. All had a sprain of the middle joint of a finger. The finger bent back too far.

Most people with these sprains are of work age. The trials did not give clear age ranges. They did not report gender details. The health issue was the same joint sprain.

The trials tested care plans that did not need surgery. One trial let people move the finger as they wished. It compared that to keeping the finger still. This is called immobilization, or keeping the joint from moving.

One trial used a removable support plus gentle exercises. This is called “protected movement.” It compared that to keeping the finger still. It looked at how people did over time.

The last trial tested how long to keep the finger still. One group kept it still for 1 week. The other group kept it still for 3 weeks. All trials checked people for about 6 months.

These trials were over 15 years old. The reports had flaws that can tilt results. None of the trials asked people to rate their own hand use. That means we lack the patient’s voice in the outcomes.

Results
Across the three trials, the main results were alike. At about 6 months, the groups did about the same. Pain levels were similar. The bend and straight range was similar.

The rate of poor results did not differ much. No group had a clear edge. Early free movement did not show better results than keeping still. Protected movement did not beat keeping still.

Short rest did not beat longer rest. One week of rest did not do better than three weeks. The studies were small, so firm answers are hard. But no plan stood out as best.

For patients, what does this mean? It means we do not have strong proof for one clear plan. Splints, taping, and guided gentle moves may all be reasonable. The right plan may depend on your injury and your tasks.

Talk with your care team about your goals. You might value a quicker return to light use. Or you might need more support at first. Your doctor can help fit the plan to your needs.

For the field, this review matters. It shows a big gap in proof. Many people have these sprains. Yet we still lack clear guidance on the best non-surgery care.

The review team reached a careful end point. They said we lack strong, solid proof. We cannot say how much to immobilize the joint. We also cannot say how long to keep it still.

We need new and better trials. They should be larger and well designed. They should ask people about pain, hand use, and return to work. New trials should also match today’s care settings.

In short, current small trials show no big differences. Many non-surgery plans seem to work about the same at 6 months. Until we have better proof, care should fit the person and the injury.","Splints and other non‐surgical methods for treating common injuries of the middle joints of the fingers

10.1002-14651858.CD013505,"Background
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by infrequent or absent ovulation, and high levels of androgens and insulin (hyperinsulinaemia). Hyperinsulinaemia occurs secondary to insulin resistance and is associated with an increased biochemical risk profile for cardiovascular disease and an increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus. Insulin‐sensitising agents such as metformin may be effective in treating PCOS‐related anovulation. This is an update of Morley 2017 and only includes studies on metformin. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of metformin in combination with or in comparison to clomiphene citrate (CC), letrozole and laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) in improving reproductive outcomes and associated gastrointestinal side effects for women with PCOS undergoing ovulation induction. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases from inception to December 2018: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL. We searched registers of ongoing trials and reference lists from relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of metformin compared with placebo, no treatment, or in combination with or compared with CC, letrozole and LOD for women with PCOS subfertility. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and bias. Primary outcomes were live birth rate and gastrointestinal adverse effects. Secondary outcomes included other pregnancy outcomes and ovulation. We combined data to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I2 statistic and reported quality of the evidence for primary outcomes and reproductive outcomes using GRADE methodology. 
Main results
We included 41 studies (4552 women). Evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate based on GRADE assessment. Limitations were risk of bias (poor reporting of methodology and incomplete outcome data), imprecision and inconsistency. 
Metformin versus placebo or no treatment 
The evidence suggests that metformin may improve live birth rates compared with placebo (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.51; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 435 women; low‐quality evidence). For a live birth rate of 19% following placebo, the live birth rate following metformin would be between 19% and 37%. The metformin group probably experiences more gastrointestinal side effects (OR 4.00, 95% CI 2.63 to 6.09; I2 = 39%; 7 studies, 713 women; moderate‐quality evidence). With placebo, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 10% whereas with metformin this risk is between 22% and 40%. There are probably higher rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.65; I2 = 30%; 11 studies, 1213 women; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be higher rates of ovulation with metformin (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.85 to 3.75; I2 = 61%; 13 studies, 684 women; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect on miscarriage rates (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.35; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 748 women; low‐quality evidence). 
Metformin plus CC versus CC alone 
We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rates compared to CC alone (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.65; I2 = 28%; 10 studies, 1219 women; low‐quality evidence), but gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common with combined therapy (OR 4.26, 95% CI 2.83 to 6.40; I2 = 8%; 6 studies, 852 women; moderate quality evidence). The live birth rate with CC alone is 24%, which may change to between 23% to 34% with combined therapy. With CC alone, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 9%, which increases to between 21% to 37% with combined therapy. The combined therapy group probably has higher rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.99; I2 = 31%; 19 studies, 1790 women; moderate‐quality evidence). The combined group may have higher rates of ovulation (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.03; I2 = 63%;21 studies, 1568 women; low‐quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of an effect on miscarriage (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.00; I2 = 0%; 10 studies, 1206 women; low‐quality evidence). 
Metformin versus CC 
When all studies were combined, findings for live birth were inconclusive and inconsistent (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.01; I2 = 86%; 5 studies, 741 women; very low‐quality evidence). In subgroup analysis by obesity status, obese women had a lower birth rate in the metformin group (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.52; 2 studies, 500 women), while the non‐obese group showed a possible benefit from metformin, with high heterogeneity (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.94; I2 = 78%, 3 studies, 241 women; very low‐quality evidence). However, due to the very low quality of the evidence we cannot draw any conclusions. Among obese women taking metformin there may be lower rates of clinical pregnancy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.55; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 500 women; low‐quality evidence) and ovulation (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.43; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 500 women; low‐quality evidence) while among non‐obese women, the metformin group may have more pregnancies (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.29; I2 = 26%; 6 studies, 530 women; low‐quality evidence) and no clear difference in ovulation rates (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.25; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 352 women; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in miscarriage rates between the groups (overall: OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.66; I2 = 36%; 6 studies, 781 women; low‐quality evidence) and no studies reported gastrointestinal side effects. 
Authors' conclusions
Our updated review suggests that metformin may be beneficial over placebo for live birth however, more women probably experience gastrointestinal side effects. We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rates compared to CC alone, but gastrointestinal side effects are probably increased with combined therapy. When metformin was compared with CC, data for live birth were inconclusive, and the findings were limited by lack of evidence. Results differed by body mass index (BMI), emphasising the importance of stratifying results by BMI. No studies reported gastrointestinal side effects in this comparison. Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain of the effect of metformin on miscarriage in all three comparisons.

Can metformin help women with PCOS have a baby?

Rationale
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormone problem. Many women with PCOS do not ovulate. Ovulation means the ovary releases an egg. Without ovulation, pregnancy is hard.

PCOS often links with high insulin levels. Insulin helps the body use sugar. When the body resists insulin, insulin levels rise. This can raise the risk for heart disease and diabetes.

Doctors use several ways to help ovulation. Metformin is a drug that helps the body use insulin better. It may also help ovulation. Other common options are clomiphene citrate (called CC), letrozole, and a small surgery on the ovaries called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD). This review asked: Does metformin, alone or with these options, help women with PCOS have a live birth? It also asked about stomach and gut side effects.

Trial Design
This is a review of many clinical trials. In these trials, women got one treatment or another by chance. This kind of trial helps give fair results.

The team looked for trials from the start of each database to December 2018. They found 41 trials with 4,552 women. All women had PCOS and trouble getting pregnant. The trials compared:
- Metformin vs placebo or no treatment
- Metformin plus CC vs CC alone
- Metformin vs CC

The review planned to look at letrozole and LOD as well. The main results here are for placebo and CC. The main outcomes were live births and stomach or gut side effects. The team also looked at pregnancy, ovulation, and miscarriage. The trials had different designs and time frames. The review did not state one set time in a study for each woman.

Results
Overall, the strength of the findings ranged from very low to moderate. Some trials did not report well. Some results were not exact or did not match across trials. Because of this, some results may change with better studies.

Metformin vs placebo or no treatment
- Live birth: Metformin may help more women have a baby. Out of 100 women on placebo, 19 had a baby. With metformin, between 19 and 37 out of 100 had a baby.
- Stomach or gut side effects: More women on metformin had side effects. Out of 100 women on placebo, 10 had side effects. With metformin, between 22 and 40 out of 100 had side effects. These are side effects that affect the stomach and gut.
- Pregnancy and ovulation: More women on metformin became pregnant. More women ovulated as well.
- Miscarriage: It is not clear if metformin changes miscarriage risk.

Metformin plus CC vs CC alone
- Live birth: We do not know if adding metformin to CC helps more women have a baby. Out of 100 women on CC alone, 24 had a baby. With metformin plus CC, between 23 and 34 out of 100 had a baby.
- Stomach or gut side effects: Side effects were more common with the two drugs together. Out of 100 women on CC alone, 9 had side effects. With both drugs, between 21 and 37 out of 100 had side effects.
- Pregnancy and ovulation: More women on both drugs became pregnant. More women ovulated as well.
- Miscarriage: It is not clear if adding metformin changes miscarriage risk.

Metformin vs CC
- Live birth: Results were mixed. When all trials were combined, we cannot be sure which is better.
- Body size matters: In women with higher body mass index (BMI), metformin led to fewer births than CC. BMI is a measure of body weight for height. In women with lower BMI, metformin may help, but the results are not firm.
- Pregnancy and ovulation: In women with higher BMI, metformin led to fewer pregnancies and less ovulation than CC. In women with lower BMI, metformin may lead to more pregnancies. The effect on ovulation in this group was not clear.
- Miscarriage: It is not clear if the risk differs between metformin and CC.
- Stomach or gut side effects: Trials in this group did not report these side effects.

What this means for patients
- Metformin may raise the chance of a baby over placebo. But more women have stomach or gut side effects with metformin.
- Adding metformin to CC may help with pregnancy and ovulation. It may not raise the chance of a baby. It does raise stomach or gut side effects.
- When we compare metformin with CC, results are not clear. Body size may guide the choice. For women with higher BMI, CC may work better for birth, pregnancy, and ovulation. For women with lower BMI, metformin may help in some cases.
- We do not know if metformin changes miscarriage risk.

Conclusions from the investigators
Metformin may help some women with PCOS have a baby, compared to placebo. But it can cause more stomach or gut problems. Adding metformin to CC may not raise live births, and it raises side effects. The choice between metformin and CC may depend on BMI. Better trials are needed. Future trials should sort results by BMI and report side effects in all groups.

If you have PCOS and want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor. Ask about your goals, your BMI, and side effects. Together you can choose the best plan for you.","Metformin for ovulation induction in women with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome and subfertility 
Review question 
Researchers reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of metformin compared with other ovulation induction agents, for inducing ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Of interest were live birth rate, gastrointestinal side effects and additional reproductive outcomes. 
Background 
Women with PCOS often have infrequent or no periods because they do not ovulate (release an egg), which can result in infertility. They may also develop problems such as obesity and diabetes. High levels of insulin, a hormone that allows the body to use sugar for energy, may be a cause of PCOS and levels are generally higher in obese women. Metformin helps the body use insulin more effectively and improves ovulation in women with PCOS. However, metformin may cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea or constipation (gastrointestinal side effects). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies in women with PCOS that compared metformin alone or with CC, letrozole or LOD, against CC, letrozole, LOD, placebo (sham treatment) or no treatment. This review updates the previous version of the review. We included 41 randomised controlled trials (where women were randomly allocated to a treatment) with 4552 women. 13 studies are new for this update. We combined results from the studies and assessed the quality of the studies to judge how confident we could be in their results. The evidence is current up to December 2018. 
Key results 
Metformin versus placebo/no treatment 
Metformin may increase the chances of having a live birth compared with no treatment or placebo, however women taking metformin probably experience more gastrointestinal side effects. With placebo, the live birth rate is 19%, and it would be between 19% and 37% with metformin. The risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 10% with placebo, but higher with metformin, between 22% and 40%. Women taking metformin are probably more likely to get pregnant and may be more likely to ovulate. We are uncertain about the effect of metformin compared to placebo or no treatment on miscarriage. 
Metformin plus CC versus CC alone 
We are uncertain if metformin plus CC improves live birth rate compared to CC alone, but gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common. The live birth rate with CC alone is 24% which may change to between 23% to 34% with metformin and CC combined. With CC alone, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects is 9%, which increases to between 21% to 37% with metformin and CC combined. However, pregnancy rate is probably improved with metformin and CC. Ovulation rates may be improved with metformin and CC. There was no clear evidence of an effect on miscarriage. 
Metformin versus CC 
We combined all the studies and found that the quality of evidence was very low, results were inconsistent, and we could not confidently draw conclusions. Obese women had a lower birth rate with metformin, while non‐obese women showed a possible benefit from metformin. The live birth rate of non‐obese women with CC is 26%, which may increase to between 26% and 50% with metformin. However, in obese women, the live birth rate is 22% which may decrease to between 5% to 13% with metformin. Similarly, among obese women taking metformin there may be lower rates of clinical pregnancy and ovulation while, non‐obese women taking metformin may have more pregnancies; there was no clear difference in ovulation rates. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in miscarriage rates between women taking metformin or CC. No studies reported gastrointestinal side effects. It is possible that a woman's body mass index (a measure of healthy weight based on height and weight) affects which treatment she should take, although further research is required to establish this. The limited improvement in outcomes such as diabetes with metformin highlights the importance of weight loss and lifestyle adjustment, particularly in overweight women with PCOS. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main problems were that the studies’ methods were poor or unclear, or they did not report all their results (risk of bias), or they were inaccurate and inconsistent.

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection and is usually treated with antibiotics.

The main 'typical' agent causing CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae).

While typical coverage is essential, the necessity of the atypical coverage has not been proven. In the previous version of this review we showed that there was no advantage to the atypical arm. Given the persisting inconsistency between current guidelines for treatment of pneumonia and the available evidence, we undertook to update this systematic review. 
This Cochrane review looked at trials comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical coverage to those without, limited to hospitalized adults with CAP. We included 28 trials, involving 5939 patients. For the regimens tested, no advantage was found for regimens covering atypical bacteria in the major outcomes tested ‐ mortality and clinical efficacy. There was no significant difference between the groups in the frequency of total adverse events, or those requiring discontinuation of treatment. However, gastrointestinal events were less common in the atypical arm.

Do adults in the hospital with pneumonia need extra antibiotics for uncommon germs?

Rationale
Pneumonia is a lung infection. It can be mild or very severe. Doctors treat it with antibiotics. Many people with pneumonia need care in the hospital.

Many kinds of germs can cause this illness. Some are common, and some are less common. Doctors often cannot tell which germ is the cause at the start. So they may give drugs for both common and less common germs.

The less common germs include Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae. These are types of bacteria. A very common germ is Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Some care guides say to start extra drugs for the less common germs. But an earlier careful review did not find a clear gain. This new review was done to check again. The goal was to see if extra coverage helps adults in the hospital live longer or get well faster.

The team also looked at side effects. They asked if extra drugs caused more harm. The review helps close the gap between daily care and past research.

Trial Design
This was a Cochrane review. That means a careful look at past trials. The team found trials in adults in the hospital with pneumonia. These adults got the illness outside the hospital.

The review compared two care plans. One plan used drugs that also treat the less common germs. The other plan did not. The review included 28 trials and 5939 patients.

The summary did not give the ages of the people. It also did not say how many were men or women. The time that people stayed in each trial was not in the summary.

How the trials were set up also matters. Most trials compared one “extra coverage” drug to one “standard” drug. Only one trial asked the key real-world question. It tested adding an extra drug to a standard drug.

Not all trials hid which drug was used. In 17 of 27 trials, both the patient and the doctor knew the drug. Funding can also shape trials. In 21 of 27 trials, a drug company gave money. In all but one, the maker of the extra drug ran the trial.

Results
The main question was simple. Do extra drugs for less common germs help people do better? The answer in this review was no. There were no fewer deaths with extra coverage. There was also no better cure or recovery with extra coverage.

Side effects matter too. The total number of side effects was about the same in both plans. Stopping the drug due to side effects was also about the same. One point stood out. People on extra coverage had fewer stomach or gut problems.

What do these results mean for patients? For adults in the hospital with pneumonia, extra drugs for less common germs did not help the main outcomes. They did not lower the chance of death. They did not help people get well faster.

This matters for care today. Doctors often start broad care right away. This review suggests that may not be needed for all people. It asks us to think about who truly needs extra coverage.

There are limits to these findings. Only one trial tested adding an extra drug to a standard drug. This is the choice doctors often face at the bedside. Many trials were not blinded, which can affect results. Many trials had drug company money, often from the maker of the extra drug.

Even with these limits, the main message was clear. Extra coverage for less common germs did not help the key outcomes. It did not reduce deaths. It did not improve how well the treatment worked.

What should patients take from this? Ask your care team which germs they aim to treat. Ask why they choose each drug. Some people may still need broad care based on how sick they are. Local germ patterns also matter.

What do the reviewers suggest next? We need better trials that match real care choices. We need trials that add an extra drug to a standard drug. We also need trials that hide who gets which drug. This helps make fair tests.

In short, this careful review found no clear gain from extra coverage at the start. The findings may help guide care. They may also help update care guides. More strong, fair trials can help confirm these results.","Initial antibiotic treatment for coverage of 'atypical' pathogens for community‐acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults

The aim of this Cochrane Review was to determine whether mindfulness‐based interventions (MBIs) i.e. interventions involving training in mindfulness meditation improve symptoms of substance use disorders (SUDs) (i.e. alcohol and/or drug use, but excluding tobacco use disorders). Cochrane researchers searched, selected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question. We found 40 randomized controlled trials,that assessed MBI as a treatment for SUDs. 
Key messages 
SUD outcomes were monitored at different time points: directly following completion of the MBIs, and at follow‐up time points, which ranged from 3 months to 10 months after the MBI ended. Relative to other interventions (standard of care, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoeducation, support group, physical exercise, medication), MBIs may slightly reduce days with substance use, but it is very uncertain whether they reduce other SUD‐related outcomes. The effects of MBIs relative to no treatment was very uncertain across all SUD‐assessed outcomes, as was the risk for adverse events. 
What was studied in this review? 
SUDs are very common and associated with negative physical and psychological health outcomes. Although evidence‐based interventions exist for treating SUDs, the standard treatments may not be sufficient and many individuals relapse to substance use. In the past several decades, MBIs have been examined for the treatment of SUDs. MBIs involve training in mindfulness meditation practice, which emphasizes the cultivation of present‐moment, non‐judgmental awareness. MBIs may improve many of the psychological variables involved in substance use and relapse (i.e. depression, anxiety, stress, attention). We studied whether MBIs benefit individuals with SUDs. 
We searched for studies that compared an MBI to no treatment or to another treatment (e.g. cognitive behavior therapy, psychoeducation). We studied the results at the end of the intervention and at follow‐up assessments, which occurred 3 to 10 months following the end of the intervention. 
What are the main results of this review? 
The review authors found 40 relevant studies, of which 45% were focused on individuals with various SUDs with the remaining studies including participants using a specific substance (e.g. alcohol, opioids). Of these 40 studies, 23 were conducted in the USA, 11 were conducted in Iran, two were conducted in Thailand, one was conducted in Brazil, one was conducted in China, one was conducted in Taiwan, and one was conducted in both Spain and the USA. We were able to analyze results of 35 studies composed of 2825 participants; the other five did not report usable results, and requests to the authors for more information were unsuccessful. 
When MBIs were compared with other treatments, our review and analysis showed that MBIs may slightly reduce days with substance use at post‐treatment and follow‐up, and show similar study retention. The evidence is uncertain for other SUD‐related outcomes we assessed (continuous abstinence, consumed amount, craving intensity). When MBIs were compared with no treatment, the evidence was uncertain for all SUD‐related outcomes, although MBIs showed similar treatment retention. Adverse effects were only reported on in four studies. However, the available evidence did not suggest MBIs result in adverse events or serious adverse events. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies published up to April 2021.
Study funding sources 
Sixteen studies reported no funding. The remaining studies reported one or more sources of funding and support. Nineteen acknowledged federal sources, seven acknowledged internal grants, four acknowledged non‐profit entities, and two acknowledged clinics.

Do mindfulness classes help people with alcohol or drug problems?

Rationale
Alcohol and drug use can harm the body and the mind. These problems can strain work, school, money, and family life. Many people seek care and still slip back to use. So, we need more ways to help.

Mindfulness is a class that trains the mind. You learn to pay full mind to the now. You watch thoughts and feelings with a kind, open view. You learn to pause and choose your next step.

These skills may help with mood, stress, and urges to use. They may help people use less or avoid a slip. The main idea is that calm, clear mind time may build self control. This review asked if such classes help and if they are safe.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. In these trials, people got put into groups by chance. One group took a mindfulness class. Other groups got no care or got a different kind of care.

The team looked for trials in many places. They found 40 such trials. They could use data from 35 trials. These 35 trials had 2,825 people in all.

People in the trials had alcohol or drug use problems. Tobacco use was not part of this review. The abstract did not list ages or gender details. Some trials mixed many kinds of use. Others looked at one drug, like alcohol or opioids.

The team checked results right after the class. They also checked results months later. The later checks were three to ten months after the class ended. This shows short term and medium term results.

The team looked at many results. They checked how many days people used in a set time. They checked full quit, which means no use at all. They checked how much people used, and how strong the urge to use felt. They also checked how many people stayed in the study.

The team also looked at safety. Trials should list bad effects. These include mild bad effects and serious bad effects. Only a few trials shared safety details.

The trials took place in many lands. Most were in the United States. Others were in Iran, Thailand, Brazil, China, Taiwan, and Spain. This helps us see how classes may work in many settings.

The review looked at how long people were in a study. People took part during the class time. Then they had checks three to ten months after the class. The class length was not clear in the abstract.

Results
When the class was compared to other care, there was a small gain. People in the class used on fewer days. This was true right after the class. It was also true months later.

These “other care” groups got real help. Some got standard care from a clinic. Some got a talk care called CBT, which teaches new ways to think and act. Others got a support group, a class on facts, exercise, or a drug treatment.

For other results, we are not sure yet. We do not know if the class helps more people quit all use. We do not know if it cuts how much people use. We do not know if it lowers the urge to use.

When the class was compared to no care, results were not clear. We cannot say the class helps, based on these trials. The data did not show a clear gain for any measured result. The number of people who stayed in the study was about the same.

Safety reports were rare. Only four trials shared safety data. These did not suggest bad or serious harm from the class. But we cannot be sure, since so few trials reported this.

People also stayed in care at about the same rate. This was true for class versus other care. It was also true for class versus no care. This means the class did not seem to make people drop out.

The trials were last found and checked up to April of 2021. Since then, new trials may exist. The review team could not use data from five trials. The authors of those trials did not send more data when asked.

Many kinds of funds backed these trials. Sixteen trials had no funds. Others had help from the government, schools, non‑profits, or clinics. Funding did not seem to change the main results.

What does this mean for you? A mindfulness class may help you use on fewer days. It may not help you quit all use. It may not cut the urge or the amount you use. We need more and better trials to know.

These classes are one tool. They may work best with other care. Ask your care team if a class fits your needs. Your goals, risks, and supports matter too.

In short, the class may help a bit with days used. We do not know its effect on other key results. We did not see clear harm, but safety data were few. More strong trials will help guide care.","Mindfulness‐based interventions for substance use disorders

10.1002-14651858.CD003459.pub4,"Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease
Although corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid‐induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6‐mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies.

Methotrexate shots may help some people with hard‑to‑treat Crohn’s disease

Rationale
Crohn’s disease is a long‑term illness of the gut. The gut gets red, sore, and swollen. Flares can come and go. This makes life hard for many people.

Doctors often use steroid drugs to calm a flare. Steroids can help at first. But many people flare again when they stop. Some need to stay on steroids.

Long steroid use can cause harm. People may gain weight. Bones may get weak. Mood and sleep may change.

We need other ways to treat this disease. Methotrexate is one option. It is a drug that calms the immune system. It may help the gut to heal.

The goal of this review was clear. The team asked if methotrexate can start a quiet phase. A quiet phase is called remission. In remission, gut signs are few or none.

The team also asked if people can stop steroids. If they can stop, side effects may drop. This would be a big help for many people.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. It looked at seven trials in total. In all, 495 people took part. They all had Crohn’s disease that was active.

Their disease did not get better with other drugs. The trials put people into groups by chance. This is called a random method. It helps make fair tests.

Some trials used methotrexate shots once each week. One large trial used 25 mg each week. The shots went into a muscle. That trial ran for 16 weeks.

Some trials used low dose pills. The dose was 12.5 to 15 mg each week. The pills were set against a sugar pill. Or they were set against other drugs.

These other drugs were azathioprine or 6‑mercaptopurine. These drugs also calm the immune system. Two trials looked at a mix of drugs. They added methotrexate to infliximab.

Infliximab is a lab made drug. It also calms gut swelling. It is often used for Crohn’s disease. The trials asked if the mix would help more.

The trials checked for key goals. One goal was a quiet gut phase. One goal was to stop steroid use. The trials also looked at side effects.

The abstract did not list the age or sex of the people. Time in each trial was not the same. One large trial ran for 16 weeks. Others may have been more or less.

Results
The large trial showed a clear sign. Methotrexate shots at 25 mg each week helped. More people had a quiet phase. More people could stop steroids.

This can help in a big way. Less steroid use can lower harm from side effects. People may feel better day to day. Care may cost less as well.

Side effects with methotrexate did occur. They were more common with a high dose. But no serious side effects were seen. This was in the trials in this review.

The common side effects were known ones. Some people felt sick to the stomach. Some threw up or had loose stool. Some had belly pain, rash, or a head ache.

Not all forms of methotrexate helped. The low dose pills did not seem to work. These were the 12.5 to 15 mg per week pills. They did not beat a sugar pill or other drugs.

But those pill trials were small. Small trials can miss a real effect. So we still need more study. New and larger pill trials may be of use.

Two trials tested a drug mix. They used infliximab with methotrexate. The mix did not help more than infliximab alone. In those trials, the add‑on gave no extra gain.

But those trials were not large. So we also need more tests of mixes. This could be with infliximab. Or with other lab made drugs.

What do these results mean for you? If you have hard‑to‑treat Crohn’s disease, shots may help. A weekly methotrexate shot may calm your gut. It may help you stop steroids.

Pills at a low dose did not help in small trials. So pills may not be the best way. At least at those low doses. Shots seem to work better so far.

This review helps guide care. It points to a tool that may help some people. It shows where we still need data. It also lists known side effects in plain terms.

The main take‑home from the team is this. Methotrexate shots at 25 mg each week may help start remission. They may help people stop steroids. We need more study on pills and on drug mixes.","Methotrexate for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease

10.1002-14651858.CD011979.pub2,"Phototherapy for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes
Review question 
Phototherapy is a pain‐free method of treatment that uses light to treat various medical conditions. We reviewed the evidence about phototherapy for foot ulcers in people with diabetes. We wanted to find out whether phototherapy speeds up wound healing and improves patients' quality of life, and whether there are any side effects. 
Background 
Foot ulcers are a disabling complication of diabetes that affect 15% to 25% of people with diabetes at some time in their lives. Diabetic foot ulcers are painful and prone to infection. Not all diabetic foot ulcers can be healed, which can ultimately lead to surgical removal of a limb. Phototherapy involves exposing the affected area to ultraviolet light, sometimes using lasers. This is thought to help ulcers heal through multiple mechanisms such as increased cell growth and blood vessel activity. It has been used as an alternative approach for healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing different phototherapies, or comparing phototherapy with other treatments or a placebo (sham treatment), for foot ulcers in adults with diabetes in October 2016. We included eight trials (316 participants). Most studies were undertaken in clinics or hospitals and had small numbers of participants (14 to 84). The average age in the included studies was from 53 to 68 years, and the ratio of females to males was 0.46 to 1.88. The included studies compared phototherapy with placebo or no phototherapy, on top of usual care (usual care could include treatments such as dressings, antibiotics, or wound cleaning). Treatment times ranged from 15 days to 20 weeks. 
Key results 
The results suggested that phototherapy, when compared to no phototherapy or a placebo, may increase the proportion of wounds completely healed during follow‐up and reduce wound size. However, as the included studies involved small numbers of participants and had drawbacks in study methods, our confidence in these results is limited. We did not find sufficient evidence that the potential harms or incidence of amputations differed between the phototherapy group and the no phototherapy/placebo group. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be low due to a lack of data and risk of the study results being biased. Further high‐quality studies are needed to confirm the benefits and harms of phototherapy.

Light therapy for foot sores in people with diabetes

Rationale
Many people with diabetes get foot ulcers. An ulcer is an open sore. These sores can hurt and get infected. Some sores do not heal.

Slow healing can lead to loss of part of the foot or leg. This harms daily life. It can also cause stress and high medical costs. So, we need better ways to heal these sores.

Phototherapy is also called light therapy. It shines light on the sore skin. Some light is ultraviolet, which we cannot see. Some light comes from a strong, tight beam called a laser.

Light may help cells grow and repair. It may also help blood flow to the sore. This could help the sore close and heal. We need to test if this is true and safe.

This study asked clear questions. Does light therapy help sores heal faster? Does it help people feel and live better? Does it cause harm?

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. A review looks at all the good studies it can find. The team searched for trials in October of 2016. They used set methods to find and judge the studies.

The team looked for strong trials. In these trials, people joined groups by chance. Some got light therapy. Some did not get light or got fake light. Fake light is also called a sham treatment.

All people also got usual wound care. Usual care can be clean dressings. It can include wound cleaning and antibiotics. These steps help prevent or treat infection.

The review found eight trials. These trials took place in clinics or hospitals. In total, 316 adults took part. All had diabetes and at least one foot ulcer.

Men and women both joined the trials. The average ages ranged from about 53 to 68 years. People stayed in treatment from 15 days to 20 weeks. The kind of light and how often it was used were not the same in each trial.

Results
The review found some signs of benefit. More people on light therapy seemed to heal fully. Sores in the light groups also seemed to get smaller faster. This hints that light may help the skin close.

But there is a problem. The trials were small. Some had weak methods. These issues can tilt the results.

Because of this, we are not sure the benefit is real. The proof we have is low in quality. We need larger and better trials to be sure.

The team also looked for harms. They checked for side effects from the light. They looked at amputations as well. They did not find clear proof of more harms with light.

This does not mean there are no harms. It means the data are not strong enough. We cannot tell if the risk is higher, lower, or the same. Better studies should track harms with care.

What does this mean for people with diabetes? Light therapy may help some foot sores heal. It may help sores get smaller. But we do not yet know how much it helps. We also do not know who will benefit most.

Light therapy should not replace good basic wound care. Good care includes clean dressings. It also includes pressure relief, blood sugar control, and infection care. Your care team can guide you on these steps.

If you are thinking about light therapy, talk with your care team. Ask if it is safe for you. Ask if the clinic has the right tools and trained staff. Ask how it fits with your current care.

This review matters for the field. It gathers the best data we had by late 2016. It shows promise for light therapy. It also shows clear gaps in our knowledge.

The main takeaways are simple. Light therapy may help healing. The current proof is weak. We need better, larger, and well run studies.

Future trials should use clear methods. They should have enough people. They should track healing and harms over time. They should also ask how people feel and live day to day.

In short, light therapy is hopeful but not proven. Keep using strong basic care. Work with your team to choose what is best for you.","Phototherapy for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes

10.1002-14651858.CD008685.pub2,"The optimal warfarin dose for patients beginning therapy
Warfarin is commonly prescribed to prevent blot clots in patients with medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation, heart valve replacement or previous blood clots. Warfarin is an effective treatment which has been used for many years but needs to be closely monitored, especially at the beginning of treatment, as there is a wide variation in response to dose. Monitoring of the response to dose is done using an International Normalized Ratio (INR) and it is important that patients remain within a narrow range (typically 2 to 3 INR) due to the need to balance the goal of preventing blood clots with the risk of causing excessive bleeding. 
This review included 12 randomised controlled trials comparing different warfarin doses given to patients beginning warfarin treatment. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias so the results were interpreted with caution. 
Those trials that were included compared loading doses in several different situations. The review authors divided the trials into four categories, 5 mg versus 10 mg initial doses (four studies), 5 mg versus other doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus age adjusted doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus genotype adjusted doses (four studies). 
The review authors concluded that there is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype adjusted dosing. We also found no data to suggest that any one method was safer than another.

Finding the best first dose when you start warfarin

Rationale
Blood clots can block blood flow. This can cause pain or harm. Many people take warfarin to help stop clots. Warfarin has been in use for many years.

Warfarin works well, but the dose is tricky. Each person’s body acts in a different way. So doctors must check the dose with a blood test. This test is called the International Normalized Ratio (INR).

INR shows how fast your blood forms a clot. Most people need an INR of 2 to 3. This range helps stop clots and also limits bleeding risk. It is key when you first start the drug.

Doctors use a “loading dose” when you start warfarin. A loading dose means the first one or few doses. Many doctors use 5 mg or 10 mg at the start. Some pick a dose based on age or on your genes.

We need clear proof on which way is best. The main goal is to reach the right INR fast. We also want to avoid harm, like bad bleeds. This review set out to study that.

Trial Design
This study was a review of many trials. A review pulls facts from many tests. It helps us see the whole story. It can show what works best.

The review looked at 12 trials. In each trial, people were put into groups by chance. That means the groups were fair and alike. All the people were just starting warfarin.

Most people take warfarin for heart rhythm issues, new heart valves, or past clots. These are common reasons for this drug. The review did not list each reason for each trial. It only said all were new to warfarin.

The trials tested first dose plans. Four trials compared 5 mg to 10 mg. Two trials compared 5 mg to other set doses. Two trials compared 5 mg or 10 mg to age-based doses. Four trials compared 5 mg or 10 mg to gene-based doses.

Age-based dosing means the dose changes with age. Gene-based dosing means the dose changes with your DNA. DNA is the code in your cells. It is what you get from your parents.

The review did not state how long people were in each trial. It also did not list the sex mix or the full age range. Some trials had older adults. But details on time in the study were not in the review.

Many trials had risks of bias. Bias means a flaw in how the trial was done. These flaws can skew results. So the team used care when they drew their views.

Results
The review found no clear best first dose. It is still not clear if 5 mg or 10 mg is better. Both can work to reach the INR goal. But we do not know which one is best for most people.

In older adults, a lower start dose may be a good plan. Age-based dosing may also help older adults. This may lower the risk of bleeding. It may still get the INR into range.

There was not enough proof to back gene-based dosing. Gene tests may one day help pick the dose. But the trials in this review did not prove a clear gain. So gene-based dosing is not needed at this time.

The review found no data to show one start plan was safer than the rest. We do not know if one plan caused fewer bleeds. We also do not know if one plan caused fewer clots. Safety seemed much the same in the data we have.

Many trials had flaws. That means we must be careful with the takeaways. We need more good trials. We need trials with clear plans and less bias.

What does this mean for you? Your warfarin dose may start at 5 mg or 10 mg. Or your doctor may use your age to set the dose. Your dose may change as your INR moves.

Fast and steady INR checks are key at the start. Work with your care team on this. Share any signs of bleed or clot right away. Your team will adjust the dose to keep you safe.

In short, warfarin helps stop clots. But the best first dose is not yet clear. Older adults may do well with a lower or age-based dose. Gene-based dosing is not yet proven to help. More strong trials can help guide the first dose choice.","The optimal warfarin dose for patients beginning therapy

This review included 12 randomised controlled trials comparing different warfarin doses given to patients beginning warfarin treatment. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias so the results were interpreted with caution. 
Those trials that were included compared loading doses in several different situations. The review authors divided the trials into four categories, 5 mg versus 10 mg initial doses (four studies), 5 mg versus other doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus age adjusted doses (two studies), 5 mg or 10 mg versus genotype adjusted doses (four studies). 
The review authors concluded that there is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype adjusted dosing. We also found no data to suggest that any one method was safer than another.

10.1002-14651858.CD013877.pub3,"Background
Loss of olfactory function is well recognised as a symptom of COVID‐19 infection, and the pandemic has resulted in a large number of individuals with abnormalities in their sense of smell. For many, the condition is temporary and resolves within two to four weeks. However, in a significant minority the symptoms persist. At present, it is not known whether early intervention with any form of treatment (such as medication or olfactory training) can promote recovery and prevent persisting olfactory disturbance. This is an update of the 2021 review with four studies added. 
Objectives
1) To evaluate the benefits and harms of any intervention versus no treatment for people with acute olfactory dysfunction due to COVID‐19 infection.  
2) To keep the evidence up‐to‐date, using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the latest search was 20 October 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with COVID‐19 related olfactory disturbance, which had been present for less than four weeks. We included any intervention compared to no treatment or placebo.  
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were the presence of normal olfactory function, serious adverse effects and change in sense of smell. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of parosmia, change in sense of taste, disease‐related quality of life and other adverse effects (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.  
Main results
We included five studies with 691 participants. The studies evaluated the following interventions: intranasal corticosteroid sprays, intranasal corticosteroid drops, intranasal hypertonic saline and zinc sulphate.  
Intranasal corticosteroid spray compared to no intervention/placebo  
We included three studies with 288 participants who had olfactory dysfunction for less than four weeks following COVID‐19. 
Presence of normal olfactory function 
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of intranasal corticosteroid spray on both self‐rated recovery of olfactory function and recovery of olfactory function using psychophysical tests at up to four weeks follow‐up (self‐rated: risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.68; 1 study; 100 participants; psychophysical testing: RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.63; 1 study; 77 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).  
Change in sense of smell 
The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of intranasal corticosteroid spray on self‐rated change in the sense of smell (at less than 4 weeks: mean difference (MD) 0.5 points lower, 95% CI 1.38 lower to 0.38 higher; 1 study; 77 participants; at > 4 weeks to 3 months: MD 2.4 points higher, 95% CI 1.32 higher to 3.48 higher; 1 study; 100 participants; very low‐certainty evidence, rated on a scale of 1 to 10, higher scores mean better olfactory function). Intranasal corticosteroids may make little or no difference to the change in sense of smell when assessed with psychophysical testing (MD 0.2 points, 95% CI 2.06 points lower to 2.06 points higher; 1 study; 77 participants; low‐certainty evidence, 0‐ to 24‐point scale, higher scores mean better olfactory function).  
Serious adverse effects 
The authors of one study reported no adverse effects, but their intention to collect these data was not pre‐specified so we are uncertain if these were systematically sought and identified. The remaining two studies did not report on adverse effects.  
Intranasal corticosteroid drops compared to no intervention/placebo  
We included one study with 248 participants who had olfactory dysfunction for ≤ 15 days following COVID‐19. 
Presence of normal olfactory function 
Intranasal corticosteroid drops may make little or no difference to self‐rated recovery at > 4 weeks to 3 months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.11; 1 study; 248 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No other outcomes were assessed by this study.  
Data on the use of hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and the use of zinc sulphate to prevent persistent olfactory dysfunction are included in the full text of the review. 
Authors' conclusions
There is very limited evidence available on the efficacy and harms of treatments for preventing persistent olfactory dysfunction following COVID‐19 infection. However, we have identified a number of ongoing trials in this area. As this is a living systematic review we will update the data regularly, as new results become available.

Do early nose treatments help COVID-19 smell loss?

Rationale
COVID-19 can harm the sense of smell. Many people get smell back in two to four weeks. But some people still have smell problems for a long time. This can make food taste odd. It can also harm mood and safety.

Many people ask if early care can help. People try nose sprays, nose drops, salt water rinses, zinc pills, or smell training. Smell training means you sniff set scents each day. We do not yet know if these help.

This review asked a clear question. Do early treatments help people with new smell loss from COVID-19? The main idea was that fast care might help smell return. It also asked if these treatments have harms.

This review looked at drugs put in the nose. These are “steroids.” A steroid is a drug that calms swelling. The review also looked at salt water rinses and zinc pills.

Trial Design
How is this study designed? This is a “systematic review.” That means the team looked for all good trials on the topic. They used a plan to search many health sites and trial lists. The last search date was October 20, 2021.

They only used “randomized” trials. In these trials, people get put by chance in a group. Some get the real treatment. Some get no treatment or a “dummy” treatment. A dummy is also called a “placebo.”

The review found five trials. There were 691 people in all. All had COVID-19 and new smell loss. The smell loss had lasted less than four weeks. One trial had people with smell loss for 15 days or less.

The trials tested these early treatments:
- Steroid nose sprays in three trials
- Steroid nose drops in one trial
- Salt water nose rinse in one or more trials
- Zinc pills in one or more trials

People stayed in the trials for up to four weeks. Some had checks as far as three months. Trials looked at if smell went back to normal. They also looked at change in smell scores. They planned to track bad side effects. Some also looked at taste change, nose bleeds, and “parosmia.” Parosmia means smells seem wrong or bad.

Results
Steroid nose sprays
Three trials with 288 people tested sprays. Do sprays help smell go back to normal in four weeks? The data do not give a clear answer. One trial with smell tests done by staff showed a gain. But a trial that asked people to rate smell did not show a clear gain. The trials were small. The proof is weak.

Do sprays change smell scores? One trial found little change in under four weeks. By three months, one trial showed a small gain by self score. Staff smell tests showed little or no change. Again, the proof is weak.

What about harms from sprays? One trial said no harms. But they did not have a strong plan to track harms. Two trials did not report harms. So we still do not know if sprays cause harm in this use.

Steroid nose drops
One trial with 248 people tested drops. All had smell loss for 15 days or less. Did drops help more people get back to normal smell by three months? No. By self report, drops did not help more than no treatment. The abstract did not give other results for drops.

Salt water rinses and zinc pills
The review looked at these too. But the abstract did not give details on their results. So we cannot say if these help based on this text.

What this means for patients
Most people with COVID-19 smell loss get better in two to four weeks. For people with new smell loss, we do not have clear proof that early nose steroids help. We also do not have clear proof that they do not help. We do not have good data on harms. We also cannot tell from this text if salt water or zinc help.

This review did not give results on smell training. So we still do not know if it helps when used early. More good trials are on the way. This review is “living.” That means the team will add new trial results as they come out.

Why this study matters
Smell loss is common with COVID-19. It can harm day to day life. It can make it hard to smell smoke or gas. It can lower joy in food. People want safe and fast ways to get smell back.

This review gathers what we know now. It found only five trials so far. The trials were small and not all used the same tests. The results do not yet give a clear guide.

Conclusion from the investigators
There is very little strong proof right now. We do not know if early nose sprays or drops help. We do not know if they cause harm. Trials on salt water rinses and zinc pills need clear results too. More and better trials are in progress. The review will update the facts as new data come in.

If you have smell loss, talk with your health care team. Ask about what we know and do not know. Ask about risks and costs. Many people improve with time. This review shows that we still need better answers.","Interventions for the prevention of persistent smell disorders (olfactory dysfunction) after COVID‐19 infection 
Why this is important 
COVID‐19 has been found to cause problems with the sense of smell. Sometimes this is a reduction in the ability to smell things, and sometimes it is a complete loss of the sense of smell. For many people this recovers in a short time, but for others it may last for weeks or months. This review considers whether there are treatments that people might take as soon as they have lost their sense of smell (within four weeks of the symptoms starting), to try and stop this becoming a long‐standing problem. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
We searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature to summarise the results. We also looked at how certain the evidence was, considering things like the size of the studies and how they were carried out. Based on this, we classed the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found five studies that had been completed. 
Intranasal corticosteroids compared to no treatment  
Three studies looked at this treatment. 
Nasal corticosteroid spray might make little or no difference to the sense of smell when measured with specific tests (rather than when asking people about their sense of smell). 
The rest of the evidence was of very low certainty, so we do not know whether a nasal corticosteroid spray is better or worse than no treatment at: 
‐ helping the sense of smell get back to normal (either people feeling that their sense of smell is back to normal, or having a normal sense of smell according to specific tests); 
‐ making people feel that their sense of smell has improved;
‐ causing any unwanted side effects.
Intranasal corticosteroid drops compared to placebo (dummy treatment) 
One study looked at this treatment.
Intranasal corticosteroid drops might not make any difference to the number of people who think their sense of smell has recovered at 30 days.  
We did find a number of other studies that are being carried out, but no results from these studies were available yet to be included in this review. 
What this means 
We do not know whether using a nasal corticosteroid spray or nasal drops has any benefit in preventing longer‐term loss of the sense of smell that is related to COVID‐19, or whether they may cause any harm. This review is a 'living systematic review' ‐ meaning that we will keep checking for new studies that might be relevant, and the review will be continually updated when any extra results are available. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to October 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013162.pub2,"Background
Previous Cochrane Reviews have shown that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders. However, questions remain regarding the following: up‐to‐date evidence of the relative efficacy and acceptability of CBT compared to waiting lists/no treatment, treatment as usual, attention controls, and alternative treatments; benefits across a range of outcomes; longer‐term effects; outcomes for different delivery formats; and amongst children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and children with intellectual impairments. 
Objectives
To examine the effect of CBT for childhood anxiety disorders, in comparison with waitlist/no treatment, treatment as usual (TAU), attention control, alternative treatment, and medication. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (all years to 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (each to October 2019), international trial registries, and conducted grey literature searches. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of CBT that involved direct contact with the child, parent, or both, and included non‐CBT comparators (waitlist/no treatment, treatment as usual, attention control, alternative treatment, medication). Participants were younger than age 19, and met diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Primary outcomes were remission of primary anxiety diagnosis post‐treatment, and acceptability (number of participants lost to post‐treatment assessment), and secondary outcomes included remission of all anxiety diagnoses, reduction in anxiety symptoms, reduction in depressive symptoms, improvement in global functioning, adverse effects, and longer‐term effects. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 87 studies and 5964 participants in quantitative analyses.
Compared with waitlist/no treatment, CBT probably increases post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety diagnoses (CBT: 49.4%, waitlist/no treatment: 17.8%; OR 5.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.90 to 7.60; n = 2697, 39 studies, moderate quality); NNTB 3 (95% CI 2.25 to 3.57) and all anxiety diagnoses (OR 4.43, 95% CI 2.89 to 6.78; n = 2075, 28 studies, moderate quality). 
Low‐quality evidence did not show a difference between CBT and TAU in post‐treatment primary anxiety disorder remission (OR 3.19, 95% CI 0.90 to 11.29; n = 487, 8 studies), but did suggest CBT may increase remission from all anxiety disorders compared to TAU (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.46; n = 203, 5 studies). 
Compared with attention control, CBT may increase post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety disorders (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.89; n = 822, 10 studies, low quality) and all anxiety disorders (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.22 to 6.17; n = 378, 5 studies, low quality). 
There was insufficient available data to compare CBT to alternative treatments on post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety disorders, and low‐quality evidence showed there may be little to no difference between these groups on post‐treatment remission of all anxiety disorders (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.23; n = 401, 4 studies) 
Low‐quality evidence did not show a difference for acceptability between CBT and waitlist/no treatment (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.41; n=3158, 45 studies), treatment as usual (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.56; n = 441, 8 studies), attention control (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.49; n = 797, 12 studies) and alternative treatment (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.13; n=515, 7 studies). 
No adverse effects were reported across all studies; however, in the small number of studies where any reference was made to adverse effects, it was not clear that these were systematically monitored. 
Results from the anxiety symptom outcomes, broader outcomes, longer‐term outcomes and subgroup analyses are provided in the text. 
We did not find evidence of consistent differences in outcomes according to delivery formats (e.g. individual versus group; amount of therapist contact time) or amongst samples with and without ASD, and no studies included samples of children with intellectual impairments. 
Authors' conclusions
CBT is probably more effective in the short‐term than waiting lists/no treatment, and may be more effective than attention control. We found little to no evidence across outcomes that CBT is superior to usual care or alternative treatments, but our confidence in these findings are limited due to concerns about the amount and quality of available evidence, and we still know little about how best to efficiently improve outcomes.

How well does CBT help anxious children and teens?

Rationale
Many children and teens live with strong worry or fear. This can harm school, sleep, and friends. Some also feel sad. Families can feel stress and lost.

CBT is a type of talk therapy. It teaches new ways to think and act. It helps kids face fears in small, safe steps. Past work found CBT can help.

But some key questions were not clear. Does CBT work better than a waitlist? Is it better than usual care, simple check‑ins, other therapy, or pills? Do gains last? Does it work in a group or one‑to‑one? What about kids with autism? This review set out to update the facts.

The goal was to guide care. The team looked at how well CBT worked. They also looked at safety and if kids stayed in care. They sought the best ways to help more kids get well.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. A trial is a study that tests a treatment. In these trials, kids got put into groups by chance. This is a fair way to test care.

All kids were under 19 years old. A trained person had said they had an anxiety disorder. CBT sessions could be with the child, a parent, or both. The other groups were different types of care.

The review compared CBT to these groups:
- Waitlist or no treatment. Kids wait and get no new care now.
- Treatment as usual. This is the care people normally get.
- Attention control. This is talk time with a helper, but not CBT skills.
- Alternative treatment. This means a different kind of therapy, not CBT.
- Medicine. This means drug treatment for anxiety.

The review found 87 trials. They included 5,964 young people. Most trials checked results right after care. A few checked later on. Time in each trial was not the same.

Results
Main finding: CBT helped more kids get past their main anxiety, when compared to a waitlist. About 5 in 10 kids got well with CBT. About 2 in 10 got well on a waitlist. So, CBT helped more kids.

Said another way, for every 3 kids who get CBT, about 1 extra kid gets well. CBT also helped more kids get past any anxiety disorder, not just the main one. This was based on many trials and many kids.

When CBT was compared to usual care, the picture was less clear. For the main anxiety problem, CBT did not show a clear edge. In some trials, more kids had no anxiety disorder after CBT than after usual care. But the proof here was not strong.

When CBT was compared to attention control, CBT may help more kids. More kids lost the main anxiety problem. More kids lost any anxiety problem. But this proof was also not strong.

When CBT was compared to other therapy, data were few. In the small set of trials, CBT and other therapy helped about the same. We cannot say one was better.

The review planned to compare CBT with medicine. But it did not have clear results to report on this point. We still need more good trials here.

Safety is key for families. No harms from CBT were reported in the trials. But most trials did not look for harms in a clear, set way. We need better checks for harms in future work.

Did kids stay in care? About the same number left care early in all groups. This suggests kids and families accept CBT about as well as other care. This is good news for care plans.

How to give CBT may also matter. Some kids had one‑to‑one care. Some had group care. Some had more or less time with a therapist. The review found no clear winner. Each way seemed to help about the same.

What about kids with autism? Results looked about the same for kids with and without autism. No trials looked at kids with an intellectual disability. We need studies for these kids.

Do gains last? Some trials looked later on. The take‑home is not yet clear. We still need more long‑term data.

What does all this mean? CBT likely helps in the short term more than a waitlist. It may help more than simple check‑ins. We do not have strong proof that CBT beats usual care or other types of therapy. But the proof we have for these points is not strong.

In sum, CBT is a sound choice for many anxious kids. It can help many get well. More high‑quality trials can show how to help even more kids. We also need to learn which way to give CBT works best, and for whom.","Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety in children and young people
Why is this review important? 
Many children and young people experience problems with anxiety. Children and young people with anxiety disorders are more likely than their peers to have difficulty with friendships, family life, and school, and to develop mental health problems later in life. Therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help children and young people to overcome difficulties with anxiety by using new ways of thinking and facing their fears. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Parents, children, and young people; people working in education and mental health services for children and young people; and general practitioners. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review updates and replaces previous Cochrane Reviews from 2005 and 2015, which showed that CBT is an effective treatment for children and young people with anxiety disorders. 
This review aimed to answer the following questions:
• Is CBT more effective than a waiting list or no treatment?
• Is CBT more effective than other treatments and medication?
• Does CBT help to reduce anxiety for children and young people in the longer term?
• Are some types of CBT more effective than others? (e.g. individual versus group therapy) 
• Is CBT effective for specific groups? (e.g. children with autism)
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched the databases to find all studies of CBT for anxiety disorders in children and young people published up to October 2019. In order to be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) and had to include young people under 19 years of age with an anxiety disorder diagnosis. We included 87 studies with a total of 5964 participants in the analysis. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
We rated the overall quality of the evidence as 'moderate’ or 'low'. There is evidence that CBT is more effective than a waiting list or no treatment in reducing anxiety in children and young people, although the findings did vary across studies. There is no clear evidence that CBT is more effective than other treatments. A small number of studies looked at outcomes six months after CBT was given and showed that reductions in anxiety continued. We found no clear evidence that one way of providing CBT is more effective than another (e.g. in a group, longer treatments, with parents) or that CBT is more or less effective for any specific group of children (e.g. children with autism spectrum disorders). 
What should happen next? 
Future research should compare CBT to alternative treatments and medication; identify who does and does not benefit from CBT and what those who do not benefit need; establish how to make CBT more accessible; and give far more consideration to neglected populations, including children and young people from low‐ and middle‐income countries.

10.1002-14651858.CD010382.pub2,"Non‐drug management of breathing problems for children with severe physical and intellectual impairment 
Background For a variety of reasons, some children live with very severe intellectual and physical problems; they are unable to walk or talk and require a lot of care. In this study we refer to them as children with severe global developmental delay (SGDD); this is not a specific diagnosis but is rather an 'umbrella term' used to describe a group of children with similar problems. These children may have weak or stiff muscles and deformities of their skeleton; often they have problems with swallowing, resulting in food or saliva going into their lungs. Frequently they have a poor cough reflex and lack the strength required to expel secretions when they do cough. When we sleep, our breathing becomes shallower; for some children with SGDD whose breathing is already shallow when awake, falling asleep means that they do not breathe sufficiently deeply to take in enough oxygen and breathe out enough carbon dioxide. The consequence of these problems is that their respiratory system becomes weakened; they are more likely to develop chest infections, and relatively minor infections can make them very unwell. This can result in their spending a lot of time in hospital. This affects the quality of life for these children and families and is very expensive. Many types of treatment could help, but no good summary of studies has been prepared to tell healthcare professionals which treatments are best and when they should be used; this is the reason for this review. 
Review question The aim of our review was to discover how effective each type of treatment is for managing breathing problems in children with severe global developmental delay. As so many treatments are available, we decided to look only at treatments that do not involve drugs. 
Study characteristics We carried out a wide database search to look for studies of interventions for the management of breathing problems in children with severe neurological impairment. We found 15 studies of interest, which included a number of different types of treatment. 
Key results The results showed that several different treatments provided potential benefits, and for most interventions no serious adverse effects were reported. However, the quality of the studies was not good enough to inspire confidence in the findings. Night‐time positioning equipment and spinal bracing were shown to have a potentially negative effect in some participants. Although some studies looked at the same type of treatment, they used it in different ways or used different measures to assess effectiveness, so we could not put the results together. 
Quality of the evidence Of the 15 studies included here, only four used the 'gold standard' study design for health interventions. The remainder of the studies used less robust study designs, which limits the strength of the results. Further well‐designed randomised studies including larger numbers of participants are required to guide healthcare professionals to select the most effective treatments. 
This plain‐language summary is current to November 2013.  We updated searches in November 2019 and July 2020 and added six studies to awaiting classification, but these results have not been fully incorporated into the review.

Non-drug ways to help breathing in children with severe developmental delay

Rationale
Some children have very severe delay in growth and learning. They often cannot walk or talk. They need help with most daily care. In this summary, we call this severe global developmental delay, or SGDD.

Children with SGDD can have weak or stiff muscles. Their bones and joints may twist or bend. They may have trouble with chewing and swallowing. Food or saliva can slip into the lungs.

Many of these children have a weak cough. They may not have the strength to clear mucus. In sleep, we all breathe more shallow. For these children, shallow breathing can get worse at night.

These breathing problems strain the lungs. Chest infections are common. Small colds can turn into bad illness. Many children spend a lot of time in the hospital.

This hurts the child and the family. It also costs a lot of money. Many kinds of care might help the lungs. But there was no good guide to show what helps and when.

The team wanted to study this gap. They asked a clear question. Do non-drug treatments help these children breathe better? They looked for the best proof they could find.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team did not start a new trial. They searched many research libraries. They looked for studies on children with SGDD and breathing problems.

They included only non-drug care. This means care like body supports or other tools. It can also mean ways to move the body to help the lungs. It did not include pills or liquid drugs.

They found 15 studies to review. The studies tested different kinds of care. Some studied the same type of care, but used it in new ways. They also measured results in different ways.

Only four studies used a strong design. In that design, children go into groups by chance. This is often called a randomized trial. The rest used weaker designs.

No child joined a new study for this review. So there was no set time a person spent in a study. The team did new searches in 2019 and 2020. They found six more studies, but did not add them yet.

Results
Several kinds of non-drug care seemed to help some children. For most types of care, the studies did not report serious harms. This is good news. But the proof is still weak.

Why is the proof weak? The studies were small. They did not all test the same things. They also used different ways to measure change. That makes it hard to compare or combine results.

Two types of care may cause harm for some children. One is night-time body supports. These are tools that hold the body in one pose in bed. The other is a back brace that holds the spine straight.

Some children did not do well with these supports. They may have had worse breathing in the study. Because the studies were small, we cannot say this will happen to all. But it is a warning sign.

What does this mean for care now? Non-drug care may help some children breathe better. These methods might help clear saliva. They might help the chest move. They may support safe rest at night.

But we need better proof to guide care. Doctors and care teams should take care when they use body supports. They should watch each child closely. They should change the plan if breathing gets worse.

This review helps families and care teams in two ways. First, it shows that some non-drug care may help. Second, it shows where proof is still weak. It points to what we must learn next.

Future studies should be larger. They should use strong designs where groups are set by chance. They should test the same kinds of care in the same way. They should also measure the same results.

Clear and shared measures will help us compare studies. This will show which care helps most. It will also show which care may harm. Then, teams can choose the best plan for each child.

The team wrote this summary in 2013. They later found six more studies in 2019 and 2020. Those new results are not in this summary. So, the full picture may change as we add them.

Bottom line: Many non-drug treatments may help breathing in children with SGDD. Most did not show serious harms. But night body supports and back braces may harm some children. We need larger, better studies to know what helps, for whom, and when.","Non‐drug management of breathing problems for children with severe physical and intellectual impairment

Review question The aim of our review was to discover how effective each type of treatment is for managing breathing problems in children with severe global developmental delay. As so many treatments are available, we decided to look only at treatments that do not involve drugs. 
Study characteristics We carried out a wide database search to look for studies of interventions for the management of breathing problems in children with severe neurological impairment. We found 15 studies of interest, which included a number of different types of treatment. 
Key results The results showed that several different treatments provided potential benefits, and for most interventions no serious adverse effects were reported. However, the quality of the studies was not good enough to inspire confidence in the findings. Night‐time positioning equipment and spinal bracing were shown to have a potentially negative effect in some participants. Although some studies looked at the same type of treatment, they used it in different ways or used different measures to assess effectiveness, so we could not put the results together. 
Quality of the evidence Of the 15 studies included here, only four used the 'gold standard' study design for health interventions. The remainder of the studies used less robust study designs, which limits the strength of the results. Further well‐designed randomised studies including larger numbers of participants are required to guide healthcare professionals to select the most effective treatments. 
This plain‐language summary is current to November 2013.  We updated searches in November 2019 and July 2020 and added six studies to awaiting classification, but these results have not been fully incorporated into the review.

10.1002-14651858.CD009567.pub2,"Treatments for high altitude (mountain) illness
Background 
Acute high altitude illness, also known as acute mountain sickness, may present with a variety of symptoms. It is caused by the decreasing level of oxygen at increasingly high altitudes; and it can be experienced when reaching a high altitude when travelling, hiking or climbing mountains or other elevated areas. People going to altitudes over 4000 metres, females, people younger than mid‐adulthood , and people with a history of migraine are at greater risk of suffering from altitude sickness. The most common symptoms are headache, loss of appetite , insomnia, and nausea. However, severe forms can include confusion, difficulty walking, progressive cough, shortness of breath, and even death. 
Review question 
What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for people suffering from high altitude illness? 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 studies with a total of 468 participants. Most studies included participants with mild or moderate forms of mountain sickness, and only one study included the severe neurological (disorder of the nervous system) form. Follow‐up was usually less than one day. We also identified two ongoing studies. 
Key results 
We found studies evaluating the following interventions: simulated descent with a hyperbaric chamber (medical use of oxygen in a special chamber at greater than atmospheric pressure to increase the availability of oxygen in the body); oxygen; medicines: acetazolamide, dexamethasone, ibuprofen, paracetamol, gabapentin, sumatriptan, nitric oxide, and magnesium sulphate. None of the studies reported the effects of these interventions on all‐cause mortality. The report of complete relief from acute mountain sickness symptoms, and adverse events was infrequent. Studies related to simulated descent with the use of a hyperbaric chamber did not find additional benefits or harms related to this intervention (3 studies, 124 participants). In addition, studies related to administration of medicines found some benefits in terms of reduction of symptoms with the use of acetazolamide (2 studies, 25 participants), and dexamethasone (1 study, 35 participants), without an increase in side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence we found was low, and thus our certainty in the findings is limited. There was insufficient information on how the studies were conducted, and in some cases there was evidence of tampering at some stages of the trials. Furthermore, the number of persons in each study was very small (< 30 participants), and therefore the results were not clear (imprecise). Some studies were not blinded (that is, participants knew what experimental treatment they were receiving), and this could have affected how the participants evaluated their own symptoms.

Treating Mountain Sickness: What Works and What We Still Do Not Know

Rationale
Mountain sickness can start when you go high into the mountains. The air has less oxygen there. Your body may not get enough oxygen to work well.
Common early signs are headache, no desire to eat, poor sleep, and nausea. Bad cases can cause confusion, trouble to walk, cough that gets worse, short breath, and even death.
Risk is higher if you go above 4,000 meters. Women, people younger than mid‑adult age, and people with migraines face more risk.
Many people travel, hike, or climb at high places. They want fast and safe care if they get sick. Doctors use oxygen, a pressure chamber, and many drugs for this.
We need to know which care helps and which does not help. We also need to know about harms. This study looked at the benefits and risks of these care options.
Some care aims to give the body more oxygen. Some pills aim to ease signs. Some may lower brain or body swelling. We wanted to see which ones work best.

Trial Design
This study was a review of past trials. The team pulled data from many trials. It was not one new trial.
They found 13 trials with 468 people in total. Most people had mild or mid sickness. One trial had people with a severe brain and nerve form.
Most trials tracked people for less than one day. The team also found two trials still in progress.
The trials tested these care options:
- A pressure chamber for “simulated drop” to a lower height. This gives more oxygen by air pressure.
- Oxygen.
- Pills and other drugs. These were acetazolamide, dexamethasone, ibuprofen, paracetamol, gabapentin, sumatriptan, nitric oxide, and magnesium sulfate.
The trials checked change in signs and any bad effects. They also looked for full relief of signs.
The people in these trials all had mountain sickness. This text did not give ages or sex.
The time in each trial was short. Most people were watched for less than one day.

Results
No trial in this review told about deaths from any cause. Few trials told if all signs went away. Few trials gave full details on side effects.
Three trials with 124 people tested the pressure chamber. They did not find extra help or extra harm with the chamber.
Some pills helped cut signs in small trials. Two trials with 25 people found that acetazolamide helped. One trial with 35 people found that dexamethasone helped. These pills did not show more side effects in those trials.
This text did not give clear results for oxygen. It also did not give clear results for ibuprofen, paracetamol, gabapentin, sumatriptan, nitric oxide, or magnesium sulfate. So we cannot say if they help or not from this text.
The strength of the proof was low. Many trials were very small. Most had fewer than 30 people. Small trials can give unclear results.
Some trials did not hide the care from the people. When people know what they get, that can change how they rate their signs. That can bias the results.
There was not enough detail on how the teams ran the trials. In some cases, there were signs that steps in the trial may have changed. This can lower trust in the results.
What does this mean for you? Some drugs may help ease signs of mountain sickness. Acetazolamide helped in two small trials. Dexamethasone helped in one small trial. The pressure chamber did not add clear help or harm in three trials.
But we are not very sure. The proof is weak due to small size and other issues. The results may change when we have large and well run trials.
More and better trials are needed. Trials should enroll more people. They should track people for longer than one day. They should also do a better job to hide the care from patients and staff. Clear reports on side effects are also key.
In short, some care may help. But we need stronger proof to guide you and your care team. Until then, talk with your doctor about your own risks and needs.","Treatments for high altitude (mountain) illness

10.1002-14651858.CD013846.pub2,"Background
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors (COX‐I) may prevent PDA‐related complications. Controversy exists on which COX‐I drug is the most effective and has the best safety profile in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic COX‐I drugs and 'no COXI prophylaxis' in preterm infants using a Bayesian network meta‐analysis (NMA). 
Search methods
Searches of Cochrane CENTRAL via Wiley, OVID MEDLINE and Embase via Elsevier were conducted on 9 December 2021. We conducted independent searches of clinical trial registries and conference abstracts; and scanned the reference lists of included trials and related systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled preterm or low birth weight infants within the first 72 hours of birth without a prior clinical or echocardiographic diagnosis of PDA and compared prophylactic administration of indomethacin or ibuprofen or acetaminophen versus each other, placebo or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. We used the GRADE NMA approach to assess the certainty of evidence derived from the NMA for the following outcomes: severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), mortality, surgical or interventional PDA closure, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), gastrointestinal perforation, chronic lung disease (CLD) and cerebral palsy (CP). 
Main results
We included 28 RCTs (3999 preterm infants). Nineteen RCTs (n = 2877) compared prophylactic indomethacin versus placebo/no treatment, 7 RCTs (n = 914) compared prophylactic ibuprofen versus placebo/no treatment and 2 RCTs (n = 208) compared prophylactic acetaminophen versus placebo/no treatment. Nine RCTs were judged to have high risk of bias in one or more domains.We identified two ongoing trials on prophylactic acetaminophen. 
Bayesian random‐effects NMA demonstrated that prophylactic indomethacin probably led to a small reduction in severe IVH (network RR 0.66, 95% Credible Intervals [CrI] 0.49 to 0.87; absolute risk difference [ARD] 43 fewer [95% CrI, 65 fewer to 16 fewer] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; moderate‐certainty), a moderate reduction in mortality (network RR 0.85, 95% CrI 0.64 to 1.1; ARD 24 fewer [95% CrI, 58 fewer to 16 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐4; moderate‐certainty) and surgical PDA closure (network RR 0.40, 95% CrI 0.14 to 0.66; ARD 52 fewer [95% CrI, 75 fewer to 30 fewer] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐2; moderate‐certainty) compared to placebo. Prophylactic indomethacin resulted in trivial difference in NEC (network RR 0.76, 95% CrI 0.35 to 1.2; ARD 16 fewer [95% CrI, 42 fewer to 13 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; high‐certainty), gastrointestinal perforation (network RR 0.92, 95% CrI 0.11 to 3.9; ARD 4 fewer [95% CrI, 42 fewer to 137 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐3; moderate‐certainty) or CP (network RR 0.97, 95% CrI 0.44 to 2.1; ARD 3 fewer [95% CrI, 62 fewer to 121 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; low‐certainty) and may result in a small increase in CLD (network RR 1.10, 95% CrI 0.93 to 1.3; ARD 36 more [95% CrI, 25 fewer to 108 more] per 1000; median rank 3, 95% CrI 1‐3; low‐certainty). 
Prophylactic ibuprofen probably led to a small reduction in severe IVH (network RR 0.69, 95% CrI 0.41 to 1.14; ARD 39 fewer [95% CrI, 75 fewer to 18 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐4; moderate‐certainty) and moderate reduction in surgical PDA closure (network RR 0.24, 95% CrI 0.06 to 0.64; ARD 66 fewer [95% CrI, from 82 fewer to 31 fewer] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐2; moderate‐certainty) compared to placebo. Prophylactic ibuprofen may result in moderate reduction in mortality (network RR 0.83, 95% CrI 0.57 to 1.2; ARD 27 fewer [95% CrI, from 69 fewer to 32 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐4; low‐certainty) and leads to trivial difference in NEC (network RR 0.73, 95% CrI 0.31 to 1.4; ARD 18 fewer [95% CrI, from 45 fewer to 26 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐3; high‐certainty), or CLD (network RR 1.00, 95% CrI 0.83 to 1.3; ARD 0 fewer [95% CrI, from 61 fewer to 108 more] per 1000; median rank 2, 95% CrI 1‐3; low‐certainty). The evidence is very uncertain on effect of ibuprofen on gastrointestinal perforation (network RR 2.6, 95% CrI 0.42 to 20.0; ARD 76 more [95% CrI, from 27 fewer to 897 more] per 1000; median rank 3, 95% CrI 1‐3; very low‐certainty). 
The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of prophylactic acetaminophen on severe IVH (network RR 1.17, 95% CrI 0.04 to 55.2; ARD 22 more [95% CrI, from 122 fewer to 1000 more] per 1000; median rank 4, 95% CrI 1‐4; very low‐certainty), mortality (network RR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.16 to 1.4; ARD 82 fewer [95% CrI, from 135 fewer to 64 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐4; very low‐certainty), or CP (network RR 0.36, 95% CrI 0.01 to 6.3; ARD 70 fewer [95% CrI, from 109 fewer to 583 more] per 1000; median rank 1, 95% CrI 1‐3; very low‐certainty). 
In summary, based on ranking statistics, both indomethacin and ibuprofen were equally effective (median ranks 2 respectively) in reducing severe IVH and mortality. Ibuprofen (median rank 1) was more effective than indomethacin in reducing surgical PDA ligation (median rank 2). However, no statistically‐significant differences were observed between the COX‐I drugs for any of the relevant outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Prophylactic indomethacin probably results in a small reduction in severe IVH and moderate reduction in mortality and surgical PDA closure (moderate‐certainty), may result in a small increase in CLD (low‐certainty) and results in trivial differences in NEC (high‐certainty), gastrointestinal perforation (moderate‐certainty) and cerebral palsy (low‐certainty). Prophylactic ibuprofen probably results in a small reduction in severe IVH and moderate reduction in surgical PDA closure (moderate‐certainty), may result in a moderate reduction in mortality (low‐certainty) and trivial differences in CLD (low‐certainty) and NEC (high‐certainty). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acetaminophen on any of the clinically‐relevant outcomes.

Early medicines to help very small babies with an open heart vessel

2. Rationale
Some babies are born too soon. In many of them, a small heart vessel stays open. Doctors call this patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA. This open vessel can strain the heart and lungs. It can raise the risk of brain bleeds and gut injury.

Doctors use early medicines to try to prevent these harms. These drugs may help the vessel close. The drugs studied here are indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen. These are common pain or fever drugs. In tiny doses, they may help the vessel close.

But we do not know which drug works best, or is safest. Some studies show gains, but others do not. This study set out a clear goal. It asked: which drug helps most, and with the least harm? The team thought two drugs, indomethacin and ibuprofen, might help most.

3. Trial Design
The team looked at many past trials. In each trial, babies went into groups by chance. This is called randomization. All babies were very small or born early. They got the study drug in the first three days of life. Babies did not have a PDA diagnosis at the start.

The team compared three drugs to a fake drug or no drug. The drugs were indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen. They also compared the drugs with each other by linking data across trials. This type of work lets us compare even if two drugs were not tested head to head.

The team measured key health problems. These were bad brain bleeds, death, surgery to close the vessel, gut injury, a hole in the gut, long-term lung disease, and cerebral palsy. The abstract did not say how long babies stayed in each trial. It also did not give dose details.

In total, 28 trials with 3,999 babies were in the review. Nineteen trials (2,877 babies) tested indomethacin. Seven trials (914 babies) tested ibuprofen. Two trials (208 babies) tested acetaminophen. Two new trials of acetaminophen are still in progress.

4. Results
Indomethacin helped some. It likely lowered bad brain bleeds a little. Out of 1,000 babies, about 43 fewer had a bad brain bleed. It likely lowered the need for an operation to close the vessel. Out of 1,000 babies, about 52 fewer needed surgery. It may also lower the risk of death a bit. Out of 1,000 babies, about 24 fewer died.

Indomethacin did not change gut injury in a clear way. It did not change the rate of a hole in the gut. It did not change the rate of cerebral palsy. It may raise long-term lung disease a little. Out of 1,000 babies, about 36 more may have lung disease. We are not fully sure of this last point.

Ibuprofen also helped. It likely lowered bad brain bleeds a little, much like indomethacin. Out of 1,000 babies, about 39 fewer had a bad brain bleed. It likely lowered the need for surgery even more. Out of 1,000 babies, about 66 fewer needed surgery. It may lower death a bit. Out of 1,000 babies, about 27 fewer died. We are less sure about the death result.

Ibuprofen did not change gut injury or long-term lung disease in a clear way. We do not know if it raises the chance of a hole in the gut. The data on gut holes were too small and unclear.

For acetaminophen, we do not know yet. Only two small trials tested it. The results were very unsure for all health problems. Two more trials are still going on.

When we stack the drugs side by side, here is the picture. Indomethacin and ibuprofen both seem to help with bad brain bleeds and death. They look about the same for those two results. Ibuprofen seems to cut the need for surgery a bit more. But the study did not find a clear winner. The gap between the two may be due to chance.

This work matters for tiny babies and their families. A bad brain bleed can lead to life-long needs. An operation on a tiny baby is also hard. If a simple early drug can lower these risks, that helps a lot.

What should parents take from this?
- Early indomethacin or ibuprofen can help a bit.
- They can lower bad brain bleeds and the need for surgery.
- The drop in death may be small.
- Indomethacin may raise lung problems a little. We are not fully sure.
- Ibuprofen did not show clear extra harms in this review. But we still watch for gut holes.
- For acetaminophen, we need more and better data.

Doctors will weigh these points for each baby. Each baby is unique. Size, age, other health issues, and unit practice all play a role. This review gives doctors and parents better facts to guide care.","Prophylactic cyclo‐oxygenase inhibitor drugs to prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants 
 
Review question 
Among the available cyclo‐oxygenase inhibitor (COX‐I) drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen), which one is the safest and most effective in preventing death and poor outcomes in preterm infants when given prophylactically without the prior knowledge of the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) within the first 72 hours after birth? 
Background 
A PDA is a common complication in preterm or low‐birth weight infants. PDA is an open vascular channel between the lungs and the heart which usually closes shortly after birth. In preterm infants, the PDA frequently remains open and may contribute to life‐threatening complications. COX‐I drugs such as indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen may prevent a PDA and related poor outcomes. Controversy exists on which of the three COX‐I drugs, if any, improves clinical outcomes in preterm infants. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in preterm babies (born at less than 37 weeks into pregnancy) or low‐birthweight (weighing less than 2500 grams) infants where COX‐I drugs were given without the prior knowledge of the presence of a PDA, within the first 72 hours after birth. The included studies compared administration of indomethacin or ibuprofen or acetaminophen versus each other, placebo or no treatment.  
Key results 
This review of 28 clinical trials (3999 preterm infants) found that prophylactic indomethacin probably results in a small reduction in severe brain bleeding, a moderate reduction in death and need for PDA surgery, and may result in a small increase in chronic lung disease. Prophylactic indomethacin likely results in trivial differences in necrotizing enterocolitis, gastrointestinal perforation and cerebral palsy. Prophylactic ibuprofen probably results in a small reduction in severe brain bleeding and a moderate reduction in need for PDA surgery. Prophylactic ibuprofen may result in a moderate reduction in death and trivial differences in chronic lung disease and necrotizing enterocolitis. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of acetaminophen on any of the clinically relevant outcomes.There are currently two ongoing trials on prophylactic use of acetaminophen. 
Certainty of the evidence 
According to GRADE (a method to score the certainty of the trials supporting each outcome), the certainty of the evidence varied from very low to high but was moderate for the most important outcomes of severe brain bleeding and death. 
How up to date is the search evidence 
The search is up to date as of 9 December 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD006487.pub2,"Injectable local anaesthetic agents for preventing pain in participants requiring dental treatment 
Review question 
This review assessed the evidence for providing successful local anaesthesia that prevents pain during a dental procedure. Included studies compared injections of local anaesthetic to help people requiring dental treatment and to prevent painful sensations tested in an experimental way (such as using cold, a sharp probe, or an electric stimulus). 
Background 
An injection of local anaesthetic prevents a person from feeling pain. It is given in one specific area rather than in the whole body. Although pain during dental treatment can be successfully managed, it is a common fear of patients. 
Several different local anaesthetics are available to dentists, as well as a variety of ways to deliver them, to prevent pain. Factors that appear to influence success include increased difficulty in anaesthetizing teeth in the presence of inflammation, variable susceptibility of different teeth to local anaesthesia, different operative procedures performed on the tooth (for example, it appears easier to achieve successful anaesthesia for dental extractions than for root canal treatment), and various techniques and solutions used to give the local anaesthetic. 
We investigated whether injection of one local anaesthetic solution was more effective than another for preventing pain during dental treatment or during an experimental study, and whether this effect occurred quickly or lasted a sufficient length of time, if any unwanted effects occurred, and people’s experience of the dental procedures. Local adverse events might include pain during or after injection, or long‐lasting anaesthesia. Systemic effects due to the local anaesthetic solution can include allergic reactions and changes in heart rate and blood pressure. 
Study characteristics 
Two reviewers searched the literature to identify studies that compared different local anaesthetic solutions injected into people undergoing dental treatment or volunteers who had the same outcomes measured in experimental ways. Within every trial, each person was randomly assigned to receive one of the local anaesthetics under study. The search was up‐to‐date as of 31 January 2018. 
We found 123 trials with 19,223 male and female participants. These trials investigated pain experienced during dental treatment including surgery, extraction, periodontal (gum) treatment, tooth preparation, root canal treatment, anaesthesia of nerves within teeth (pulps) tested using an electric pulp tester or cold stimulant, and anaesthesia of soft tissues measured following pricking of gums or self‐reported by the participant. We pooled data from 68 studies (6615 participants). This resulted in eight outcomes when seven different local anaesthetic solutions were tested during dental treatment, two outcomes assessing pain during and after injection of local anaesthetic, and 47 outcomes tested with a pulp tester or by pricking of gums or self‐reported by participants. 
Key results 
The review suggests that of the 14 types of local anaesthetic tested, evidence to support the use of one over another is limited to the outcome of success (absence of pain), from three comparisons of local anaesthetic. Findings show that 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine in posterior teeth with inflamed pulps requiring root canal treatment. No difference between these solutions was seen when pain on injection was assessed, and although lidocaine resulted in less post‐injection pain, the difference was minimal. Researchers found that 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 3% prilocaine, 0.03 IU felypressin and 4% prilocaine plain for surgical procedures and surgical procedures/periodontal treatment, respectively. Speeds of onset were within clinically acceptable times, and durations were variable, making them suitable for different applications. Both of these latter outcomes were tested in experimental ways that may not reflect clinical findings. Unwanted effects were rare. Patients' experience of the procedures was not assessed owing to lack of data. 
Quality of the evidence 
From comparisons of local anaesthetics in this review, all appeared effective and safe with little difference between them. Available evidence ranged from moderate to very low in quality. Some studies fell short, in terms of quality, owing to small numbers of participants, unclear reporting of study methods, and reporting of data in a format that was not easy to combine with other data. Further research is required to clarify the effectiveness and safety of one local anaesthetic over another.

Which dental numbing shot works best to stop pain?

Rationale
Many people fear pain at the dentist. A numbing shot can block pain in one area. It helps you feel calm and safe during care. Dentists can choose from many numbing drugs and ways to give them.

Some teeth are hard to numb when the inside is sore or inflamed. Back teeth can be harder to numb than front teeth. Some care, like pulling a tooth, may be easier to numb than root canal work. With many choices, it is not clear which drug works best. This study asked which shots work best and are safe.

Trial Design
This was a review of many studies. The team looked for studies where people got dental care or had pain tests. Pain tests used cold, a sharp tip, or a small electric pulse on a tooth or gum. In each study, people were put into groups by chance. Each group got a different numbing drug.

The search was up to date on 31 January 2018. The team found 123 trials. These trials had 19,223 men and women. The studies looked at pain during surgery, pulling teeth, gum care, tooth prep, and root canals. They also looked at how well teeth or gums felt numb in tests.

The team combined data from 68 studies. These 68 studies had 6,615 people in total. Not all studies could be combined. The time a person spent in each study was not clear. The drugs were given as shots near the tooth or gum.

Results
All the numbing shots worked to block pain. All seemed safe. Side effects were rare. Most side effects were mild, like pain during or after the shot.

Some drugs worked a bit better in some cases. One key point was for back teeth with sore nerves that need a root canal. In those cases, articaine worked better than lidocaine. Both drugs had a small dose of epinephrine, a drug that tightens blood vessels. That helps the numbness last longer.

People felt the same pain when the shot went in, no matter which drug. After the shot, lidocaine caused a little less soreness than articaine. But the difference was small. For surgery on teeth, lidocaine worked better than prilocaine with felypressin. For surgery and gum care, lidocaine also worked better than prilocaine without felypressin. Felypressin is a drug that also tightens blood vessels.

The time it took to get numb was fast enough with all drugs. How long the numbness lasted was not the same for all drugs. This can help dentists match the drug to the care you need. For short work, a shorter time may be best. For long work, a longer time may be best.

Some results came from lab-like tests. These used cold, a sharp tip, or a small electric pulse. These tests may not always match what happens during real dental care. Few studies asked people how the whole visit felt. So we do not know how the shots changed the visit for the patient.

The quality of the proof was mixed. Some proof was moderate in strength. Some was low or very low. Some studies had few people. Some did not report well. Some made the data hard to combine. Because of this, we still need more good studies.

What this means for you
If you need dental work, a numbing shot should help block pain. Most shots work well and are safe. Your dentist may choose a drug based on your tooth, gums, and the type of work. If your back tooth nerve is sore and you need a root canal, articaine may work better than lidocaine. For surgery or gum care, lidocaine may work better than some forms of prilocaine. But these last points came from tests that may not match real care.

Ask your dentist which shot they plan to use and why. Tell them if you have had problems with numbing in the past. Share any health issues or drug allergies. Side effects are rare. Pain during the shot can happen. Mild soreness after the shot can happen. These feelings do not last long in most people.

In short, many safe choices exist. The small differences can guide care for your needs. Better studies will help us know more.","Injectable local anaesthetic agents for preventing pain in participants requiring dental treatment 
Review question 
This review assessed the evidence for providing successful local anaesthesia that prevents pain during a dental procedure. Included studies compared injections of local anaesthetic to help people requiring dental treatment and to prevent painful sensations tested in an experimental way (such as using cold, a sharp probe, or an electric stimulus). 
Background 
An injection of local anaesthetic prevents a person from feeling pain. It is given in one specific area rather than in the whole body. Although pain during dental treatment can be successfully managed, it is a common fear of patients. 
Several different local anaesthetics are available to dentists, as well as a variety of ways to deliver them, to prevent pain. Factors that appear to influence success include increased difficulty in anaesthetizing teeth in the presence of inflammation, variable susceptibility of different teeth to local anaesthesia, different operative procedures performed on the tooth (for example, it appears easier to achieve successful anaesthesia for dental extractions than for root canal treatment), and various techniques and solutions used to give the local anaesthetic. 
We investigated whether injection of one local anaesthetic solution was more effective than another for preventing pain during dental treatment or during an experimental study, and whether this effect occurred quickly or lasted a sufficient length of time, if any unwanted effects occurred, and people’s experience of the dental procedures. Local adverse events might include pain during or after injection, or long‐lasting anaesthesia. Systemic effects due to the local anaesthetic solution can include allergic reactions and changes in heart rate and blood pressure. 
Study characteristics 
Two reviewers searched the literature to identify studies that compared different local anaesthetic solutions injected into people undergoing dental treatment or volunteers who had the same outcomes measured in experimental ways. Within every trial, each person was randomly assigned to receive one of the local anaesthetics under study. The search was up‐to‐date as of 31 January 2018. 
We found 123 trials with 19,223 male and female participants. These trials investigated pain experienced during dental treatment including surgery, extraction, periodontal (gum) treatment, tooth preparation, root canal treatment, anaesthesia of nerves within teeth (pulps) tested using an electric pulp tester or cold stimulant, and anaesthesia of soft tissues measured following pricking of gums or self‐reported by the participant. We pooled data from 68 studies (6615 participants). This resulted in eight outcomes when seven different local anaesthetic solutions were tested during dental treatment, two outcomes assessing pain during and after injection of local anaesthetic, and 47 outcomes tested with a pulp tester or by pricking of gums or self‐reported by participants. 
Key results 
The review suggests that of the 14 types of local anaesthetic tested, evidence to support the use of one over another is limited to the outcome of success (absence of pain), from three comparisons of local anaesthetic. Findings show that 4% articaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine in posterior teeth with inflamed pulps requiring root canal treatment. No difference between these solutions was seen when pain on injection was assessed, and although lidocaine resulted in less post‐injection pain, the difference was minimal. Researchers found that 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was superior to 3% prilocaine, 0.03 IU felypressin and 4% prilocaine plain for surgical procedures and surgical procedures/periodontal treatment, respectively. Speeds of onset were within clinically acceptable times, and durations were variable, making them suitable for different applications. Both of these latter outcomes were tested in experimental ways that may not reflect clinical findings. Unwanted effects were rare. Patients' experience of the procedures was not assessed owing to lack of data. 
Quality of the evidence 
From comparisons of local anaesthetics in this review, all appeared effective and safe with little difference between them. Available evidence ranged from moderate to very low in quality. Some studies fell short, in terms of quality, owing to small numbers of participants, unclear reporting of study methods, and reporting of data in a format that was not easy to combine with other data. Further research is required to clarify the effectiveness and safety of one local anaesthetic over another.

10.1002-14651858.CD012853.pub2,"Cannabis and cannabis oil for the treatment of Crohn's disease
What is Crohn's disease? 
Crohn’s disease is a long‐term condition that results in inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, occurring anywhere from the mouth to the anus. Common symptoms include fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss. Crohn's disease is characterized by periods of relapse when people are actively experiencing symptoms and periods of remission when the symptoms stop. 
What are Cannabis and Cannabinoids? 
Cannabis is a widely used drug which acts on the endocannabinoid system. Cannabis contains multiple components called cannabinoids. The use of cannabis and cannabis oil containing specific cannabinoids produces mental and physical effects such as altered sensory perception and euphoria when consumed. Some cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, do not have a psychoactive effect. Cannabis and cannabidiol have some anti‐inflammatory properties that might help people with Crohn's disease. 
What did the researchers investigate? 
The researchers studied whether cannabis is better than placebo (e.g. a sugar pill) therapy for treating adults with active Crohn's disease or Crohn's disease that is in remission. 
What did the researchers find? 
The researchers extensively searched the literature up to 17 October 2018 and found three studies (93 participants) that met the inclusion criteria. One ongoing study was also identified. All of the studies were small in size and had some quality issues. One small study (21 participants) compared eight weeks of treatment with cannabis cigarettes containing 115 mg of D9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to placebo cigarettes containing cannabis with the THC removed in participants with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. Although no difference in clinical remission rates was observed, more participants in the cannabis group had improvement in their Crohn's disease symptoms than participants in the placebo group. More side effects were observed in the cannabis cigarette group compared to placebo. These side effects were considered to be mild in nature and included sleepiness, nausea, difficulty with concentration, memory loss, confusion and dizziness. Participants in the cannabis cigarette group reported improvements in pain, appetite and satisfaction with treatment. 
One small study (22 participants) compared cannabis oil (10 mg of cannabidiol twice daily) to placebo oil (i.e. olive oil) in participants with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. No difference in clinical remission rates was observed. There was no difference in serious side effects. Serious side effects included worsening Crohn's disease in one participant in each group. 
One small study (50 participants) compared cannabis oil (composed of 15% cannabidiol and 4% THC) to placebo oil in participants with active Crohn's disease. Positive differences in quality of life and the Crohn's disease activity index were observed. 
Conclusions 
The effects of cannabis and cannabis oil on Crohn's disease are uncertain. No firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms (e.g. side effects) of cannabis and cannabis oil in adults with Crohn's disease can be drawn. The effects of cannabis and cannabis oil in people with Crohn's disease in remission have not been investigated. Further studies with larger numbers of participants are required to assess the potential benefits and harms of cannabis in Crohn's disease. Future studies should assess the effects of cannabis in people with active and inactive Crohn's disease. Different doses of cannabis and formulations (e.g. cannabis oil or pills) should be investigated.

Can cannabis or cannabis oil help adults with Crohn’s disease?

Rationale
Crohn’s disease is a long-term gut disease. It can affect any part of the gut, from mouth to bottom. It causes swelling in the gut. Common signs are fever, loose stools, belly pain, and weight loss.

People with Crohn’s have flares and quiet times. A flare is when signs are active. Quiet time, or remission, is when signs stop. Flares can hurt daily life. They can harm sleep, work, and mood. Many people try many drugs to feel better.

Cannabis is a plant used by many people. It has plant parts called cannabinoids. These parts can change how we feel pain and mood. Some parts can cause a “high.” One part, called cannabidiol, or CBD, does not cause a high. Some parts may calm swelling. So, they might help Crohn’s disease.

The study team asked a clear question. Does cannabis help adults with Crohn’s more than a look‑alike with no drug (a placebo)? They also asked if cannabis is safe. This work is needed because some people do not get better with usual drugs. Cannabis and CBD may help with pain or swelling. But we must test this with care.

Trial Design
The team searched medical papers up to October 17, 2018. They looked for studies in adults with Crohn’s disease. They found three small studies. In total, 93 people took part. They also found one study still in progress.

All three studies tested people with active Crohn’s disease. The reports did not list the gender mix. The studies did not include people in quiet phases of Crohn’s. So, we do not know effects in remission.

Each study compared cannabis or cannabis oil to a placebo. A placebo is a look‑alike with no active drug. The goal was to see if signs got better. The goal was also to see if people felt well and safe on the drug.

The time in each study was short. One study lasted eight weeks. The other two did not give the time in the report.

Results
This is what each study found.

Study 1: Cannabis smoke vs placebo smoke
This study had 21 adults. All had active Crohn’s. All had tried at least one drug that did not work. People smoked cannabis or placebo for eight weeks. The cannabis had a part called THC, which can cause a “high.”

Remission rates were the same in both groups. This means about the same number reached a quiet phase. But more people who used cannabis felt better day to day. They had less pain and better gut signs.

People who used cannabis had more side effects. These were mild. They were sleepiness, sick stomach, trouble to focus, memory lapses, confusion, and feeling dizzy. People on cannabis also said their pain was less. They ate better. They felt more happy with care.

Study 2: CBD oil vs placebo oil
This study had 22 adults. All had active Crohn’s. All had tried at least one drug that did not work. People took CBD oil by mouth. The placebo was olive oil.

Remission rates were the same in both groups. There was no sign that CBD alone led to more people in a quiet phase. Serious side effects were rare and the same in both groups. In each group, one person had Crohn’s get worse.

Study 3: CBD plus THC oil vs placebo oil
This study had 50 adults with active Crohn’s. People took an oil that had both CBD and THC. The other group took a placebo oil.

People who took the oil with CBD and THC felt better overall. They had better scores for life quality. They also had better scores on a Crohn’s symptom scale. This scale adds up many gut signs to a single number.

What do these findings mean?
Across the three studies, the results do not match in all ways. In two studies, the number of people in remission did not change with cannabis or CBD. In one study, people on cannabis smoke said they felt better. In one study, the oil with both CBD and THC helped life quality and symptom scores.

Side effects did occur. In the smoke study, mild side effects were more common. These included sleepiness and trouble to focus. With CBD oil alone, serious side effects were rare and the same as placebo. One person in each group had Crohn’s get worse.

What are the limits?
These studies were small. They had few people. Some had quality issues in how they were run or reported. We do not know the long‑term effects. We do not know the best dose or best form. We do not know how cannabis works for people in remission. The reports did not give details on gender. Two studies did not state how long they ran.

Conclusions from the investigators
The effect of cannabis and cannabis oil for Crohn’s is still not clear. We cannot make firm claims on benefits or harms yet. We need larger and better studies. Future work should test people with active and quiet disease. It should test different doses and forms, like oil, smoke, or pills. It should track both signs and day‑to‑day life.

What this means for patients
Cannabis may help some people feel better. It may ease pain or improve life quality. But it did not raise the number of people in remission in two small studies. Side effects can occur. Some are mild, like sleepiness or dizzy spells.

If you think about cannabis, talk with your care team. Ask about risks and local laws. Ask about how it may fit with your care plan. More and better research is on the way.","Cannabis and cannabis oil for the treatment of Crohn's disease

10.1002-14651858.CD008215.pub3,"Is there an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with drugs for subfertility?
Background Drugs to stimulate ovulation have been used to treat subfertility since the early 1960s. There is uncertainty about the safety of these drugs and their potential risk of causing cancer. Moreover, it has already been shown that infertility itself increases the risk of ovarian cancer. 
The aim of the review We aimed with this updated systematic review to summarise current published research on the risk of ovarian cancer in subfertile women treated with fertility drugs compared to the general population and to subfertile women not treated with fertility drugs. 
What are the main findings? Overall, based on 37 studies, which included a total of 4,684,724 women, we did not find enough strong evidence suggesting a potentially higher risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with fertility drugs. 
A cumulative analysis of 12 case‐control studies from the USA revealed increased risk of ovarian cancer in women using fertility drugs, and this risk was higher in nulliparous women (women who have not given birth) when compared to multiparous women (women who have given birth to more than one child). One of the 37 included studies reported a two‐fold increase in development of serous borderline ovarian tumour in women after more than four cycles of progesterone; however the number of cases included in this group was very small. One cohort study also suggested an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumour in infertile women treated with clomiphene citrate when compared to infertile women who did not undergo treatment to conceive. 
Quality of the evidence Studies showing an increase in the risk of ovarian cancer were of low methodological quality, with short follow‐up periods and with lack of adjustment for important confounding factors; therefore the results are too unreliable. However, compared with older studies, recent studies have tended to report both the dose and the number of cycles of infertility drugs and have included more contemporary drug regimens; this has made the final results more reliable. 
What are the conclusions? Infertility has been found to be an important risk factor for ovarian cancer. However, the association between infertility drugs and ovarian cancer needs to be addressed with consideration of other factors such as age, body mass index, parity, genetic factors (i.e. family history for ovarian cancer), and aetiology of the infertility, along with longer follow‐up times.

Fertility drugs and ovarian cancer: what we learned from many studies

Rationale
Some people have trouble getting pregnant. Doctors call this subfertility. It can cause stress, grief, and high cost. Many people try drugs that help the ovary release an egg. These drugs have been used since the 1960s.

Some people worry that these drugs may raise cancer risk. Ovarian cancer is cancer of the ovary. It can be hard to find early. We also know that subfertility itself can raise the risk of ovarian cancer.

This review asked a clear question. Do fertility drugs raise the risk of ovarian cancer? The team wanted to compare three groups. They looked at women with subfertility who used these drugs. They looked at women with subfertility who did not use the drugs. They also looked at women in the general public.

This work is needed to guide care. These drugs can help people build a family. But people also want to know if the drugs add cancer risk. Clear facts can help people and doctors make choices.

Trial Design
This was not a new drug study. No one got a new pill in this review. The team did not enroll new patients. They read and combined past research. This type of work is a “systematic review.”

The team looked at 37 studies. These studies included 4,684,724 women. Some studies compared women with ovarian cancer to women without it. Some studies followed women over time to see who got cancer later. The team also looked at a set of 12 studies from the USA.

The women in the studies were adults with subfertility. Subfertility means trouble getting pregnant. Some women used drugs to help the ovary release an egg. Some did not. There was no set time in this review for any one person. The review used past data, so there were no study visits.

Results
Across all 37 studies, the team did not find strong proof of harm. In simple words, the review did not show a clear raise in ovarian cancer risk from fertility drugs. This was true when they compared to the general public. It was also true when they compared to women with subfertility who did not use the drugs.

But there were some mixed signals. When the team pooled 12 USA studies, they saw a higher risk. This higher risk was stronger in women who had never given birth. It was lower in women who had given birth many times.

One study found a higher risk of a “borderline” ovarian tumor. A borderline tumor is a growth that is not clearly cancer. It is not normal either. This study saw about two times higher risk after more than four rounds of a hormone drug called progesterone. But the number of women in this group was very small.

One study that followed women over time found a signal too. It suggested a higher risk of borderline ovarian tumor in women who used clomiphene citrate. This drug helps the ovary release an egg. The risk looked higher than in women with subfertility who did not use the drug.

We must weigh how strong the proof is. Studies that showed higher risk had key limits. Many had short time watching people. Cancer can take many years to develop. Many did not adjust for other things that raise risk. These include age, weight, number of births, family history, and the cause of subfertility. For these reasons, those results are not very reliable.

Newer studies did some things better. They reported the drug dose. They reported how many rounds of drugs people took. They used more modern drug plans. These steps help make results more sound. Even with these steps, the review did not find strong proof of harm.

So what does this mean for people? First, subfertility itself can raise ovarian cancer risk. This is important to know. Second, this review did not show that the drugs add clear extra risk. Some small groups did seem to have a higher risk. But those signals came from weaker studies. We need more and better research to be sure.

Future work should watch people for a long time. It should account for age and body size. It should include number of births and family history. It should include the cause of subfertility. It should also track the drug type, dose, and number of rounds.

In short, this big review offers some calm. It did not find strong proof that fertility drugs raise ovarian cancer risk. But doctors and patients should still talk about personal risk. They should weigh the need to treat subfertility. They should also consider age, body size, past births, and family history. This will help each person choose the plan that fits them best.","Is there an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women treated with drugs for subfertility?

10.1002-14651858.CD014328,"Background
Arthroscopic knee surgery remains a common treatment for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, including for degenerative meniscal tears, despite guidelines strongly recommending against its use. This Cochrane Review is an update of a non‐Cochrane systematic review published in 2017. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of arthroscopic surgery, including debridement, partial menisectomy or both, compared with placebo surgery or non‐surgical treatment in people with degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis, degenerative meniscal tears, or both). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers up to 16 April 2021, unrestricted by language. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or trials using quasi‐randomised methods of participant allocation, comparing arthroscopic surgery with placebo surgery or non‐surgical interventions (e.g. exercise, injections, non‐arthroscopic lavage/irrigation, drug therapy, and supplements and complementary therapies) in people with symptomatic degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis or degenerative meniscal tears or both). Major outcomes were pain, function, participant‐reported treatment success, knee‐specific quality of life, serious adverse events, total adverse events and knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of evidence using GRADE. The primary comparison was arthroscopic surgery compared to placebo surgery for outcomes that measured benefits of surgery, but we combined data from all control groups to assess harms and knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy). 
Main results
Sixteen trials (2105 participants) met our inclusion criteria. The average age of participants ranged from 46 to 65 years, and 56% of participants were women. Four trials (380 participants) compared arthroscopic surgery to placebo surgery. For the remaining trials, arthroscopic surgery was compared to exercise (eight trials, 1371 participants), a single intra‐articular glucocorticoid injection (one trial, 120 participants), non‐arthroscopic lavage (one trial, 34 participants), non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (one trial, 80 participants) and weekly hyaluronic acid injections for five weeks (one trial, 120 participants). The majority of trials without a placebo control were susceptible to bias: in particular, selection (56%), performance (75%), detection (75%), attrition (44%) and selective reporting (75%) biases. The placebo‐controlled trials were less susceptible to bias and none were at risk of performance or detection bias. Here we limit reporting to the main comparison, arthroscopic surgery versus placebo surgery. 
High‐certainty evidence indicates arthroscopic surgery leads to little or no difference in pain or function at three months after surgery, moderate‐certainty evidence indicates there is probably little or no improvement in knee‐specific quality of life three months after surgery, and low‐certainty evidence indicates arthroscopic surgery may lead to little or no difference in participant‐reported success at up to five years, compared with placebo surgery. 
Mean post‐operative pain in the placebo group was 40.1 points on a 0 to 100 scale (where lower score indicates less pain) compared to 35.5 points in the arthroscopic surgery group, a difference of 4.6 points better (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 better to 9 better; I2 = 0%; 4 trials, 309 participants). Mean post‐operative function in the placebo group was 75.9 points on a 0 to 100 rating scale (where higher score indicates better function) compared to 76 points in the arthroscopic surgery group, a difference of 0.1 points better (95% CI 3.2 worse to 3.4 better; I2 = 0%; 3 trials, 302 participants). 
Mean post‐operative knee‐specific health‐related quality of life in the placebo group was 69.7 points on a 0 to 100 rating scale (where higher score indicates better quality of life) compared with 75.3 points in the arthroscopic surgery group, a difference of 5.6 points better (95% CI 0.36 better to 10.68 better; I2 = 0%; 2 trials, 188 participants). We downgraded this evidence to moderate certainty as the 95% confidence interval does not rule in or rule out a clinically important change. 
After surgery, 74 out of 100 people reported treatment success with placebo and 82 out of 100 people reported treatment success with arthroscopic surgery at up to five years (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.86; I2 = 53%; 3 trials, 189 participants). We downgraded this evidence to low certainty due to serious indirectness (diversity in definition and timing of outcome measurement) and serious imprecision (small number of events). 
We are less certain if the risk of serious or total adverse events increased with arthroscopic surgery compared to placebo or non‐surgical interventions. Serious adverse events were reported in 6 out of 100 people in the control groups and 8 out of 100 people in the arthroscopy groups from eight trials (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.83; I2 = 47%; 8 trials, 1206 participants). Fifteen out of 100 people reported adverse events with control interventions, and 17 out of 100 people with surgery at up to five years (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.70; I2 = 48%; 9 trials, 1326 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low, downgraded twice due to serious imprecision (small number of events) and possible reporting bias (incomplete reporting of outcome across studies). Serious adverse events included death, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis and deep infection. 
Subsequent knee surgery (replacement or high tibial osteotomy) was reported in 2 out of 100 people in the control groups and 4 out of 100 people in the arthroscopy surgery groups at up to five years in four trials (RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.94 to 7.34; I2 = 11%; 4 trials, 864 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low, downgraded twice due to the small number of events. 
Authors' conclusions
Arthroscopic surgery provides little or no clinically important benefit in pain or function, probably does not provide clinically important benefits in knee‐specific quality of life, and may not improve treatment success compared with a placebo procedure. It may lead to little or no difference, or a slight increase, in serious and total adverse events compared to control, but the evidence is of low certainty. Whether or not arthroscopic surgery results in slightly more subsequent knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy) compared to control remains unresolved.

Do small-scope knee surgeries help knee pain from wear and tear?

Rationale
Knee wear and tear is called osteoarthritis. The smooth joint part wears down. A meniscus is the knee’s soft cushion. It can fray or tear with age and use. Both problems can cause pain, swelling, and stiff joints. Walking, stairs, and sleep can get hard.

Many people have small-scope knee surgery for these problems. Doctors place a tiny camera and tools in the knee through small cuts. They may trim a torn cushion. They may clean rough spots. Some advice now says to avoid this surgery for wear and tear. But many people still get it.

This study asked a clear question. Does this surgery help more than pretend surgery or other care? The team also looked at harms. They wanted to see if surgery helps pain, knee use, and life quality. They also wanted to know if people felt it worked.

Trial Design
This was a review of many fair tests. In these tests, chance picked who got which care. This helps make a fair match between groups.

The team searched medical records up to mid-April 2021. They found 16 trials with 2105 adults. Ages were 46 to 65 years. About 56 out of 100 were women. All people had knee wear and tear, a worn or torn meniscus, or both. All had knee pain.

Four trials (380 people) used a pretend surgery group. In pretend surgery, people go to the operating room. But doctors do not do the key steps of the surgery. This helps test the true effect of surgery.

Other trials compared surgery to other care. These were: set exercise plans (8 trials, 1371 people), one steroid shot into the knee (120 people), a knee wash without the scope (34 people), anti-inflammatory pills (80 people), or a series of gel shots (120 people).

The trials measured these things. Pain. How well the knee worked. Knee life quality. If people felt the care worked. Side effects. Serious harms. Later knee surgery, like a knee replace or a bone cut to shift knee load.

People were checked at three months. Some were also checked for as long as five years. Some trials had weaker methods. The pretend-surgery trials were stronger and give clearer answers.

Results
These results focus first on the best test: surgery versus pretend surgery. This shows the true added value of the surgery.

Pain at three months: The team is very sure about this. Surgery led to little or no extra pain relief. On a 0 to 100 pain scale, the pretend group had about 40. The surgery group had about 36. That is about 5 points less pain. This small change likely does not help daily life.

Knee use at three months: The team is very sure about this. Both groups used the knee about the same. Scores were almost the same. Surgery did not add real benefit.

Knee life quality at three months: The team is fairly sure about this. Surgery was a little better, by about 6 points on a 0 to 100 scale. We cannot tell if this small change matters in real life.

Did people feel the care worked? The team is not very sure about this. Up to five years after care, 74 out of 100 people in the pretend group said yes. In the surgery group, 82 out of 100 said yes. The range of results was wide. We cannot say surgery helps more in a sure way.

Harms and side effects: The team is not very sure about this. Serious harms were not common in either group. In the no-surgery groups, 6 out of 100 people had a serious harm. In the surgery groups, 8 out of 100 people had a serious harm. Any harm of any kind was 15 out of 100 without surgery, and 17 out of 100 with surgery. We do not know if surgery raises risk. Serious harms seen in the trials included death, blood clots in the leg or lung, heart attack, and deep joint infection.

Later knee surgery: The team is not very sure about this. In the no-surgery groups, 2 out of 100 people later had a knee replace or a bone cut to shift load. In the surgery groups, 4 out of 100 later had one of these. We do not know if this is a real rise.

What this means
For adults with knee wear and tear or a worn meniscus, small-scope knee surgery did not help pain in a clear way. It did not help knee use in a clear way. It likely does not improve knee life quality in a way most people would feel. A few more people said surgery worked, but the results were not clear.

The risks may be about the same as other care, or a bit higher. We cannot be sure. Later big knee surgery may be a bit more common after small-scope surgery. Again, we cannot be sure.

Overall, the reviewers’ view is clear. This surgery gives little or no real gain for this group. Many people still have this surgery. These results show that many may not gain from it. Talk with your care team about what these results mean for you.","Arthroscopic surgery for degenerative knee disease
Background 
Degenerative knee disease (osteoarthritis in the knee which affects the joint lining and menisci) is the most common cause of knee pain, swelling and stiffness in the knee joint which leads to difficulty in walking. The cartilage in the knee joint is damaged, resulting in friction in the joint surfaces and formation of new bone in severe cases. Arthroscopic knee surgery removes damaged cartilage and loose tissue and smooths the knee joint surfaces. 
Study characteristics 
We included 16 randomised trials (2105 participants) published up to 16 April 2021. Trials were conducted in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Pakistan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Netherlands and USA. 
Overall, 56% of participants were women. The average age of participants ranged from 46 to 65 years and the average duration of symptoms ranged from 1.6 months to 4.4 years. Of the nine trials reporting their funding source, none received funding from industry. The other seven trials did not report any funding source. 
We limit reporting to the main comparison, arthroscopic surgery versus placebo (dummy or sham) surgery. 
Key results 
Compared with placebo surgery, arthroscopic surgery had little benefit:
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improvement in pain was 4.6 points better (0.02 better to 9 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative pain as 35.5 points.
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative pain as 40.1 points.
Knee function (higher scores mean better function) 
Improvement in knee function was 0.1 points better (3.2 worse to 3.4 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative knee function as 76.0 points. 
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative knee function as 75.9 points. 
Knee‐specific quality of life (higher scores mean better quality of life) 
Improvement in knee‐specific quality of life was 5.6 points better (0.4 better to 10.7 better) on a 0 to 100 point scale with arthroscopic surgery than with placebo, 3 months after surgery. 
• People who had arthroscopic surgery rated their post‐operative quality of life as 75.3 points. 
• People who had placebo surgery rated their post‐operative quality of life as 69.7 points. 
Treatment success (rated by participants) 
8% more people rated their treatment a success (25% fewer to 63% more), or 8 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 82 out of 100 people reported treatment success with arthroscopic surgery.
• 74 out of 100 people reported treatment success with placebo surgery.
Serious adverse events 
2% more people (2% fewer to 10% more) had serious adverse events, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 8 out of 100 people reported serious adverse events with arthroscopic surgery.
• 6 out of 100 people reported serious adverse events with placebo surgery.
Total adverse events 
2% more people (3% fewer to 11% more), had adverse events, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years after surgery. 
• 17 out of 100 people reported adverse events with arthroscopic surgery.
• 15 out of 100 people reported adverse events with placebo surgery.
Subsequent knee surgery 
2% more people (0.1% fewer to 9% more), had subsequent knee surgery, or 2 more people out of 100, at up to 5 years. 
• 4 out of 100 people had knee replacement or osteotomy (knee surgery that reshapes bone) with arthroscopic surgery. 
• 2 out of 100 people had knee replacement or osteotomy with placebo surgery.
Certainty of the evidence 
We are confident that knee arthroscopy does not provide any clinically important benefits in terms of pain and function. We are moderately confident that knee arthroscopy probably does not provide any clinically important benefits in knee‐specific quality of life over a placebo procedure. Knee arthroscopy may not increase participant‐reported success compared with placebo. We have little confidence in the evidence because of differences across trials in reporting success and the small number of events. We are less certain of the risk of serious and total adverse events in arthroscopy versus placebo surgery: the evidence was uncertain because of the small number of events and incomplete reporting of study information. 
Adverse events associated with surgery include total knee replacement, osteotomy, repeat arthroscopy, arthroscopy in opposite knee, cutaneous nerve lesion (damage to nerves in the skin), deep or superficial infection, general knee pain, swelling, instability, stiffness or decreased range of motion in the affected or opposite knee, haemarthrosis (bleeding into the knee joint), death, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), hypoxaemia (decreased oxygen in the blood), deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the deep veins), tendonitis (inflammation of tendons), pain from fall or other trauma, rupture of a Baker's cyst (a fluid‐filled sac behind the knee), and back or hip or foot pain. 
Arthroscopic surgery may or may not lead to slightly more subsequent knee surgery (replacement or osteotomy) than the placebo procedure.

10.1002-14651858.CD010222.pub4,"Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism
Background 
Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke. The advent of multi‐detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE regarding visualisation of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, increasing its rate of diagnosis. More cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have thereby been identified. These two conditions are usually found in patients with few or no classic symptoms such as coughing (including coughing up blood), chest or upper back pain, acute shortness of breath, or general or specific failure of the circulation that is either cardiac or peripheral in nature. However, in patients with an impaired cardiac and pulmonary condition the classic PE symptoms can be found with isolated SSPEs. Incidental SSPE is found casually in asymptomatic patients, usually by diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons (for example routine computed tomography (CT) for cancer staging in oncologic patients). Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may have a more benign clinical presentation compared to those with proximal PEs. However, the clinical significance and prognosis in these patients has to be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is required. 
Review question 
What is the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE? 
Study characteristics 
We did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria.
Key results 
There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials (current to 26 November 2019) on the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus control in patients with isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE. We cannot draw any conclusions. Well‐conducted research is required before informed practice decisions can be made.

It is not possible to review methodological quality in the absence of studies eligible for inclusion in the review. 
","Plain Title
Do blood thinners help small lung clots found on scans?

Rationale
A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot in the lung. It can block blood flow and harm the body. It can cause shortness of breath and chest pain. It can lead to death.

About 50,000 to 200,000 people die from this each year. Among heart and blood vessel diseases, it ranks third. Heart attack and stroke rank higher. This is a big health burden.

Doctors now find more small lung clots. A modern CT lung scan can see tiny lung arteries. These small clots are called subsegmental pulmonary embolism, or SSPE. “Subsegmental” means a very small branch of a lung artery.

These small clots often cause few or no signs. Some are found by chance on a scan. For example, during a cancer check scan. This is called an incidental finding.

Some people still have classic signs. They may cough or cough up blood. They may have chest or back pain. They may feel very short of breath. People with weak heart or lung health may be at higher risk.

Doctors do not know the best care for SSPE. Big clots need blood thinners. Blood thinners lower the chance a clot will grow. But blood thinners can cause heavy bleeding.

We need to know if SSPE needs blood thinners. The key question is benefit and safety. Do blood thinners help more than they harm? This review set out to answer that.

Trial Design
This study was a review of past trials. The team looked for the strongest type of test. In these tests, chance picks each person’s treatment. These are called randomized controlled trials.

Such trials can show what works and what harms. The team searched many sources for trials. They searched for trials up to November 26, 2019. They used clear rules for which trials to include.

They looked for people with SSPE. They also looked for people with SSPE found by chance. The plan was to compare blood thinners to no blood thinners. They aimed to see both benefits and harms.

They found no trials that fit the plan. There were no randomized trials to include. So they could not gather or study results. They could not report patient age or gender.

The time a person would be in a trial was not known. This is because no trial met the rules. The review could not rate the quality of proof. There were no trials to judge.

Results
The main result is clear. No eligible trials were found. We cannot say if blood thinners help SSPE. We also cannot say if they cause more harm.

We cannot make safe advice from this review. The review gives no proof for or against treatment. This is not the same as saying blood thinners do not work. It means we do not know yet.

Why does this matter? Doctors now find more SSPE with new scans. Patients and doctors must decide how to treat them. But they lack strong proof to guide that choice.

Care may differ from one clinic to another. Some doctors may give blood thinners. Some doctors may watch and wait. Each choice has risks and benefits.

The review team called for better research. We need large, well run trials. Trials should test blood thinners against no drugs. Trials should track new clots, bleeds, and death.

Trials should also look at how people feel day to day. They should include people with and without signs. They should include people with other health problems. This will help real world care.

Right now, we do not know the best care for SSPE. Doctors and patients must talk about each case. Ask about clot size and your health risks. Ask about bleed risks from blood thinners.

Ask what signs to watch for at home. Ask when to seek urgent care. Ask how follow up scans or tests may help. Shared decisions can fit your goals and needs.

In summary, this review asked a simple question. Do blood thinners help people with small lung clots? The search found no qualifying trials up to late 2019. We need strong trials to give clear answers.

Until then, choices will vary. They should be based on your risks and values. Your care team can guide you through these choices. More research will help future patients decide with confidence.","Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism

10.1002-14651858.CD014962,"Background
Remdesivir is an antiviral medicine with properties to inhibit viral replication of SARS‐CoV‐2. Positive results from early studies attracted media attention and led to emergency use authorisation of remdesivir in COVID‐19.  A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effects of remdesivir as a treatment for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is required. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of remdesivir compared to placebo or standard care alone on clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (which comprises the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv) as well as Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index) and WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions. We conducted the searches on 16 April 2021. 
Selection criteria
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
We included RCTs evaluating remdesivir for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in hospitalised adults compared to placebo or standard care alone irrespective of disease severity, gender, ethnicity, or setting.  
We excluded studies that evaluated remdesivir for the treatment of other coronavirus diseases. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
To assess risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for outcomes that were reported according to our prioritised categories: all‐cause mortality at up to day 28, duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation, duration to liberation from supplemental oxygen, new need for mechanical ventilation (high‐flow oxygen, non‐invasive, or invasive mechanical ventilation), new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, new need for non‐invasive mechanical ventilation or high‐flow oxygen, new need for oxygen by mask or nasal prongs, quality of life, serious adverse events, and adverse events (any grade). 
Main results
We included five RCTs with 7452 participants diagnosed with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and a mean age of 59 years, of whom 3886 participants were randomised to receive remdesivir. Most participants required low‐flow oxygen (n=4409) or mechanical ventilation (n=1025) at baseline. Studies were mainly conducted in high‐ and upper‐middle‐income countries. We identified two ongoing studies, one was suspended due to a lack of COVID‐19 patients to recruit. 
Risk of bias assessments were considered to be some concerns or high risk for clinical status and safety outcomes because participants who had died did not contribute information to these outcomes. Without adjustment, this leads to an uncertain amount of missing values and the potential for bias due to missing data. 
Effects of remdesivir in hospitalised individuals  
Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to all‐cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.06; risk difference (RD) 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 21 fewer to 7 more; 4 studies, 7142 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  There was limited evidence for a beneficial effect of remdesivir on mortality in a subset of 435 participants who received low flow oxygen at baseline in one study (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.66). We could not confirm this finding due to restricted availability of relevant subgroup data from other studies. 
Remdesivir may have little or no effect on the duration to liberation from invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1298 participants, data not pooled, low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether remdesivir increases or decreases the chance of clinical improvement in terms of duration to liberation from supplemental oxygen at up to day 28 (3 studies, 1691 participants, data not pooled, very low‐certainty evidence).   
We are very uncertain whether remdesivir decreases or increases the risk of clinical worsening in terms of new need for mechanical ventilation at up to day 28 (high‐flow oxygen or non‐invasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation) (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.24; RD 29 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 68 fewer to 32 more; 3 studies, 6696 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); new need for non‐invasive mechanical ventilation or high‐flow oxygen (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.98; RD 72 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 118 fewer to 5 fewer; 1 study, 573 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and new need for oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.22; RD 84 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 204 fewer to 98 more; 1 study, 138 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Remdesivir may decrease the risk of clinical worsening in terms of new need for invasive mechanical ventilation (67 fewer participants amongst 1000 participants; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.77; 2 studies, 1159 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
None of the included studies reported quality of life.
Remdesivir probably decreases the serious adverse events rate at up to 28 days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.90; RD 63 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 94 fewer to 25 fewer; 3 studies, 1674 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether remdesivir increases or decreases adverse events rate (any grade) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; RD 29 more per 1000, 95% CI 82 fewer to 158 more; 3 studies, 1674 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the currently available evidence remdesivir probably has little or no effect on all‐cause mortality at up to 28 days in hospitalised adults with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We are uncertain about the effects of remdesivir on clinical improvement and worsening. There were insufficient data available to examine the effect of remdesivir on mortality across subgroups defined by respiratory support at baseline.  
Future studies should provide additional data on efficacy and safety of remdesivir for defined core outcomes in COVID‐19 research, especially for different population subgroups. This could allow us to draw more reliable conclusions on the potential benefits and harms of remdesivir in future updates of this review. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically.

Remdesivir for adults in the hospital with COVID-19: what the trials show

Rationale
COVID-19 is an illness caused by a virus called SARS‑CoV‑2.
It can harm the lungs and make it hard to breathe.
Many people with bad COVID-19 need care in the hospital.
Remdesivir is an anti‑virus drug.
It tries to stop the virus from making copies.

Early reports gave hope that remdesivir might help.
But we need clear proof that it helps people in the hospital.
We want to know if it helps people live or breathe better.
We also want to know if it causes harm.

The best way to learn this is to study fair trials.
In fair trials, people go to a group by chance.
This review looked at those trials and keeps them up to date.

Trial Design
This was a “living” review of trials.
A living review adds new trials as they appear.
The team looked for all trials in many research lists.
They read studies in any language.

They included trials where people went to a group by chance.
Adults were in the hospital with COVID‑19.
They got remdesivir or a dummy drug or usual care.
Usual care means the care a hospital would give anyway.

The review found five trials with 7452 people.
The average age was 59 years.
Many people used oxygen through a small tube or mask.
Some people were on a breathing machine at the start.
Trials took place in several countries.

The trials followed people for up to 28 days.
Most results in this review use that time frame.
The review also looked for harms from the drug.

Results
The main question was death within 28 days.
Remdesivir probably made little or no difference.
In 1000 people, there were about 8 fewer deaths.
It could be 21 fewer or 7 more.
This came from four trials with 7142 people.

One trial looked at people on low‑flow oxygen at the start.
This means oxygen by a tube under the nose or a mask.
In 435 people, fewer died with remdesivir in that trial.
But other trials did not share enough data on this group.
So we cannot confirm this result.

We looked at time off a breathing machine.
A breathing machine uses a tube to help you breathe.
Remdesivir may make little or no difference here.
We also looked at time off oxygen.
Here, we do not know the effect.

We looked at new need for a breathing machine.
We are not sure if remdesivir helps or harms.
But remdesivir may lower the need for a breathing tube.
About 67 fewer in 1000 needed a breathing tube.
This came from two trials with 1159 people.

One small study found fewer people needed strong air by mask.
This is called high‑flow air or non‑invasive support.
About 72 fewer in 1000 needed this support.
But we are very unsure about this result.
For other oxygen needs, the results were not clear.

No study measured quality of life.
So we cannot tell if people felt better day to day.
We also cannot say if they had better function.

We looked at harms.
Serious harms were lower with remdesivir.
There were about 63 fewer serious harms in 1000 people.
This came from three trials with 1674 people.
For any harms, we are very unsure.

Some limits in the trials may affect results.
People who died could not report later outcomes.
This can change results on breathing and oxygen.
So some results are not clear.

What does this mean for patients?
Remdesivir probably does not change the chance of death by day 28.
It may reduce the need for a breathing tube and machine.
It may also reduce serious harms.
For many other outcomes, we still do not know.

This review is important for COVID‑19 care.
It brings together the best trial data we have so far.
It shows where remdesivir may help and where it may not.
It also shows where we need better data.

More good trials are needed.
We need trials in different patient groups.
We need trials that measure how people feel and function.
We also need clear data by type of oxygen support.

This review will update as new trials appear.
As we learn more, these findings may change.
For now, the main message is careful and balanced.
Remdesivir may help some outcomes but not death overall by day 28.","Remdesivir to treat people with COVID‐19
Is remdesivir (an antiviral medicine) an effective treatment for COVID‐19? 
Key messages 
• For adults hospitalised with COVID‐19, remdesivir probably has little or no effect on deaths from any cause up to 28 days after treatment compared with placebo (sham treatment) or usual care.  
• We are uncertain whether remdesivir improves or worsens patients’ condition, based on whether they needed more or less help with breathing. 
• Researchers should agree on key outcomes to be used in COVID‐19 research, and future studies should investigate these areas. This would allow future updates of this review to draw more certain conclusions about the use of remdesivir to treat COVID‐19. 
What is remdesivir? 
Remdesivir is a medicine that fights viruses. It has been shown to prevent the virus that causes COVID‐19 (SARS‐CoV‐2) from reproducing. Medical regulators have approved remdesivir for emergency use to treat people with COVID‐19.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if remdesivir is an effective treatment for people in hospital with COVID‐19 and if it causes unwanted effects compared to placebo or usual care. 
People with COVID‐19 are given different kinds of breathing support, depending on how severe their breathing difficulties are. We used the types of breathing support people received as a measure of the success of remdesivir in treating COVID‐19. Types of breathing support included: 
• for severe breathing difficulties: invasive mechanical ventilation, when a breathing tube is put into patients’ lungs, and a machine (ventilator) breathes for them. Patients are given medicine to make them sedated whilst they are on a ventilator. 
• for moderate to severe breathing difficulties: non‐invasive mechanical ventilation through a mask over the nose and/or mouth, or a helmet. Air or oxygen is pushed through the mask. Patients are generally awake for this treatment. 
• for moderate breathing difficulties: oxygen via a mask or prongs that sit in the nostrils. Patients can still breathe room air. 
We were interested in the following outcomes:
• deaths from any cause in the 28 days after treatment;
• whether patients got better after treatment, measured by how long they spent on mechanical ventilation or oxygen; 
• whether patients’ condition worsened so that they needed oxygen or mechanical ventilation;
• quality of life;
• any unwanted effects; and 
• serious unwanted effects.
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that investigated remdesivir to treat adults with COVID‐19 compared to placebo or standard care. Patients were hospitalised with COVID‐19 and could be of any gender or ethnicity.   
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find?  
We found 5 studies with 7452 people hospitalised with COVID‐19. Of these, 3886 people were given remdesivir. The average age of patients was 59 years. Studies took place around the world, mainly in high‐ and upper‐middle‐income countries.  
Main results  
The included studies compared remdesivir to placebo or usual care in people hospitalised with COVID‐19 for up to 28 days. 
Deaths from any cause 
• Remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to deaths from any cause (4 studies, 7142 people). In 1000 people, 8 fewer die with remdesivir compared to placebo or standard care. 
Did patients get better with remdesivir? 
• Remdesivir may have little or no effect on the length of time patients spent on invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1298 people).  
• We do not know whether remdesivir increases or decreases time on supplemental oxygen (3 studies, 1691 people). 
Did patients get worse with remdesivir? 
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need any mechanical ventilation (invasive or non‐invasive) with remdesivir (3 studies, 6696 people). 
• Patients may be less likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation (2 studies, 1159 people). 
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need non‐invasive mechanical ventilation (1 study, 573 people).  
• We do not know whether patients are more or less likely to need oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (1 study, 138 people). 
Quality of life 
• None of the included studies reported quality of life.
Unwanted effects 
• We do not know whether remdesivir leads to more or fewer unwanted effects of any level (3 studies, 1674 people).  
• Patients are probably less likely to experience serious unwanted effects with remdesivir than with placebo or standard care (3 studies, 1674 people). In 1000 people, 63 fewer would experience a serious unwanted effect compared to placebo or standard care. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are moderately confident in the evidence for deaths from any cause and serious unwanted effects; however, our confidence in the other evidence is limited because studies used different methods to measure and record their results, and we did not find many studies for some of our outcomes of interest.  
How up‐to‐date is this evidence?

10.1002-14651858.CD011082.pub2,"Antimicrobial dressings attached to the central venous catheters in reducing catheter‐related infections in newborn infants 
Review question: In newborn infants who require a central venous catheter, does the use of antiseptic or antibiotic catheter dressing, compared to no dressing, reduce catheter‐related infections? 
Background: Central venous catheters (CVCs) are small tubes inserted into the vein to give fluids, medication and intravenous nutrition to sick patients. The risks of CVCs are well‐known, and can cause infections, which may result in death or serious illnesses. Newborn infants are vulnerable, as they on the one hand require the CVCs to sustain life, and on the other hand are at high risks of the complications, due to their thin skin and poorly‐developed immune system. 
Several measures have been developed to reduce infections in newborn infants. These include hand hygiene for caregivers, skin cleaning for the infants, antibiotics and modification of the catheters including the use of antiseptic or antibiotic‐coated catheter dressing or patch that could be placed on the skin at the CVC insertion site. While promising, these measures need on‐going evaluation. In this review, we synthesized up‐to‐date evidence on the effectiveness and safety of antiseptic or antibiotic dressing as a part of CVC care in sick newborn infants. 
Search date: We performed a search in multiple medical databases in September 2015. 
Study characteristics: Three studies (total participants: 855) fit our inclusion criteria. There were two main comparisons: i) chlorhexidine dressing and alcohol skin cleansing against standard polyurethane dressing and povidone‐iodine skin cleansing (from one large study), and ii) silver‐alginate patch against a control group without patch (from two smaller studies). The quality of the included studies are high, except that the people closely involved in the trials such as the care personnel were not masked from knowing whether or not the infants in the study were given antiseptic or antibiotic dressing, which might have affected their recording or interpretation of the results. 
Study funding sources: One of the studies was funded in part by Johnson and Johnson Medical; Children's Foundation; Children's Hospital, Milwaukee and National Institutes of Health. Another study was funded by the Vanderbilt NICU Research Fund. Funding source was not stated in the third study. 
Key results: In our main findings, chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol skin cleansing made no difference to catheter‐related blood stream infection (CRBSI) and blood stream infection (""sepsis"") without an identifiable source, although it significantly reduced the chance of micro‐organisms lodging in the CVCs (""catheter colonisation""), with an average of 9% reduction in risk among newborn infants with a baseline risk of 24% (1 study, 655 infants). However, infants who received chlorhexidine dressing/alcohol skin cleansing were more likely to develop skin irritation (""contact dermatitis""), as 19 out of 335 infants (5.7%) in the chlorhexidine group developed this complication compared to none in the group that received standard dressing/povidone‐iodine cleansing. However, it was unclear whether the dressing or the alcohol solution was mainly responsible for the skin irritation, as the other group did not use alcohol solution for skin cleansing. In the other comparison, silver‐alginate patch made no overall differences in CRBSI and mortality compared to no dressing, neither did it cause any adverse reaction. 
Quality of the evidence: There was moderate‐quality evidence for all the major outcomes. The major factor that affected the quality of evidence was the lack of precision in the result estimates, as the calculated plausible range of the effects (the 95% confidence intervals) were wide. 
Conclusions: Chlorhexidine CVC dressing with alcohol skin cleansing posed a high risk of skin irritation against a modest reduction in catheter colonisation. For silver‐alginate patch, evidence is still insufficient for a clear picture of benefit an harm. We have made recommendations for future research that evaluate these interventions.

Germ-fighting patches for IV lines in newborn babies: do they help?

Rationale
Very sick newborns often need a central line. This is a small tube in a large vein. It lets doctors give fluid, food, and drugs. These lines can also let germs in.

Blood infections can be life threatening. Newborns are at high risk. Their skin is thin. Their immune system is still weak.

Staff can lower risk with clean hands and clean skin. Some teams also use special line dressings or patches. These dressings have drugs that kill germs. They sit on the skin where the line goes in.

This review asked a clear question. Do germ-kill dressings or patches help stop line infections in newborns? The team also looked at safety. They asked if these dressings cause harm, like skin rash.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team searched many medical sites in September 2015. They found three good trials. In all, 855 newborns took part.

All babies were newborns who needed a central line. They were in the hospital and very sick. The trials took place in newborn intensive care units. The abstract did not say how long each baby stayed in the study.

The trials tested two types of care. One large trial used a chlorhexidine dressing and alcohol skin clean. It compared this to a standard plastic dressing and a brown skin cleaner, called povidone-iodine. Two smaller trials used a silver-alginate patch. They compared the patch to no patch.

Chlorhexidine is a germ-kill drug. Alcohol is a skin cleaner. Povidone-iodine is also a skin cleaner. Silver-alginate is a patch with silver. Silver can kill germs.

In these trials, staff knew which dressing each baby got. This can affect how they record results. The overall study quality was moderate.

Results
First, the chlorhexidine dressing and alcohol skin clean. This care did not lower blood infections from the line. It also did not lower other blood infections. But it did lower germs on the line itself.

Here is what that means. With standard care, about 24 out of 100 babies had germs on the line. With the chlorhexidine dressing and alcohol skin clean, about 9 fewer out of 100 had germs on the line. Fewer germs on the line could mean less risk later. But this review did not show fewer blood infections.

There was a clear harm. More babies had a skin rash with the chlorhexidine dressing and alcohol skin clean. In that group, 19 out of 335 had a rash. In the standard care group, none had a rash. The review could not tell if the rash came from the dressing or the alcohol. The standard group did not use alcohol on the skin.

Next, the silver-alginate patch. This patch did not lower blood infections. It also did not change the risk of death. The trials did not find any bad skin effects with the patch.

What do these results mean for care? The chlorhexidine dressing with alcohol skin clean cut germs on the line. But it did not cut blood infections. It also raised the chance of a skin rash. Teams must weigh a small drop in germs on the line against a real risk of skin harm.

For the silver-alginate patch, there was no clear help and no clear harm. It did not change blood infections or death in these trials. There were no skin problems seen with the patch.

How strong is this evidence? The review rated it as moderate. The range of the results was wide. That means we cannot be sure of the size of any effect. More large, well run trials are needed.

In short, here is the key take away. For newborns with a central line, a chlorhexidine dressing with alcohol skin clean lowered germs on the line. It did not lower blood infections. It raised the risk of a skin rash. A silver-alginate patch did not change infections or death, and did not cause harm in the trials.

This review helps guide care today. It also points to needs for new studies. Future trials should test these dressings in more babies. They should track blood infections, skin harm, and death. They should also keep staff blind to the dressings when they can. This can make the results more sure.

Funding notes from the trials were mixed. Some funds came from a maker of medical goods. Some came from hospital and public funds. One trial did not list a fund source. The review did not say that funds changed the results.

Talk with your baby’s care team about these options. Ask about the steps they use to keep lines clean and safe. Ask how they watch for skin rash and for signs of blood infection. Your team can help weigh risks and gains for your child.","Antimicrobial dressings attached to the central venous catheters in reducing catheter‐related infections in newborn infants

Germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage (GMH‐IVH) remains a substantial issue in neonatal intensive care units worldwide. Current therapies to prevent or treat GMH‐IVH are limited. Stem cell‐based therapies offer a potential therapeutic approach to repair, restore, and/or regenerate injured brain tissue. These preclinical findings have now culminated in ongoing human neonatal studies. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of stem cell‐based interventions for prevention or treatment of germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage (GM‐IVH) in preterm infants. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 1), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 7 January 2019); Embase (1980 to 7 January 2019); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 7 January 2019). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We attempted to identify randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials, and cluster trials comparing (1) stem cell‐based interventions versus control; (2) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of type or source versus MSCs of other type or source; (3) stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of type or source versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of other type or source; or (4) MSCs versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs. For prevention studies, we included extremely preterm infants (less than 28 weeks' gestation), 24 hours of age or less, without ultrasound diagnosis of GM‐IVH; for treatment studies, we included preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation), of any postnatal age, with ultrasound diagnosis of GM‐IVH. 
Data collection and analysis
For each of the included trials, two review authors independently planned to extract data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, type and source of MSCs, other stem cell‐based interventions) and assess the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomisation, blinding, completeness of follow‐up). Primary outcomes considered in this review are all‐cause neonatal mortality, major neurodevelopmental disability, GM‐IVH, and extension of pre‐existing non‐severe GM‐IVH. We planned to use the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
Our search strategy yielded 769 references. We did not find any completed studies for inclusion. One randomised controlled trial is currently registered and ongoing. Five phase 1 trials are described in the excluded studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently no evidence is available to show the benefits or harms of stem cell‐based interventions for treatment or prevention of GM‐IVH in preterm infants.

Stem cells for brain bleeds in very early babies: what we know now

Rationale
Some babies are born much too early. Their brains are still very soft. A brain bleed can then occur. This is a bleed near the fluid spaces in the brain. Doctors call this a “germinal matrix brain bleed.”

This bleed can harm the baby’s brain. It can raise the risk of death. It can also cause long‑term problems. These may include trouble with moving, learning, and thinking. These life effects can be hard for families.

There are few proven ways to stop or treat this bleed. So we need new options. Stem cells may help. Stem cells are special cells. They can grow into other kinds of cells. Lab and animal work suggest they may help repair brain tissue. They might calm swelling, protect brain cells, and help healing. But we must test them in humans to see if they work and are safe.

This study asked a clear question. Do stem cells help prevent or treat brain bleeds in very early babies? It also asked if stem cells might cause harm. We need good proof to guide care. Families and doctors want to know if stem cells help, do not help, or hurt.

Trial Design
This study was not a single trial in babies. It was a careful review of trials. The team searched many medical libraries. They looked from the year 1966 to early 2019. They also checked trial lists and meeting books.

They looked for fair tests of care. In these tests, chance decides which care a baby gets. These are called randomized trials. The team planned to include trials that gave stem cells or usual care. They also planned to compare types of stem cells.

The review set clear rules for who could be in such trials. For prevention trials, the babies would be very early. They would be born before 28 weeks. They would be less than one day old. They would not yet have a brain bleed on a head scan. For treatment trials, the babies would be born before 37 weeks. They would have a brain bleed seen on a head scan. A head “ultrasound” is a safe scan that uses sound waves. It does not use radiation.

The abstract did not state any limits by sex. It did not state any race or ethnic limits. It did not set how long a baby would be in a trial. This was a review of trials. It did not enroll any babies itself.

The team planned what results to look for. Key results were death from any cause in the newborn period. They also planned to look at major long‑term brain and nerve problems. They planned to look at brain bleeds that start or get worse. They would also judge the trust level of the proof.

Results
The search found 769 papers and records. But there were no finished trials that fit the plan. No trial had results that the team could include. One trial that uses chance to assign care is still in progress. Five very early “phase 1” trials were found. But these were not the right type to include. Phase 1 trials mainly test safety and dose.

So, what does this mean right now? There is no proof yet that stem cells help prevent brain bleeds in very early babies. There is no proof they help treat brain bleeds in these babies. There is also no proof yet on harms in this group. In short, we do not know if stem cells help, do not help, or hurt.

This gap matters. Brain bleeds in very early babies are a major cause of harm. Families and doctors need safe and sure care. Stem cells still offer hope. Lab and animal work suggest they may help repair the brain. But we must test them the right way in people. We need fair, well run trials. These trials should measure the outcomes that matter to families. These include survival, brain and nerve health, growth, and day‑to‑day function. Trials should also look for any bad effects. Follow‑up should last for years, not months.

What should families and care teams do now? At this time, stem cells for this problem should be used only in trials. That way, babies get close watch. We also learn what works and what does not. This helps all babies and families in the future.

In summary, this review set out to find firm answers. It found no completed, fair trials to include. One such trial is in progress. Early safety trials exist, but they are not enough to guide care. We still need strong research. Until then, we cannot say that stem cells help or hurt very early babies with brain bleeds.","Stem cell‐based therapies for bleeding to the brain (germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage) in newborns born preterm 
Review question 
Do stem cell‐based therapies save the lives or improve the long‐term development of preterm newborns who have or may develop bleeding to the brain (""germinal matrix‐intraventricular haemorrhage"")? 
Background 
Newborns born too early (""preterm""), especially babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy, sometimes develop bleeding to the brain. Babies with less severe bleeding may make a full recovery or may have only mild problems. For other babies with more serious bleeding, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. For instance, some of these babies develop cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, or other problems. Currently no approaches are available to prevent or treat this condition.   
The aim of this review was to assess whether stem cell‐based therapies could reduce death and improve the long‐term development of newborns born too early. During cell stem‐based therapy, stem cells are given to the baby, for instance, through injection. These stem cells may have come from humans or animals and may have been taken from cord blood, bone marrow, or other parts of the body. These cells then repair the brain cells that have been damaged by bleeding.  
Key results 
We were not able to include any studies in our review. We did identify five studies, but we excluded them because of the way they were designed, which meant that their results could not answer our review question (all were ""phase 1"" studies).   
We searched for studies that were available up to 7 January 2019.

Hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a leading cause of mortality and long‐term neurological sequelae, affecting thousands of children worldwide. Current therapies to treat HIE are limited to cooling. Stem cell‐based therapies offer a potential therapeutic approach to repair or regenerate injured brain tissue. These preclinical findings have now culminated in ongoing human neonatal trials. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of stem cell‐based interventions for the treatment of hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in newborn infants.

We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials and cluster trials comparing 1) stem cell‐based interventions (any type) compared to control (placebo or no treatment); 2) use of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) of type (e.g. number of doses or passages) or source (e.g. autologous versus allogeneic, or bone marrow versus cord) versus MSCs of other type or source; 3) use of stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of type (e.g. mononuclear cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, neural stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and inducible pluripotent stem cells) or source (e.g. autologous versus allogeneic, or bone marrow versus cord) versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs of other type or source; or 4) MSCs versus stem cell‐based interventions other than MSCs.

Can stem cell treatment help newborns with brain injury from low oxygen?

Rationale
Some babies do not get enough oxygen and blood around birth. This can harm the brain. Doctors call this harm hypoxic‑ischaemic encephalopathy, or HIE. HIE can cause death or life‑long problems with moving, learning, or seeing.

Right now, the main care for HIE is cooling. Care teams cool the baby’s body for a short time. Cooling can lower brain harm in some babies. But many babies still have brain injury after cooling.

Stem cells may offer a new path. Stem cells are special cells. They can grow and change into other cell types. They may help heal or regrow injured brain tissue.

Tests in labs and in animals have looked good. Because of this, some trials in newborns have begun. We need strong proof in people to know if stem cells help and are safe.

Trial Design
This study did not treat babies. It was a review of trials. The team looked for the best type of trials. These are trials where babies go into groups by chance. One group gets stem cells. The other group gets no treatment or a fake treatment.

The team searched many large medical libraries. They looked at records from the start dates of those libraries to early June of the year 2020. Two team members checked each record. They also looked at trial lists and meeting reports.

They planned to include newborn babies with HIE. Babies could be any birth weight or age at birth. The plan was to study stem cells from any source. These could be from cord blood or bone marrow. The team would compare types and doses if data were there.

They set main results to check. These were death from any cause in the newborn time. They also planned to check brain and nerve problems. They would look at death or major brain and nerve problems at about age two years. That is when many skills can be tested. The team planned to judge how strong the proof was.

Results
The search found 616 records. The team read them and checked them against the plan. They did not find any finished trials that fit the plan. Three studies did not meet the rules and were left out.

They did find that 15 trials are now in progress. These trials plan to test stem cells in newborns with HIE. But none had full results at the time of the search. So, there were no results to pool and judge.

What does this mean for families now? We do not yet know if stem cells help babies with HIE. We also do not know the risks for these babies. There is no proof from the best type of trials at this time.

This review matters for care teams and for families. It shows the need for well‑run trials in this field. It points out the key results that matter. These are death, major brain and nerve problems, or both, by about two years of age.

The team’s view is careful and clear. They say there is no proof yet, from random trials, that stem cells help or harm. They do not say stem cells work. They do not say stem cells fail. We must wait for the trials that are still going on.

If you are a parent or carer, please talk with your baby’s care team. Ask if a trial is open at your hospital. Stem cell care for HIE should be in a trial at this time. Cooling care is still the main care for HIE right now.

As new trial results come out, the picture may change. Future reviews can add those data. Then we may learn if stem cells help babies with HIE, and if so, which ones, when, and how. For now, we need more and better proof.","Stem cell‐based therapies following poor brain oxygenation at birth (hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy) in newborns 
Review question 
Do stem cell‐based therapies save the lives, or improve the long‐term development, of newborns who have poor brain oxygenation at birth ('hypoxic‐ischaemic encephalopathy')? 
Background 
Lack of oxygen at birth may damage the brain of the newborn. Babies with less severe brain damage may make a full recovery or only have mild problems. For other babies with more serious damage, this may lead to death or to problems later in life. For instance, some of these babies develop cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, or other problems. We currently have  only cooling as an approach to treat this condition. The aim of this review was to assess if stem cell‐based therapies could reduce death and improve the long‐term development of newborns with poor brain oxygenation at birth. During stem cell‐based therapy, stem cells are given to the baby, for instance through injections. These stem cells may have come from humans or animals and may have been taken from cord blood, bone marrow or other parts of the body. These cells then repair the brain cells that the lack of oxygen has damaged. 
Key results 
We were not able to include any studies in our review. We identified three potential studies, but we excluded them due to the way they were designed which meant that their results could not answer our review question (phase 1 studies). Fifteen studies are ongoing.

10.1002-14651858.CD006237.pub4,"What are the best ways to help people with depression go back to work?
What is depression? 
Depression is a common mental health problem that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in people, activities, and things that were once enjoyable. A person with depression may feel tearful, irritable, or tired most of the time, and may have problems with sleep, concentration, and memory. 
Depression may affect people's ability to work. People with depression may be absent from work (off sick), or feel less able to cope with working. 
Going back to work 
Reducing depressive symptoms may help people with depression to go back to work. Treatments include medications and psychological (talking) therapies, or a combination of both. Changes at the workplace could also help, such as: 
changing a person's tasks or working hours;
supporting them in a gradual return to work; or
helping them to cope better with certain work situations.
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
Work can improve a person's physical and mental well‑being; it helps build confidence and self‐esteem, allows people to socialise, and provides money. We wanted to find out if workplace changes and clinical programmes could help people with depression to return to work. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at whether workplace changes and clinical programmes affected the amount of sick leave taken by people with depression. Clinical programmes included: medicines (anti‐depressants); psychological therapies; improved healthcare by doctors; and other programmes such as exercise and diet.  
Search date: we included evidence published up to 4 April 2020. 
What we found 
We found 45 studies in 12,109 people with depression. The studies took place in Europe (34 studies), the USA (8), Australia (2) and Canada (1). 
The effects of 'care as usual' were compared with those of workplace changes and clinical programmes to find out: 
how many days people with depression were on sick leave
how many people with depression were off work;
people's symptoms of depression; and
how well people with depression could cope with their work.
What are the results of our review? 
Our main findings within the first year of follow‐up, for workplace changes or treatments compared with usual care, are listed below. 
Workplace changes combined with a clinical programme:
probably reduce the number of days on sick leave (on average, by 25 days for each person over one year; 9 studies; 1292 participants); 
do not reduce the number of people off work (2 studies; 1025 participants);
may reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1091 participants); and
may improve ability to cope with work (5 studies; 926 participants).
Workplace changes alone:
may increase the number of days on sick leave (2 studies, 130 participants);
probably do not lead to more people off work (1 study; 226 participants);
probably do not affect symptoms of depression (4 studies; 390 participants); and
may not improve ability to cope with work (1 study; 48 participants).
Improved healthcare alone:
probably reduces the number of days on sick leave, by 20 days (in two, well‐conducted studies in 692 participants, although not in all 7 studies, in 1912 participants); 
probably reduces symptoms of depression (7 studies; 1808 participants); and
may reduce ability to cope with work (1 study; 604 participants).
Psychological therapies alone:
may reduce the number of days off work, by 15 days (9 studies; 1649 participants); and 
may reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1255 participants).
We are uncertain if psychological therapies alone affect people's ability to cope with work (1 study; 58 participants). 
How reliable are these results? 
Our confidence in these results is mostly moderate to low. Some findings are based on small numbers of studies, in small numbers of participants. We also found limitations in the ways some studies were designed, conducted and reported. 
Key messages 
Combining workplace changes with a clinical programme probably helps people with depression to return to work more quickly and to take fewer days off sick. We need more evidence to assess which combination of workplace changes and clinical programmes works best. 
Improved healthcare probably also helps people with depression to take fewer days off sick.

Helping People with Depression Get Back to Work

Rationale
Depression is a long‑lasting low mood. It can drain joy and energy. It can harm sleep, focus, and memory. It can make work feel too hard.

Work can help health and mood. It brings purpose, social ties, and pay. Many people with depression miss work days. Some stop work for a time.

Help can come in many ways. These include medicine for low mood. They also include talk therapy, team care from doctors, and healthy habits. Job changes can help too, like new hours or a slow return.

This study asked a clear question. Which kinds of help get people back to work sooner? The idea was that job changes plus a care plan may work best. This work was needed to guide people, doctors, and bosses.

Trial Design
This was a Cochrane Review. That is a trusted group that sums up many studies. The team searched for studies to April 4, 2020. They looked for studies in people with depression who worked.

They found 45 studies with 12,109 people. Most were in Europe. Others were in the USA, Australia, and Canada. The studies in this summary did not list ages or genders.

The team compared normal care to other help. They looked at job changes at the workplace. They looked at care plans. Care plans could include medicine, talk therapy, better doctor care, or exercise and diet. They also looked at mixes of these helps.

The main things they measured were work and mood. They checked days off sick. They checked how many people were off work. They checked signs of depression. They checked how able people felt to do their job. Most results were within one year.

Results
Job changes plus a care plan helped most. People took fewer sick days in a year. On average, each person had about 25 fewer days off. This came from nine studies with 1,292 people. People did not lose jobs less often. Mood and work coping may also improve.

Job changes alone did not help much. In two small studies, people had more sick days. One study found job loss did not change. Four studies found mood did not change. One small study found work coping did not improve.

Better healthcare alone also helped, in part. In two strong studies with 692 people, sick days fell by 20 days. But this did not show in all seven studies. Mood likely improved in seven studies with 1,808 people. One study found people felt less able to cope at work.

Talk therapy alone may help some. In nine studies with 1,649 people, sick days fell by about 15 days. In eight studies with 1,255 people, mood improved. One small study could not show if work coping changed.

What do these results mean for you? A mix of job changes and a care plan may help you most. This can mean new tasks, new hours, or a slow return. It can include medicine or talk therapy. It can include better, joined‑up care from your doctors.

Normal care alone was less helpful for work time. Job changes alone may even add sick days. Better healthcare may cut sick days, though not in all studies. Talk therapy may also cut sick days.

How sure are these results? The team felt somewhat sure about some parts. But many studies were small. Some had limits in how they ran or wrote up. So, we need more strong studies.

Why is this review important? It gives clear, real‑world help. It can guide patients, doctors, and bosses. It shows that care and job changes together can help people return sooner. It also shows where we need more proof.

What should happen next? Care teams and workplaces can plan together. They can offer a slow return to work. They can adjust tasks and hours. They can add medicine or talk therapy when needed.

More research should test which mix works best. We need to learn which job changes help most. We need to learn which care plans work best for work time and mood. This can make support more fair and more fast.

Key takeaways
- Job changes plus a care plan cut sick days the most.
- Better healthcare may also cut sick days.
- Talk therapy may help with sick days and mood.
- Job changes alone may not help, and may add sick days.
- More strong studies are needed to guide exact choices.","What are the best ways to help people with depression go back to work?
What is depression? 
Depression is a common mental health problem that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in people, activities, and things that were once enjoyable. A person with depression may feel tearful, irritable, or tired most of the time, and may have problems with sleep, concentration, and memory. 
Depression may affect people's ability to work. People with depression may be absent from work (off sick), or feel less able to cope with working. 
Going back to work 
Reducing depressive symptoms may help people with depression to go back to work. Treatments include medications and psychological (talking) therapies, or a combination of both. Changes at the workplace could also help, such as: 
changing a person's tasks or working hours;
supporting them in a gradual return to work; or
helping them to cope better with certain work situations.
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
Work can improve a person's physical and mental well‑being; it helps build confidence and self‐esteem, allows people to socialise, and provides money. We wanted to find out if workplace changes and clinical programmes could help people with depression to return to work. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at whether workplace changes and clinical programmes affected the amount of sick leave taken by people with depression. Clinical programmes included: medicines (anti‐depressants); psychological therapies; improved healthcare by doctors; and other programmes such as exercise and diet.  
Search date: we included evidence published up to 4 April 2020. 
What we found 
We found 45 studies in 12,109 people with depression. The studies took place in Europe (34 studies), the USA (8), Australia (2) and Canada (1). 
The effects of 'care as usual' were compared with those of workplace changes and clinical programmes to find out: 
how many days people with depression were on sick leave
how many people with depression were off work;
people's symptoms of depression; and
how well people with depression could cope with their work.
What are the results of our review? 
Our main findings within the first year of follow‐up, for workplace changes or treatments compared with usual care, are listed below. 
Workplace changes combined with a clinical programme:
probably reduce the number of days on sick leave (on average, by 25 days for each person over one year; 9 studies; 1292 participants); 
do not reduce the number of people off work (2 studies; 1025 participants);
may reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1091 participants); and
may improve ability to cope with work (5 studies; 926 participants).
Workplace changes alone:
may increase the number of days on sick leave (2 studies, 130 participants);
probably do not lead to more people off work (1 study; 226 participants);
probably do not affect symptoms of depression (4 studies; 390 participants); and
may not improve ability to cope with work (1 study; 48 participants).
Improved healthcare alone:
probably reduces the number of days on sick leave, by 20 days (in two, well‐conducted studies in 692 participants, although not in all 7 studies, in 1912 participants); 
probably reduces symptoms of depression (7 studies; 1808 participants); and
may reduce ability to cope with work (1 study; 604 participants).
Psychological therapies alone:
may reduce the number of days off work, by 15 days (9 studies; 1649 participants); and 
may reduce symptoms of depression (8 studies; 1255 participants).
We are uncertain if psychological therapies alone affect people's ability to cope with work (1 study; 58 participants). 
How reliable are these results? 
Our confidence in these results is mostly moderate to low. Some findings are based on small numbers of studies, in small numbers of participants. We also found limitations in the ways some studies were designed, conducted and reported. 
Key messages 
Combining workplace changes with a clinical programme probably helps people with depression to return to work more quickly and to take fewer days off sick. We need more evidence to assess which combination of workplace changes and clinical programmes works best. 
Improved healthcare probably also helps people with depression to take fewer days off sick.

10.1002-14651858.CD011364.pub2,"Ultrasound use for insertion of arterial catheters in children
Background 
An arterial catheter is a thin tube or line that can be inserted into an artery. Arterial catheters are used to monitor blood pressure during complex surgeries and during stays in intensive care. Ultrasound imaging (an image created with sound waves of soft tissue) allows anaesthesiologists and intensivists to see surrounding structures. Ultrasound can help medical practitioners accurately locate the artery and insert the catheter, and, particularly when surgeries involve children, ultrasound can prevent the need for multiple needle sticks. This reduces the occurrence of haematoma (a localized collection of blood outside the blood vessels) or damage to the artery, compared with other techniques such as palpation of the artery (feeling through the skin for the pulse) or Doppler auditory assistance (listening for a change to a higher pitch at the exact location of the artery). Our aim was to find out whether ultrasound offers any advantages over palpation of the artery or Doppler auditory assistance. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to January 2016. We found five eligible studies ‐ four comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. 
Key results 
We included in the review children aged one month to 18 years. We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas. Ultrasound also increased the success rate within two attempts. It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children. It is also likely that ultrasound is more useful if the practitioner is experienced in its use. 
Quality of the evidence 
We noted variation in the risk of bias of included studies. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate mainly because the number of studies was limited. For the same reason, we could not confirm the effect of age and expertise in ultrasound usage. 
Conclusions 
Our evidence suggests that ultrasound is superior to other techniques for arterial catheter insertion, particularly in babies and young children.

Using sound wave pictures to place artery lines in children

Rationale
Some children need close blood pressure checks during surgery or in intensive care. To do this, doctors place an artery line. An artery line is a thin tube in an artery. It lets doctors watch blood pressure every moment.

Placing this line in children can be hard. Small arteries can be hard to find. Many needle tries can happen. Many tries can harm the artery. They can cause a bad bruise under the skin, called a hematoma.

Doctors have used three main ways to find the artery. One way is to feel for the pulse with fingers. This is called feeling by touch. A second way is to use a Doppler tool. This tool listens for the sound of blood flow. A third way is to use ultrasound. Ultrasound makes a picture with sound waves. The picture can show the artery under the skin.

The question is simple. Does ultrasound help doctors place the line in children with fewer tries and less harm? The study team thought it might. The picture could guide the needle to the right spot. This could mean fewer needle sticks and fewer problems. We need to know if this is true in real care for kids.

Trial Design
This paper is a review of past studies. The team looked for studies through January of 2016. They found five studies to include. Four studies compared ultrasound to feeling for a pulse. One study compared ultrasound to the Doppler tool.

The children in these studies were one month to 18 years old. They needed an artery line for surgery or intensive care. The abstract did not say how long each child was in a study. It also did not give gender details. The review looked at how often the first try worked. It also looked at problems like bruises under the skin.

Results
Ultrasound helped place the artery line on the first try more often. It also helped place the line within two tries more often. This means fewer needle sticks for many children. Fewer tries can also save time in care.

Ultrasound led to fewer hematomas. A hematoma is a blood leak under the skin. It looks and feels like a bad bruise. Fewer hematomas mean less harm to the artery. This can lower the chance of other problems.

The review suggests that ultrasound may help most in babies and small children. Their arteries are tiny and hard to feel. The picture from ultrasound can make them easier to find. The review also suggests it may help more when the doctor knows how to use it well.

The proof has limits. Only five studies were found. The studies were not all the same. Some may have design issues. Because of this, the team rated the proof as moderate. That means the proof is fair, but not strong. We may need more studies to be sure.

Even so, the main message is clear. In these studies, ultrasound worked better than feeling by touch. It also worked better than the Doppler tool. It raised the chance of success on the first try. It raised the chance of success within two tries. It also cut the number of bad bruises.

These results matter for children and families. Fewer needle sticks can ease stress for a child. They can make care go smoother in a high‑risk time. They can lower the chance of artery harm. The results also matter for doctors and nurses. A higher first‑try success rate can help the whole care team.

What do the authors advise? They say ultrasound is better for placing artery lines in children. They think it is most helpful in babies and young children. They also note that skill with ultrasound may improve results. Training and practice can help build that skill.

In short, the review found this. Using a sound wave picture to guide the needle helps. It helps get the line in with fewer tries. It helps avoid bad bruises. It may help most in the youngest patients. More studies can add to what we know. But for now, the evidence supports using ultrasound for artery lines in kids.","Ultrasound use for insertion of arterial catheters in children

People with diabetes and other chronic diseases often use complementary and alternative medicines. This review examines the efficacy and safety of the use of various Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus.

Six studies tested five different types of herbal mixtures (proprietary drugs) and only one tested 'whole system' Ayurvedic treatment. The duration of treatment ranged from three to six months. One study each of Diabecon, Inolter and Cogent DB (proprietary herbal mixtures) found significantly lower glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) levels at the end of the treatment period compared to controls. Two studies of Diabecon, and one study of Cogent DB (proprietary herbal mixtures) found significantly lower fasting blood sugar levels at the end of the study period in the treatment group. No deaths were observed in these trials and side effects did not differ significantly between intervention and control groups. One study of Pancreas tonic reported no significant change in health‐related quality of life. No study reported on or was designed to investigate diabetic complications, death from any cause and costs. Despite positive results in some studies, and absence of serious side effects, firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to weak methods and small number of participants in the evaluated studies. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of these treatments. Ayurvedic physicians generally use a mixture of various herbs or proprietary preparations along with diet, exercise and mode of living.

What we know so far about Ayurvedic herbs for type 2 diabetes

Rationale
Type 2 diabetes means high blood sugar over time. It can harm the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart. Many people look for other ways to help. Some use herbs and care from Ayurveda.

Ayurveda is a system of care from India. It uses herbs, diet, exercise, and daily life tips. Many hope these herbs can help lower blood sugar. But we must test safety and benefit.

This study looked at past trials. The goal was to see if Ayurvedic care helps adults with type 2 diabetes. The study also checked for harm.

Ayurvedic care is often custom for each person. It blends herbs with diet and exercise plans. Trials may not match that real life care. So we must read the results with care.

Trial Design
This was a review of seven small trials. All trials were in adults with type 2 diabetes. People got an herbal treatment or a comparison plan. Time in each trial was three to six months.

Six trials tested brand name herbal mixes. These included Diabecon, Inolter, Cogent DB, and Pancreas Tonic. One trial tested full Ayurveda care. That means herbs plus diet and life advice.

In total, 354 people took part. Of those, 172 got the treatment. 158 were in the comparison group. Twenty four people could not be placed in a group.

Trials checked A1c and fasting blood sugar. A1c shows average blood sugar for three months. Fasting blood sugar is the level after not eating overnight. Some trials also checked side effects. One trial asked about quality of life.

Results
Some results looked good for blood sugar. Three single studies found lower A1c at the end. One each tested Diabecon, Inolter, and Cogent DB. This means average blood sugar went down in those groups.

Three studies found lower fasting blood sugar by the end. Two tested Diabecon. One tested Cogent DB. These results suggest short term benefit for some mixes.

No deaths were seen in any trial. Side effects were about the same in both groups. This suggests the herbs seemed safe in these small trials. One study of Pancreas Tonic saw no clear change in life quality.

No trial checked long term diabetes harm. That means no data on eye, kidney, nerve, or heart problems. No trial checked costs. So we cannot say if the herbs help with those things.

The trials were small and had weak methods. So we cannot make firm claims. The early results look helpful in some cases. But we need more and better trials.

Real life Ayurveda is custom care. It blends herbs, diet, exercise, and daily life tips. The trials mostly used set herb mixes. So these trials may not match real world care.

What does this mean for patients? Some herbal mixes may lower blood sugar for a short time. They seemed safe in these small trials. But we do not know the full effect or long term risk.

Why is this study useful? It sums up what we know so far. It shows where the gaps are. It points to the need for better studies.

The study team’s view is careful. They saw some good signs. But the evidence is not strong. More research must test full Ayurveda care and herb mixes. Trials should last longer and use strong methods.

In the future, we need clear answers. We need to know who benefits and how much. We need to know the risks and the costs. Until then, talk with your care team before you start any herb.","Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus:

10.1002-14651858.CD004314.pub3,"A comparison of botulinum toxin type A versus botulinum toxin type B for involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia 
The review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of botulinum toxin type A (BtA) compared to botulinum toxin type B (BtB) in people with involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia. This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review and we assessed the effectiveness (reduction in severity, disability and pain) and safety of BtA versus BtB in cervical dystonia. 
Background 
Cervical dystonia, also called spasmodic torticollis, is a disease that causes undesired, uncontrollable, often painful, abnormal placement of the head. It is a relatively uncommon condition (affecting 57 to 280 people per million) that can be very disabling and can affect a person's quality of life negatively. In most cases the cause is unknown and no cure exists. Since cervical dystonia is normally a long‐term disease it requires long‐term treatment. 
Botulinum toxin (Bt) is a powerful, natural chemical that can cause severe paralysis (an inability to move in the part of the body where it is applied) in animals and humans. It can also be used to treat many conditions, in particular those with involuntary muscle contractions, such as cervical dystonia. Bt is delivered by injections into the muscles that contract to produce the disease. There are different types of Bt, not all are available for treating health conditions. BtA is typically the first‐used treatment in cervical dystonia, but botulinum toxin type B (BtB) is an alternative option. The relative strength of each Bt formulation is variable, and the cost for 200 units varies from GBP 198 to GBP 308. 
Study characteristics 
We performed a rigorous search of the medical literature in October 2016 and found three studies that compared a single treatment session of BtA with BtB. These studies included a total of 270 participants, with on average a moderate disease impairment. The participants remained in the studies for a short period of time ‐ between 16 and 20 weeks after the treatment. The average age of people in the studies was 53.3 years, and they had had cervical dystonia for an average of 6.6 to 7.9 years before taking part in the trials. Most, 63.3%, of the people in the studies were women. All three of the studies were funded by drug manufacturers with possible interests in the results of the studies. 
Key results 
The results show little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the main measures of overall improvement and safety, including the total number of adverse (unwanted or harmful) events. There was also little or no difference between BtA and BtB in the self‐evaluations reported by the study participants. Based on the results we would expect that, out of 1000 people with cervical dystonia treated with BtB, there would be 362 more people who experience dry mouth/sore throat compared to 1000 people treated with BtA. The studies which looked at the duration of effect showed little or no difference between BtA and BtB. None of the studies examined the impact of either Bt on quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
All of the studies included participants that were different to the average person who suffers from cervical dystonia. To be included participants had to have a history of successful treatment with Bt. People with certain types of cervical dystonia, in particular the forms that make the head turn backward or forward, were not allowed to participate in the studies. 
Not enough participants were included across the studies for us to be completely confident in the results for the total number of adverse events, the self‐reported evaluations by participants or the pain assessment. 
The quality of the evidence for overall improvement and total number of adverse events was low. The quality of the evidence for more sore throat/dry mouth in people receiving BtB is moderate. The quality of the evidence where participants gave their self‐assessments is low. 
No definite conclusions can be drawn regarding overall safety and long‐term utility of BtA compared to BtB in cervical dystonia.

Type A or Type B botulinum toxin shots for painful neck pulling

Rationale
Cervical dystonia is a long-term neck problem. The neck muscles tighten on their own. The head may twist, tilt, or pull. It can hurt a lot. It can make daily life hard.

There is no cure. Many people need care for years. Shots of botulinum toxin can help. This medicine blocks nerve signals to muscles. That helps tight muscles relax.

Doctors can use two kinds of this medicine. They are called type A and type B. Type A is often used first. Type B is another choice if type A does not suit someone.

This review asked a simple question. Do type A or type B shots work better and are they safe? The team looked for change in neck pull, pain, and daily tasks. They also looked at side effects. They wanted to help doctors and patients pick a shot type.

Trial Design
This was a review of clinical trials. The team searched for all good trials up to October 2016. They found three trials that fit the plan. Each trial compared one set of type A shots with one set of type B shots. The shots went into neck muscles.

In all, 270 adults took part. On average, they had moderate neck problems. The average age was 53 years. Most had the illness for about 7 years. About two in three were women.

People in these trials had to have done well with these shots before. People with some neck pull types were not in the trials. This included people whose heads pulled back or forward. Everyone stayed in a trial for about 16 to 20 weeks. That is about four to five months after the shots.

Drug makers paid for all three trials. That can affect how a study is run or read. It is good to keep that in mind.

Results
Main benefits
Type A and type B gave close to the same results. People had similar change in how bad the neck pull was. They had about the same change in pain. They had about the same change in daily tasks. People’s own scores of how they felt were also about the same.

How long the shots helped was also much the same. The trials that looked at this found little or no gap between the two types. None of the trials checked change in quality of life. So we do not know if one type helped life quality more.

Side effects and safety
The total number of side effects was about the same with each type. Most side effects were mild or known for these shots. One side effect did stand out. Dry mouth or sore throat was more common with type B. Based on the trials, out of 1000 people on type B, about 360 more had dry mouth or sore throat than out of 1000 on type A.

Who these results fit
The people in these trials were not just like all people with this neck problem. They had to have done well with botulinum toxin before. People with some head pull types were not in the trials. So the results may not fit all patients.

How sure are these results?
The team also rated how sure we can be. For overall change and total side effects, our confidence was low. That means new studies could change these results. For the higher chance of dry mouth or sore throat with type B, our confidence was moderate. New studies may change the size of the gap, but the effect is likely real. For people’s own scores and pain change, our confidence was low.

What this means for patients and care
Both types seem to help to the same degree for most goals. This means many patients may do just as well on either type. But type B may cause more dry mouth or sore throat. If that side effect is a big issue for you, type A may be the better first choice. Your doctor may still choose type B for good reasons. For example, if type A did not work well for you in the past.

We still have gaps in what we know. These trials were small and short. They looked at only one set of shots. We do not know which type is safer or better over many sets of shots. We also do not know which type improves life quality more.

What the investigators concluded
The review found little or no difference between type A and type B in key benefits. The total number of side effects was about the same. Dry mouth or sore throat was more common with type B. The team could not make a firm call on long-term safety or use.

What should happen next
We need more and larger trials. They should include many kinds of patients. They should run for a longer time. They should track life quality, pain, daily tasks, and side effects. This will help patients and doctors choose the right shot type for each person.","A comparison of botulinum toxin type A versus botulinum toxin type B for involuntary positioning of the head, or cervical dystonia

Conventionally used soybean oil‐based lipid emulsion (S‐LE) have high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and phytosterols that may contribute to adverse effects in preterm infants. The newer lipid emulsions (LE) from different lipid sources are currently available for use in preterm infants. 
Objectives
To compare the safety and efficacy of all LE for parenteral nutrition (PN) in preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation) including preterm infants with surgical conditions or parenteral nutrition‐associated liver disease (PNALD)/cholestasis using direct comparisons and pair‐wise meta‐analyses. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to 18 June 2018), Embase (1974 to 18 July 2018), CINAHL (1982 to 18 June 2018), MIDRIS (1971 to 31 May 2018), conference proceedings, trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO's Trials Registry and Platform), and reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled studies in preterm infants with or without surgical conditions or PNALD within the first six months of life. 
Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis conformed to the methods of Cochrane Neonatal. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence for important outcomes in addition to reporting statistical significance of results. 
Main results
We included 29 studies (n = 2037) in this review. LE were classified in three broad groups: 1. all fish oil‐containing LE including pure fish oil‐LE (F‐LE) and multisource LE (e.g. medium‐chain triglycerides (MCT)‐olive‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (MOFS‐LE), MCT‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (MFS‐LE) and olive‐fish‐soybean oil‐LE (OFS‐LE); 2. conventional S‐LE; 3. alternative‐LE (e.g. MCT‐soybean oil‐LE (MS‐LE), olive‐soybean oil‐LE and borage oil‐based LE). 
We considered the following broad comparisons: fish oil LE versus non‐fish oil LE; fish oil LE versus another fish oil LE; alternative‐LE versus S‐LE; alternative‐LE versus another alternative‐LE in preterm infants less than 37 weeks' gestation, preterm infants with surgical conditions and preterm infants with PNALD/cholestasis. Separate subgroup comparisons of each LE preparation were included within these broader groups. 
Most studies in preterm infants used PN for mean duration of four weeks or less and for longer duration in infants with cholestasis or surgical conditions. 
We defined the primary outcome of PNALD/cholestasis as conjugated bilirubin (Cbil) 2 mg/dL or greater and resolution of PNALD/cholestasis as Cbil less than 2 mg/dL. There was heterogeneity in definitions used by the included studies with Cbil cut‐offs ranging from 17.1 μmol/L (1 mg/dL) up to 50 μmol/L (about 3 mg/dL). 
In preterm infants, meta‐analysis found no evidence of a difference in the incidence of PNALD/cholestasis (Cbil cut‐off: 2 mg/dl) between fish oil‐LEs and all non‐fish oil LEs (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 1.56; typical risk difference (RD) –0.03, 95% CI –0.08 to 0.02; 4 studies; n = 328; low‐quality evidence). 
We also considered an outcome allowing for any definition of PNALD (different Cbil cutoffs). In the meta‐analysis for PNALD/cholestasis, using any definition and restricted to low or unclear risk of bias studies, there was no evidence of a difference between fish oil LE and all non‐fish oil LE for incidence of cholestasis (typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.21; typical RD –0.02, 95% CI –0.05 to 0.02; 10 studies; n = 1024; low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of difference in subgroup meta‐analyses of individual LE types in any comparison. 
In preterm infants with surgical conditions or cholestasis, there was only one small study each reporting no evidence of a difference in incidence or resolution of cholestasis respectively with use of a pure F‐LE versus S‐LE (using a Cbil cut‐off of 2 mg/dL). 
In preterm infants with PNALD/cholestasis (using any definition), the meta‐analysis showed significantly less cholestasis with the use of fish oil‐LE compared to S‐LE (typical RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.91; typical RD –0.39, 95% CI –0.65 to –0.12; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3, 95% CI 2 to 9; 2 studies; n = 40; very low‐quality evidence). However, this outcome had a very low number of participants from two small studies with methodological differences, one of which was terminated early, increasing the uncertainty about effect estimates. 
There were no differences between LE types in pair‐wise meta‐analyses for growth in preterm infants. There was paucity of studies in preterm infants with surgical conditions or cholestasis to perform meta‐analyses for growth and most other outcomes. 
In the secondary outcomes for preterm infants, there was no difference between fish‐oil LE and non‐fish oil LE in meta‐analysis for severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (stage 3 or greater, or requiring surgery: typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.16; typical RD –0.03, 95% CI –0.07 to 0.02; 7 studies; n = 731; very low‐quality evidence). There were no differences in the LE types in pair‐wise meta‐analyses for death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), ventilation duration, patent ductus arteriosus, sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, jaundice, hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, intrahepatocellular lipid content and conjugated bilirubin levels in any comparison. 
In surgical infants, one study (n = 19) reported no differences in death, sepsis rates, Cbil and neurodevelopmental outcomes with pure F‐LE versus S‐LE. 
In infants with cholestasis, there were no evidence of differences in death or sepsis in meta‐analyses between fish oil‐LE and S‐LE; (2 studies; n = 40; very low‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
In the current review, we did not find any particular LE with or without fish oil to be better than another LE in preterm infants for prevention of PNALD/cholestasis, growth, mortality, ROP, BPD and other neonatal outcomes. 
In preterm infants with surgical conditions or cholestasis, there is currently insufficient evidence from randomised studies to determine with any certainty if fish oil LEs offer advantage in prevention or resolution of cholestasis or in any other clinical outcome. 
Further research, with larger well‐designed trials, is warranted to evaluate the ideal composition of LE in preterm infants and the role of fish oil‐containing and other LEs in the prevention and resolution of PNALD, ROP and other clinical outcomes.

Which IV fat is best for preterm babies on IV feeding?

Rationale
Many preterm babies are born before 37 weeks. Their gut may not work well yet. They may need food by vein. This is called IV feeding.

IV feeding often includes fat. The fat comes as a milky mix. Doctors call this a “lipid emulsion.” The most common mix uses soy oil. Soy oil has some plant fats and plant sterols. These may hurt the liver in some babies. The liver can then have bile back up. This is called cholestasis. When it is linked to IV feeding, some call it PN liver disease.

New fat mixes are now on the market. Some have fish oil. Some have olive oil. Some have medium chain fats. Some mix these oils. Fish oil may help the liver. But we do not know if it helps preterm babies on IV feeding.

This review asked a clear question. Is a fish oil fat mix safer or better than other fat mixes? The main hope was that it may lower liver problems. We also looked for effects on growth and other health risks.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. It looked at 29 studies with 2,037 babies. All babies were born before 37 weeks. Some had surgery. Some already had liver problems from IV feeding.

The studies compared three kinds of IV fat mixes:
- Fish oil mixes. These were pure fish oil, or fish oil mixed with soy, olive, or medium chain fats.
- Standard soy oil mixes.
- Other non-fish mixes. These used soy oil with olive oil or medium chain fats, or borage oil.

Most babies got IV fat for four weeks or less. Babies with surgery or liver disease often got it longer.

The main thing the trials tracked was liver health. They used a blood test called “conjugated bilirubin.” This is a sign of bile build up. Many studies set the main cut-off at 2 mg/dL. Some used a lower or higher cut-off. The review also looked at growth and many baby health problems. These were eye, lung, heart, gut, brain, blood sugar, and blood fat issues, and death. The reviewers also judged how strong the proof was. In many cases, the proof was weak.

Results
What was the main finding? For most preterm babies, no one IV fat mix stood out as best. Fish oil mixes did not clearly prevent liver problems better than other mixes. This was true when the cutoff for the bile test was 2 mg/dL. It was also true when the studies used other cut-offs.

Fish oil mixes also did not show clear gains for growth. They did not change the risk of death. They did not change the risk for key health problems. These include:
- Retinopathy of prematurity. This is a serious eye disease in preterm babies.
- Bronchopulmonary dysplasia. This is long-term lung disease in preterm babies.
- Time on a breathing machine.
- Patent ductus arteriosus. This is a heart vessel that stays open.
- Sepsis. This is a blood infection.
- Necrotizing enterocolitis. This is a severe gut disease.
- Intraventricular hemorrhage. This is brain bleeding.
- Periventricular leukomalacia. This is white matter brain injury.
- Jaundice, high blood sugar, or high blood fat.
- Fat build up in liver cells.
- The actual level of the bile marker in blood.

What about babies who had surgery? One small study had 19 babies. It found no real difference between pure fish oil and soy oil fat. This was true for death, blood infection, the bile marker, and brain outcomes.

What about babies who already had liver disease from IV feeding? Two small studies looked at this. They had 40 babies in total. In these studies, fish oil mixes seemed to help the liver get better more often than soy oil. But the proof was very weak. The studies were small. One stopped early. The methods were not all the same. So we cannot be sure this is a true effect.

What do these results mean for care now? For most preterm babies, fish oil mixes did not do better than other fat mixes. They did not prevent liver problems or improve growth or other outcomes. For babies who already have liver disease from IV feeding, fish oil may help. But we need strong, large trials to be sure.

Why is this review important? IV feeding saves lives. But it can hurt the liver in some babies. Families and care teams want fat mixes that are safe and help babies grow well. This large review shows we still lack clear answers. We need bigger, well-planned trials. These trials should test which fat mix keeps the liver safe. They should also look at the eyes, lungs, gut, brain, growth, and survival.

Bottom line for parents and caregivers: Today, no one IV fat mix is clearly best for most preterm babies. If a baby has liver disease from IV feeding, fish oil may help. But the current proof is not strong. Talk with your care team. They can weigh your baby’s needs and the best choice for now.","Systematic review of lipid emulsions for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants.
Review question: which lipid (fat) emulsions (LE) have the best outcomes in preterm infants with and without liver disease and surgical conditions? 
Background: preterm infants who need nutrition (feeding) through intravenous (into a vein; called parenteral nutrition) lines have been conventionally given pure soybean oil‐based fat emulsions. However, high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and phytosterols in pure soybean oil‐based emulsions may be harmful and contribute to parenteral nutrition‐associated liver disease (PNALD). The newer lipid emulsions (LE) from alternative lipid sources, including fish oil, may potentially improve clinical outcomes in preterm infants by decreasing PUFA content and providing lipid source‐specific benefits. 
Study characteristics: we searched the medical literature and identified 29 studies (including 2037 preterm infants). The evidence is up to date as of 18 June 2018. 
Key findings: in the population of preterm infants, without liver disease or surgical conditions, no particular LE was better than another for growth, liver disease, death, retinopathy (eye disease), infection and chronic lung disease. 
While there was very low quality and limited evidence to suggest that fish oil‐based LE may improve liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease, this evidence was based on a limited number of infants from two small studies, one of which was terminated early, and no certain conclusions can be drawn. 
Conclusions: based on this review, no particular LE is better than another for intravenous nutrition in preterm infants. There currently exists insufficient evidence from well‐designed studies about the benefit of fish oil‐LE for improving liver disease‐related outcomes in infants with pre‐existing liver disease or surgical conditions. Further research is required to establish the role of fish oil‐LE for liver disease outcomes in preterm infants and the ideal composition of LE for preterm infants.

10.1002-14651858.CD012019,"Urinary biomarkers for the non‐invasive diagnosis of endometriosis
Review Question 
How accurate are urine test in detecting endometriosis? Can any urine test be accurate enough to replace or reduce the need for surgery in the diagnosis of endometriosis? 
Background 
Women with endometriosis have endometrial tissue (the tissue that lines the womb and is shed during menstruation) growing outside the womb within the pelvic cavity. This tissue responds to reproductive hormones causing painful periods, chronic lower abdominal pain and difficulty conceiving. Currently, the only reliable way of diagnosing endometriosis is to perform laparoscopic surgery and visualise the endometrial deposits inside the abdomen. Because surgery is risky and expensive, urine tests have been evaluated for their ability to detect endometriosis non‐invasively. An accurate urine test could lead to the diagnosis of endometriosis without the need for surgery; or it could reduce the need for diagnostic surgery, so only women who were most likely to have endometriosis would require it. Other non‐invasive ways of diagnosing endometriosis using blood, imaging, endometrial and combination tests are evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews from this series. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence included in this review is current to July 2015. We included eight studies involving 646 participants. All studies evaluated reproductive‐aged women who were undertaking diagnostic surgery to investigate symptoms of endometriosis or for other indications. Five studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of four urinary biomarkers, including four biomarkers that were expressed differently in women with and without endometriosis and one showing no difference between the two groups. Three other studies just identified three biomarkers that did not distinguish the two groups. 
Key results 
None of the assessed biomarkers, including cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), enolase 1 (NNE), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and urinary peptide profiling have been evaluated by enough studies to provide a meaningful assessment of test accuracy. None of the tests were accurate enough to replace diagnostic surgery. Several studies identified biomarkers that might be of value in diagnosing endometriosis, but there are too few reports to be sure of their diagnostic benefit. There is not enough evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for use in clinical practice for the diagnosis of endometriosis. 
Quality of the evidence 
Generally, the reports were of low methodological quality and urine tests were only assessed in small individual studies. 
Future research 
More high quality research trials are needed to accurately assess the diagnostic potential of urinary biomarkers identified in small numbers of studies as having value in detecting endometriosis.

Can a urine test find endometriosis without surgery?

Rationale
Endometriosis is a long term health problem in women. Tissue like the womb lining grows outside the womb. This can cause bad period pain and pain in the belly. It can also make it hard to get pregnant.

Right now, doctors confirm endometriosis with surgery. The surgeon makes small cuts and looks inside the belly. This is called keyhole surgery. Surgery costs money, takes time, and has some risk.

A urine test would be simple and safe. You pee in a cup. Then the lab looks for a “biomarker.” A biomarker is a substance in the body. It may rise or fall with a disease. If a urine test works well, fewer women may need surgery. The goal is to find a test that can spot the disease. The test should also rule it out when it is not there.

This study review asked two main things. Can any urine test find endometriosis well? Could a urine test replace or reduce the need for surgery?

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies, not one new trial. The review looked for all good studies up to July 2015. It found eight studies. These studies had 646 women in all.

All women were in their “reproductive age.” This means they still had their period. Most had symptoms, like pain or trouble getting pregnant. Doctors had planned surgery to check the cause. Some women had surgery for other reasons.

In each study, women gave a urine sample. Then they had planned surgery. The surgery finding was the “truth” for diagnosis. The studies then checked how well the urine tests matched the surgery results.

The review did not report how long each person was in a study. Most tests were done near the time of surgery. That way, the urine and surgery results could be compared.

Results
The review looked at several urine biomarkers. A biomarker is a sign in urine that may show disease. Some were proteins. One was a pattern of small pieces called peptides.

Four biomarkers had more data on test accuracy. These were cytokeratin 19, enolase 1, vitamin D binding protein, and peptide profiling. We also call them CK 19, NNE, VDBP, and urine peptide profiling. Some studies found these were different in women with endometriosis. Other studies did not.

Three more studies found three other biomarkers. These did not tell the groups apart. So they did not help to diagnose endometriosis.

No urine test had enough proof to be sure it works well. The studies were small. They did not all use the same methods. Many had limits in their design. Because of this, the results were not strong.

None of the urine tests could replace surgery. None was accurate enough to make or rule out the diagnosis on its own. This means the standard way to confirm the disease is still surgery.

What does this mean for patients today? A urine test would be easy and safe. But the tests we have now are not ready for clinic use. Using them today could give wrong answers. A wrong answer could delay care or lead to unneeded surgery. So doctors should not use these tests alone to diagnose endometriosis.

Is there any benefit now? Not yet for daily care. But the work points to hope for the future. Some biomarkers may help if future studies are large and well done. If a strong urine test is found, it could help many women. It could also speed up the path to care.

Why is this review important? Endometriosis can take years to diagnose. Pain can affect school, work, sex, and mood. A simple test could cut that wait. It could also lower the need for surgery. That is why this research field matters.

What do the reviewers suggest next? They call for more high quality trials. Future trials should use clear, shared methods. They should include more women. They should compare the urine test to surgery in the same way. This will help tell if a biomarker truly works.

Bottom line for patients: We do not yet have a reliable urine test for endometriosis. Surgery is still the best way to confirm the disease. More research may change this in the future. For now, talk with your doctor about the best plan for you.","Urinary biomarkers for the non‐invasive diagnosis of endometriosis

10.1002-14651858.CD013280.pub2,"Background
Breast cancer will affect one in eight women during their lifetime. The opportunity to restore the removed tissue and cosmetic appearance is provided by reconstructive breast surgery following skin‐sparing mastectomy (SSM). Mastectomy skin flap necrosis (MSFN) is a common complication following SSM breast reconstruction. This postoperative complication can be prevented by intraoperative assessment of mastectomy skin flap viability and intervention when tissue perfusion is compromised. Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography is presumed to be a better predictor of MSFN compared to clinical evaluation alone. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of indocyanine green fluorescence angiography (ICGA) for preventing mastectomy skin flap necrosis in women undergoing immediate breast reconstruction following skin‐sparing mastectomy. 
To summarise the different ICGA protocols available for assessment of mastectomy skin flap perfusion in women undergoing immediate breast reconstructions following skin‐sparing mastectomy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 3, 2019), MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Clinicaltrials.gov in April 2019. In addition, we searched reference lists of published studies. 
Selection criteria
We included studies that compared the use of ICGA to clinical evaluation to assess mastectomy skin vascularisation and recruited women undergoing immediate autologous or prosthetic reconstructive surgery following SSM for confirmed breast malignancy or high risk of developing breast cancer. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included nonrandomised studies and extracted data on postoperative outcomes, including postoperative MSFN, reoperation, autologous flap necrosis, dehiscence, infection, haematoma and seroma, and patient‐related outcomes. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach and we constructed two 'Summary of finding's tables: one for the comparison of ICGA to clinical evaluation on a per patient basis and one on a per breast basis. 
Main results
Nine nonrandomised cohort studies met the inclusion criteria and involved a total of 1589 women with 2199 breast reconstructions. We included seven retrospective and two prospective cohort studies. Six studies reported the number of MSFN on a per breast basis for a total of 1435 breasts and three studies reported the number of MSFN on a per patient basis for a total of 573 women. Five studies reported the number of other complications on a per breast basis for a total of 1370 breasts and four studies reported the number on a per patient basis for a total of 613 patients. Therefore, we decided to pool data separately. 
Risk of bias for each included nonrandomised study was assessed using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. There was serious concern with risk of bias due to the nonrandomised study design of all included studies and the low comparability of cohorts in most studies. The quality of the evidence was found to be very low, after downgrading the quality of evidence twice for imprecision based on the small sample sizes and low number of events in the included studies. 
Postoperative complications on a per patient basis 
We are uncertain about the effect of ICGA on MSFN (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.56; three studies, 573 participants: very low quality of evidence), infection rates (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.40; four studies, 613 participants: very low quality of evidence), haematoma rates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.53; two studies, 459 participants: very low quality of evidence) and seroma rates (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.41 to 6.80; two studies, 408 participants: very low quality of evidence) compared to the clinical group. We found evidence that ICGA may reduce reoperation rates (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.72; four studies, 613 participants: very low quality of evidence). One study considered dehiscence as an outcome. In this single study, dehiscence was observed in 2.2% of participants (4/184) in the ICGA group compared to 0.5% of participants (1/184) in the clinical group (P = 0.372). The RR was 4.00 (95% CI 0.45 to 35.45; one study; 368 participants; very low quality of evidence). 
Postoperative complications on a per breast basis 
We found evidence that ICGA may reduce MSFN (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.82; six studies, 1435 breasts: very low quality of evidence), may reduce reoperation rates (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.92; five studies, 1370 breasts: very low quality of evidence) and may reduce infection rates (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97; five studies, 1370 breasts: very low quality of evidence) compared to the clinical group. We are uncertain about the effect of ICGA on haematoma rates (RR 1.53, CI 95% 0.47 to 4.95; four studies, 1042 breasts: very low quality of evidence) and seroma rates (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.35; two studies, 528 breasts: very low quality of evidence). 
None of the studies reported patient‐related outcomes.
ICGA protocols: eight studies used the SPY System and one study used the Photodynamic Eye imaging system (PDE) to assess MSFN. ICGA protocols in the included studies were not extensively described in most studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Although mastectomy skin flap perfusion is performed more frequently using ICGA as a helpful tool, there is a lack of high‐quality evidence in the context of randomised controlled trials. The quality of evidence in this review is very low, since only nonrandomised cohort studies have been included. With the results from this review, no conclusions can be drawn about what method of assessment is best to use during breast reconstructive surgery. High‐quality randomised controlled studies that compare the use of ICGA to assess MSFN compared to clinical evaluation are needed.

Can a dye and camera during breast surgery help save skin?

Rationale
Many women face breast cancer in their life. Some need a skin-sparing mastectomy. In this surgery, the breast is removed but most skin stays. Right after, doctors can rebuild the breast.

A key risk is skin loss after surgery. Doctors call this “skin flap necrosis.” It means the skin does not get enough blood, and the skin dies. This can harm healing and the final look.

Doctors check skin blood flow during surgery. They look at the skin and make a judgment. A newer tool may help them see blood flow better. It is called indocyanine green fluorescence angiography, or ICGA.

ICGA is a dye test with a special camera. The dye goes into a vein. The camera then shows how blood moves in the skin. If blood flow looks weak, the surgeon can act at once.

This review asked a key question. Does ICGA help prevent skin loss after this surgery? The authors also looked at how teams used ICGA in the operating room. This work may guide safer care.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team looked in many medical lists in April 2019. They found studies that compared ICGA to a doctor’s eye check alone. They also checked the study lists for more papers.

The review included women with breast cancer. Some women had a very high risk of breast cancer. All women had a skin-sparing mastectomy. All had breast rebuild right away. The rebuild used an implant or the patient’s own tissue.

Nine cohort studies met the rules. Seven looked back at records. Two followed women going forward. In total, 1,589 women took part. There were 2,199 breast reconstructions.

Not all studies reported the same things. Some counted outcomes by breast. Some counted by person. The review judged the study quality. The team rated the evidence as very low. This was due to the type of studies and small numbers.

The review did not report how long each woman stayed in a study. It did not report how long doctors watched for problems. The review did not find reports on patient views or quality of life.

Results
What did the review find? The main goal was less skin loss after surgery. The team also looked at more surgery, wound opening, infection, and blood or fluid build up.

When results were counted by person, the picture was unclear. ICGA may lower the need for another surgery. But for skin loss, infection, blood pooling, and fluid build up, the team was not sure. The evidence was too weak to judge.

When results were counted by breast, ICGA seemed to help more. It may lower skin loss. It may lower the need for another surgery. It may lower infection. For blood pooling and fluid build up, the effect was unclear.

One study looked at wound edges that split open. Few women had this in either group. This review did not find any studies that asked women about pain, worry, or daily life. No study shared those patient views.

How strong is this proof? The team rated it as very low. Why is that? The studies were not randomised. That means people were not put into groups by chance. The groups could differ in many ways. The groups were also hard to compare. Some were small. Some had few events.

What tools did teams use in the operating room? Most used one brand of ICGA system. One study used a different brand. But most papers did not say much about how they used ICGA. They did not list dye dose, timing, or imaging steps. This makes it hard to repeat the steps.

What does this mean for patients now? ICGA may help the surgeon see poor blood flow. It may help the surgeon make changes right away. It may lower skin loss and the need for another surgery. It may also lower infection. But we cannot be sure yet.

What should happen next? We need strong trials. In these trials, women would go into groups by chance. One group would get ICGA. One group would get the doctor’s eye check alone. The teams should track skin loss and other issues. They should also ask women about healing and life after surgery.

Bottom line
ICGA is a dye and camera test used during surgery. It may help the surgeon spot skin at risk. In this review, ICGA looked helpful in some ways. It may lower skin loss, infection, and repeat surgery when counted by breast. It may lower repeat surgery when counted by person. But the proof is very weak.

We cannot yet say that ICGA is better than a careful exam. Better studies are needed. Until then, patients can ask their team about ICGA. They can ask how the team uses it. They can ask about risks, costs, and likely benefits for them.","Indocyanine green angiography versus clinical evaluation in preventing postoperative complications following breast reconstruction after mastectomy 
What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out whether the use of a new imaging technique, called indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), during reconstructive breast surgery can reduce necrosis (cell death) of the overlying breast skin and other complications such as infections, following reconstructive breast surgery after mastectomy.  We included women who had undergone skin‐sparing mastectomy (that is, where the whole breast including nipple is removed, sparing the overlying breast skin) for breast cancer or women who were at high risk of developing breast cancer (because of faulty genes). We collected and analysed all relevant studies to provide a review that will inform doctors and patients on ICGA use in reconstructive breast surgery.  Key messages The use of ICGA during reconstructive breast surgery seems to reduce the chance of reoperations when compared to clinical evaluation only. We are uncertain about the effect of ICGA on reducing the chance of necrosis of the overlying breast skin and other post‐surgery complications when compared to clinical evaluation only. The quality of studies used for this review is very low, meaning that we are not confident of the results. We need high‐quality studies that have randomised women to a group of ICGA assessment or clinical evaluation alone to have a more definitive answer.  What was studied in the review? Around 40% of women with breast cancer need to undergo mastectomy (removal of the whole breast). A skin‐sparing mastectomy is a common operation in which the overlying breast skin is preserved. After skin‐sparing mastectomy, women have the option to undergo reconstructive breast surgery. This operation carries some risks and complications, including an operation to correct complications (reoperation), spontaneous reopening of the surgical wound (dehiscence), infection, blood pooling outside of a blood vessel (haematoma) and a pocket filled with blood plasma underneath the skin (seroma).  Preserving the blood supply of the overlying breast skin during skin‐sparing mastectomy is crucial. When the blood supply is poor, skin will not survive, and surgeons need to intervene to prevent postoperative complications. Usually, the surgeon will assess tissue colour, the time taken for colour to return to the skin after pressure is applied (capillary refill), temperature, skin’s elasticity, and bleeding of the skin.  ICGA is a new imaging technique that assesses the blood supply to the tissue. It can assess blood flow in the overlying breast skin better than clinical judgement alone. We collected studies that compared the use of ICGA to clinical evaluation by a surgeon during immediate reconstructive breast surgery after skin‐sparing mastectomy. In these studies, women underwent immediate reconstructive surgery with their own tissue from another area of the woman’s body or with a breast implant.  What are the main results of this review? We found nine studies that compared the number of postoperative complications in women who had ICGA assessment of their breast skin versus clinical evaluation. Six studies were performed in the USA, two in Denmark and one in Japan. There were a total 1589 women with 2199 breast reconstructions. Studies reported the number of complications on a per patient basis or on a per breast basis. We present information based on both types of data.  The main results on a per patient analysis were that: ‐ICGA may reduce reoperation rates, and ‐we are uncertain as to whether ICGA has an effect on necrosis of the overlying skin of the breast, infection, haematoma and seroma rates. 
The main results on a per breast basis were that: ‐ICGA may reduce necrosis of the overlying skin of the breast, reoperation and infection rates, and ‐we are uncertain as to whether ICGA has an effect on haematoma and seroma rates.  The evidence contributing to this review topic is considered to be very low quality. Since randomised controlled trials are found to be one of the most powerful methods in clinical research, it is a major downside that these studies are missing. We emphasise the need for randomised controlled trials to further investigate the use of ICGA in reconstructive breast surgery.  How up‐to‐date is this review? Studies published up to April 2019 have been used for this review.

What was the aim of this review? To compare treatment with and without anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF) medications for people with neovascular glaucoma (NVG). 
Key message It is uncertain whether treatment with anti‐VEGF medications is more beneficial than treatment without anti‐VEGF medications for people with NVG. More research is needed to investigate the long‐term effect of anti‐VEGF medications compared with, or in addition to, conventional treatment. 
What did we study in this review? VEGF is a protein produced by cells in your body, and produces new blood vessels when needed. When cells produce too much VEGF, abnormal blood vessels can grow in the eye. NVG is a type of glaucoma where the angle between the iris (coloured part of the eye) and the cornea (transparent front part of the eye) is closed by new blood vessels growing in the eye, hence, the name 'neovascular'. New blood vessels can cause scarring and narrowing, which can eventually lead to complete closure of the angle. This results in increased eye pressure since the fluid in the eye cannot drain properly. In NVG, the eye is often red and painful, and the vision is abnormal. High pressure in the eye can lead to blindness. 
Anti‐VEGF medication is a type of medicine that blocks VEGF, therefore, slowing the growth of blood vessels. It is administered by injection into the eye. It can be used early stage, when conventional treatment may not be possible. Most studies report short‐term (generally four to six weeks) benefits of anti‐VEGF medication, but long‐term benefits are not clear. 
What were the main results of this review? We included four studies enrolling a total of 263 participants with NVG. In one study, results beyond the treatment period of 1 week could not be evaluated. In another study, results were uncertain due to the limitation of study design. 
The last two studies reported different results for lowering eye pressure; one study showed inconclusive results, and the other study showed that anti‐VEGF medications were more effective. The certainty of the evidence in these studies was low, due to limitations in the study designs and inconsistency of results. Therefore, available evidence is insufficient to recommend the routine use of anti‐VEGF medication in individuals with NVG. 
How up to date is the review? We searched for studies that were published up to 22 March 2019.

Do eye shots that block new blood vessels help a type of glaucoma?

Rationale
Glaucoma is eye damage from high eye pressure. It can harm the nerve for sight. This can lead to vision loss and even blindness.

A rare kind is new blood vessel glaucoma. Doctors also call it neovascular glaucoma. In this type, many weak, new vessels grow in the eye. They block a tiny drain where eye fluid should flow out. Eye pressure then climbs. The eye may get red and sore. Sight may get worse.

The body makes a signal called VEGF. It helps the body grow new vessels when needed. Too much VEGF can cause many weak, new vessels to grow in the eye.

Anti-VEGF drugs block this signal. Doctors give these drugs as a shot into the eye. The goal is to slow or stop new vessel growth. This may help open the drain and lower eye pressure.

Some people with this glaucoma cannot get standard care right away. In these cases, doctors may use anti-VEGF shots first. Many reports show short-term help with these shots. But we do not know if the help lasts. We also do not know if they work better than care without them. This review asked that key question.

Trial Design
This review looked at studies that tested care with and without anti-VEGF shots. The goal was to see if the shots add more benefit. The review found four studies. They enrolled a total of 263 people with new vessel glaucoma.

Most studies watched people for a short time. Many looked at four to six weeks after the shot. One study had only one week of results. We do not have clear long-term results from these studies.

Some study details were not clear in the abstract. It did not list ages. It did not list the split by sex or gender. All people in the studies had new vessel glaucoma.

All the anti-VEGF drugs were given into the eye. The control care did not include these shots. The review searched for studies up to March 22, 2019.

Results
The main point is still not clear. We do not know if anti-VEGF shots help more than no shots. One study could not tell us what happened after one week. Another had limits in how it was done, so the results were not sure.

Two other studies looked at eye pressure. One showed no clear edge for the shots. The other showed that the shots lowered eye pressure more. These results do not match. That makes it hard to be sure.

The proof from these studies was low in certainty. The studies had design limits. The results did not agree with each other. We need better and longer studies.

What does this mean for patients right now? The shots may help some people for a short time. They may lower eye pressure for a few weeks. But we do not know if they help for months or years. We also do not know if they work better than care without them.

Because of this, experts cannot advise using these shots for all people with this glaucoma. Care choices should be based on each person’s needs. Doctors may still use the shots in some cases. For example, they may use them when other care is not yet possible. But this should be a case-by-case choice.

This review is up to date through March 22, 2019. New studies may add more facts. If you have this type of glaucoma, talk with your eye doctor. Ask about the goals of each option. Ask what is known now, and what is not yet known. This can help you choose the best plan for you.","Anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor for neovascular glaucoma

10.1002-14651858.CD013180.pub2,"Background
Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with women's quality of life, regardless of the absolute amount of bleeding. It is a very common condition in women of reproductive age, affecting 2 to 5 of every 10 women. Diverse treatments, either medical (hormonal or non‐hormonal) or surgical, are currently available for HMB, with different effectiveness, acceptability, costs and side effects. The best treatment will depend on the woman's age, her intention to become pregnant, the presence of other symptoms, and her personal views and preferences. 
Objectives
To identify, systematically assess and summarise all evidence from studies included in Cochrane Reviews on treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), using reviews with comparable participants and outcomes; and to present a ranking of the first‐ and second‐line treatments for HMB. 
Methods
We searched for published Cochrane Reviews of HMB interventions in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The primary outcomes were menstrual bleeding and satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, adverse events and the requirement of further treatment. Two review authors independently selected the systematic reviews, extracted data and assessed quality, resolving disagreements by discussion. We assessed review quality using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool and evaluated the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods. We grouped the interventions into first‐ and second‐line treatments, considering participant characteristics (desire for future pregnancy, failure of previous treatment, candidacy for surgery). First‐line treatments included medical interventions, and second‐line treatments included both the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) and surgical treatments; thus the LNG‐IUS is included in both groups. We developed different networks for first‐ and second‐line treatments. We performed network meta‐analyses of all outcomes, except for quality of life, where we performed pairwise meta‐analyses. We reported the mean rank, the network estimates for mean difference (MD) or odds ratio (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and the certainty of evidence (moderate, low or very low certainty). 
We also analysed different endometrial ablation and resection techniques separately from the main network: transcervical endometrial resection (TCRE) with or without rollerball, other resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA), microwave non‐resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA), hydrothermal ablation NREA, bipolar NREA, balloon NREA and other NREA. 
Main results
We included nine systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Library up to July 2021. We updated the reviews that were over two years old. In July 2020, we started the overview with no new reviews about the topic. The included medical interventions were: non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid), combined oral contraceptives (COC), combined vaginal ring (CVR), long‐cycle and luteal oral progestogens, LNG‐IUS, ethamsylate and danazol (included to provide indirect evidence), which were compared to placebo. Surgical interventions were: open (abdominal), minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic) and unspecified (or surgeon's choice of route of) hysterectomy, REA, NREA, unspecified endometrial ablation (EA) and LNG‐IUS. We grouped the interventions as follows. 
First‐line treatments 
Evidence from 26 studies with 1770 participants suggests that LNG‐IUS results in a large reduction of menstrual blood loss (MBL; mean rank 2.4, MD −105.71 mL/cycle, 95% CI −201.10 to −10.33; low certainty evidence); antifibrinolytics probably reduce MBL (mean rank 3.7, MD −80.32 mL/cycle, 95% CI −127.67 to −32.98; moderate certainty evidence); long‐cycle progestogen reduces MBL (mean rank 4.1, MD −76.93 mL/cycle, 95% CI −153.82 to −0.05; low certainty evidence), and NSAIDs slightly reduce MBL (mean rank 6.4, MD −40.67 mL/cycle, −84.61 to 3.27; low certainty evidence; reference comparator mean rank 8.9). We are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions and the sensitivity analysis for reduction of MBL, as the evidence was rated as very low certainty. 
We are uncertain of the true effect of any intervention (very low certainty evidence) on the perception of improvement and satisfaction. 
Second‐line treatments 
Bleeding reduction is related to the type of hysterectomy (total or supracervical/subtotal), not the route, so we combined all routes of hysterectomy for bleeding outcomes. We assessed the reduction of MBL without imputed data (11 trials, 1790 participants) and with imputed data (15 trials, 2241 participants). Evidence without imputed data suggests that hysterectomy (mean rank 1.2, OR 25.71, 95% CI 1.50 to 439.96; low certainty evidence) and REA (mean rank 2.8, OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.29 to 5.66; low certainty evidence) result in a large reduction of MBL, and NREA probably results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 2.0, OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.53 to 7.23; moderate certainty evidence). Evidence with imputed data suggests hysterectomy results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 1.0, OR 14.31, 95% CI 2.99 to 68.56; low certainty evidence), and NREA probably results in a large reduction of MBL (mean rank 2.2, OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.29 to 6.05; moderate certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the true effect for REA (very low certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effect on amenorrhoea (very low certainty evidence). 
Evidence from 27 trials with 4284 participants suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy results in a large increase in satisfaction (mean rank 1.3, OR 7.96, 95% CI 3.33 to 19.03; low certainty evidence), and NREA also increases satisfaction (mean rank 3.6, OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.33; low certainty evidence), but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions (very low certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence suggests LNG‐IUS is the best first‐line treatment for reducing menstrual blood loss (MBL); antifibrinolytics are probably the second best, and long‐cycle progestogens are likely the third best. We cannot make conclusions about the effect of first‐line treatments on perception of improvement and satisfaction, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. For second‐line treatments, evidence suggests hysterectomy is the best treatment for reducing bleeding, followed by REA and NREA. We are uncertain of the effect on amenorrhoea, as evidence was rated as very low certainty. Minimally invasive hysterectomy may result in a large increase in satisfaction, and NREA also increases satisfaction, but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining second‐line interventions, as evidence was rated as very low certainty.

Which treatments work best for heavy periods? A review of past studies

Rationale
Heavy periods are common. They can harm day to day life. They can cause pain, leaks, and stress. They can lead to low blood iron and fatigue.

Heavy periods affect 2 to 5 in 10 women of child‑bearing age. Help is key for work, school, home, and life plans. Many options exist. Some are pills. Some are a device in the womb. Some are a surgery.

This study set out to rank treatments. The team asked: what works best first? If that fails, what should come next? They looked for the best ways to cut blood lost with each period. They also looked for what makes people feel more pleased with care.

Some drugs may slow blood loss by helping clots form. One is tranexamic acid. Some drugs are hormones. They can thin the womb lining. One device, called an intrauterine system, gives a small dose of a hormone in the womb. Some pain drugs may also help a bit. Some in‑office or day care steps can burn or remove the womb lining. This is called ablation. A hysterectomy is surgery to remove the womb. It stops periods for good.

Trial Design
This was a review of past work, not a new trial. The team used nine Cochrane Reviews. A review like this groups many trials. It gives a big view of what works and what does not.

The team looked at women with heavy periods. These were women who still have periods. They grouped care into first line and second line options. First line was mostly drugs and the device that sits in the womb. Second line was the device and surgery. The device is called the levonorgestrel intrauterine system, or LNG‑IUS for short.

The team ranked how well each option cut bleed flow. They also looked at how many people felt more pleased with care. They checked for changes in life quality, side effects, and if more care was later needed. They rated how sure the proof was. They called it moderate, low, or very low.

This review did not enroll new people. So there were no study visits or set time in the study for a person. It drew on trials done up to July 2021.

Results
First line care
The LNG‑IUS cut period blood by a lot. In this review, it ranked first for this goal. The LNG‑IUS is a small T‑shaped device put in the womb. It gives off a low dose of a progestin hormone. This thins the womb lining. Then less blood comes out in each period.

Tranexamic acid also helped. It likely ranked next best. This drug helps blood clot. People take it only on period days.

Long course progestin pills also helped. They likely ranked in third place. These pills give a hormone for many days in a row. That can thin the womb lining and cut flow.

Common pain pills from the class called NSAIDs gave a small drop in bleed. They did not rank as high.

For how people felt over all, the proof was not clear. The review could not say if first line care raised the sense of well‑being or joy with care. The proof was too weak to make a firm call.

Second line care
If first line care fails, there are other steps. A hysterectomy gave the largest drop in bleed. It takes out the womb, so periods stop for good. This can be done through the belly, the vagina, or by tiny cuts. The route did not change how much bleed was cut. The type of hysterectomy (total or part) was the key point.

Ablation also helped. In ablation, a doctor removes or destroys the womb lining. One way cuts the lining with a scope (this is called resectoscopic ablation). One way uses heat, fluid, or a small tool and does not cut (this is called non‑resectoscopic ablation). Both cut bleed a lot. The proof was stronger for the type that does not cut.

Joy with care rose most after small cut (minimally invasive) hysterectomy. People also felt more pleased after ablation that does not cut. We do not know as much about how the other methods change joy with care.

The review could not say if any option made periods stop (amenorrhea) more often. The proof there was weak. The review also looked at side effects and the need for more care. But the main clear facts were on bleed flow and joy with care.

What this means for you
Many women have heavy periods. Care should fit your goals. Think about plans for a child, other signs you have, and what you can afford and accept. A device in the womb may be the best first step to cut bleed. If you want pills, tranexamic acid is likely next best. Long course progestin pills may help as well. Pain drugs may help a bit, too.

If those do not help, ablation or a hysterectomy may be next. Ablation keeps the womb but may not suit if you want to get pregnant later. A hysterectomy ends periods and ends the chance to have a child. It had the largest drop in bleed and high joy with care in this review.

Not all facts were firm. Some results had low or very low proof. Talk with your care team. Ask what is best for you now. Ask how each choice may help, and what risks it has. This review can guide a plan that fits your life and your goals.","Which is the best treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding?
Key results 
Evidence suggests that the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) is the best first‐line option for reducing menstrual bleeding, while antifibrinolytics are probably the second best, and long‐cycle progestogens are the third best. Because of some limitations in the evidence, we are not sure what the true effect of these first‐line treatments is for the perception of improvement and satisfaction. 
For second‐line treatments, evidence suggests any type of hysterectomy is the best treatment for reducing bleeding, even though this is a major surgery, and resectoscopic endometrial ablation (REA) and non‐resectoscopic endometrial ablation (NREA) are second and third best. We are uncertain of the true effect of the second‐line treatments on amenorrhoea (absence of menstrual blood loss). Evidence suggests that minimally invasive hysterectomy results in a large increase in satisfaction, and NREA increases satisfaction, but we are uncertain of the true effect of the remaining interventions. 
What is heavy menstrual bleeding? 
Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with the quality of life of people who menstruate. It is very common and can affect 20% to 50% of people who menstruate during their reproductive years. There are different treatments available, each with their own pros and cons. The best treatment depends on the person's age, whether they have or want to have children, their personal preferences, and their medical history, among other things. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to get an overview of all the published evidence on different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. We were most interested in finding out if the treatments were effective for reducing menstrual bleeding and for improving women's satisfaction. We also wanted to know how the treatment affected quality of life, what side effects it caused, and whether women required further treatment. 
What did we do? 
This study is an overview of reviews, which means we looked for published studies that synthesised the results of other studies on different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. Then we tried to give a broad overview of all that evidence. We analysed the certainty of the evidence based on factors like study size and methodological rigour. We categorised the treatments based on patient characteristics, including the desire (intention) for future pregnancy, failure of previous treatment or having been referred for surgery. First‐line treatment included medical interventions and second‐line treatment included the LNG‐IUS plus surgical interventions; thus, the LNG‐IUS was included in both first‐ and second‐line treatments. We used network meta‐analysis, a statistical method that compares all the interventions at the same time, to find out which treatments produced the best results for patients. 
What did we find? 
We found nine reviews with 104 studies, involving a total of 11,881 participants. Altogether, the data we analysed came from 85 trials and 9950 participants. The medical interventions included were: non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid), combined oral contraceptives (COC), combined vaginal ring (CVR), long‐cycle and luteal oral progestogens, the LNG‐IUS, ethamsylate and danazol (included only to provide indirect evidence). These were compared to placebo (sham treatment). The surgical interventions included were: open (abdominal), minimally invasive (vaginal or laparoscopic) and unspecified (or surgeon's choice of) route of hysterectomy, REA, NREA and unspecified endometrial ablation (EA). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
Our confidence in some evidence is moderate, but for most of it, our confidence is low to very low. The main reasons were because the studies were often not blinded, which means the participants knew which treatment they were receiving, and that could have changed their perception; the direct and indirect evidence was not similar enough to compare in the network; and the range of the results was too wide. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The last search for reviews was in July 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD007077.pub4,"Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer
What is the issue? 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer that women get.
Women with early breast cancer who choose to keep their breast need to have radiotherapy (RT) as well as surgery to remove the cancer to make sure it does not regrow in the breast. RT is treatment with high energy x‐rays. Having RT for breast cancer usually means 15 to 30 visits to the RT department, five times per week. 
If breast cancer does regrow in the same breast (called local recurrence), it tends to come back in the area it was removed from. Women can also grow a new cancer (new 'elsewhere primary') in another part of the same breast. We are not sure if the RT given to stop cancer regrowth where the first cancer was, stops the growth of 'elsewhere primaries.' 
Why does it matter? 
We always want to treat the smallest area we can with RT because this means fewer side effects. Treating only part of the breast could mean that RT might be able to be used again in another part of the same breast if needed. New ways of giving RT mean that treating part of the breast can be done with fewer treatments. This is likely to be easier for women and cost less money. 
What did we compare? 
We asked if giving RT to part of the breast (called partial breast irradiation (PBI)) is as good as giving RT to the whole breast. PBI can be given with a shortened treatment duration (called accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)). 
For this treatment to be acceptable, it would need to control the cancer as well as giving RT to the whole breast does. It would also be important that the PBI gives about the same side effects and breast appearance as treating the whole breast. 
What did we find? 
We found nine studies, which involved 15,187 women. Our evidence is current to 27 August 2020. Local recurrence is probably slightly more common with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence) and the breast appearance (scored by doctors and nurses) was probably worse with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence). There is probably little difference in survival (high‐quality evidence). Late radiation fibrosis (change in breast appearance and feel) is probably increased with APBI/PBI. There are probably few differences in breast cancer‐related deaths and spread of breast cancer around the body with the use of APBI/PBI. The use of APBI/PBI makes little difference to how many women need mastectomy (removal of the whole breast) because of unacceptable late side effects or local recurrence. 
What do our findings mean? 
This means that at the moment, PBI does not give the same cancer control in the breast as treating the whole breast, but the difference is small. It may cause worse side effects. There are seven big ongoing studies that will be important to answer this question. We hope to have a clearer answer in the next update of this review. 
","1. Plain Title
Treating only part of the breast after early breast cancer

2. Rationale
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Many women can keep the breast after surgery. To lower the chance of the cancer coming back, they also get radiation treatment (RT). RT uses high energy x‑rays to kill any cells left behind.

Usual RT treats the whole breast. It often needs many trips. Most women go 5 days a week. Many women need 15 to 30 visits in total. This is hard for some women.

Most breast cancers that come back in the same breast grow near the first spot. Some women can also grow a new cancer in another part of the same breast. Doctors ask: If the cancer comes back close to the old spot, can we treat only that area?

Partial breast irradiation (PBI) treats only the area near the first cancer. A short course is called accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). PBI aims to treat less normal breast. This may mean fewer side effects. It may also mean fewer trips for care. If a new cancer grows in a far spot later, RT might still be possible there.

This review asked if PBI works as well as whole breast RT. The hope was that PBI would control cancer just as well. It would also need to have a similar look and feel of the breast. Side effects would need to be about the same.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of other studies. The team looked for studies that compared PBI or APBI with whole breast RT. They found nine studies. These studies included 15,187 women. The evidence in this review is current to 27 August 2020.

All women had early breast cancer. All kept the breast after surgery. The studies compared two plans. One plan treated the whole breast. The other plan treated only part of the breast.

The review looked at key results. These included cancer coming back in the same breast. It also looked at how the breast looked. It looked at hard scar tissue in the breast. It looked at spread of cancer to other parts of the body. It looked at need for removal of the whole breast (mastectomy). It looked at how long women lived.

RT plans take time. Whole breast RT often means many visits. PBI can be a shorter plan. Each study had its own time frame. Women were watched for years to see if cancer came back. The summary did not list the exact time in each study.

4. Results
The review found that PBI or APBI controlled cancer in the breast almost as well. But local regrowth in the same breast was a bit more common with PBI or APBI. This means whole breast RT gave slightly better control in the breast.

Doctors and nurses also rated how the breast looked. They found the breast looked a bit worse after PBI or APBI. Some women had more late changes in the breast after PBI or APBI. These changes can feel like hard scar tissue. The breast may also look or feel different.

There was little difference in how long women lived. This means overall survival was about the same. There were also few differences in deaths from breast cancer. There were few differences in spread of breast cancer to other parts of the body.

The number of women who later needed a mastectomy was about the same. This was true whether the reason was side effects or cancer coming back.

What do these results mean for you? Treating only part of the breast may save time. It may mean fewer trips. It may lower the dose to the rest of the breast. It may also leave RT as an option in a far spot later. But it may raise the chance of a small in‑breast regrowth. It may also change how the breast looks and feels.

The size of the rise in regrowth with PBI or APBI was small. But it was there. The change in how the breast looks was also there. Many women still did just as well in terms of life span. Many had no spread of cancer. Many did not need a mastectomy later.

These facts can help you weigh your choices. Some women value fewer visits most. Others value the small extra drop in regrowth. Your own values matter.

There are seven large studies still going on now. These may give a clearer answer. The review team plans to update their work. We may know more soon.

If you face this choice, talk with your care team. Ask about your own risk of regrowth. Ask about how many visits you may need. Ask how your breast may look and feel. Together, you can pick the plan that fits you best.","Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer
What is the issue? 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer that women get.
Women with early breast cancer who choose to keep their breast need to have radiotherapy (RT) as well as surgery to remove the cancer to make sure it does not regrow in the breast. RT is treatment with high energy x‐rays. Having RT for breast cancer usually means 15 to 30 visits to the RT department, five times per week. 
If breast cancer does regrow in the same breast (called local recurrence), it tends to come back in the area it was removed from. Women can also grow a new cancer (new 'elsewhere primary') in another part of the same breast. We are not sure if the RT given to stop cancer regrowth where the first cancer was, stops the growth of 'elsewhere primaries.' 
Why does it matter? 
We always want to treat the smallest area we can with RT because this means fewer side effects. Treating only part of the breast could mean that RT might be able to be used again in another part of the same breast if needed. New ways of giving RT mean that treating part of the breast can be done with fewer treatments. This is likely to be easier for women and cost less money. 
What did we compare? 
We asked if giving RT to part of the breast (called partial breast irradiation (PBI)) is as good as giving RT to the whole breast. PBI can be given with a shortened treatment duration (called accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)). 
For this treatment to be acceptable, it would need to control the cancer as well as giving RT to the whole breast does. It would also be important that the PBI gives about the same side effects and breast appearance as treating the whole breast. 
What did we find? 
We found nine studies, which involved 15,187 women. Our evidence is current to 27 August 2020. Local recurrence is probably slightly more common with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence) and the breast appearance (scored by doctors and nurses) was probably worse with APBI/PBI (moderate‐quality evidence). There is probably little difference in survival (high‐quality evidence). Late radiation fibrosis (change in breast appearance and feel) is probably increased with APBI/PBI. There are probably few differences in breast cancer‐related deaths and spread of breast cancer around the body with the use of APBI/PBI. The use of APBI/PBI makes little difference to how many women need mastectomy (removal of the whole breast) because of unacceptable late side effects or local recurrence. 
What do our findings mean? 
This means that at the moment, PBI does not give the same cancer control in the breast as treating the whole breast, but the difference is small. It may cause worse side effects. There are seven big ongoing studies that will be important to answer this question. We hope to have a clearer answer in the next update of this review.

Review question: We reviewed the evidence about the effect of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. We found 13 studies including 9059 participants. 
Background: We wanted to discover whether using fixed‐dose combination therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care, placebo, or giving drugs separately, for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. This report represents an update from a previous review published in 2014. 
Study characteristics: The evidence is current to September 2016. Four studies included individuals with a prior heart attack or stroke or with a high predicted risk for having an initial heart attack and five studies had long‐term (12 months or more) follow‐up. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Most study participants were middle‐aged men with moderate elevations in blood pressure or cholesterol. Two studies specifically included ethnic Aboriginal or Maori minorities in half of the study participants. The fixed‐dose combinations ranged from two to five drugs; all studies included at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one cholesterol‐lowering drug. 
Key results: The effects of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on all‐cause mortality and fatal and non‐fatal heart attacks and strokes are uncertain, primarily due to the low number of participants experiencing these events in these studies (fewer than 5% for both) and comparisons with usual care (low‐quality evidence). Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy leads to more adverse events than control (32% versus 27%), including placebo (moderate‐quality evidence). This information is not surprising since aspirin, blood pressure‐lowering drugs and cholesterol drugs are known to increase the risk for side effects compared with placebo. Fixed‐dose combination therapy may modestly lower blood pressure (˜6 mmHg) and cholesterol (‐0.6 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol), but these effects were not consistent (moderate‐quality evidence for blood pressure and LDL cholesterol but low‐quality evidence of total cholesterol). Fixed‐dose combination therapy appears to improve adherence to medications to prevent ASCVD (moderate‐quality evidence). 
Quality of the evidence: The quality of evidence from these studies generally ranged from moderate to low. Ongoing trials of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy will likely inform clinical endpoints to guide decision‐making. 
","1. Plain Title
One pill with many drugs to help prevent heart attack and stroke

2. Rationale
Heart disease and stroke are common. They can cause death and long-term harm. Many adults have high blood pressure or high cholesterol. These raise the chance of heart attack and stroke.

Many people need more than one pill each day. It can be hard to keep up. Missing pills can reduce the benefit. A single pill that holds several drugs may help. It may be easier to take each day. It may lower blood pressure and bad cholesterol.

This study asked a clear question. Do fixed-dose combo pills help prevent heart attack and stroke? Are they as safe as usual care or taking pills one by one? The idea is that one pill, once a day, may help people stay on treatment. That could lead to better heart health over time.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. The team looked at 13 studies with 9,059 adults. The search included studies up to September 2016. It updated a review first done in 2014.

Most people in the studies were middle-aged men. Many had raised blood pressure or raised cholesterol. Some had a past heart attack or stroke. Some had a high chance of a first heart attack. Two studies included many Aboriginal or Maori people.

The combo pills had two to five drugs in one tablet. Each pill mix had at least one drug to lower blood pressure. Each also had at least one drug to lower cholesterol. The studies compared the combo pill to usual care, to a fake pill, or to the same drugs given as separate pills.

Five studies watched people for one year or more. Other studies were shorter. In many studies, people knew what pill they got. That can affect how people report symptoms. It can also affect how they take pills.

4. Results
What did the review find? The effect on death, heart attack, and stroke is still not clear. Across these studies, fewer than 5 in 100 people had these events. When events are rare, it is hard to be sure of true effects. Some studies also used usual care as the match group. That makes firm answers harder.

Side effects were more common with the combo pill. About 32 in 100 people on the combo pill had a side effect. About 27 in 100 people in the match group had a side effect. This is not a surprise. Blood pressure and cholesterol drugs can cause side effects. A combo pill puts more than one drug together. That can raise the chance of side effects.

The combo pill may help lower blood pressure a bit. On average, the top blood pressure number fell about 6 points. The combo pill also lowered bad cholesterol a little. These changes were not the same in all studies. Some studies showed more change. Some showed less.

The combo pill seemed to help people keep up with their pills. More people took their pills as told when they had one pill to take. This is a key point. Taking pills day after day is hard. A simple plan may help.

What does this mean for patients? A combo pill may make daily care easier. It may lower blood pressure and bad cholesterol a bit. But it may also bring more side effects. We do not yet know if it lowers the chance of heart attack or stroke. The events were rare in these studies. The proof was fair to weak in quality.

What does this mean for doctors and nurses? The review adds to what we know. It updates the 2014 report. It shows better pill taking with combo pills. It shows small drops in blood pressure and bad cholesterol. But it does not prove fewer heart attacks or strokes yet. More and larger trials are in progress. Those trials should give clearer answers.

What did the study team conclude? Fixed-dose combo pills have promise. They simplify care and may improve daily pill use. They may lower key risk numbers a little. But they also bring more side effects. The current proof is moderate to low in strength. Ongoing trials will test hard outcomes, like heart attack and stroke. Those results will guide care in the future.

If you are a patient, talk with your doctor. Ask about the number of pills you take. Ask about side effects. Ask if a combo pill could be a fit for you. Every person is different. Your care plan should fit your needs and goals.","Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke

10.1002-14651858.CD013705.pub3,"Background
Accurate rapid diagnostic tests for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection would be a useful tool to help manage the COVID‐19 pandemic. Testing strategies that use rapid antigen tests to detect current infection have the potential to increase access to testing, speed detection of infection, and inform clinical and public health management decisions to reduce transmission. This is the second update of this review, which was first published in 2020. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of rapid, point‐of‐care antigen tests for diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We consider accuracy separately in symptomatic and asymptomatic population groups. Sources of heterogeneity investigated included setting and indication for testing, assay format, sample site, viral load, age, timing of test, and study design. 
Search methods
We searched the COVID‐19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) on 08 March 2021. We included independent evaluations from national reference laboratories, FIND and the Diagnostics Global Health website. We did not apply language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included studies of people with either suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, known SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or known absence of infection, or those who were being screened for infection. We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated commercially produced, rapid antigen tests. We included evaluations of single applications of a test (one test result reported per person) and evaluations of serial testing (repeated antigen testing over time). Reference standards for presence or absence of infection were any laboratory‐based molecular test (primarily reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR)) or pre‐pandemic respiratory sample. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard screening procedures with three people. Two people independently carried out quality assessment (using the QUADAS‐2 tool) and extracted study results. Other study characteristics were extracted by one review author and checked by a second. We present sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each test, and pooled data using the bivariate model. We investigated heterogeneity by including indicator variables in the random‐effects logistic regression models. We tabulated results by test manufacturer and compliance with manufacturer instructions for use and according to symptom status. 
Main results
We included 155 study cohorts (described in 166 study reports, with 24 as preprints). The main results relate to 152 evaluations of single test applications including 100,462 unique samples (16,822 with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2). Studies were mainly conducted in Europe (101/152, 66%), and evaluated 49 different commercial antigen assays. Only 23 studies compared two or more brands of test. 
Risk of bias was high because of participant selection (40, 26%); interpretation of the index test (6, 4%); weaknesses in the reference standard for absence of infection (119, 78%); and participant flow and timing 41 (27%). Characteristics of participants (45, 30%) and index test delivery (47, 31%) differed from the way in which and in whom the test was intended to be used. Nearly all studies (91%) used a single RT‐PCR result to define presence or absence of infection. 
The 152 studies of single test applications reported 228 evaluations of antigen tests. Estimates of sensitivity varied considerably between studies, with consistently high specificities. Average sensitivity was higher in symptomatic (73.0%, 95% CI 69.3% to 76.4%; 109 evaluations; 50,574 samples, 11,662 cases) compared to asymptomatic participants (54.7%, 95% CI 47.7% to 61.6%; 50 evaluations; 40,956 samples, 2641 cases). Average sensitivity was higher in the first week after symptom onset (80.9%, 95% CI 76.9% to 84.4%; 30 evaluations, 2408 cases) than in the second week of symptoms (53.8%, 95% CI 48.0% to 59.6%; 40 evaluations, 1119 cases). For those who were asymptomatic at the time of testing, sensitivity was higher when an epidemiological exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2 was suspected (64.3%, 95% CI 54.6% to 73.0%; 16 evaluations; 7677 samples, 703 cases) compared to where COVID‐19 testing was reported to be widely available to anyone on presentation for testing (49.6%, 95% CI 42.1% to 57.1%; 26 evaluations; 31,904 samples, 1758 cases). Average specificity was similarly high for symptomatic (99.1%) or asymptomatic (99.7%) participants. 
We observed a steady decline in summary sensitivities as measures of sample viral load decreased. 
Sensitivity varied between brands. When tests were used according to manufacturer instructions, average sensitivities by brand ranged from 34.3% to 91.3% in symptomatic participants (20 assays with eligible data) and from 28.6% to 77.8% for asymptomatic participants (12 assays). For symptomatic participants, summary sensitivities for seven assays were 80% or more (meeting acceptable criteria set by the World Health Organization (WHO)). The WHO acceptable performance criterion of 97% specificity was met by 17 of 20 assays when tests were used according to manufacturer instructions, 12 of which demonstrated specificities above 99%. For asymptomatic participants the sensitivities of only two assays approached but did not meet WHO acceptable performance standards in one study each; specificities for asymptomatic participants were in a similar range to those observed for symptomatic people. 
At 5% prevalence using summary data in symptomatic people during the first week after symptom onset, the positive predictive value (PPV) of 89% means that 1 in 10 positive results will be a false positive, and around 1 in 5 cases will be missed. At 0.5% prevalence using summary data for asymptomatic people, where testing was widely available and where epidemiological exposure to COVID‐19 was suspected, resulting PPVs would be 38% to 52%, meaning that between 2 in 5 and 1 in 2 positive results will be false positives, and between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 cases will be missed. 
Authors' conclusions
Antigen tests vary in sensitivity. In people with signs and symptoms of COVID‐19, sensitivities are highest in the first week of illness when viral loads are higher. Assays that meet appropriate performance standards, such as those set by WHO, could replace laboratory‐based RT‐PCR when immediate decisions about patient care must be made, or where RT‐PCR cannot be delivered in a timely manner. However, they are more suitable for use as triage to RT‐PCR testing. The variable sensitivity of antigen tests means that people who test negative may still be infected. Many commercially available rapid antigen tests have not been evaluated in independent validation studies. 
Evidence for testing in asymptomatic cohorts has increased, however sensitivity is lower and there is a paucity of evidence for testing in different settings. Questions remain about the use of antigen test‐based repeat testing strategies. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of screening programmes at reducing transmission of infection, whether mass screening or targeted approaches including schools, healthcare setting and traveller screening. 
","1. Plain Title
How well do rapid COVID-19 antigen tests work?

2. Rationale
COVID-19 is an illness caused by a new virus. It can spread fast. Quick, easy tests can help find people who are sick. This can help slow the spread.

Lab tests like PCR are very good. But they can take time to give a result. Rapid antigen tests look for virus proteins. They can give a result soon after the sample is taken.

Many brands sell these rapid tests. We need to know how well they work. We also need to know how they work in people with signs of COVID-19 and in people with no signs. This review asked: Do rapid antigen tests find current infection well enough to guide care and public health?

3. Trial Design
This was not one trial of patients. The team pulled together results from many studies. These studies tested people once with a rapid antigen test. Most also did a lab PCR test to double check the result. Some studies did repeat rapid tests over time, but the main results are for one-time tests.

The search included studies up to 8 March 2021. The review included 155 study groups, from 166 reports. There were 152 single-test evaluations with 100,462 people. Of these, 16,822 had COVID-19 by the lab test. Studies took place mostly in Europe. They looked at 49 test brands. Only 23 studies compared more than one brand.

Who was in the studies? People with signs like cough or fever. People with no signs. Some had a known contact with someone with COVID-19. Others came for testing even without a known contact. The abstract did not report ages or gender.

Each person gave a sample one time in most studies. The rapid test result was compared to a lab test result. Nearly all studies used a single lab PCR result to say if someone had or did not have the virus.

4. Results
What do “how well” and “how accurate” mean here? One part is how often the test finds people who have the virus. Think of this as “finds the sick people.” Another part is how often the test is right for people who do not have the virus. Think of this as “gives a correct negative.”

Across studies, results varied a lot. In people with signs of COVID-19, the tests found about 7 in 10 people who had the virus. In people with no signs, the tests found about 5 in 10 people who had the virus.

Timing matters. In the first week after signs start, tests did better. They found about 8 in 10 people who had the virus. In the second week, they found about 5 in 10. The tests did better when there was more virus in the sample. They did worse when there was less virus.

Exposure matters too. Among people with no signs but with a known contact, tests found about 6 in 10 infected people. Where testing was open to many people without known contact, tests found about 5 in 10 infected people.

For people who did not have the virus, the tests were very good. About 99 in 100 people without the virus got a correct negative result. This was true for people with signs and for people with no signs.

Brand and use matter. When used as the maker said, brands in people with signs found from about 3 in 10 to about 9 in 10 infected people. In people with no signs, brands found from about 3 in 10 to about 8 in 10. For people with signs, seven brands found at least 8 in 10 infected people. The World Health Organization (WHO) says a good rapid test should find at least 8 in 10 infected people. The WHO also says a good test should give correct negatives in at least 97 in 100 people without the virus. Of 20 brands used as the maker said, 17 met this 97 in 100 rule. Twelve had 99 in 100 or more correct negatives.

What do these numbers mean for you? Picture a group where 5 in 100 people have COVID-19, and they are in their first week of signs. If they all take a rapid test, about 1 in 10 positive results will be false. Also, the test will miss about 1 in 5 people who do have COVID-19.

Now picture a group where 1 in 200 people have COVID-19, and most have no signs. If they all take a rapid test, between 2 in 5 and 1 in 2 positive results will be false. Also, the test will miss between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 infected people.

The review also found some limits in the studies. Many did not pick people in a way that fits real life use. Some did not use the test as the maker said. Many used only one lab test as the check. These limits can affect how sure we are about the results.

What did the authors say? Rapid antigen tests do not all work the same. They work best in the first week of signs. Some brands meet the WHO rules in people with signs. In places that need a fast result, these tests can guide care when a lab test is not ready in time. Still, the best way to be sure is to use the rapid test to decide who should get a lab PCR test next. A “negative” rapid test does not always mean “not infected,” especially with no signs or later in illness.

More research is needed. We need to know how well repeat testing works over time. We also need to know how well screening works in schools, hospitals, travel, and other places. Many brands still need independent checks.","How accurate are rapid antigen tests for diagnosing COVID‐19?
Key messages 
• Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID‐19, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected. 
• Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID‐19. 
• The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests. 
What are rapid point‐of‐care antigen tests for COVID‐19? 
Rapid point‐of‐care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID‐19 infection in people with or without COVID‐19 symptoms. They: 
• are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point‐of‐care) or in non‐healthcare settings such as in the home; 
• are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps; 
• are less expensive than standard laboratory tests;
• do not require a specialist operator or setting; and
• provide results ‘while you wait’.
For this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as ‘lateral flow tests’. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over‐the‐counter pregnancy tests. 
Why is this question important? 
People with suspected COVID‐19 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self‐isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID‐19 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT‐PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result. 
In many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID‐19 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID‐19, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point‐of‐care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID‐19 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID‐19 using RT‐PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms. 
What did we find? 
We included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID‐19 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe. 
Main results 
In people with confirmed COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID‐19 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID‐19 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). 
In people who did not have COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms. 
Different brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as ‘acceptable’ for confirming and ruling out COVID‐19 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID‐19. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms. 
Using summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID‐19: 
• 45 people would test positive for COVID‐19. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID‐19 (false positive result). 
• 955 people would test negative for COVID‐19. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID‐19 (false negative result). 
In people with no symptoms of COVID‐19 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID‐19 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID‐19: 
• 62 people would test positive for COVID‐19. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID‐19 (false positive result). 
• 9938 people would test negative for COVID‐19. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID‐19 (false negative result). 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
In general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers’ instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID‐19 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT‐PCR result as evidence of no COVID‐19 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms. 
What does this mean? 
In people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT‐PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT‐PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT‐PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self‐isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people ‐ individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected. 
Rapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID‐19. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non‐healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers’ instructions.

10.1002-14651858.CD013298.pub2,"Background
Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) are severe and potentially sight‐threatening allergic eye diseases characterised by chronic inflammation of the ocular surface. Both topical and systemic treatments are used. This Cochrane Review focuses on systemic treatments. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of systemic treatments (including corticosteroids, NSAIDS, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies), alone or in combination, compared to placebo or other systemic or topical treatment, for severe AKC and VKC in children and young people up to the age of 16 years. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. We last searched the electronic databases on 17 February 2020. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that involved systemic treatments in children aged up to 16 years with a clinical diagnosis of AKC or VKC. We planned to include studies that evaluated a single systemic medication versus placebo, and studies that compared two or multiple active treatments. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methods expected by Cochrane.

No trial met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane Review. No RCTs have been carried out on this topic. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently no evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the safety and efficacy of systemic treatments for VKC and AKC. Trials are required to test efficacy and safety of current and future treatments. Outcome measures need to be developed which can capture both objective clinical and patient‐reported aspects of the condition and treatments.

Do body‑wide drugs help severe allergic eye disease in kids? A careful review

Rationale
Some children have a severe eye allergy. Doctors call it AKC or VKC. It lasts a long time. It can harm sight over time. The eye stays red, sore, and swollen.

Eye drops can help some kids. But some kids still have bad flares. In these hard cases, doctors may try drugs that work through the whole body. These are pills or shots. They aim to calm the body’s defense system.

This review looked at those body‑wide drugs. These include steroid pills or shots (corticosteroids). These also include anti‑swelling drugs, called NSAIDs. There are drugs that shape the defense system (immunomodulators). There are lab‑made proteins that target parts of that system (monoclonal antibodies). The big hope was that these drugs might help when drops are not enough.

We need to know if these drugs are safe in kids. We also need to know if they work. Parents and doctors want clear, fair tests. That is why this study team did this review.

Trial Design
This was a Cochrane Review. That means the team looked for all fair tests on this topic. A fair test is a randomized trial. In these trials, chance picks what drug a child gets. Some kids get the drug. Some get a fake pill or shot, called a placebo. Or they get a different drug. This helps us know what really works and what does not.

The team set clear rules. They looked for trials in kids and teens up to age 16. The kids had to have AKC or VKC. The trials had to test a body‑wide drug. The drug could be used alone or with other care. The test could compare the drug to a placebo, to another body‑wide drug, or to eye drops.

The team searched many large study lists. They checked medical journals. They looked in trial registries. They did not limit by year or by language. Their last search date was February 17, 2020.

The goal was to find strong proof. They planned to check how well the drugs worked. They also planned to check side effects. They looked for both doctor‑seen signs and what kids felt and said. But the review found no trials that met the rules.

Results
The team did not find any randomized trials. None fit the set rules. So there is no strong proof yet. We do not know if these body‑wide drugs help kids with AKC or VKC. We also do not know how safe they are in this group.

What does this mean for families? Doctors do use these drugs at times. But we lack fair test data in kids for these eye diseases. We cannot say which drug helps most. We cannot say how big the benefit is. We cannot say how big the risk is. Choices must weigh the unknowns.

This review shows a clear gap. We need good trials in children and teens. Trials should be fair and clear. Chance should pick who gets which care. Trials should track what the doctor sees in the eye. Trials should also track what kids feel, like pain, itch, and light hurt. That will show what matters day to day.

Future work should also agree on the main things to track. These are called outcomes. They should be easy to measure and use. They should include eye health and how kids feel and live. This will help compare drugs across trials.

In short, this careful review looked for proof. It did not find any trials to guide us. We cannot claim benefit or safety for body‑wide drugs in these kids yet. New trials are needed to test these drugs the right way. Until then, care teams must use the best judgment for each child.

This review helps the field. It shows where to aim next. It calls for strong, child‑safe trials. It calls for clear and shared ways to track results. The goal is simple: protect sight and ease daily life for kids with severe eye allergy.","What medicines, taken by mouth or given as an injection, work best to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people under 16 years old? 
What is allergic eye disease? An immune response is how the body recognises and defends itself against substances that appear harmful, usually by producing specific blood proteins (antibodies) against them. An allergy is a reaction by the body's immune system to a particular substance (an allergen) that is usually harmless, such as grass or tree pollens in the air. Different allergens affect different tissues, and their effects can be mild or serious. 
In the eye, allergic reactions can cause conjunctivitis: the conjunctiva (the tissue covering the white of the eye and lining the inside of the eyelids) becomes swollen and sore. Severe allergic eye disease may also affect the cornea (the clear, front part of the eye), causing keratoconjunctivitis. 
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) are rare types of severe allergic eye disease. VKC usually develops in children and is more common in boys; AKC can affect children and adults. These conditions usually affect both eyes and make them red, itchy, sore, watery and sensitive to light. Both conditions can damage the cornea, which can affect eyesight and lead to blindness. Treatment is essential to save eyesight. 
Treatments for severe allergic eye disease Both conditions are treated with medicines that try to block the allergic reaction and reduce swelling. Symptoms may get better with medicines given as eye drops, but if these don't work, other medicines may be taken by mouth or given as an injection (systemic medicines). Systemic medicines that are often used to treat severe allergic eye disease include ones that target or suppress the immune response, such as anti‑inflammatory medicines and antibodies. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review We wanted to find out which systemic treatments work best for severe allergic eye disease in children and young people. 
What did we do?We searched for studies that looked at systemic medicines to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people under 16 years of age. We wanted to find studies that compared a single medicine with a placebo (dummy) medicine, or studies that compared two or more medicines against each other. 
We looked for randomised controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
Search date: We searched for evidence published up to 17 February 2020. 
What we foundWe found no randomised controlled studies in children and young people with severe allergic eye disease treated by systemic medicines. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence from randomised controlled studies about how well systemic medicines work for severe allergic eye disease in children and young people aged under 16 years. 
Research is needed to investigate how well systemic medicines work to treat severe allergic eye disease in children and young people, and to learn about any unwanted effects these medicines might cause.

Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is a type of eye movement disorder that can negatively impact vision. Currently, INS cannot be cured, but its effects can potentially be treated pharmacologically, optically, or surgically. This review focuses on the surgical interventions for INS. 
Despite the range of surgical interventions available, and currently applied in practice for the management of INS, there is no clear consensus, and no accepted clinical guidelines regarding the relative efficacy and safety of the various treatment options. A better understanding of these surgical options, along with their associated side effects, will assist clinicians in evidence‐based decision‐making in relation to the management of INS. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions for INS.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to 3 July 2020, with no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying the efficacy and safety of surgical options for treating INS. 
Data collection and analysis
Our prespecified outcome measures were the change from baseline in: binocular best‐corrected distance visual acuity; head posture; amplitude, frequency, intensity, and foveation period durations of the nystagmus waveform; visual recognition times; quality of life and self‐reported outcome measures; incidence of adverse effects with a probable causal link to treatment; and permanent adverse effects after surgery. 
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full‐text articles, extracted data from eligible RCTs, and judged the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. We reached consensus on any disagreements by discussion. We summarised the overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We only identified one eligible RCT (N = 10 participants), undertaken in India. This trial randomised participants to receive either a large retro‐equatorial recession of the horizontal rectus muscle of 9 mm on the medial rectus and 12 mm on the lateral rectus, or a simple tenotomy and resuturing of the four horizontal rectus muscles. We did not identify any RCTs comparing a surgical intervention for INS relative to no treatment. 
In the single eligible RCT, both eyes of each participant received the same intervention. The participants’ age and gender were not reported, nor was information on whether participants were idiopathic or had sensory disorders. The study only included participants with null in primary position and did not explicitly exclude those with congenital periodic alternating nystagmus. The study did not report funding source(s) or author declaration of interests. The evaluation period was six months. 
We judged this study at low risk for sequence generation and other sources of bias, but at high risk of bias for performance and detection bias. The risk of bias was unclear for selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. 
There is very uncertain evidence about the effect of the interventions on visual acuity and change in amplitude, frequency, and intensity of the nystagmus waveform. We were unable to calculate relative effects due to lack of data. None of the participants in either intervention group reported adverse effects at six‐month follow‐up (very low‐certainty evidence). There was no quantitative data reported for quality of life, although the study reported an improvement in quality of life after surgery in both intervention groups (very low‐certainty evidence). 
Change in head posture, foveation period durations of the nystagmus waveform, visual recognition times, and permanent adverse effects after surgery were not reported in the included study. 
We judged the certainty of the evidence, for both the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes, to be very low. Due to a lack of comprehensive reporting of adverse events, there was also very low‐certainty of the safety profile of the evaluated surgical interventions in this population. As such, we are very uncertain about the relative efficacy and safety of these interventions for the surgical management of INS. 
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review identified minimal high‐quality evidence relating to the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions for INS. The limited availability of evidence must be considered by clinicians when treating INS, particularly given these procedures are irreversible and often performed on children. More high‐quality RCTs are needed to better understand the efficacy and safety profile of surgical interventions for INS. This will assist clinicians, people with INS, and their parents or caregivers to make evidence‐based treatment decisions.

What we know now about eye muscle surgery for infant eye shake

Rationale
Infantile nystagmus syndrome, or INS, starts at birth or soon after. The eyes move back and forth on their own. This fast shake can blur sight. Some people also turn or tilt the head to see better.

INS has no cure yet. But care may help. Care may use glasses, drops or pills, or surgery on the eye muscles. Doctors do not agree on the best surgery. There are no clear care rules to guide them.

This study asked two main things. First, does eye muscle surgery help sight and daily life? Second, is it safe? This work is key. These surgeries cannot be undone. Doctors often use them on kids. The hope is that surgery may calm the eye shake. It may help the eyes hold a steady view.

Trial Design
This was a “systematic review.” That means the team looked for all good trials on this topic. They searched many medical lists up to July 2020. They looked for trials that put people into groups by chance. These trials are called randomized trials.

The team found only one trial that fit the plan. This trial took place in India. Ten people took part. The trial did not name the age or sex of the people. It did not say if their INS had a known cause. All had the least eye shake when they looked straight ahead.

The trial compared two types of eye muscle surgery. In one group, the surgeon moved two side eye muscles back. One muscle moved back 9 millimeters. The other moved back 12 millimeters. In the other group, the surgeon cut and then sewed back all four side muscles. Both eyes got the same type of surgery in each person.

People were in the trial for six months. The trial did not say who paid for the work. It also did not list if the authors had any ties that could sway the work.

Results
The review could not tell which surgery worked better. The trial was small. It gave few numbers. The team could not tell if sight got better. They also could not tell if the eye shake got smaller or slower.

No one in either group had side effects during the six months. But the trial was small. It did not report all harms. So we still do not know the full risk of these surgeries.

The trial did not report some key things. It did not say if head turn or head tilt changed. It did not say how long the eyes could stay steady. It did not say how fast people could spot and name things. It did not report any long term harms after six months.

The trial did say that life quality got better in both groups. But it did not share numbers. It did not use a named score we can check. So we cannot judge how big that change was.

How the trial was done also had some limits. People and staff knew which surgery they had. That can change what they say and how they test sight. Some parts of the plan were not clear. Some data may be missing. These issues can make the results less sure.

This review also found no trials that compared surgery to no surgery. So we do not know if any surgery helps more than no surgery at all. We also do not know which surgery is safer or works better than the other.

What does this mean for patients and families? Based on this review, we have very little strong proof. We are very unsure if these surgeries help sight. We are very unsure if they lower the eye shake in a clear way. We are also very unsure about the harms. This gap in proof matters. These surgeries cannot be undone. Doctors often do them in kids.

What should happen next? We need more and better trials. These trials should put people into groups by chance. They should be bigger than ten people. They should last longer than six months. They should report who took part, like age and sex. They should measure sight, head turn, daily life, and harms. They should share clear numbers so we can compare results.

Until we have that proof, doctors and families must weigh choices with care. They should talk about the weak proof base. They should talk about the fact that surgery is not reversible. They should also talk about other choices, like glasses or drugs. Shared choice can help each person pick the care that fits their needs.","What are the benefits and risks of different surgical procedures for infantile nystagmus syndrome (an eye disorder that develops shortly after birth)? 
Why is this question important?Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is an eye disorder that causes involuntary movement of the eyes from side to side, up and down, or in circles. INS typically develops shortly after birth, and persists throughout life. It is often associated with visual problems, such as:‐ long‐sightedness (when people can see distant objects clearly, but near objects appear blurred);‐ or short‐sightedness (when people can see near objects clearly, but distant objects appear blurred). 
There is currently no cure for INS. However, it is possible to reduce eye movement and improve people’s vision. One of the main options is eye surgery, which involves operating on the muscles that control eye movement. Several different surgical procedures can be used: some procedures involve detaching and reattaching the eye muscles, whereas others require complete removal of these muscles.   
It is unclear whether some surgical procedures for INS have more benefits or risks than others. To find out which surgical procedures work best, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. We were particularly interested in whether different surgical procedures could improve vision and quality of life in people with INS. We also wanted to know about any adverse (unwanted) effects. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?First, we searched for randomised controlled studies, in which people were randomly divided into two or more treatment groups. This makes it less likely that any differences between treatment effects were actually due to differences in the people who received them (rather than due to the treatments themselves, which is what we wanted to find out). 
We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find?We found one study, set in India, that involved a total of 10 people with INS who were followed for six months after surgery. The study authors did not report any information about: ‐ the age and gender of the people who took part in it;‐ or the source of funding for the study. 
The study compared two different surgical procedures: ‐ one procedure in which two horizontal rectus muscles (eye muscles that control side‐to‐side eye movements) were moved from their original position to a position further back on the eyeball; and‐ another procedure in which four horizontal rectus muscles were detached and reattached, in their original position.The procedures were conducted in both eyes. 
The study compared the effects of the treatments on:‐ clarity of vision six months after surgery;‐ intensity of eye movement six months after surgery;‐ adverse events six months after surgery; and‐ quality of life.   
The study did not investigate the effects of treatments on:‐ head posture;‐ the amount of time when the eye is still; or‐ the time it takes to recognise objects. 
We have very little confidence in the evidence from the study we found, because:‐ it is based on a very small number of people; and‐ the patients and researchers in the study knew which type of surgery each patient received. This knowledge may have influenced the study results. 
We therefore cannot determine whether the two procedures investigated in the study had different benefits and risks. 
What does this mean?There is insufficient evidence to determine whether some surgical procedures are better than others for INS. We need researchers to conduct robust randomised controlled trials in future, so that we can compare different procedures. This would help clinicians, and people with INS, to make treatment decisions based on evidence from research. 
How‐up‐to date is this review?The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to July 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD009134.pub2,"Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure following upper abdominal surgery 
Review question 
The goal of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel NPPV) compared with oxygen therapy alone in adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. 
Background 
Acute respiratory failure , where fluid builds up in the lungs stopping oxygen from crossing into the blood, is a relatively common complication after abdominal surgery and can increase the risk of dying (mortality). 
NPPV is a type of treatment that helps to improve breathing without having to insert a tube inside a person's windpipe (tracheal intubation). This intervention is effective in several illnesses. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the treatment of adults with acute respiratory failure following abdominal surgery. The trials compared NPPV with usual care(oxygen therapy through a face mask). We included two trials involving 269 participants.The participants were mostly men (67%) and on average 65 years of age. One trial was conducted in several intensive care units (ICU). Both trials included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. The evidence is current to May 2015. 
Key results 
This review examined mortality, rate of tracheal intubation, length of stay in the ICU, length of hospital stay, complications after NPPV, and changes in the levels of gases within the blood (arterial blood gases). 
Compared with oxygen therapy, NPPV decreased the rate of tracheal intubation. Out of every 1000 adults who developed acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery, 181 adults treated with oxygen therapy would need to be intubated compared with 54 adults treated with NPPV. 
When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV tended to reduce mortality. However, since the number of participants included in the two trials was small, more studies are needed. 
The use of NPPV also reduced the length of stay in the ICU by almost two days when compared to oxygen therapy. However, the mean length of stay in the hospital was similar in the two groups. 
When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV improved blood gas levels one hour after the intervention. 
There was insufficient evidence to be certain that CPAP or NPPV had an effect on anastomotic (e.g. where two pieces of intestine are joined together) leakage, pneumonia related complications and sepsis (blood poisoning) or infections. However, adults treated with NPPV had lower rates these complications than adults treated with oxygen. 
Quality of the evidence 
There was low quality evidence for hospital mortality, low quality of evidence for rate of tracheal intubation, and very low quality of evidence for ICU length of stay. 
Authors' conclusions 
The findings of this review showed that NPPV is an effective and safe treatment for adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. However, due to the low quality of the evidence, more good quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Breathing Support After Upper Belly Surgery: Mask Air Help vs Oxygen Alone

Rationale
Some people have trouble breathing after upper belly surgery. Fluid can get in the lungs. Then oxygen has a hard time getting into the blood. This can raise the risk of death.

Doctors often give oxygen by a face mask. But this may not be enough for some people. Some then need a breathing tube in the windpipe. A tube can help, but it also has risks.

A mask air method can help. It is called noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, or NPPV. It pushes air into the lungs through a tight mask. No tube goes into the windpipe.

Two types of NPPV are common. One is called CPAP. One is called bilevel. Both use a mask to help air move in and out.

The team wanted to test a key idea. They asked if NPPV helps more than oxygen alone. They also asked if NPPV is safe after this type of surgery. They looked for clear facts to guide care.

This study was needed to guide doctors and patients. The hope was to avoid a breathing tube. The hope was also to improve oxygen in the blood. The team asked if NPPV could shorten time in the intensive care unit.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team searched medical databases. They looked for trials of adults after upper belly surgery. All people had sudden breathing failure.

Sudden breathing failure means your lungs do not work well. Fluid can fill air sacs. That makes blood oxygen low. It can be life threatening.

The trials compared two treatments. One group got oxygen by a face mask. The other group got NPPV by a tight mask. The team then compared results.

The review found two trials. Together they had 269 adults. About two in three were men. The average age was 65 years.

All people were adults after upper belly surgery. All had new trouble with breathing. One trial took place in several intensive care units. An intensive care unit, or ICU, is a special hospital unit.

The review looked at many outcomes. These included death, need for a breathing tube, and time in the ICU. It also looked at time in the hospital and blood oxygen levels.

The review did not tell how long each person was in a trial. But it did report ICU time. It also reported hospital time. It said the evidence was current to May of 2015.

Results
NPPV lowered the need for a breathing tube. Out of 1000 people on oxygen, 181 needed a tube. Out of 1000 people on NPPV, 54 needed a tube. That is a clear drop.

NPPV may also lower the risk of death. The trials showed a trend toward fewer deaths. But the number of people was small. We need more good trials to be sure.

NPPV cut time in the ICU. People on NPPV spent almost two days less there. Time in the hospital was about the same in both groups. This means total hospital time did not change.

NPPV improved blood gas levels at one hour. Blood gases measure oxygen and carbon dioxide. Better levels mean better breathing support. This is a good early sign.

The team also looked at harms. These include leaks where bowel ends join. Doctors call that an anastomotic leak. They also looked at lung infection and blood infection.

There was not enough proof to be sure about these harms. But the NPPV group had lower rates of these problems. This is a hopeful sign. We still need stronger proof.

The review said NPPV was safe in these trials. No major new safety risks were found. This supports use in the right patients. Trained staff should guide its use.

The quality of the proof was low to very low. This means we have limits in what we can claim. The trials were few and small. We need more and better trials.

What does this mean for patients? NPPV can help you breathe without a tube. It can lower the chance you will need a tube. It can help you leave the ICU sooner.

Talk with your care team if you face this problem. Ask if NPPV is right for you. It can be a safe choice after upper belly surgery. It may help you heal and feel better.

In short, NPPV helped more than oxygen alone. It lowered the need for a breathing tube. It improved blood oxygen early. It cut time in the ICU.

But we still need more strong studies. New trials should confirm these results. They should also track safety in detail. This will help guide future care.","Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure following upper abdominal surgery

10.1002-14651858.CD013217.pub2,"Background
The prevalence of substance use, both prescribed and non‐prescribed, is increasing in many areas of the world. Substance use by women of childbearing age contributes to increasing rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is a newer term describing the subset of NAS related to opioid exposure. Non‐pharmacological care is the first‐line treatment for substance withdrawal in newborns. Despite the widespread use of non‐pharmacological care to mitigate symptoms of NAS, there is not an established definition of, and standard for, non‐pharmacological care practices in this population. Evaluation of safety and efficacy of non‐pharmacological practices could provide clear guidance for clinical practice. 
Objectives
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of non‐pharmacological treatment of infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal on the length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment for symptom management. 
Comparison 1: in infants at risk for, or having early symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal, does non‐pharmacological treatment reduce the length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment? 
Comparison 2: in infants receiving pharmacological treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, does concurrent non‐pharmacological treatment reduce duration of pharmacological treatment, maximum and cumulative doses of opioid medication, and length of hospitalization? 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search CENTRAL (2019, Issue 10); Ovid MEDLINE; and CINAHL on 11 October 2019. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster trials. 
Selection criteria
We included trials comparing single or bundled non‐pharmacological interventions to no non‐pharmacological treatment or different single or bundled non‐pharmacological interventions. We assessed non‐pharmacological interventions independently and in combination based on sufficient similarity in population, intervention, and comparison groups studied. We categorized non‐pharmacological interventions as: modifying environmental stimulation, feeding practices, and support of the mother‐infant dyad. We presented non‐randomized studies identified in the search process narratively. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes in infants at risk for, or having early symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal included length of hospitalization and pharmacological treatment with one or more doses of opioid or sedative medication. Primary outcomes in infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal included length of hospitalization, length of pharmacological treatment with opioid or sedative medication, and maximum and cumulative doses of opioid medication. 
Main results
We identified six RCTs (353 infants) in which infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal participated between 1975 and 2018. We identified no RCTs in which infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal participated. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low to low. We also identified and excluded 34 non‐randomized studies published between 2005 and 2018, including 29 in which infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal participated and five in which infants receiving opioid treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal participated. We identified seven preregistered interventional clinical trials that may qualify for inclusion at review update when complete. 
Of the six RCTs, four studies assessed modifying environmental stimulation in the form of a mechanical rocking bed, prone positioning, non‐oscillating waterbed, or a low‐stimulation nursery; one study assessed feeding practices (comparing 24 kcal/oz to 20 kcal/oz formula); and one study assessed support of the maternal‐infant dyad (tailored breastfeeding support). 
There was no evidence of a difference in length of hospitalization in the one study that assessed modifying environmental stimulation (mean difference [MD) –1 day, 95% confidence interval [CI) –2.82 to 0.82; 30 infants; very low‐certainty evidence) and the one study of support of the maternal‐infant dyad (MD –8.9 days, 95% CI –19.84 to 2.04; 14 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). No studies of feeding practices evaluated the length of hospitalization. 
There was no evidence of a difference in use of pharmacological treatment in three studies of modifying environmental stimulation (typical risk ratio [RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; 92 infants; low‐certainty evidence), one study of feeding practices (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.33; 49 infants; very low‐certainty evidence), and one study of support of the maternal‐infant dyad (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.90; 14 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Reported secondary outcomes included neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, days to regain birth weight, and weight nadir. One study of support of the maternal‐infant dyad reported NICU admission (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.90; 14 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). One study of feeding practices reported days to regain birth weight (MD 1.10 days, 95% CI 2.76 to 0.56; 46 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). One study that assessed modifying environmental stimulation reported weight nadir (MD –0.28, 95% CI –1.15 to 0.59; 194 infants; very low‐certainty evidence) and one study of feeding practices reported weight nadir (MD –0.8, 95% CI –2.24 to 0.64; 46 infants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns affects important clinical outcomes including length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment based on the six included studies. The outcomes identified for this review were of very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence. Combined analysis was limited by heterogeneity in study design and intervention definitions as well as the number of studies. Many prespecified outcomes were not reported. Although caregivers are encouraged by experts to optimize non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns prior to initiating pharmacological care, we do not have sufficient evidence to inform specific clinical practices. Larger well‐designed studies are needed to determine the effect of non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns.

Non-drug care for newborn opioid withdrawal: what we know so far

Rationale
Some newborns face opioid withdrawal after birth. This can happen when the mother used opioids during pregnancy. Opioids are strong pain drugs. Street drugs like heroin are opioids too. Withdrawal can make babies shake, cry hard, and sleep poor.

More women of childbearing age now use opioids. More babies face this problem as a result. Doctors call this newborn opioid withdrawal syndrome. Some people also say neonatal abstinence syndrome. Both mean the baby has signs of withdrawal.

Care without drugs is the first step. This care can include a quiet, dim room. It can include swaddling, gentle holding, skin-to-skin time, and help with feeds. It may also mean rooming-in with the mother. These steps can calm the baby. They may cut the need for medicine.

But there is no one set way to do this care. The steps can vary by hospital. Families and nurses want clear advice. This study asked if non-drug care is safe and helps. The main idea was that it might shorten the hospital stay. It might also lower the need for opioid medicine for the baby.

Trial Design
This was a review of “fair tests.” In these tests, chance decides the care group. This helps make the groups alike. It lets us compare the care steps in a fair way.

The team searched many medical libraries. They also checked trial lists for new studies. The last search date was October 11, 2019. They looked for trials in newborns at risk for, or with early signs of, opioid withdrawal.

They grouped non-drug care into three types. One type changed the baby’s space. That means a rocking bed, a waterbed, lying on the tummy, or a quiet nursery. One type changed feeding. This compared higher calorie formula to standard formula. One type helped the mother and baby as a pair. This meant help to breastfeed.

They found six small trials. These trials took place from 1975 to 2018. In all, 353 babies took part. All were newborns. Some had early signs of withdrawal. Some were at risk for it. The trials took place in the birth hospital. They also looked for trials in babies already on drug treatment. They found none.

What about how long each baby was in a trial? The trials looked at the time in the hospital. The abstract did not give more on the time in a trial. The team also found many other study types. Those were not fair tests. The team did not mix those with the trials.

Results
The review looked at two main things. One was how long the baby stayed in the hospital. The other was if the baby needed drug treatment for signs of withdrawal.

On hospital stay, there was no clear change. One study changed the baby’s space. One study gave help to breastfeed. In both, the time in the hospital did not clearly get shorter or longer. The feeding study did not report hospital stay.

On drug use, there was no clear change. Three studies changed the baby’s space. One study changed feeds. One study helped the mother and baby as a pair. In all of these, the chance a baby needed drug treatment did not clearly go up or down.

The trials also looked at other things. One was if the baby went to the NICU. The NICU is a unit for very sick babies. One study with breastfeeding help looked at this. It did not show a clear change. Two studies looked at weight. One asked how many days to get back to birth weight. One asked about the lowest weight after birth. These did not show clear changes.

What do these results mean for families? These small trials did not prove that non-drug care helps. They did not prove harm either. The results do not let us be sure. Why? The trials were few and small. The care steps were not the same across trials. Many results we care about were not told. The strength of the proof was low to very low.

Still, non-drug care may help comfort the baby. It may help bonding of mother and baby. Many experts still start with non-drug care before they use medicine. But we do not yet know the best mix of steps. We also do not know the best way to do them.

This review matters a lot. More babies now face withdrawal. Families and nurses need clear, shared rules for care. We need larger, well done trials to guide care. We need the same words and steps across studies. Seven new trials were on record and may add to this.

In short, here is what we know. Non-drug care is common and may be helpful. But small trials so far do not show clear gains. We cannot claim it shortens hospital stay. We cannot claim it cuts drug use. We need better proof. Until then, teams can still give kind, calm care. They can watch the baby close. They can add medicine if needed. Larger studies will help us learn what works best.","Non‐pharmacological care for opioid withdrawal in newborns
Review question 
Do one or more specific non‐pharmacological (treatments other than medicines) care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth? 
Background 
Newborns of mothers who take opioids during pregnancy often experience symptoms of withdrawal after delivery, such as high‐pitched cry, tremors, and high tone. Non‐pharmacological care is the first treatment for symptoms of withdrawal. If symptoms worsen despite non‐pharmacological care, a medication such as morphine, methadone, or buprenorphine is the second treatment to reduce symptoms. Though non‐pharmacological care is the first approach to symptom management, it is not the same at every hospital. We wanted to discover whether one or more non‐pharmacological care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth. 
Study characteristics 
We looked at randomized controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of opioid‐exposed newborns treated with one or more non‐pharmacological care practice. Non‐pharmacological care practices include changes to the environment to reduce stimulation or provide soothing, changes to feeding frequency or type, changes that increase maternal care of the newborn or maternal wellness, and multiple changes such as occur in a new site or system of care. Search is up to date as of October 2019. 
Key results 
This review included six RCTs that enrolled 353 opioid‐exposed newborns. The studies were published between 1975 and 2018. We also identified seven ongoing studies that may qualify for inclusion at review update when complete. 
Of the six RCTs, four assessed changes to the environment to reduce stimulation or provide soothing. These studies examined the effect of a mechanical rocking bed, prone positioning (lying on tummy), non‐oscillating waterbed, and a low‐stimulation nursery. We are uncertain whether modifying environmental stimulation is associated with length of hospitalization based on one study with 30 infants. Modifying environmental stimulation may be associated with little or no difference in use of pharmacological treatment based on three studies with 92 infants. We are uncertain whether modifying environmental stimulation is associated with weight nadir (lowest weight recorded during birth hospitalization) based on one study with 194 infants. 
One study assessed a change to the feeding type comparing higher‐calorie formula to standard‐calorie formula. We are uncertain whether feeding practices are associated with use of medicines, days to regain birth weight, or weight nadir based on one study with 46 infants. 
One study assessed changes to support the mother with tailored breastfeeding support. We are uncertain whether support of the mother‐infant dyad is associated with length of hospitalization, use of medicines, or neonatal intensive care unit admission based on one study with 14 infants. 
Many potential important effects were not reported, and others were not reported in all studies. 
Quality of evidence 
We are uncertain whether one or more specific non‐pharmacological care practices benefit newborns with opioid withdrawal after birth. The quality of evidence for all outcomes is very low to low and provides limited information to inform individual non‐pharmacological care practices or combinations of non‐pharmacological care practices.

10.1002-14651858.CD013757.pub2,"Background
Respiratory viruses are the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and hospitalisation in infants and young children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main infectious agent in this population. Palivizumab is administered intramuscularly every month during five months in the first RSV season to prevent serious RSV LRTI in children. Given its high cost, it is essential to know if palivizumab continues to be effective in preventing severe RSV disease in children. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of palivizumab for preventing severe RSV infection in children.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, three other databases and two trials registers to 14 October 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We searched Embase to October 2020, as we did not have access to this database for 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐RCTs, comparing palivizumab given at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a month (maximum five doses) with placebo, no intervention or standard care in children 0 to 24 months of age from both genders, regardless of RSV infection history.  
Data collection and analysis
We used Cochrane’s Screen4Me workflow to help assess the search results. Two review authors screened studies for selection, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. The primary outcomes were hospitalisation due to RSV infection, all‐cause mortality and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were hospitalisation due to respiratory‐related illness, length of hospital stay, RSV infection, number of wheezing days, days of supplemental oxygen, intensive care unit length of stay and mechanical ventilation days. 
Main results
We included five studies with  a total of 3343 participants. All studies were parallel RCTs, assessing the effects of 15 mg/kg of palivizumab every month up to five months compared to placebo or no intervention in an outpatient setting, although one study also included hospitalised infants. Most of the included studies were conducted in children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities like bronchopulmonary dysplasia and congenital heart disease. The risk of bias of outcomes across all studies was similar and predominately low.  
Palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection at two years' follow‐up (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.64; 5 studies, 3343 participants; high certainty evidence). Based on 98 hospitalisations per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 (29 to 62) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in mortality at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.15; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 (10 to 27) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in adverse events at 150 days' follow‐up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.39; 3 studies, 2831 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Based on 84 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 91 (71 to 117) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory‐related illness at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.97; 5 studies, 3343 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Palivizumab may result in a large reduction in RSV infection at two years' follow‐up (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55; 3 studies, 554 participants; low certainty evidence). Based on 195 cases of RSV infection per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 64 (39 to 107) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days at one year's follow‐up (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.44; 1 study, 429 participants; high certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence suggests that prophylaxis with palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection and results in little to no difference in mortality or adverse events. Moreover, palivizumab results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory‐related illness and may result in a large reduction in RSV infections. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days. These results may be applicable to children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities. 
Further research is needed to establish the effect of palivizumab on children with other comorbidities known as risk factors for severe RSV disease (e.g. immune deficiencies) and other social determinants of the disease, including children living in low‐ and middle‐income countries, tropical regions, children lacking breastfeeding, living in poverty, or members of families in overcrowded situations.

Do monthly palivizumab shots help high‑risk babies avoid RSV hospital stays?

Rationale
RSV is a germ that causes bad colds in babies. It can move into the lungs and small airways. This can lead to hard breathing and wheeze. Many babies and young kids need the hospital for this.

Some babies have a higher risk. This is true for babies born early. It is also true for babies with long‑term lung or heart problems. For these babies, RSV can be very serious.

Palivizumab is a lab‑made antibody. It is a shot in the muscle. Babies get one shot each month for up to five months. This may help the body block RSV. But the shot costs a lot. We need to know if it works well and is safe. This study set out to test that.

Trial Design
This report looked at past studies. In each study, babies were put into groups by chance. Some got palivizumab shots. Others got a dummy shot or no shot. This helps make a fair test.

The dose was based on weight. It was 15 milligrams for each kilogram. Babies could get up to five monthly shots. Most babies were seen in clinics. One study also had babies in the hospital.

The babies were from birth to age two years. Boys and girls were both in the studies. Many babies had high risk for RSV. This was due to lung or heart problems. Researchers then watched the babies for up to two years.

The team looked at key health events. These were RSV hospital stays. Death from any cause. Side effects. They also looked at other things. These were any breathing hospital stays. RSV infections. Days with wheeze. Days on oxygen. Time in the ICU. Days on a breathing machine.

Results
Five studies were found. They had 3343 babies in total. The studies were well run and careful.

RSV hospital stays went down with the shot. Out of 1000 babies without the shot, about 98 went to the hospital for RSV. Out of 1000 babies with the shot, about 43 went to the hospital. That means about 55 fewer babies in 1000 needed the hospital for RSV. We feel very sure about this result.

Deaths did not change much. Out of 1000 babies without the shot, about 23 died. Out of 1000 babies with the shot, about 16 died. This small gap may be due to chance. We feel fairly sure about this.

Side effects were about the same in both groups. Out of 1000 babies without the shot, about 84 had a side effect. Out of 1000 babies with the shot, about 91 had a side effect. These side effects were counted over about five months. We feel fairly sure about this.

There was a small drop in other breathing hospital stays. This means fewer hospital stays for lung or airway problems of any kind. The drop was not large. We feel fairly sure about this.

RSV infections also went down. Out of 1000 babies without the shot, about 195 got RSV. Out of 1000 babies with the shot, about 64 got RSV. That means about 131 fewer babies in 1000 got RSV. We are less sure about this result. Fewer babies were in these studies, so there is more doubt.

Days with wheeze went down a lot in one study. Wheeze means a whistling sound when a baby breathes. Fewer wheeze days can mean less trouble breathing. We feel very sure about this single study.

The studies also looked at oxygen use, ICU time, and breathing machine time. The results for these were not the main focus. The report does not list simple numbers for them here.

What does this mean for families? For high‑risk babies, the shot lowers RSV hospital stays. It likely does not change the chance of death. It seems to have side effects close to the same as no shot. It may also lower RSV infections and wheeze days.

Who do these results fit best? Most babies in the studies had a high risk of bad RSV. Many had long‑term lung or heart disease. So these results fit best for babies like that. We do not know as much for other groups.

We need more studies in other settings. This includes babies with weak immune systems. It includes babies in low‑ or middle‑income places. It includes babies in the tropics. It also includes babies who do not breastfeed. It includes babies who live in crowded homes or in poverty.

In short, monthly palivizumab shots help keep many high‑risk babies out of the hospital for RSV. The shots seem safe. The effect on death is small to none. More work can show how well this helps other babies and in other places.","Palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus infection prevention in children
Review question 
What are the effects (benefits and harms) of palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children? 
Background 
RSV is the main cause of acute respiratory infections in children, mainly during the first year of life, accounting for 33.1 million infections a year with an estimated 90.6% of these episodes occurring in low‐ and middle‐income countries. These infections may present with a runny nose, fever, cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, or difficulty feeding. They may result in hospitalisation, admission to an intensive care unit, and even death, in particular amongst infants aged less than two months, with an estimated hospitalisation rate of 1970 per 100,000 population and 59,600 deaths annually worldwide in children younger than five years old. They may also lead to long‐term complications such as recurrent wheezing and chronic lung problems.  
Palivizumab, sold under the brand name Synagis, is a drug administered with an intramuscular injection every month up to five doses to prevent serious infections in children at high risk for severe disease. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 14 October 2021.
Study characteristics 
We included five studies with 3343 participants. All studies included a small number of participants, including children with a high risk of adverse outcomes if infected with RSV due to underlying health issues, such as premature birth or heart or pulmonary problems.    
Study funding sources 
Most studies did not specify their funding sources. One study was funded by Abbott Laboratories and by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development.  
Key results 
Palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection by 56%; based on 98 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no difference in mortality, and little to no difference in adverse events; based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants and 84 adverse events per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 deaths per 1000 participants and 81  adverse events per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory illness by 22% but may result in little to no difference in length of hospital stay. It may reduce RSV infection rate by 67% at two years’ follow‐up. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days by 61% but may result in little to no difference in days using oxygen, length of stay in the intensive care unit, or mechanical ventilation days.  
Certainty of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the evidence was moderate to high.

10.1002-14651858.CD012204.pub2,"Dipeptidyl‐peptidase (DPP)‐4 inhibitors and glucagon‐like peptide (GLP)‐1 analogues for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
Review question 
Are the glucose‐lowering medicines, DPP‐4 inhibitors (e.g. linagliptin or vildagliptin) and GLP‐1 analogues (e.g. exenatide or liraglutide) able to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes and its associated complications in people at risk for the development of type 2 diabetes? 
Background 
DPP‐4 inhibitors and GLP‐1 analogues are widely used to treat people with type 2 diabetes. People with moderately elevated blood glucose are said to be at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (often referred to as 'prediabetes'). It is currently not known whether DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues should be prescribed for people with raised blood glucose levels who do not have type 2 diabetes. We wanted to find out whether these medicines could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people at increased risk. We also wanted to know the effects on patient‐important outcomes such as complications of diabetes (e.g. kidney and eye disease, heart attacks, strokes), death from any cause, health‐related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health) and side effects of the medicines. 
Study characteristics 
Participants had to have blood glucose levels higher than considered normal, but below the glucose levels that are used to diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found seven randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 2702 participants. The duration of the treatments varied from 12 weeks to 160 weeks. One study investigating liraglutide dominated the evidence (2285/2702 participants). The participants in this study were overweight or obese. 
This evidence is up to date as of January 2017.
Key results 
DPP‐4 inhibitors did not reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with placebo (a dummy medicine). In the big study investigating the GLP‐1‐analogue liraglutide, given in a dose used for obese people (3.0 mg), the development of type 2 diabetes was delayed: 26/1472 (1.8%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 46/738 (6.2%) participants randomised to placebo developed type 2 diabetes after 160 weeks. On the other side, 970/1472 (66%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 268/738 (36%) participants randomised to placebo switched back to normal glucose levels. This study was extended for another 12 weeks without treatment and five additional participants developed diabetes in the liraglutide group, compared with one participant in the placebo group. After the 12 weeks without treatment, 740/1472 (50%) participants in the liraglutide group compared with 263/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group had glucose levels considered as normal. This means that to keep chances high to prevent type 2 diabetes in people at risk one probably needs to continuously take this drug. Of note, serious adverse events (e.g. defined as hospitalisation or a hazard putting the participant at risk, such as an interaction with another medicine) happened more often following liraglutide treatment (230/1524 (15%) participants in the liraglutide group and 96/755 (13%) participants in the placebo group) and it is unclear whether taking this drug is safe in the long term. 
We detected neither an advantage nor a disadvantage of DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues in relation to non‐fatal heart attacks, non‐fatal strokes or heart failure. Our included studies did not report on other complications of diabetes such as kidney or eye disease. The effects on health‐related quality of life were inconclusive. In the included studies, very few participants died and there was no apparent relation to treatment. 
Future studies should investigate more patient‐important outcomes like complications of diabetes and especially the side effects of the medications, because we do not know for sure whether 'prediabetes' is just a condition arbitrarily defined by a laboratory measurement, is in fact a real risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether treatment of this condition translates into better patient‐important outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
All included trials had deficiencies in the way they were conducted or how key items were reported. For the individual comparisons, the number of participants was small, resulting in a high risk of random errors (play of chance).

Can two blood sugar drugs stop or slow type 2 diabetes?

Rationale
Type 2 diabetes is common. Over time, high blood sugar can harm the heart, eyes, and kidneys. It may also harm nerves and cause pain. Many people have “pre‑diabetes.” This means blood sugar is high, but not in the diabetes range.

Doctors use two kinds of sugar drugs for people with diabetes. One kind is called DPP‑4 blockers. Examples are linagliptin and vildagliptin. The other kind is called GLP‑1 helpers. Examples are exenatide and liraglutide. These drugs help the body lower sugar. They help the body release insulin. They may also help with weight.

We do not know if people with pre‑diabetes should take these drugs. The main idea is to see if they can stop or delay diabetes. We also want to know if they lower harm from diabetes. This includes kidney or eye disease, heart attack, and stroke. We also want to know if they help people live better and feel better. We must also learn about side effects. This study set out to answer these needs.

Trial Design
This was a review of clinical trials. In these trials, people were put by chance into groups. Some got a study drug. Some got a “dummy” pill or shot. A dummy is a look‑alike with no drug in it.

All people had blood sugar above normal, but not in the diabetes range. In short, they had pre‑diabetes. The review found seven trials. There were 2702 people in total. The drug time in these trials ran from 12 to 160 weeks. One very large trial used liraglutide at a 3.0 mg dose. Most people in that trial were overweight or had obesity.

The trials did not report age or sex details in this summary. People stayed in the study for the length of the trial. In the large trial, people took the drug for 160 weeks. Then they had 12 weeks with no drug.

Results
First, the DPP‑4 blockers did not stop or delay diabetes. They worked no better than the dummy.

The large trial of liraglutide at 3.0 mg showed a delay in diabetes. After 160 weeks, 26 out of 1472 people on liraglutide got diabetes. In the dummy group, 46 out of 738 people got diabetes. While on liraglutide, more people also went back to normal sugar. On the drug, 970 out of 1472 people had normal sugar at some point. On the dummy, 268 out of 738 people had normal sugar.

Then the drug was stopped for 12 weeks. In that time, 5 more people who had used liraglutide got diabetes. In the dummy group, 1 more person got diabetes. After those 12 weeks off the drug, fewer people kept normal sugar. In the prior liraglutide group, 740 out of 1472 people had normal sugar. In the dummy group, 263 out of 738 people had normal sugar. This means the gain may fade when you stop the drug. To keep the gain, you may need to keep taking it.

Side effects matter as well. A “serious” side effect means a bad effect that needs a hospital stay. It can also mean a big risk, such as a bad drug‑drug mix. In the liraglutide trials, serious side effects were a bit more common. They happened in 230 out of 1524 people on liraglutide. They happened in 96 out of 755 people on the dummy. We still do not know if long‑term use is safe.

The studies also looked at heart and blood flow harm. These include heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. There was no clear gain and no clear harm for these events. The trials did not report kidney or eye disease results. The effect on how people felt about their health was not clear. Very few people died in these trials. Deaths did not seem tied to the study drugs.

What do these results mean for patients?
For DPP‑4 blockers, there was no sign of benefit. They did not stop or slow diabetes in people with pre‑diabetes.

For liraglutide at 3.0 mg, there was a clear short‑term gain. Fewer people got diabetes while on the drug. More people went back to normal sugar while on it. But some of that gain faded after people stopped the drug. Serious side effects were somewhat more common with liraglutide. We do not yet know the long‑term safety.

Why does this matter?
Many people have pre‑diabetes. We want to know what helps most and harms least. Weight loss, healthy food, and more movement help many people. We also want to know if drugs can help, and for how long. We need proof that any drug lowers real harm from diabetes. This means fewer heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease, or eye disease. We also want people to feel better and live well. These trials did not answer all of that yet.

How strong is the evidence?
The review is up to date as of January 2017. Many trials had limits in how they ran or reported results. Most trials were small. This raises the chance that results are due to luck.

In sum, DPP‑4 blockers did not help prevent diabetes. Liraglutide at 3.0 mg did delay diabetes while on the drug. Some gain fell off when people stopped it. Side effects that are serious were a bit more common. We still need better and longer studies. We need to see if early drug use cuts real harms and is safe over time.","Dipeptidyl‐peptidase (DPP)‐4 inhibitors and glucagon‐like peptide (GLP)‐1 analogues for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus

In the big study investigating the GLP‐1‐analogue liraglutide, given in a dose used for obese people (3.0 mg), the development of type 2 diabetes was delayed: 26/1472 (1.8%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 46/738 (6.2%) participants randomised to placebo developed type 2 diabetes after 160 weeks. On the other side, 970/1472 (66%) participants randomised to liraglutide compared with 268/738 (36%) participants randomised to placebo switched back to normal glucose levels. This study was extended for another 12 weeks without treatment and five additional participants developed diabetes in the liraglutide group, compared with one participant in the placebo group. After the 12 weeks without treatment, 740/1472 (50%) participants in the liraglutide group compared with 263/738 (36%) participants in the placebo group had glucose levels considered as normal. This means that to keep chances high to prevent type 2 diabetes in people at risk one probably needs to continuously take this drug. Of note, serious adverse events (e.g. defined as hospitalisation or a hazard putting the participant at risk, such as an interaction with another medicine) happened more often following liraglutide treatment (230/1524 (15%) participants in the liraglutide group and 96/755 (13%) participants in the placebo group) and it is unclear whether taking this drug is safe in the long term. 
We detected neither an advantage nor a disadvantage of DPP‐4 inhibitors or GLP‐1 analogues in relation to non‐fatal heart attacks, non‐fatal strokes or heart failure. Our included studies did not report on other complications of diabetes such as kidney or eye disease. The effects on health‐related quality of life were inconclusive. In the included studies, very few participants died and there was no apparent relation to treatment. 
Future studies should investigate more patient‐important outcomes like complications of diabetes and especially the side effects of the medications, because we do not know for sure whether 'prediabetes' is just a condition arbitrarily defined by a laboratory measurement, is in fact a real risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether treatment of this condition translates into better patient‐important outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
All included trials had deficiencies in the way they were conducted or how key items were reported. For the individual comparisons, the number of participants was small, resulting in a high risk of random errors (play of chance).

10.1002-14651858.CD009487.pub3,"Lateral pararectal versus transrectal stoma placement for prevention of parastomal herniation 
We asked 
Is there a difference in the rate of parastomal herniation, and other stoma‐related complications in people undergoing abdominal wall enterostomy, when comparing two stoma formation techniques: lateral pararectal, in which the stoma is located beside the rectus abdominis muscle, one of the muscles of the abdominal wall, versus transrectal, in which the stoma is pulled through the rectus abdominis muscle? 
Background 
A stoma is an opening in the abdomen, which is surgically created to divert the flow of urine or feces; an enterostomy is a stoma that starts in the bowel. A parastomal hernia is an incisional hernia, through which abdominal contents protrude through a defect in the abdominal wall at the site of previous surgery. It is related to a stoma, and is one of the most common stoma‐related complications. Many factors that potentially influence the occurrence of parastomal herniation have been investigated. However, it remains unclear whether the enterostomy should be placed through or beside the rectus abdominis muscle in order to prevent parastomal herniation. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 9 November 2018. In this update, we included 10 retrospective cohort studies with a total of 864 participants, and one randomized controlled trial (RCT: a study in which participants are randomly allocated to the treatment groups), including 60 participants. The target population was individuals, regardless of age, who received a temporary or permanent enterostomy for any reason in either the elective (planned) or the emergency setting. 
Key results 
The results found inconclusive results between the two techniques for the risk of parastomal herniation (11 studies, 924 participants), stomal prolapse (1 study, 145 participants), ileus or stenosis (1 study, 60 participants), and skin irritation (1 study, 60 participants). 
Neither technique was found to be better than the other for any of the stoma‐related outcomes of interest. 
None of the studies measured other stoma‐related problems, or death.
Quality of the evidence 
We downgraded the quality of the evidence to moderate, low, or very low, because of high risk of bias, small sample sizes, few events, and diversity across studies. 
Conclusion 
Based on the current knowledge presented in this review, there is no evidence to support the use of one stoma formation technique over the other. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect.

Two ways to place a stoma: do they change hernia risk?

Rationale
A stoma is a small opening on the belly. Doctors make it with surgery. It lets stool or urine leave the body into a bag. An enterostomy is a stoma that starts in the bowel.

A common problem is a parastomal hernia. This is a weak spot near the stoma. Belly tissue can push out through this spot. It can cause pain, bulge, or problems with the bag.

Doctors use two main ways to place a stoma. One way is beside a belly muscle. This muscle is the rectus abdominis. The other way is through that muscle. Some think the muscle may shield the stoma. Others think it may not help.

It is not clear which way is better. This study looked at both ways. The goal was to see if one way lowers hernia risk. The team also looked at other stoma problems. These include prolapse, block, narrow, and skin rash.

Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team searched for all studies up to 9 November 2018. They found 11 studies to include.

Ten studies looked back at patient charts. This is called a cohort review. One study used a random pick to choose the method. That is called a randomized trial.

In total, 924 people took part in these studies. The people had a stoma from the bowel. The stoma could be for a short time. Or it could be for a long time. Surgery could be planned. Or it could be done in an emergency.

People of any age could be in the studies. The reports did not limit by gender. The studies did not give one set time in the study. Follow-up times were not the same across the reports.

The two methods were clear. In the lateral pararectal way, the stoma sits beside the rectus muscle. In the transrectal way, the stoma goes through that muscle. The studies compared the two ways.

The main problem they measured was parastomal hernia. Some studies also looked at prolapse. Prolapse means the stoma sticks out more than it should. One study looked at ileus or stenosis. Ileus means the bowel stops moving. Stenosis means a narrow spot forms. One study looked at skin rash or skin pain near the stoma.

Results
The results did not show a clear winner. For hernia risk, there was no clear difference. This finding came from 11 studies with 924 people.

For prolapse, there was no clear difference. This finding came from 1 study with 145 people. For ileus or stenosis, there was no clear difference. This came from 1 study with 60 people. For skin rash, there was no clear difference. This also came from 1 study with 60 people.

None of the studies measured other stoma problems. None of the studies measured death. So we cannot say if one way is safer for those outcomes.

The strength of the proof was not high. The team rated it as moderate, low, or very low. The reasons were bias and small study size. There were few events. The studies also differed in many ways. This lowers our trust in the results.

What does this mean for patients? Based on what we know now, both ways seem much the same. We do not see a clear benefit with one way. We also do not see clear harm with one way. This can help you talk with your surgeon. You can ask about other points that matter to you. These may include your body shape, scar sites, and your care plan.

What does this mean for the field? Stoma care needs stronger proof. We need larger studies. We need more even study groups. We need clear and shared follow-up times. We need to track more outcomes that matter to patients.

In short, this review found no best way to place the stoma. More and better research can change this. For now, your care team can choose the method that fits you. They can base this on your needs and your surgery plan.","Lateral pararectal versus transrectal stoma placement for prevention of parastomal herniation

Why is this review important? 
More than one in ten children and adolescents have long‐term physical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems like anxiety or depression. Treating these problems early can prevent difficulties with family life, school, and future mental health problems. It is currently unclear whether psychological therapies (talking therapies) designed for children and adolescents without medical issues are appropriate for use with this population. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
This review will be of interest to mental and medical healthcare providers, service users, and service commissioners. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review aims to answer the following questions: 1) Are psychological therapies better than a range of other therapies in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions? and 2) Are psychological therapies acceptable to this audience? 
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched a number of databases to find all high‐quality trials of psychological therapies for anxiety or depression in children and adolescents aged 18 years or less with long‐term physical conditions and symptoms of anxiety or depression, published from 1970 to September 2018. We included twenty‐nine studies with a total of 1349 people in the review and rated the overall quality of the studies as 'low to moderate'. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
A handful of psychological therapies have been researched in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. Most of these were developed for use with children and adolescents who do not have long‐term physical conditions. Some of these, particularly those based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and therapies specifically designed to treat depression or anxiety, are effective at reducing mild symptoms of these conditions in the short term. There is limited evidence that such therapies are acceptable to young people and that they can improve quality of life and symptoms of long‐term physical conditions. There is currently a lack of therapies for addressing health‐related anxiety in this population. 
What should happen next? 
Further research should be undertaken to develop more effective psychological therapies to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions.

Talking help for worry and sadness in children with long-term illness

Rationale
Some children live with long-term body illness. Examples are asthma, diabetes, and cancer. These health needs can last for years. Many of these children also feel strong worry or deep sadness. This can harm school, home life, and friends. It can also lead to later mental health problems.

Treating worry and sadness early can help. Many “talking” treatments exist. These are also called psychological therapies. They teach skills to cope with hard thoughts and feelings. One well-known type is cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT. CBT helps a child notice unhelpful thoughts. It then helps the child try new ways to think and act.

But most of these therapies were built for children without long-term illness. We do not know if they fit children who also manage a health condition. This study set out to learn more. The team asked if talking therapies can lower worry and sadness in this group. They also asked if children and teens would accept and use them. This work is needed to guide care for families and clinics.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team did not run a new trial. They looked for the best trials done since 1970. They searched many research sites. They looked up to September of 2018. They found 29 studies. These studies included 1,349 children and teens.

All the young people were age 18 or younger. All had a long-term body illness. All had signs of worry or sadness. Illness types included asthma, diabetes, and cancer. The review did not give details on gender. Most therapies were first made for youth without long-term illness.

The review compared talking therapies to other types of care. In some studies, the other care was usual care. In others, it was another kind of therapy. The team also looked at how many young people stayed in care. This helps show if the therapy was acceptable. Most studies looked at short-term change. How long each person took part was not clear in this summary.

Results
Only a small number of therapies had been tested in this group. Some did show benefit. The best results were for CBT-type care. These teach skills to change thoughts and actions. Therapies built to treat worry or sadness also helped. These therapies eased mild signs in the short term.

Some studies found more gains. A few showed better quality of life. A few also showed better control of body symptoms. But these gains were not seen in all studies. We do not know the size of the gains for each child. We also do not know if the gains last.

This review did not find many therapies that target health-related worry. Health-related worry means fear about the illness, care, or the future. This is a gap. Children with long-term illness often have this type of worry. More work is needed to build and test help for this need.

The review also looked at whether youth accept these therapies. The proof we have is limited. Some young people did stay in care. But across studies, we still lack clear data on this. We need trials that track who starts, who stays, and why.

The overall study quality was low to moderate. This means we should be careful in how we read the results. There were many types of illness, therapies, and outcomes. Study size was often small. Not all studies used the same tests to measure change. Few studies checked long-term results. Because of this, we cannot yet say what works best.

What does this mean for families and care teams today? Talking therapy can help some children and teens with long-term illness. It may lower mild worry or sadness for a time. It may also help daily life in some cases. It is worth asking about these options. A care team can help choose a therapy that fits the child.

But we still need better answers. We need therapies built for health-related worry and sadness. We need larger, stronger trials. We need to see if gains last over time. We also need to learn which therapy helps which child and which illness.

In short, talking therapies show promise for this group. CBT and similar care can help with mild signs in the short term. Yet the proof is not strong enough to guide all care choices. More research will help us serve children and teens with long-term illness and low mood or worry.","Psychological therapies for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions

10.1002-14651858.CD013743.pub2,"Background
Antibiotics have been considered to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) due to their antimicrobial properties against intestinal bacteria linked to inflammation. However, there are concerns about their efficacy and safety. 
Objectives
To determine whether antibiotic therapy is safe and effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in people with UC. 
Search methods
We searched five electronic databases on 10 December 2021 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic therapy to placebo or an active comparator. 
Selection criteria
We considered people with UC of all ages, treated with antibiotics of any type, dose, and route of administration for inclusion. Induction studies required a minimum duration of two weeks for inclusion. Maintenance studies required a minimum duration of three months to be considered for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome for induction studies was failure to achieve remission and for maintenance studies was relapse, as defined by the primary studies. 
Main results
We included 12 RCTs (847 participants). One maintenance of remission study used sole antibiotic therapy compared with 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA). All other trials used concurrent medications or standard care regimens and antibiotics as an adjunct therapy or compared antibiotics with other adjunct therapies to examine the effect on induction of remission. 
There is high certainty evidence that antibiotics (154/304 participants) compared to placebo (175/304 participants) result in no difference in failure to achieve clinical remission (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.06). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids, steroids plus 5‐ASA, or steroids plus 5‐ASA plus probiotics were used as additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (102/168 participants) compared to placebo (121/175 participants) may result in no difference in failure to achieve clinical response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.22). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids or steroids plus 5‐ASA were used as additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (6/342 participants) compared to placebo (5/349 participants) may result in no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.71). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids were additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
There is low certainty evidence that antibiotics (3/342 participants) compared to placebo (1/349 participants) may result in no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 2.06, 95% CI 0.27 to 15.72). A subgroup analysis found no differences when steroids or steroids plus 5‐ASA were additional therapies to antibiotics and placebo. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics in combination with probiotics compared to no treatment or placebo for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.19), serious adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.08), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.08). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to 5‐ASA for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.14). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to probiotics for failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.94). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to 5‐ASA for failure to maintain clinical remission (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.06). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
It is unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics compared to no treatment for failure to achieve clinical remission in a mixed population of people with active and inactive disease (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07). The certainty of the evidence is very low. 
For all other outcomes, no effects could be estimated due to a lack of data.
Authors' conclusions
There is high certainty evidence that there is no difference between antibiotics and placebo in the proportion of people who achieve clinical remission at the end of the intervention period. However, there is evidence that there may be a greater proportion of people who achieve clinical remission and probably a greater proportion who achieve clinical response with antibiotics when compared with placebo at 12 months. There may be no difference in serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events between antibiotics and placebo. 
No clear conclusions can be drawn for any other comparisons.
A clear direction for future research appears to be comparisons of antibiotics and placebo (in addition to standard therapies) with longer‐term measurement of outcomes. Additionally. As there were single studies of other head‐to‐head comparisons, there may be scope for future studies in this area.

Do antibiotics help people with ulcerative colitis get well and stay well?

Rationale
Ulcerative colitis is a long-term bowel disease. It causes swelling and sores in the colon. It can lead to belly pain, blood in stool, and urgent trips to the toilet. These symptoms can limit work, school, and daily life.

Germs in the gut may play a role in this disease. Antibiotics kill germs. So, some hope antibiotics might calm gut swelling. But antibiotics can also cause harm. This study asked if antibiotics help more than they harm.

The main idea was simple. Do antibiotics help more people feel well, with few or no symptoms? We call that “remission.” Do antibiotics help people keep symptoms away? We call it “staying in remission.” The team also looked at side effects.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. A trial is a study that tests a treatment in people. In these trials, people joined groups by chance. Some took antibiotics. Some took a “placebo,” a look-alike pill with no drug. Some took another active drug.

The team searched five online libraries on 10 December 2021. They looked for the best kind of trials. These are “randomized controlled trials.” That means chance decides the group. That helps make fair and balanced groups.

People of any age with ulcerative colitis could be in these trials. The trials used many types and doses of antibiotics. Most people also took usual care. Usual care can be steroid pills or 5-ASA. 5-ASA is a common gut anti-swelling pill.

Some people also took a probiotic. A probiotic is a “good bacteria” pill. The “get symptoms under control” trials lasted at least two weeks. The “keep symptoms away” trials lasted at least three months. Some trials also checked results at one year.

The main results they tracked were clear and simple. For short term care, they asked: did people get into remission? For longer care, they asked: did people relapse? Relapse means symptoms came back. They also tracked bad side effects and people who stopped pills due to side effects.

Results
The review found 12 trials with 847 people. Most trials added antibiotics to usual care. One trial for long-term care used only antibiotics and compared them to 5-ASA. The rest tested add-on use or other add-ons.

For short term care, antibiotics did not help more people get into remission than placebo. Remission means few or no symptoms. We are very sure about this result. The numbers in each group were about the same.

We are not sure if antibiotics help symptoms get better in the short term. The proof for this is weak. We call that “low certainty.” This means we may learn more with better trials. For now, we cannot say they help in the short term.

Serious side effects were rare. About the same number had a serious side effect in each group. The proof for this is weak. People stopped pills due to side effects at about the same rate. This proof is also weak.

At one year, antibiotics may help more people be in remission. They may also help more people feel better. This finding is not firm. The proof is not strong. We need larger, longer trials to be sure.

Most trials used antibiotics with usual care. Usual care was steroid pills, 5-ASA, or both. Adding antibiotics did not change short term results. So antibiotics gave no extra short term gain. This is key for day-to-day care.

We cannot tell if antibiotics work better or worse than 5-ASA for getting into remission. We also cannot tell if antibiotics help more than probiotics. We cannot tell if antibiotics plus probiotics help more than no treatment. These head-to-head tests had few people. The proof from them is very weak.

For keeping remission, we cannot tell if antibiotics help more than 5-ASA. One trial looked at this and did not give a clear answer. We need more trials that follow people for longer time. This will help judge relapse better.

What does this mean for patients? In the short term, antibiotics did not help more people get into remission than a placebo. They seemed about as safe as a placebo in these trials. At one year, antibiotics may help more people feel well, but we are not sure yet. For now, we cannot say antibiotics should be used to get quick control of symptoms.

Why is this study important? It pulls together the best trials so far. It gives a clear message for the short term. It shows where we still need answers for the long term. The team suggests future trials should compare antibiotics with placebo on top of usual care. These trials should track results for at least a year.

In sum, we are very sure antibiotics do not help more people get into remission in the short term. We are not sure about long-term benefits. Side effects were rare and about the same as placebo. Better and longer studies can give clearer answers.","The use of antibiotics in the treatment of ulcerative colitis
What was the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aimed to determine whether antibiotics are useful and safe for people with ulcerative colitis (UC) in achieving or maintaining remission. 
Key messages 
We found that antibiotics, when added to standard therapies, are similar to placebo in how often they fail to achieve remission or disease improvement for people with UC, measured up to three months from taking them. 
We found that antibiotics when compared to placebo may be useful in achieving remission or some improvement of UC symptoms, measured at 12 months from taking them. 
In terms of safety, the evidence is of low certainty, but antibiotics may be as safe as placebo. 
We have confidence in the findings up to three months, but have less confidence in the evidence at 12 months due to low numbers of study participants. 
What is ulcerative colitis? 
UC is a chronic (long term) inflammatory disease that affects the large bowel. The most common symptoms include bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and a sudden almost uncontrollable urge to pass stool. Some people have other symptoms including sore joints, mouth sores, and inflammation in their eyes. When someone is experiencing symptoms of UC, they are said to have 'active' disease. When symptoms improve with treatment, the disease is said to be responding to therapy. When symptoms stop, the disease is said to be in 'remission'. People with UC in remission are often given therapy with medicines to try and prolong (maintain) their remission or response to therapy. 
What did the review study? 
This review studied the use of antibiotics in the treatment of UC. Eleven studies considered antibiotics as a therapy for achieving remission and one study as therapy for maintaining remission. 
Antibiotics could theoretically be helpful as they might be able to fight harmful bacteria in the gut that are thought to be a partial cause for the presence of UC symptoms. 
Currently, most doctors do not recommend the use of antibiotics unless the patient has an infection. 
What were the main results of the review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing antibiotics with another treatment or dummy treatment. We found 12 RCTs including 847 participants. The trials looked at people of all ages; using different types and doses of antibiotics; and at antibiotics taken as tablets, injections, or any other way. The main results from our review are as follows. 
1. Antibiotics, when added to standard therapies, are no different from placebo in failing to achieve remission or improve disease symptoms for people with UC when measured up to three months from taking them. 
2. Antibiotics probably fail less than placebo in achieving remission or some improvement of UC symptoms measured at 12 months from taking them. 
3. In terms of safety, antibiotics may be similar to placebo, but the evidence is of low certainty. 
4. We are uncertain about how antibiotics compare to other treatments because there is not enough good evidence to make a judgement. 
Conclusion 
There is no difference between antibiotics and placebo when added to standard therapies to achieve remission or improvement of symptoms in the short term. However, they may help to lessen the number of people who do not achieve remission, and they probably lead to fewer numbers of people who have not achieved improvement of symptoms at 12 months. 
No conclusions can be drawn on other treatments or safety due to lack of evidence, even though there may be a possibility that antibiotics are as safe as placebo. Further research would be needed to clarify the usefulness of antibiotics in the treatment of UC; however, such studies should focus on longer‐term outcomes given the findings of this review.

We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, clinical trials registries, manufacturers' websites, and reference lists of included studies. Our most recent search was 23 September 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing anti‐IL‐5 therapy with placebo in adults with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and analysed outcomes using a random‐effects model.The primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring antibiotics or oral steroids, hospitalisations due to exacerbation of COPD, serious adverse events, and quality of life. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
Six studies involving a total of 5542 participants met our inclusion criteria. Three studies used mepolizumab (1530 participants), and three used benralizumab (4012 participants). The studies were on people with COPD, which was similarly defined with a documented history of COPD for at least one year. We deemed the risk of bias to be generally low, with all studies contributing data of robust methodology. 
Mepolizumab 100 mg reduces the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations by 19% in those with an eosinophil count of at least 150/μL (rate ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.93; participants = 911; studies = 2, high‐certainty evidence). When participants with lower eosinophils are included, mepolizumab 100 mg probably reduces the exacerbation rate by 8% (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03; participants = 1285; studies = 2, moderate‐certainty evidence). Mepolizumab 300 mg probably reduces the rate of exacerbations by 14% in participants all of whom had raised eosinophils (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.06; participants = 451; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence); the evidence was uncertain for a single small study of mepolizumab 750 mg. In participants with high eosinophils, mepolizumab probably reduces the rate of hospitalisation by 10% (100 mg, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.24; participants = 911; studies = 2, moderate‐certainty evidence) and 17% (300 mg, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.35; participants = 451; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence). Mepolizumab 100 mg increases the time to first moderate or severe exacerbation compared to the placebo group, in people with the eosinophilic phenotype (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.92; participants = 981; studies 2, high‐certainty evidence). When participants with lower eosinophils were included this difference was smaller and less certain (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.0; participants = 1285; studies 2, moderate‐certainty evidence). Mepolizumab 300 mg probably increases the time to first moderate or severe exacerbation in participants who all had eosinophilic phenotype (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99; participants = 451; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Benralizumab 100 mg reduces the rate of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalisation in those with an eosinophil count of at least 220/μL (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.81; participants = 1512; studies = 2, high‐certainty evidence). Benralizumab 10 mg probably reduces the rate of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalisation in those with an eosinophil count of at least 220/μL (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94; participants = 765; studies = 1, moderate‐certainty evidence). 
There was probably little or no difference between the intervention and placebo for quality of life measures. Where there were differences the mean difference fell below the pre‐specified minimum clinically significant difference. 
Treatment with mepolizumab and benralizumab appeared to be safe. All pooled analyses showed that there was probably little or no difference in serious adverse events, adverse events, or side effects between the use of a monoclonal antibody therapy compared to placebo. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that mepolizumab and benralizumab probably reduce the rate of moderate and severe exacerbations in the highly selected group of people who have both COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils. This highlights the importance of disease phenotyping in COPD, and may play a role in the personalised treatment strategy in disease management. 
Further research is needed to elucidate the role of monoclonal antibodies in the management of COPD in clinical practice. In particular, it is not clear whether there is a threshold blood eosinophil level above which these drugs may be effective. Studies including cost effectiveness analysis may be beneficial given the high cost of these therapies, to support use if appropriate.

Do newer asthma-style drugs help some people with COPD?

Rationale
COPD is a long-term lung disease. It makes it hard to breathe. People can have sudden flare-ups. Doctors call these flares exacerbations. Flares can lead to a hospital stay.

COPD is not one single type. Some people have airway swelling driven by eosinophils. Eosinophils are a kind of white blood cell. They can drive flares in some people. These people may need a different plan.

Some asthma drugs block IL-5. IL-5 is a body signal. It helps eosinophils grow and act. Drugs that block IL-5 may cut flares. Two such drugs are mepolizumab and benralizumab.

These drugs are monoclonal antibodies. They are lab-made proteins. They block one target in the body. They may work if eosinophils are high. This review asked if they help and if they are safe.

Trial Design
This was a review of trials. The team looked for high quality tests. They searched many study lists. The last search was September 23, 2020. They used standard, careful methods.

They found six trials with 5,542 adults. All had COPD for at least one year. Three trials tested mepolizumab with 1,530 people. Three tested benralizumab with 4,012 people.

In each trial, people got a study drug or a placebo. A placebo is a shot with no drug. Staff picked who got what by chance. This helps keep groups the same. The abstract did not give the study time.

The abstract did not give the gender mix. It did not give exact ages, beyond “adults.” It did list eosinophil counts used in the trials. Counts were per microliter, a very small blood amount. Larger numbers mean more eosinophils.

Results
In people with high eosinophils, mepolizumab helped. High meant 150 or more per microliter. With 100 mg, people had fewer flare-ups. They had about 1 in 5 fewer flares. People also went longer before a first flare.

When people with low eosinophils were included, gains were small. That change was about 1 in 12 fewer flares. The proof for this was less sure. With 300 mg, results were close. There were about 1 in 7 fewer flares.

All people in the 300 mg trial had raised eosinophils. People went longer before a first flare. A small 750 mg study was not clear. The number of people was too low. We cannot draw firm ideas from that dose.

Mepolizumab may lower hospital stays. In high eosinophils, fewer stayed in hospital. The drop was about 1 in 10 to 1 in 6. The exact size was not clear. Still, fewer people needed the hospital.

Benralizumab helped some people with high eosinophils. High here meant 220 or more per microliter. With 100 mg, there were fewer hospital stays. The drop was about 1 in 3. With 10 mg, results were like this.

The 10 mg dose likely lowered hospital stays. The drop was also about 1 in 3. These gains were in people with high eosinophils. The trials show a role for blood tests. Tests can guide who may benefit.

Day to day life scores did not change much. Any gains were small. They fell below the level that matters. People did not feel much better day to day. This was similar for both drugs.

These drugs seemed safe in the trials. Bad side effects were about the same as placebo. Serious problems were also about the same. People on the drugs and on placebo had similar safety. No major new risks were found.

What this means
These drugs can help a select group. People with COPD and high eosinophils saw gains. Flares fell in number. Hospital stays fell in number. People also went longer before the first flare.

Blood tests can help pick who may gain. This may guide more personal care. It shows COPD has different types. A “one size fits all” plan may not work. Matching care to type can help.

We still need more study. We do not yet know the best eosinophil cut-off. We also need cost and value studies. These drugs can be costly. Good value data can help with care choices.

In short, these drugs likely help some people. The key is high eosinophils in the blood. Talk with your doctor about testing. Ask if you may fit this group. Together, you can plan next steps.","Mepolizumab or benralizumab for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
Background to the question 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung condition in which people can experience severe difficulties with breathing and an associated reduction in their quality of life. 
For people with COPD, episodes in which the condition of patients seriously worsens are a major concern. We examined the findings of clinical trials to see whether mepolizumab or benralizumab, two new drugs, are better than placebo (dummy treatment) for people with COPD, and whether they reduce the number of episodes when the condition of patients seriously worsens. 
Study characteristics 
Six clinical studies compared either mepolizumab or benralizumab to placebo in a total of 5542 people with COPD. We examined the findings of the studies in terms of episodes when patients' conditions flared up requiring additional treatment, patient quality of life, patient performance in breathing tests, and side effects of the medication. 
Main results 
Three studies used mepolizumab, and the other three studies used benralizumab.
Mepolizumab 100 mg reduced the rate of flare‐ups in a group of people with both COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils (a type of white blood cells involved in inflammatory and allergic reactions). When mepolizumab is given in a higher dose (300 mg or 750 mg) the rate of flare‐ups is probably reduced. 
Benralizumab at a dose of 100mg resulted in a clear reduction in the number of episodes requiring admission to hospital, and when given at a lower dose (10mg) probably reduces flare‐ups requiring hospitalisation. This is in people with COPD and higher levels of blood eosinophils. 
Further studies comparing mepolizumab or benralizumab to a placebo may provide more clarity on the role of these drugs for COPD. 
Quality of the evidence 
The included studies were for the most part very well‐designed and robust, and the evidence was generally of high quality.

Diabetes and vascular disease are the leading causes of lower limb amputation. Currently, 463 million adults are living with diabetes, and 202 million with peripheral vascular disease, worldwide. When a lower limb amputation is considered, preservation of the knee in a below‐knee amputation allows for superior functional recovery when compared with amputation at a higher level. When a below‐knee amputation is not feasible, the most common alternative performed is an above‐knee amputation. Another possible option, which is less commonly performed, is a through‐knee amputation which may offer some potential functional benefits over an above‐knee amputation. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of through‐knee amputation compared to above‐knee amputation on clinical and rehabilitation outcomes and complication rates for all patients undergoing vascular and non‐vascular major lower limb amputation. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases; the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register to 17 February 2021. 
We undertook reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing through‐knee amputation and above‐knee amputation were eligible for inclusion in this study. Primary outcomes were uncomplicated primary wound healing and prosthetic limb fitting. Secondary outcomes included time taken to achieve independent mobility with a prosthesis, health‐related quality of life, walking speed, pain, and 30‐day survival. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed all records identified by the search. Data collection and extraction were planned in line with recommendations outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We planned to assess the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We did not identify RCTs that met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Authors' conclusions
No RCTs have been conducted to determine comparative clinical or rehabilitation outcomes of through‐knee amputation and above‐knee amputation, or complication rates. It is unknown whether either of these approaches offers improved outcomes for patients. RCTs are needed to guide practice and to ensure the best outcomes for this patient group.

Through-knee or above-knee leg surgery: what we know now

2. Rationale
Many people live with diabetes or poor blood flow in the legs. Diabetes means high sugar in the blood. It can harm nerves and blood vessels over time. Poor blood flow means the leg does not get enough blood. Wounds may not heal. Pain may be severe. Some people need surgery to remove part of the leg. This is called an amputation.

When this happens, doctors try to save the knee. If they can, people often move better. This is called a below-knee amputation. But this is not always possible. Then doctors must choose another level.

Two choices are above-knee and through-knee surgery. Above-knee means the leg is removed above the knee. Through-knee means the cut goes through the knee joint. Some think through-knee may help with use of an artificial leg. We need clear proof to guide this choice.

This need is large. Many people face this choice. There are 463 million adults with diabetes worldwide. There are 202 million people with poor leg blood flow worldwide. Better research can help many people live and move better after surgery.

3. Trial Design
This study did not test a treatment on patients. It was a review of research. The team looked for fair tests that compare the two options. A fair test is a trial where people go to groups by chance. One group would get through-knee surgery. The other group would get above-knee surgery.

The plan was to include all causes of major leg loss. This means people who need a large part of the leg removed. It could be due to blood flow problems or other causes. The review did not limit age or sex. It aimed to include all patients who had these surgeries.

The team set key results to check. These were wound healing without problems. And success with fitting an artificial leg. An artificial leg is a device that replaces the missing leg. Other results were time to walk on the new leg, pain, and walking speed. The team also planned to look at life quality and being alive at day thirty.

The team searched many sources. They checked large medical study lists. They checked trial lists that track planned and ongoing trials. They also looked at the lists of papers in each study. They asked study authors if they knew of more trials. The search included records up to February 17, 2021.

This review did not enroll new patients. It only looked for trials that already took place. Because it is a review, there was no set time in a study for a person. If trials had been found, the time in each trial would depend on that trial. But no such trials were found.

4. Results
The team found no trials that met the plan. There were no head-to-head tests by chance group. So we do not know which surgery works better. We do not know which heals better. We do not know which helps people walk better or sooner.

We also do not know about pain or life quality. Life quality means how you feel in daily life. It includes comfort, mood, and the things you can do. We cannot say which option keeps more people alive at thirty days. We cannot say which one has fewer problems after surgery.

Problems after surgery are called complications. These include slow wound healing or infection. They also include trouble with the fit of the artificial leg. The review cannot compare these problems between the two options. The lack of trials is the main result.

What does this mean for patients and care teams? Today, we do not have strong proof to guide this choice. Doctors must use skill, patient needs, and values to plan care. The authors say new fair trials are needed. These trials should test clear results that matter to patients.

Those results include healing, fit of the artificial leg, and walking on your own. They also include pain, walking speed, and daily life. Survival at day thirty is also key. Trials should compare through-knee and above-knee directly. People should be put into groups by chance.

Many people face this choice each year. Diabetes and poor leg blood flow are very common. Better research can help many people. Trials can also help set shared terms and goals. This can lead to better rehab and better daily life after surgery.

In short, this review asked a clear question. It asked which surgery level is better when the knee cannot be saved. It looked hard for fair tests. It found none. So we do not know which option is best. New trials are needed to guide care and improve lives.","Does surgical removal of the lower leg (amputation) through the knee offer patients improved surgical recovery and better rehabilitation than amputation above the knee? 
Background 
Each year, thousands of people worldwide need to have their lower leg surgically removed (lower limb amputation) due to problems such as blockages in blood vessels (vascular disease), diabetes, and injury. When an amputation is planned, a surgeon needs to decide how high up the leg to go, and therefore how much leg to leave behind. This decision is based on a balance between leaving as much of the leg as possible to improve a person’s ability to walk with an artificial leg (prosthesis) and removing anything that will not survive or go on to heal. If possible, a surgeon will prefer to preserve the knee, as having a working knee of one's own ensures a person’s best chance of walking. In some cases, this is not possible, and currently almost all people in this situation will have an amputation in the middle of the thigh (above the knee). However, another option is an amputation that can be performed through the knee joint itself. This carries potential advantages, as all of the muscles controlling movements of the thighbone are undamaged. A longer remaining leg would be expected to act as a lever to reduce the effort of swinging a prosthetic limb during walking and to aid sitting balance and transfer from bed to chair. By avoiding cutting the muscles, it is possible to minimise the physical trauma of surgery, allowing a procedure with reduced blood loss and less procedure time. In addition, the end of the thighbone and in some cases the knee cap remain. These bones can support the body’s weight at the end of the remaining limb through the same mechanism as kneeling down. On the other hand, some surgeons think that problems with healing may be more common with this approach. It is unclear whether amputation through the knee may therefore be a better operation, allowing improved recovery, greater likelihood of being able to walk with an artificial leg, and better quality of life, or whether it is associated with worse outcomes due to wound healing failure and the need for further surgery. The aim of this review was to look at the best available evidence to see how these operations compare.  
This review searched for studies that looked at whether through‐the‐knee or above‐the‐knee amputation resulted in better wound healing after amputation, improved patient survival, and reduced pain (clinical outcomes), as well as better rates of prosthesis use, walking speed, and quality of life (rehabilitation outcomes). 
Study characteristics and key results 
A thorough search of the available literature was performed (up to 17 February 2021) to find studies comparing through‐knee with above‐knee amputation. We identified no studies comparing these two procedures. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We were unable to assess the certainty of evidence because of the absence of studies included in this review. 
Conclusion 
Due to a lack of randomised trials, we are unable to determine if through‐knee amputations have different outcomes from above‐knee amputations. High‐quality randomised controlled trials are required to provide evidence on this topic.

10.1002-14651858.CD013057.pub2,"Benefits and risks of ear cleaning for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (persistent or recurring ear infection with discharge of pus) 
Why this is important 
Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), also known as chronic otitis media (COM), is an inflammation and infection of the middle ear that lasts for two weeks or more. People with CSOM usually experience recurrent or persistent ear discharge – pus that leaks out from a hole in the eardrum – and hearing loss. 
Different approaches can be used to clean the affected ears and remove discharge. These include: 
‐ using cotton wool or tissue paper (dry mopping);‐ sucking up material blocking the ear with a small device (usually done under a microscope); or‐ washing out the ear (irrigation). 
To find out how effective ear cleaning is in people with CSOM, and whether it causes unwanted effects, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. In particular, we wanted to know whether ear cleaning stopped ear discharge, and whether it affected health‐related quality of life, or hearing. We also wanted to know if it caused pain, discomfort or irritation in the ear, unwanted effects such as dizziness or ear bleeding, or any serious complications. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found three studies in 431 people with CSOM. People were followed for between six weeks and six months after treatment. 
The studies compared:
‐ daily dry mopping versus no treatment (two studies, 351 people);‐ daily suction combined with antibiotic ear drops administered in a clinic, versus one instance of suction only (in a clinic) followed by daily self‐administered antibiotic ear drops (one study, 80 people). 
Daily dry mopping compared against no treatment 
‐ We do not know whether dry mopping stops ear discharge, because the evidence on whether people experienced discharge after four weeks was of very low certainty, and no studies looked at the presence of discharge earlier. 
‐ One study reported serious complications, but it was not clear whether the people who reported complications had their ears cleaned with dry mopping or not, or whether the complications occurred before or after treatment. We therefore could not tell whether dry mopping caused serious complications, or how often these occurred. 
‐ One study looked at hearing, but did not report the results in a way that could tell us whether or not dry mopping affects hearing. 
‐ No studies investigated the impact of dry mopping on health‐related quality of life, ear pain, dizziness or ear bleeding. 
Daily suction compared against one instance of suction only, in addition to antibiotic ear drops 
‐ We do not know whether suction stops ear discharge, because the evidence for between one and two weeks after treatment was of very low certainty, and the results for discharge after four weeks could not be interpreted. 
‐ We do not know if suction affects hearing or dizziness, as the evidence was of very low certainty. 
‐ No studies investigated the impact of suction on health‐related quality of life, ear pain, serious complications or ear bleeding. 
What this means 
We do not know how effective ear cleaning is for people with CSOM, and whether it causes unwanted effects. There are very few studies in this area, and these provide very low‐certainty evidence. Unwanted effects were not well reported in the studies we found. We need researchers to conduct future studies that compare ear cleaning to no cleaning, and compare different cleaning techniques and frequency, so that we can assess the benefits and risks of ear cleaning for people with CSOM.

Ear cleaning for long-lasting ear infection: what we know and do not know

Rationale
Some people have a long-lasting ear infection. Doctors call this chronic suppurative otitis media. We can say “chronic” for long-lasting. “Suppurative” means pus comes out of the ear. This kind of ear problem can cause hearing loss. It can also cause bad smell, wet ears, and stress in daily life.

Why study ear cleaning? Thick pus and crust can block the ear. This may slow healing. It may also keep germ-killing ear drops from reaching deep infection. Ear cleaning may help remove this block. It might lower ear wetness and help hearing. But ear cleaning can also have risks, like pain, dizziness, or bleeding. We need to know both the good and the bad. This study looked for proof on the benefits and harms.

There are a few ways to clean the ear. Dry mopping uses cotton or tissue to wipe the ear. Suction uses a small device to suck out ear fluid. Washing out the ear, also called irrigation, uses water or saline. This review set out to see which, if any, helps most. It also looked at how often cleaning should be done.

Trial Design
This was a careful review of research. The team looked for all studies on this topic. They compared results and judged how strong the proof was. They rated proof as high, moderate, low, or very low. Very low means we are not sure at all.

The review found three studies. In total, 431 people took part. All had a long-lasting ear infection with pus. The reports did not state ages or gender. People were followed from six weeks to six months.

The studies compared two main things. First, daily dry mopping versus no treatment. Two studies with 351 people looked at this. Second, daily suction in a clinic with antibiotic (germ-killing) ear drops. This was compared to one time suction in a clinic, then daily self-use of the same ear drops at home. One study with 80 people looked at this. No study in this review tested washing out the ear.

Results
Main point: we still do not know if ear cleaning helps. The proof we have is very weak. The studies were few and small. Some did not report key results in clear ways. So we cannot tell if benefits outweigh risks.

For daily dry mopping versus no treatment, here is what we know. We do not know if dry mopping stops ear discharge. At four weeks, the proof was very weak. No study checked discharge earlier than four weeks. One study noted serious problems in some people. But it did not show who had dry mopping and who did not. It also did not say if these problems came before or after treatment. So we cannot say if dry mopping caused any serious harm. One study looked at hearing. But it did not report results in a way we can use. No study looked at life quality, ear pain, dizziness, or ear bleeding.

For daily suction plus clinic ear drops versus one time suction plus home ear drops, here is what we know. We do not know if daily suction stops ear discharge. The proof for one to two weeks after treatment was very weak. The results for four weeks were not clear enough to use. We also do not know if suction helps hearing. We do not know if it causes dizziness. Again, the proof was very weak. No study looked at life quality, ear pain, serious harm, or ear bleeding.

What does this mean for patients? Based on these studies, we cannot say ear cleaning helps or harms. We do not have strong proof that dry mopping or suction stops ear wetness. We do not have strong proof that these methods help hearing. We also do not have good data on pain, dizziness, or bleeding. This does not mean ear cleaning has no value. It means we lack clear, solid proof from good studies.

Why is this review helpful? It shows where the gaps are. It tells doctors and patients that the current proof is weak. It guides researchers on what to study next. We need larger and better studies. These studies should compare cleaning to no cleaning. They should also compare methods and how often to clean. They should report on ear wetness, hearing, pain, dizziness, bleeding, and life quality. Clear and simple reports will help patients and doctors make choices.

In short, we need more and better proof. Until then, talk with your ear doctor. Ask about the pros and cons for you. Ask how to keep the ear dry and safe. Ask how to use ear drops the right way. Each case is different, and your care should fit your needs.

We searched international trials registries via the World Health Organization's trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural activation for the treatment of depression or symptoms of depression in adults aged 18 or over. We excluded RCTs conducted in inpatient settings and with trial participants selected because of a physical comorbidity. Studies were included regardless of reported outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened all titles/abstracts and full‐text manuscripts for inclusion. Data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments were also performed by two review authors in duplicate. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for more information. 
Main results
Fifty‐three studies with 5495 participants were included; 51 parallel group RCTs and two cluster‐RCTs. 
We found moderate‐certainty evidence that behavioural activation had greater short‐term efficacy than treatment as usual (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 1.78; 7 RCTs, 1533 participants), although this difference was no longer evident in sensitivity analyses using a worst‐case or intention‐to‐treat scenario. Compared with waiting list, behavioural activation may be more effective, but there were fewer data in this comparison and evidence was of low certainty (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.90 to 5.09; 1 RCT, 26 participants). No evidence on treatment efficacy was available for behavioural activation versus placebo and behavioural activation versus no treatment. 
We found moderate‐certainty evidence suggesting no evidence of a difference in short‐term treatment efficacy between behavioural activation and CBT (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.07; 5 RCTs, 601 participants). Fewer data were available for other comparators. No evidence of a difference in short term‐efficacy was found between behavioural activation and third‐wave CBT (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.33; 2 RCTs, 98 participants; low certainty), and psychodynamic therapy (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.99; 1 RCT,60 participants; very low certainty). Behavioural activation was more effective than humanistic therapy (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.95; 2 RCTs, 46 participants; low certainty) and medication (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.76; 1 RCT; 141 participants; moderate certainty), but both of these results were based on a small number of trials and participants. No evidence on treatment efficacy was available for comparisons between behavioural activation versus interpersonal, cognitive analytic, and integrative therapies. 
There was moderate‐certainty evidence that behavioural activation might have lower treatment acceptability (based on dropout rate) than treatment as usual in the short term, although the data did not confirm a difference and results lacked precision (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.31; 14 RCTs, 2518 participants). Moderate‐certainty evidence did not suggest any difference in short‐term acceptability between behavioural activation and waiting list (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.93; 8 RCTs. 359 participants), no treatment (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.09; 3 RCTs, 187 participants), medication (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.16; 2 RCTs, 243 participants), or placebo (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.67; 1 RCT; 96 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No evidence on treatment acceptability was available comparing behavioural activation versus psychodynamic therapy. 
Low‐certainty evidence did not show a difference in short‐term treatment acceptability (dropout rate) between behavioural activation and CBT (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.25; 12 RCTs, 1195 participants), third‐wave CBT (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.10; 3 RCTs, 147 participants); humanistic therapy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.20 to 5.55; 2 RCTs, 96 participants) (very low certainty), and interpersonal, cognitive analytic, and integrative therapy (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.20; 4 RCTs, 123 participants). 
Results from medium‐ and long‐term primary outcomes, secondary outcomes, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses are summarised in the text. 
Authors' conclusions
This systematic review suggests that behavioural activation may be more effective than humanistic therapy, medication, and treatment as usual, and that it may be no less effective than CBT, psychodynamic therapy, or being placed on a waiting list. However, our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. 
We found no evidence of a difference in short‐term treatment acceptability (based on dropouts) between behavioural activation and most comparison groups (CBT, humanistic therapy, waiting list, placebo, medication, no treatment or treatment as usual). Again, our confidence in all these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. 
No data were available about the efficacy of behavioural activation compared with placebo, or about treatment acceptability comparing behavioural activation and psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal, cognitive analytic and integrative therapies. 
The evidence could be strengthened by better reporting and better quality RCTs of behavioural activation and by assessing working mechanisms of behavioural activation. 
","1. Plain Title
Does a simple talk therapy called behavioral activation help adults with depression?

2. Rationale
Depression is common. It can make people feel sad, numb, or tired. It can harm sleep, work, and home life. Many people need care that is easy to get and easy to use.

Behavioral activation is a brief talk therapy. In this therapy, a person and a helper plan small, doable steps. These steps add back daily activity, joy, and a sense of control. The goal is to break the “stop doing” cycle that keeps mood low.

This study looked to see if this therapy helps adults with depression. The team asked three main questions. Does it work as well as other talk therapy? Does it work as well as medicine for mood? Does it work better than usual care, wait list, or fake care? The idea was that it might help, and may be easier to offer than other care.

3. Trial Design
This was a large review of past trials. A review like this joins the results of many trials into one big picture. The trials were “randomized.” That means people were put into groups by chance. This helps make fair tests.

The team looked for trials in many big research lists. They looked at all years up to mid‑January 2020. They did not limit language or type of report. Two team members checked each study and took out the key data.

The review included 53 trials with 5,495 adults. All were age 18 or older. All had depression or had low mood that was close to depression. These studies took place in clinics or the community, not in the hospital. People with a main health problem other than depression were not the focus.

The trials compared behavioral activation to other types of care. These included cognitive behavioral therapy, also called CBT. It also included newer forms of CBT, and other talk therapies. Some trials compared it to medicine for mood. Some compared it to usual care, a wait list, fake care, or no care. Time in each trial was not the same. Many results were for the “short term,” which means near the end of care. The review also looked at middle and long term, but with less detail. The team also checked “acceptability.” That means how many people stopped care early.

4. Results
What did the trials show? In the short term, behavioral activation helped more than usual care. This means more people felt better at the end of care. When the team used very strict checks, this edge was less clear. Even so, the main result favored behavioral activation over usual care.

There were few trials that used a wait list. In those, behavioral activation seemed to help more than waiting. But the data were small, so we are not sure. There were no short‑term results that compared it to fake care for how well it worked.

How did it compare to other talk therapy? Behavioral activation worked about the same as CBT in the short term. This was based on several trials. It also seemed about the same as “third‑wave” CBT. These are newer forms of CBT that add ideas like noticing thoughts with care. It also seemed about the same as “psychodynamic” therapy. That is a type of talk therapy that looks at deep feelings and past ties. These two matches had fewer people, so we are less sure.

Behavioral activation worked better than “humanistic” therapy in a few small trials. Humanistic therapy often focuses on personal growth and self‑insight. In one trial, behavioral activation helped more than medicine for mood. This was only one trial, with not many people. So we need more data before we can feel sure.

How easy was this care to stick with? The share of people who stopped care was close to the same for most matches. This includes CBT, wait list, no care, medicine, fake care, and usual care. In one look, more people may have left behavioral activation than usual care. But the data were not clear enough to say for sure. Some types of talk therapy did not have data on this.

What do these results mean for patients? Behavioral activation is a simple, hands‑on therapy. It may help as much as CBT, which is a common type of care. It may help more than usual care alone. It may help more than some other talk therapy and more than medicine in one small study. It may be a good choice when time, cost, or access to care are barriers. It may also help in places with few trained staff.

What are the limits? The strength of proof ranged from low to medium. Some matches had few trials or few people. Some results were less clear when checked in strict ways. We lack data for some types of care and for fake care on how well it works. We also need more trials that report results in the same, clear way.

What do the researchers suggest next? We need more high‑quality trials. We need better reports of how the care works. We need to learn who gains the most and why. For now, behavioral activation looks helpful for many adults with depression. It can be a sound option to discuss with a care team.","Behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults
Review question 
In this Cochrane review, we wanted to find out how well behavioural activation therapy works for depression in adults. 
Why this is important 
Depression is a common mental health problem that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in people, activities, and things that were once enjoyable. A person with depression may feel tearful, irritable, or tired most of the time, and may have problems with sleep, concentration, and memory. These and other symptoms can make daily life more difficult than usual. 
Treatments for depression include medications (antidepressants) and psychological therapies (talking therapies). Behavioural activation is a type of psychological therapy that encourages a person to develop or get back into activities which are meaningful to them. The therapy involved scheduling activities and monitoring behaviours and looking at specific situations where changing these behaviours and activities may be helpful. A therapist may support people in person, over the phone, or online, usually over multiple sessions. 
It is important to know whether behavioural activation could be an effective and acceptable treatment to offer to people with depression. 
What we did 
In January 2020, we searched for studies of behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults (aged over 18 years). We looked for randomised controlled trials, in which treatments were given to study participants at random; these studies give the most reliable evidence. 
We included 53 studies involving 5495 participants. The studies compared behavioural activation with no treatment, standard or usual care, a dummy treatment (placebo), taking medications, being on a waiting list for treatment, or other psychotherapies (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), third‐wave CBT, humanistic therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and integrative therapy). 
The studies were conducted in 14 countries; most were conducted in the USA (27 studies). Most studies lasted from four to 16 weeks. 
The outcomes we focussed on were how well the treatments worked and whether they were acceptable to participants. How well treatments worked (efficacy) was measured by the number of people who responded well to treatment or no longer met criteria for depression at the end of treatment. Acceptability was measured by counting how many people dropped out during the study. 
What did we find? 
Behavioural activation may treat depression better than receiving usual care. We were uncertain whether behavioural activation worked better than medication or being on a waiting list, and we found no evidence for this outcome comparing behavioural activation to no treatment or placebo treatment. 
We found no differences between behavioural activation and CBT in treating depression. Although we did not find enough evidence to compare behavioural activation reliably with other psychotherapies, it may work better than humanistic therapy, and we found no differences between behavioural activation and third‐wave CBT or psychodynamic therapy. No evidence was available comparing behavioural activation to integrative therapies. 
Behavioural activation is probably less acceptable to people than usual care. We found no differences in acceptability of behavioural activation compared with being on a waiting list, no treatment, taking antidepressants, or receiving a placebo treatment. We also found no differences in acceptability between behavioural activation and other psychotherapies studied (CBT, third‐wave CBT, humanistic therapy, integrative therapies). For behavioural activation compared with psychodynamic therapy, we found no evidence on treatment acceptability. 
Conclusions 
Behavioural activation may be an effective and acceptable treatment for depression in adults. Offering this therapy in practice would give people with depression greater treatment choice, and different formats and types of delivery could be explored to meet the demand for mental health support. Our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. 
Most findings were short‐term, meaning that we cannot be sure behavioural activation would be helpful to people with depression in the longer term. 
Certainty of the evidence 
Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence is mostly low to moderate. Some findings are based on only a few studies, with poorly reported results, in which the participants knew which treatment they received. Therefore, we are not sure how reliable the results are. Our conclusions may change if more studies are conducted.

10.1002-14651858.CD015077,"Background
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents the most severe course of COVID‐19 (caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus), usually resulting in a prolonged stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) and high mortality rates. Despite the fact that most affected individuals need invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), evidence on specific ventilation strategies for ARDS caused by COVID‐19 is scarce. Spontaneous breathing during IMV is part of a therapeutic concept comprising light levels of sedation and the avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA). This approach is potentially associated with both advantages (e.g. a preserved diaphragmatic motility and an optimised ventilation‐perfusion ratio of the ventilated lung), as well as risks (e.g. a higher rate of ventilator‐induced lung injury or a worsening of pulmonary oedema due to increases in transpulmonary pressure). As a consequence, spontaneous breathing in people with COVID‐19‐ARDS who are receiving IMV is subject to an ongoing debate amongst intensivists. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of early spontaneous breathing activity in invasively ventilated people with COVID‐19 with ARDS compared to ventilation strategies that avoid spontaneous breathing. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register (which includes CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, Clinical Trials.gov WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv) and the WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies from their inception to 2 March 2022.  
Selection criteria
Eligible study designs comprised randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated spontaneous breathing in participants with COVID‐19‐related ARDS compared to ventilation strategies that avoided spontaneous breathing (e.g. using NMBA or deep sedation levels). Additionally, we considered controlled before‐after studies, interrupted time series with comparison group, prospective cohort studies and retrospective cohort studies. For these non‐RCT studies, we considered a minimum total number of 50 participants to be compared as necessary for inclusion. Prioritised outcomes were all‐cause mortality, clinical improvement or worsening, quality of life, rate of (serious) adverse events and rate of pneumothorax. Additional outcomes were need for tracheostomy, duration of ICU length of stay and duration of hospitalisation.  
Data collection and analysis
We followed the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 
Two review authors independently screened all studies at the title/abstract and full‐text screening stage. We also planned to conduct data extraction and risk of bias assessment in duplicate. We planned to conduct meta‐analysis for each prioritised outcome, as well as subgroup analyses of mortality regarding severity of oxygenation impairment and duration of ARDS. In addition, we planned to perform sensitivity analyses for studies at high risk of bias, studies using NMBA in addition to deep sedation level to avoid spontaneous breathing and a comparison of preprints versus peer‐reviewed articles. We planned to assess the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.  
Main results
We identified no eligible studies for this review.
Authors' conclusions
We found no direct evidence on whether early spontaneous breathing in SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS is beneficial or detrimental to this particular group of patients.  RCTs comparing early spontaneous breathing with ventilatory strategies not allowing for spontaneous breathing in SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS are necessary to determine its value within the treatment of severely ill people with COVID‐19. Additionally, studies should aim to clarify whether treatment effects differ between people with SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS and people with non‐SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced ARDS. 
","Plain Title
Breathing Some on Your Own vs Full Machine Breathing in Severe COVID

Rationale
COVID-19 can cause a bad lung illness called ARDS. In ARDS, the lungs fill with fluid and get stiff. Oxygen levels fall. Many people need care in the intensive care unit, or ICU. This illness can lead to death.

Many of these people need a breathing machine. A tube goes into the windpipe to help them breathe. Doctors set the machine to protect the lungs. There is a key choice in this care. Should the person do some breaths on their own?

There may be good and bad parts to self-breathing. It may help keep the main breathing muscle strong. It may help air and blood flow match better in the lungs. But it may also strain the lungs. It may worsen lung swelling. It may cause more harm from the machine.

Some doctors use light sleep drugs. They avoid drugs that stop muscle movement. That plan can let a person breathe some on their own. Other doctors use deep sleep and drugs that stop muscles. That plan stops any effort to breathe.

We need clear proof to guide this choice. Does early self-breathing help or harm? This study set out to find that answer. The team looked for all good studies on this topic. They wanted to help patients and care teams choose well.

Trial Design
This was a careful review of research. It did not enroll new patients. The team set the plan before they began. They planned to find and judge all trials on this question. They aimed to avoid unfair results.

They searched many large research sites. These sites list trials and reports from around the world. They looked from the start of the pandemic to March 2, 2022. They used a broad search plan. They looked for both finished and ongoing work.

They planned to include certain study types. First, they looked for randomized trials. In these trials, a computer picks which care a person gets. Second, they could include some other study types. Those had to compare at least 50 people.

The people of interest had COVID-19 ARDS. They were on a breathing machine with a tube. The abstract did not list age or sex limits. The choice was early self-breathing versus no self-breathing. The no self-breathing plan could use deep sleep or muscle stop drugs.

They planned key outcomes. These included death from any cause. They looked at getting better or worse. They looked at life quality. They looked at serious harms and a collapsed lung.

They also planned to note other results. These were need for a small breathing hole in the neck, called a trach tube. They planned to check time in the ICU and in the hospital. They planned to combine results if they could. They would judge study quality with a standard method. They also planned checks to spot unfair or weak results.

This review did not put time demands on patients. It used data from past or running trials. So there was no set time that a person stayed in a study. That would depend on each trial, if found.

Results
They found no studies that met the rules. So they could not compare the two ways of breathing. They could not say which way helps more. They could not say which way harms more.

What does this mean for patients? Right now, we lack clear proof for this choice. Care teams must use their best skill and judgment. They must weigh the goals for each person. They should discuss risks and hopes with families.

How is this review useful? It shows a key gap in care for severe COVID. It sets a clear plan for future trials. It lists outcomes that matter to patients. It calls for fair and clear testing.

What should researchers do next? Run randomized trials on this choice. Start the self-breathing early in one group. Do not allow it in the other group. Track the outcomes that patients value.

The team also notes one more need. We should test if COVID ARDS acts the same as other ARDS. The cause may change the best plan. So trials should look at both types. That can guide care for all bad lung failure cases.

In sum, we do not yet know the best way. Letting people breathe some on their own may help. It may also harm in some cases. Only good trials can give a clear answer. Until then, care will be case by case.","Spontaneous breathing activity in COVID‐19‐related lung failure
Is early spontaneous breathing beneficial in the treatment of lung failure in individuals with COVID‐19? 
People with severe COVID‐19 can present with lung failure, which is called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This requires invasive mechanical ventilation through a breathing tube. It is possible to allow breathing, triggered by the patient (called spontaneous breathing), whilst being on a ventilator. However, it is unclear whether this is beneficial for such individuals, especially in the early phase of ventilation. 
Key messages 
We found no evidence if spontaneous breathing is beneficial in the treatment of lung failure due to COVID‐19. 
What are the advantages of early spontaneous breathing in ARDS?  
The advantage of spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation is the preserved movement of the diaphragm (the major muscle for breathing located under the lungs). It leads to better distribution of the inhaled air, especially in the pulmonary alveoli (small air sacs within the lungs) close to the diaphragm. In general, ventilation procedures with possible spontaneous breathing require lower doses of sedatives (which slow down brain activity). Since these can cause low blood pressure, it can additionally reduce the administration of cardiovascular medicines. 
Can early spontaneous breathing be harmful in the treatment of ARDS? 
During spontaneous breathing under mechanical ventilation, increased pressure fluctuations in the lungs may occur. Increased pressure difference within the lung is the main cause of ventilator‐associated lung injury. 
What is the alternative to using early spontaneous breathing? 
Spontaneous breathing may be suppressed by increased sedation or blockade of the nerves innervating muscles by medicines that allow for breathing (called neuromuscular blockade). The advantage of complete ventilator‐based breathing is a lower oxygen consumption of the muscles and the reduced risk of self‐inflicted lung injury. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of early spontaneous breathing activity in ventilated people with COVID‐19 with ARDS compared to ventilation strategies that avoid spontaneous breathing. 
What did we do?  
We searched for studies that compared early spontaneous breathing during invasive mechanical ventilation with mandatory invasive ventilation and neuromuscular blockade in people with ARDS related to COVID‐19. People could have been any age, sex or ethnicity.  
What did we find?  
After systematic search, we found no records that met the inclusion criteria.
Main results 
We identified no eligible studies for this review.
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
To date, there are no studies that have compared early spontaneous breathing during invasive mechanical ventilation to mandatory invasive ventilation without spontaneous breathing in people with ARDS related to COVID‐19.  
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
Our evidence is up‐to‐date to 2 March 2022.

10.1002-14651858.CD005231.pub3,"Can smokers be helped to reduce the harm caused by cigarette smoking by smoking fewer cigarettes or using different tobacco products? 
Background 
The best thing to do to reduce the harms caused by smoking is to quit, but some people may not want to do this or may feel that they are unable to stop smoking completely. Cutting down the number of cigarettes smoked daily or using different tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco or low‐tar cigarettes, may reduce some of the harm caused by smoking. It may also help people to stop smoking completely in the long term. On the other hand, reducing smoking or using other tobacco products may not improve health and could reduce a person's motivation to quit smoking altogether. It is important that we review the evidence to find out whether these approaches could help smokers who do not want to or cannot quit to reduce the harm caused by their smoking. We were mainly interested in whether these approaches improved the health of smokers, but also looked at smoking reduction and quitting rates. 
Study characteristics 
We found 20 randomised controlled trials that tested ways to help people to cut down the number of cigarettes they smoked. Some of these just advised smokers to smoke less, but most also provided them with a product to help them cut down: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, bupropion, electronic cigarettes (ecigs), or snus (a form of smokeless, oral tobacco). We also found four randomized controlled trials that tested the effects of using cigarettes designed to reduce the damage caused by smoking: reduced tar, carbon or nicotine cigarettes. Most of the studies used NRT to help people to reduce their smoking. All of the studies included people who were not planning to quit smoking soon. The research is current to October 2015. 
Key results 
Eight studies (with 3081 smokers) found that using NRT roughly doubled the likelihood of halving the number of cigarettes smoked each day, compared to using a placebo. Using NRT in this way also nearly doubled the likelihood of quitting completely. One trial each tested bupropion, varenicline, ecigs and snus to help reduce the harms caused by smoking, and there was no evidence that any of these treatments helped smokers to reduce the number of cigarettes they were smoking each day. This may be because there has not yet been enough research into these methods. Only one of the trials testing cigarettes designed to reduce risk measured their effect on the number of people quitting smoking. It found that people were not more likely to quit smoking if they used reduced‐nicotine cigarettes than if they smoked their usual cigarettes. We did not find any trials which reported the long‐term health effects of the treatments, and so it remains uncertain how much health benefit there is from reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day or smoking cigarettes designed to be less harmful. 
Quality of evidence 
The tobacco industry funded three of the included studies of cigarettes designed to reduce risk. None of the studies looked at whether there had been a long‐term change in the health of the users. We rate the quality of the evidence looking at how many people quit smoking as 'low' or 'very low', generally because the findings are based on a small number of studies. We need more studies to investigate methods of reducing the harm caused by continued smoking. These need to measure the health of the users over a long period. 
","1. Plain Title
Does smoking less or using other tobacco help your health?

2. Rationale
Smoking harms the heart, lungs, and more. The best way to cut harm is to quit. Some people cannot or do not want to quit now. Some try to smoke fewer cigarettes each day. Some try other tobacco or “safer” cigarettes.

Cutting down may lower harm or help with a later quit. But it may not help health. It may also lower the drive to quit. This review asked if these steps help. The team looked for fair tests in people who smoke.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of many fair tests. In these tests, people joined groups by chance. The team searched for studies through October 2015. They found 20 tests that tried to help people cut down. Some studies only gave advice to smoke less.

Most studies also gave a product to help with cutting down. Products included nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT. NRT gives nicotine without smoke. Some tests used varenicline or bupropion. These are stop smoking drugs.

Some tests used e‑cigarettes or snus, a smokeless oral tobacco. They also found four tests of cigarettes made to seem safer. These had lower tar, carbon, or nicotine. All studies enrolled people not ready to quit soon. The abstract did not give age or gender details.

The abstract did not state how long people stayed in each test. It also did not describe where the people lived. The review focused on smoking change and quitting. It also looked for health changes. Long term health data were not reported.

4. Results
Eight tests with 3,081 people looked at NRT. People using NRT were about two times more likely to cut down by half. They cut daily cigarettes by half more often than those using a dummy product. A dummy product is a look‑alike with no drug. People on NRT were also almost two times more likely to quit.

One test looked at bupropion. One test looked at varenicline. One test looked at e‑cigarettes. One test looked at snus. These did not show clear help in cutting daily smoking.

This may be due to too little research. There were only single tests for each product. We cannot rule in or rule out a benefit. More fair tests are needed to know. People should not assume these help with harm.

Four tests used cigarettes made to seem safer. Only one test checked quitting. People using reduced nicotine cigarettes did not quit more often. They quit at the same rate as those using usual cigarettes. We do not know if these change health risks.

No test tracked long term health changes. We do not know if cutting down helps health over time. We also do not know if “safer” cigarettes help health. Three tests of “safer” cigarettes had tobacco industry funds. This may affect how we read those results.

The proof for quitting was low or very low in quality. This was due to few and small tests. Results for health were missing. So we cannot say how much harm changes. We need larger and longer studies.

What does this mean for people who smoke? Quitting fully is still the best way to cut harm. For people not ready to quit, NRT may help cut down. It may also help some people quit later. We do not know the health gain from cutting down alone.

This review helps the field by pointing to gaps. It shows NRT may help people reduce and quit. It shows weak or no proof for other products so far. It shows “safer” cigarettes did not boost quitting. The authors call for long term health studies.","Can smokers be helped to reduce the harm caused by cigarette smoking by smoking fewer cigarettes or using different tobacco products?

Health services have traditionally been developed to focus on specific diseases or medical specialties. Involving consumers as partners in planning, delivering and evaluating health services may lead to services that are person‐centred and so better able to meet the needs of and provide care for individuals. Globally, governments recommend consumer involvement in healthcare decision‐making at the systems level, as a strategy for promoting person‐centred health services. However, the effects of this 'working in partnership' approach to healthcare decision‐making are unclear. Working in partnership is defined here as collaborative relationships between at least one consumer and health provider, meeting jointly and regularly in formal group formats, to equally contribute to and collaborate on health service‐related decision‐making in real time. In this review, the terms 'consumer' and 'health provider' refer to partnership participants, and 'health service user' and 'health service provider' refer to trial participants. 
This review of effects of partnership interventions was undertaken concurrently with a Cochrane Qualitative Evidence Synthesis (QES) entitled Consumers and health providers working in partnership for the promotion of person‐centred health services: a co‐produced qualitative evidence synthesis. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership, as an intervention to promote person‐centred health services. 
Search methods
We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases from 2000 to April 2019; PROQUEST Dissertations and Theses Global from 2016 to April 2019; and grey literature and online trial registries from 2000 until September 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, and cluster‐RCTs of ‘working in partnership’ interventions meeting these three criteria: both consumer and provider participants meet; they meet jointly and regularly in formal group formats; and they make actual decisions that relate to the person‐centredness of health service(s). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened most titles and abstracts. One review author screened a subset of titles and abstracts (i.e. those identified through clinical trials registries searches, those classified by the Cochrane RCT Classifier as unlikely to be an RCT, and those identified through other sources). Two review authors independently screened all full texts of potentially eligible articles for inclusion. In case of disagreement, they consulted a third review author to reach consensus. One review author extracted data and assessed risk of bias for all included studies and a second review author independently cross‐checked all data and assessments. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion, or by consulting a third review author to reach consensus. Meta‐analysis was not possible due to the small number of included trials and their heterogeneity; we synthesised results descriptively by comparison and outcome. We reported the following outcomes in GRADE ‘Summary of findings’ tables: health service alterations; the degree to which changed service reflects health service user priorities; health service users' ratings of health service performance; health service users' health service utilisation patterns; resources associated with the decision‐making process; resources associated with implementing decisions; and adverse events. 
Main results
We included five trials (one RCT and four cluster‐RCTs), with 16,257 health service users and more than 469 health service providers as trial participants. For two trials, the aims of the partnerships were to directly improve the person‐centredness of health services (via health service planning, and discharge co‐ordination). In the remaining trials, the aims were indirect (training first‐year medical doctors on patient safety) or broader in focus (which could include person‐centredness of health services that targeted the public/community, households or health service delivery to improve maternal and neonatal mortality). Three trials were conducted in high income‐countries, one was in a middle‐income country and one was in a low‐income country. Two studies evaluated working in partnership interventions, compared to usual practice without partnership (Comparison 1); and three studies evaluated working in partnership as part of a multi‐component intervention, compared to the same intervention without partnership (Comparison 2). No studies evaluated one form of working in partnership compared to another (Comparison 3). 
The effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership compared to usual practice without partnership are uncertain: only one of the two studies that assessed this comparison measured health service alteration outcomes, and data were not usable, as only intervention group data were reported. Additionally, none of the included studies evaluating this comparison measured the other primary or secondary outcomes we sought for the 'Summary of findings' table. 
We are also unsure about the effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership as part of a multi‐component intervention compared to the same intervention without partnership. Very low‐certainty evidence indicated there may be little or no difference on health service alterations or health service user health service performance ratings (two studies); or on health service user health service utilisation patterns and adverse events (one study each). No studies evaluating this comparison reported the degree to which health service alterations reflect health service user priorities, or resource use. 
Overall, our confidence in the findings about the effects of working in partnership interventions was very low due to indirectness, imprecision and publication bias, and serious concerns about risk of selection bias; performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias in most studies. 
Authors' conclusions
The effects of consumers and providers working in partnership as an intervention, or as part of a multi‐component intervention, are uncertain, due to a lack of high‐quality evidence and/or due to a lack of studies. Further well‐designed RCTs with a clear focus on assessing outcomes directly related to partnerships for patient‐centred health services are needed in this area, which may also benefit from mixed‐methods and qualitative research to build the evidence base.

Do patients and staff making decisions together improve care? A review of trials

Rationale
Many health services focus on one disease or one clinic. This can ignore what matters to each person. Care that fits each person is called person‑centred care. It aims to meet needs, goals, and values.

Many groups now ask for patient voice in health plans. They want patients to help plan, give, and judge care. We call this “working in partnership.” In this review, that means patients and staff meet as a group. They meet often and make real decisions about services.

Patients in this role can be patients, family, carers, or community members. Staff can be doctors, nurses, or managers. Together, they may shape how clinics run. This may help care fit people better.

But we do not yet know if this way helps. It could improve care plans and safety. It could also take time and staff and not change care. This study asked, does partnership improve person‑centred care?

Trial Design
This was a review of trials. Trials are studies where groups are set by chance. Some trials put people into groups. Others put whole clinics into groups. This is a “cluster” trial.

The team looked for trials from the year 2000 to 2019. They searched many research lists. They also checked trial registries and other sources. They set clear rules for which trials to include.

They found five trials that fit their rules. One trial put people into groups by chance. Four trials put clinics or wards into groups by chance. Trials took place in rich and less rich countries.

The trials had over 16,000 patients. They also had more than 469 staff. The patients used many types of services. Ages and health issues varied across trials.

Not all trials had the same goal. Two trials aimed to improve person‑centred care. One did this through service planning. One did this through better discharge plans.

Three trials had a broader or indirect aim. One focused on safety training for new doctors. Others worked on care for mothers and newborn babies. These could help person‑centred care as part of a larger change.

The trials tested two main ideas. Some compared partnership to usual care with no partnership. Others added partnership to a larger plan. They then compared that plan with and without partnership.

Time in the trials was not clear in this summary. The trials took place in many settings. Details on age and gender were not always given. The trials differed in design and what they measured.

Results
The review team could not pool the data. The trials were too different. They looked at each trial and outcome on its own. They then summed up what they found.

What outcomes did they check? They looked at changes made to services. They asked if changes matched what patients said they wanted. They looked at how patients rated the service.

They also looked at how often people used care. They looked at harm or bad events. They looked at time, money, and staff used to make or apply decisions. Not all trials reported on these.

First, partnership versus usual care: two trials tested this. Only one trial reported service changes. But it only gave data for the partnership group. So the team could not compare groups.

These two trials did not report on the other key outcomes. So the effect of partnership versus no partnership is not clear. We do not know if it helps, harms, or makes no difference.

Next, partnership as part of a larger plan: three trials tested this. The evidence here suggests little or no difference. This applied to service changes and patient ratings in two trials. It also applied to care use and bad events in one trial each.

These trials did not report if changes matched patient wishes. They also did not report on time, money, or staff used. So we do not know the effect on these outcomes.

The quality of the evidence was very low. There were few trials. The trials were small or varied in what they did. Many had problems in how they were run or reported.

These problems can tilt the results. Some trials may be missing. The trials did not measure all the same things. This lowers our trust in the results.

What does this mean for patients and staff? We do not yet know if formal partnership helps. It may help, or it may not change care. It also might help in some settings more than others.

The review shows a gap in proof. We need better trials on this question. Future trials should test partnership head‑to‑head with clear outcomes. They should track what matters to patients and to services.

Trials should also report time, money, and staff used. They should report any harms. Studies that ask people about their views can add depth. Together, this can build solid proof.

In short, the idea has promise. Many support it on values and rights. But current trials do not show clear gain or harm. We need strong new trials to be sure.","When healthcare consumers (patients, carers and family members) and healthcare providers work together as partners to plan, deliver and evaluate health services, what effects does this have? 
What are person‐centred health services? 
Traditionally, health services have been developed by healthcare providers and focus on specific diseases or medical specialties. Involving consumers as partners in planning, delivering and evaluating health services may lead to services that are better able to meet the needs of and provide care for individuals.  
Why we did this Cochrane review 
Governments worldwide recommend that healthcare providers work with consumers to promote person‐centred health services. However, the effects of healthcare providers and consumers working together are unclear. 
We reviewed the evidence from research studies to find out about the effects of healthcare providers and consumers working together to plan, deliver and evaluate health services. 
Specifically, we wanted to know if consumers and healthcare providers working together in partnership – in the form of regular meetings in which consumers and providers were invited to contribute as equals to decisions about health services – had an impact on: 
‐ changes to health services;
‐ the extent to which changes to health services reflected service users’ priorities;
‐ users’ ratings of health services;
‐ health service use; and
‐ time and money needed to make or act on decisions about health services.
We also wanted to find out if there were any unwanted (adverse) effects.    
What did we do? 
First, we searched the medical literature for studies that compared:
‐ consumers and healthcare providers working in partnership against usual practice or other strategies with no partnership; or 
‐ different ways of working in partnership (for example, with fewer or more consumers, or with online or face‐to‐face meetings). 
We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. 
What did we find? 
We found five studies that involved a total of 16,257 health service users and more than 469 health service providers. Three studies took place in high income‐countries and one each in middle‐ and low‐income countries. 
The studies compared:
‐ working in partnership against usual practice without partnership working (2 studies); and 
‐ working in partnership as part of a wider strategy to promote person‐centred health services, against the same wider strategy without partnership working (3 studies).   
No studies evaluated one form of working in partnership compared to another.
What are the main results of our review? 
The studies provided insufficient evidence to determine if working in partnership had any effects compared to usual practice or wider strategies with no working in partnership. 
No studies investigated:
‐ impacts on the extent to which changes to health services reflected service users’ priorities, or 
‐ the resources needed to make or act on decisions about health services.
Few studies investigated:
‐ impacts on changes to health services;
‐ users’ ratings of health services;
‐ health service use; and
‐ adverse events.
The few studies that did investigate these outcomes either did not report usable information or produced findings in which we have very little confidence. These studies were small, used methods likely to introduce errors in their results and focused on specific settings or populations. Their results are unlikely to reflect the results of all the studies that have been conducted in this area, some of which have not made their results public yet. 
What does this mean? 
There is not enough robust evidence to determine the effects of consumers and providers working in partnership to plan, deliver or evaluate health services. 
This review highlights the need for well‐designed studies with a clear focus on evaluating the effects of partnerships for promoting person‐centred care in health services. This area of research may also benefit from studies that investigate why certain partnerships between consumers and healthcare providers may be more successful than others, and an accompanying qualitative evidence synthesis addressing this aspect is forthcoming.

10.1002-14651858.CD013876.pub3,"Background
Olfactory dysfunction is a common consequence of COVID‐19 infection and persistent symptoms can have a profound impact on quality of life. At present there is little guidance on how best to treat this condition. A variety of interventions have been suggested to promote recovery, including medication and olfactory training. However, it is uncertain whether any intervention is of benefit. This is an update of the 2021 review with one additional study added.  
Objectives
1) To evaluate the benefits and harms of any intervention versus no treatment for people with persisting olfactory dysfunction due to COVID‐19 infection.  
2) To keep the evidence up‐to‐date, using a living systematic review approach. 
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the latest search was 20 October 2021.   
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with COVID‐19 related olfactory disturbance that had persisted for at least four weeks. We included any intervention compared to no treatment or placebo.  
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were the recovery of sense of smell, disease‐related quality of life and serious adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were the change in sense of smell, general quality of life, prevalence of parosmia and other adverse effects (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included two studies with 30 participants. The studies evaluated the following interventions: systemic corticosteroids plus intranasal corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant and palmitoylethanolamide plus luteolin.  
Systemic corticosteroids plus intranasal corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant compared to no intervention  
We included a single RCT with 18 participants who had anosmia for at least 30 days following COVID‐19 infection. Participants received a 15‐day course of oral corticosteroids combined with nasal irrigation (consisting of an intranasal corticosteroid/mucolytic/decongestant solution) or no intervention. Psychophysical testing was used to assess olfactory function at 40 days. This is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
Palmitoylethanolamide plus luteolin compared to no intervention  
We included a single RCT with 12 participants who had anosmia or hyposmia for at least 90 days following COVID‐19 infection. Participants received a 30‐day course of palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin or no intervention. Psychophysical testing was used to assess olfactory function at 30 days. This is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. 
Authors' conclusions
There is very limited evidence available on the efficacy and harms of treatments for persistent olfactory dysfunction following COVID‐19 infection. However, we have identified a number of ongoing trials in this area. As this is a living systematic review we will update the data regularly, as new results become available.

Treating smell loss after COVID-19: what do studies show?

2. Rationale
Many people lose their sense of smell after COVID-19. Some people also have a weak or odd sense of smell. This can last for weeks or months.

Smell loss can harm daily life. Food may taste bland. Safety can drop if you can not smell smoke or gas. Mood and sleep can also suffer.

Many ideas to treat this problem exist. Some use drugs. Some use smell training, which is a set plan to sniff scents. But we do not yet know what works best.

This study set out to find proof. The team asked two main things. Do any treatments help people get their sense of smell back? Do they cause harm?

The team will keep this work up to date over time. This type of work is a “living review.” It adds new trial results as they appear.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of trials. A review sums up all the best trials on a topic. It looks at how the trials were done and what they found.

The team looked for randomized trials. In these trials, people get a treatment or no treatment by chance. This helps make fair groups.

They only looked at people with smell loss from COVID-19. The smell problem had to last at least four weeks. The last search date for trials was October 20, 2021.

The team found two small trials. In total, there were 30 people. The abstract did not report age or sex details.

The first trial had 18 people. All had no sense of smell for at least 30 days. People took steroid pills for 15 days. Steroids are drugs that lower swelling. They also rinsed the nose with a drug mix. The mix had a nasal steroid, a mucus thinner, and a decongestant. A decongestant helps clear a stuffy nose. The other group got no treatment. The team tested smell around day 40. They used a standard smell test. In such tests, people sniff and report what they smell.

The second trial had 12 people. They had no or low sense of smell for at least 90 days. People took two compounds for 30 days. The names were palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin. The other group got no treatment. The team tested smell around day 30, using a standard smell test.

The trials planned to look at key outcomes. These included full recovery of smell, change in smell, and life quality due to smell loss. They also tracked serious side effects. They looked for other side effects too. These included nose bleeds and bloody nasal discharge. The team used a standard method to judge how sure we can be about the results.

4. Results
The two trials were very small. Each trial had few people and lasted a short time. The results were not clear.

In the trial with steroid pills plus the nose rinse, we can not tell if it helped. The same is true for harm. The study was too small to be sure. The smell test at day 40 did not give firm proof.

In the trial with palmitoylethanolamide plus luteolin, we can not tell if it helped. We also can not tell if it caused harm. The smell test at day 30 did not give firm proof.

The team judged the proof as very weak. This means we should be very careful when we read the results. With such small trials, chance can sway the numbers a lot.

So, what does this mean for patients now? Today, we do not have a proven drug that gets smell back after COVID-19. We also do not have clear proof on safety for these drugs in this setting. We need more and larger trials.

This review helps in two ways. First, it shows what we know now. Second, it shows what we still need to learn. It points the way for better trials.

New trials are under way. The team will add new results as they appear. This is the value of a living review. It keeps the facts fresh.

If you have smell loss after COVID-19, talk with your doctor. Ask about the lack of clear proof for these drugs. Ask about risks and what you can try. Some people may choose to wait. Some may join a trial. Both paths can help care and knowledge grow.

The investigators concluded that evidence is very limited. They can not draw firm conclusions from the numbers. For now, no treatment has clear proof of benefit for smell loss after COVID-19. More high-quality trials are needed.","Interventions for the treatment of persistent smell disorders (olfactory dysfunction) after COVID‐19 infection 
Why this is important 
The sense of smell is critical to one's enjoyment of odours and tastes, and is important for safety. During the COVID‐19 pandemic there has been an increasing focus on change in sense of smell as one of the early symptoms associated with infection. This can be a reduction, change or complete loss of the sense of smell. For most people this is temporary, however for some this lasts weeks or even months. If a person has lost their sense of smell for a long time (over four weeks after having COVID‐19), we do not know if there are any treatments that might help it to recover.  
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
We searched the medical literature, identifying relevant studies and summarising the results. We assessed the quality of the studies as well as the certainty of the evidence. Factors influencing this included the size of the studies, the methods used to perform them and how results were reported by researchers. Based on this, we classed the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found two small studies to include in the review, including a total of 30 people. All participants had problems with their sense of smell that had lasted for at least four weeks, and started after a COVID‐19 infection. Problems with the sense of smell were identified using special smell identification tests carried out by the research team. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: those who would receive treatment and those who would not.  
The treatment in one study was a course of corticosteroid tablets ('systemic') and nasal irrigation (with a wash consisting of a mix of corticosteroids, decongestant and an agent that breaks down mucus). The second study used a course of a supplement known as palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin.  
Systemic corticosteroids and nasal irrigation (intranasal corticosteroids/decongestant/mucolytic) compared to no treatment 
We do not know whether corticosteroid tablets with nasal irrigation is better or worse than no treatment at: 
 ‐ restoring the sense of smell back to normal after 40 days; ‐ changing the sense of smell after 40 days; ‐ causing any unwanted side effects. 
This is because the evidence that we found was of very low certainty, mainly due to the fact that only one study was identified and it included a small number of patients. 
Palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin compared to no treatment 
We do not know whether palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin is better or worse than no treatment at: 
 ‐ restoring the sense of smell back to normal after 30 days; ‐ changing the sense of smell after 30 days; ‐ causing any unwanted side effects. 
This is because the evidence that we found was of very low certainty, mainly due to the fact that only one study was identified and it included a small number of patients. 
We did find a number of other studies that are being carried out, but no results from these studies are yet available to be included in this review. 
What this means 
It is unclear whether using corticosteroids with nasal irrigation, or using a palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin supplement, might treat problems with the sense of smell after COVID‐19, or whether these treatments can potentially cause harm. 
Other treatments are under investigation. This review is a 'living systematic review', meaning that we will keep checking for new studies that might be relevant, and the review will be continually updated when any extra results are available. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to October 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013397.pub2,"Background
Leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg that can last weeks, months or even years. Most leg ulcers are the result of venous diseases. First‐line treatment options often include the use of compression bandages or stockings. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of using compression bandages or stockings, compared with no compression, on the healing of venous leg ulcers in any setting and population. 
Search methods
In June 2020 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions by language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials that compared any types of compression bandages or stockings with no compression in participants with venous leg ulcers in any setting. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, and risk‐of‐bias assessment using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool. We assessed the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE methodology. 
Main results
We included 14 studies (1391 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 51 participants). Participants were recruited from acute‐care settings, outpatient settings and community settings, and a large proportion (65.9%; 917/1391) of participants had a confirmed history or clinical evidence of chronic venous disease, a confirmed cause of chronic venous insufficiency, or an ankle pressure/brachial pressure ratio of greater than 0.8 or 0.9. The average age of participants ranged from 58.0 to 76.5 years (median: 70.1 years). The average duration of their leg ulcers ranged from 9.0 weeks to 31.6 months (median: 22.0 months), and a large proportion of participants (64.8%; 901/1391) had ulcers with an area between 5 and 20 cm2. Studies had a median follow‐up of 12 weeks. Compression bandages or stockings applied included short‐stretch bandage, four‐layer compression bandage, and Unna's boot (a type of inelastic gauze bandage impregnated with zinc oxide), and comparator groups used included 'usual care', pharmacological treatment, a variety of dressings, and a variety of treatments where some participants received compression (but it was not the norm). Of the 14 included studies, 10 (71.4%) presented findings which we consider to be at high overall risk of bias. 
Primary outcomes 
There is moderate‐certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias) (1) that there is probably a shorter time to complete healing of venous leg ulcers in people wearing compression bandages or stockings compared with those not wearing compression (pooled hazard ratio for time‐to‐complete healing 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 3.10; I2 = 59%; 5 studies, 733 participants); and (2) that people treated using compression bandages or stockings are more likely to experience complete ulcer healing within 12 months compared with people with no compression (10 studies, 1215 participants): risk ratio for complete healing 1.77, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.21; I2 = 65% (8 studies with analysable data, 1120 participants); synthesis without meta‐analysis suggests more completely‐healed ulcers in compression bandages or stockings than in no compression (2 studies without analysable data, 95 participants). 
It is uncertain whether there is any difference in rates of adverse events between using compression bandages or stockings and no compression (very low‐certainty evidence; 3 studies, 585 participants). 
Secondary outcomes 
Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that people using compression bandages or stockings probably have a lower mean pain score than those not using compression (four studies with 859 participants and another study with 69 ulcers): pooled mean difference −1.39, 95% CI −1.79 to −0.98; I2 = 65% (two studies with 426 participants and another study with 69 ulcers having analysable data); synthesis without meta‐analysis suggests a reduction in leg ulcer pain in compression bandages or stockings, compared with no compression (two studies without analysable data, 433 participants). Compression bandages or stockings versus no compression may improve disease‐specific quality of life, but not all aspects of general health status during the follow‐up of 12 weeks to 12 months (four studies with 859 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
It is uncertain if the use of compression bandages or stockings is more cost‐effective than not using them (three studies with 486 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
If using compression bandages or stockings, people with venous leg ulcers probably experience complete wound healing more quickly, and more people have wounds completely healed. The use of compression bandages or stockings probably reduces pain and may improve disease‐specific quality of life. There is uncertainty about adverse effects, and cost effectiveness. 
Future research should focus on comparing alternative bandages and stockings with the primary endpoint of time to complete wound healing alongside adverse events including pain score, and health‐related quality of life, and should incorporate cost‐effectiveness analysis where possible. Future studies should adhere to international standards of trial conduct and reporting.

Do tight leg wraps help heal vein leg sores?

Rationale
A leg ulcer is an open sore on the lower leg.
Many ulcers come from vein problems in the leg.
These sores can last weeks, months, or even years.
They are hard to heal and often come back.

Many people use tight wraps or stockings on the leg.
These are called compression bandages or compression stockings.
They press on the leg in a firm and even way.
Doctors often choose them as a first treatment.

This study asked a clear question.
Do compression wraps or stockings help these sores heal?
Do they also ease pain or help daily life?
We also wanted to know about harms and cost.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials.
The team looked for the best kind of trials.
These are trials where people are put into groups by chance.
One group used compression. The other group did not.

The search ended in June 2020.
The team found 14 trials with 1,391 people.
People took part in clinics, hospitals, and at home.
Most were older adults. The average age was about 70 years.

Most people had clear signs of vein disease.
Their sores had been there for a long time.
Some sores had lasted many months or even years.
Many sores were mid-sized, not very small or very large.

People used several kinds of wraps.
These included short-stretch wraps and four-layer wraps.
Some used an Unna boot. It is a stiff gauze wrap.
The other group had care without compression.

Most trials watched people for about 12 weeks.
Some trials followed people for up to 12 months.
We judged the quality of each trial.
Some trials had limits that could affect trust.

Results
People who used compression healed sooner.
More people in that group had a fully closed sore.
This was seen across many trials.
We have a moderate level of trust in this result.

By one year, more people healed with compression.
The size of the benefit was clear.
It was close to two times as many people.
This means compression likely helps many people heal.

Pain was also lower with compression.
People said their pain scores went down.
This was shown in several trials.
We have a moderate level of trust in this result.

Some parts of daily life got better.
This was true for leg ulcer problems in daily life.
But not all parts of general health got better.
We have a low level of trust in this result.

We do not know if harms were different.
Few trials reported side effects in a clear way.
So we cannot say if compression had more harms.
We have a very low level of trust in this area.

We also do not know about cost value.
Few trials measured cost in a full way.
So we cannot say if compression saves money.
We have a very low level of trust in this area.

These findings matter for care.
Compression is a common first treatment.
This review shows it likely helps sores heal.
It also likely eases pain from the sore.

But we still need better trials.
We need trials that compare types of wraps.
They should track time to full healing.
They should also track pain, harms, life quality, and cost.

What does this mean for you?
If you have a vein leg ulcer, wraps may help.
They likely help the sore close faster.
They also likely ease pain from the sore.

Not everyone can use tight wraps.
Some people have other health needs.
Talk with your nurse or doctor about your case.
Ask if compression is safe and right for you.

In short, here is the takeaway.
Compression bandages or stockings likely help sores heal.
They likely lower pain from the sore.
We still need better data on harms and cost.","Compression bandages or stockings versus no compression for treating venous leg ulcers
Key messages 
Compared with not using compression, compression therapy that uses bandages or stockings to treat venous leg ulcers: 
‐ probably heals venous leg ulcers more quickly;
‐ probably increases the number of people whose ulcer has completely healed after 12 months; 
‐ probably reduces pain; and
‐ may improve some aspects of people’s quality of life.
However, there is still uncertainty about whether or not compression therapy causes unwanted side effects, and if the health benefits of using compression outweigh its cost. 
What are leg ulcers? 
Leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg that can last weeks, months or even years. Most leg ulcers are caused by venous diseases that affect the circulation of blood in leg veins. Venous leg ulcers can cause distress and pain to patients, and can be very costly to the health service. 
What did we want to find out? 
Standard treatment options for venous leg ulcers often include compression therapy. This involves applying external pressure around the lower leg to help the return of blood from the legs to the heart. Compression therapy uses bandages, stockings or other devices. 
We wanted to find out if compression therapy delivered by bandages and stockings compared with no compression: 
‐ heals venous leg ulcers;
‐ has any unwanted effects;
‐ improves people’s quality of life;
‐ has health benefits that outweigh the costs (cost‐effectiveness); and
‐ reduces pain.
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where the treatment or care people receive is chosen at random). This type of study design provides the most reliable health evidence about the effects of a treatment. We searched for studies that evaluated the effects of any types of compression bandages or stockings compared with no compression in people affected with venous leg ulcers in any care setting. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found 14 studies (1391 people, average age: 70.1 years) that lasted on average for 12 weeks. People in eight of the 14 studies were treated in outpatient and community settings. People had venous leg ulcers that had lasted for 22 months on average, and most ulcers had an area between 5 and 20 cm2. 
The studies used three types of compression therapy: short‐stretch bandage, four‐layer compression bandage, and Unna's boot (a type of compression bandage containing zinc oxide). These therapies were compared with no compression in forms of 'usual care', pharmacological treatment, a variety of dressings, and a variety of treatments where only some participants received compression (but it was not the norm). 
(1) Venous leg‐ulcer healing and unwanted effects  
Compared with no compression, the evidence suggests that:
‐ people wearing compression bandages or stockings probably experience complete ulcer healing more quickly; and 
‐ more people treated using the compression bandages or stockings are likely to experience complete ulcer healing within 12 months. 
However, we did not find clear evidence to tell if using compression bandages or stockings causes any unwanted effects. 
(2) Other effects  
The evidence suggests that, compared with not using compression, the use of compression bandages or stockings: 
‐ probably reduces pain more than not using compression; and
‐ may improve some aspects of people’s quality of life in 12 weeks to 12 months.
However, we are uncertain if the use of compression bandages or stockings results in health benefits that outweigh their costs. 
What limited our confidence in the evidence? 
Most studies were small (51 people on average) and 10 of the 14 included studies used methods that could introduce errors in their results. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to June 2020.

10.1002-14651858.MR000006.pub3,"Background
The tendency for authors to submit, and of journals to accept, manuscripts for publication based on the direction or strength of the study findings has been termed publication bias. 
Objectives
To assess the extent to which publication of a cohort of clinical trials is influenced by the statistical significance, perceived importance, or direction of their results. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Methodology Register (The Cochrane Library [Online] Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to March Week 2 2007), EMBASE (1980 to Week 11 2007) and Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (March 21 2007). We also searched the Science Citation Index (April 2007), checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted researchers to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Studies containing analyses of the association between publication and the statistical significance or direction of the results (trial findings), for a cohort of registered clinical trials. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data. We classified findings as either positive (defined as results classified by the investigators as statistically significant (P < 0.05), or perceived as striking or important, or showing a positive direction of effect) or negative (findings that were not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05), or perceived as unimportant, or showing a negative or null direction in effect). We extracted information on other potential risk factors for failure to publish, when these data were available. 
Main results
Five studies were included. Trials with positive findings were more likely to be published than trials with negative or null findings (odds ratio 3.90; 95% confidence interval 2.68 to 5.68). This corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.78 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.95), assuming that 41% of negative trials are published (the median among the included studies, range = 11% to 85%). In absolute terms, this means that if 41% of negative trials are published, we would expect that 73% of positive trials would be published. 
Two studies assessed time to publication and showed that trials with positive findings tended to be published after four to five years compared to those with negative findings, which were published after six to eight years. Three studies found no statistically significant association between sample size and publication. One study found no significant association between either funding mechanism, investigator rank, or sex and publication. 
Authors' conclusions
Trials with positive findings are published more often, and more quickly, than trials with negative findings.

Do trials with good results get published more?

Rationale
Doctors and patients need clear facts. We get many facts from reports of trials. A trial is a test in people. It checks if a care helps or harms.

But not all trials get shared. Some trials never get to print. This is called publication bias. It means what we read can be one sided.

Here is why that matters. If only “good news” gets out, care may seem better than it is. Risks may seem small. Doctors may pick care that is not best. Patients may miss other good choices.

This study looked at that risk. The team asked a simple question. Do trials with “good” results get to print more? Do they get to print faster? They also asked if other things play a role.

The study is needed to guide safe care. If bias is real, we must fix it. The study helps show how big the gap may be. It also helps us plan better rules.

Trial Design
This was not a drug trial. No patients got a study drug here. The team did a review of past work. They looked at reports that tracked groups of trials.

They searched large health and science files. The search covered work from 1950 to 2007. They also checked lists of papers for more clues. They asked other teams for any missed work.

They set clear rules to pick studies. Each study had to track a group of trials. The trials had to be set up first and then watched. The study had to test if results linked to who got to print.

They sorted trial results into two types. “Positive” results showed a clear benefit. Or the team saw them as big or key. “Negative” or “null” results did not show a clear benefit.

Five studies met all the rules. These studies followed many trials over time. The trials were on people with many health needs. This review looked at how often and how fast they got to print.

There were no new visits or tests for people. No one had to join a new study. There was no set time in the study for patients. The work used data already on file.

Results
The main result was clear. Trials with “good” results got to print more. Trials with “not good” results got to print less.

Here is a simple way to see it. Think of ten trials with not good results. About four of those ten got to print. Now think of ten trials with good results. About seven of those ten got to print.

Time also mattered. Trials with good results got to print sooner. They came out in about four to five years. Trials with not good results took longer. They came out in about six to eight years.

The team also looked at other things. Three studies checked trial size. They found no clear link to print chance. So small trials did not seem less likely to print.

One study looked at money source and who led the work. It checked job rank and sex of the lead. It found no clear link to who got to print. So these things did not seem to drive the gap.

What does this mean for patients? We may not see the full picture. If we see more good news than bad, care can look better. That can shape advice you get. It can change what you choose.

This work helps the field in a key way. It shows the size of the problem. It shows that time to print also skews the facts. Fast “good news” and slow “bad news” can tilt reviews.

The study did not test fixes. But the lesson is plain. We need all trial results, good or not. We need them shared in a fair time frame. That helps you and your care team judge well.

The authors drew a firm close. Trials with good results are more likely to be shared. They also get shared faster. Trials with not good results are shared less, and later.

In short, what gets shared can shape what we think is true. Full and fast sharing can help keep care safe and sound.","Publication bias in clinical trials due to statistical significance or direction of trial results 
The validity of a systematic review depends on the methods used to conduct the review. If there is a systematic bias, such that studies with statistically significant or positive findings are more likely to be published and included in systematic reviews than trials with non‐significant findings, then the validity of a review's conclusions can be threatened. 
This methodology review identified five studies that investigated the extent to which the publication of clinical trials (such as those approved by an ethics review board) is influenced by the statistical significance or direction of a trial's results. These studies showed that trials with positive findings (defined either as those that were statistically significant (P < 0.05), or those findings perceived to be important or striking, or those indicating a positive direction of treatment effect), had nearly four times the odds of being published compared to findings that were not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05), or perceived as unimportant, or showing a negative or null direction of treatment effect. This corresponds to a risk ratio of 1.78 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.95), assuming that 41% of negative trials are published.Two studies found that trials with positive findings also tended to be published more quickly than trials with negative findings. The size of the trial (assessed in three studies) and the source of funding, academic rank, and sex of the principal investigator (assessed in one study) did not appear to influence whether a trial was published. 
These results provide support for mandating that clinical trials are registered before recruiting participants so that review authors know about all potentially eligible studies, regardless of their findings. Those carrying out systematic reviews should ensure they assess the potential problems of publication bias in their review and consider methods for addressing this issue by ensuring a comprehensive search for both published and unpublished trials.

Previous research on animal and physiological models suggests that antioxidant supplements have beneficial effects that may prolong life. Some observational studies also suggest that antioxidant supplements may prolong life, whereas other observational studies demonstrate neutral or harmful effects. Our Cochrane review from 2008 demonstrated that antioxidant supplements seem to increase mortality. This review is now updated. 
The present systematic review included 78 randomised clinical trials. In total, 296,707 participants were randomised to antioxidant supplements (beta‐carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium) versus placebo or no intervention. Twenty‐six trials included 215,900 healthy participants. Fifty‐two trials included 80,807 participants with various diseases in a stable phase (including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurological, ocular, dermatological, rheumatoid, renal, endocrinological, or unspecified diseases). A total of 21,484 of 183,749 participants (11.7%) randomised to antioxidant supplements and 11,479 of 112,958 participants (10.2%) randomised to placebo or no intervention died. The trials appeared to have enough statistical similarity that they could be combined. When all of the trials were combined, antioxidants may or may not have increased mortality depending on which statistical combination method was employed; the analysis that is typically used when similarity is present demonstrated that antioxidant use did slightly increase mortality (that is, the patients consuming the antioxidants were 1.03 times as likely to die as were the controls). When analyses were done to identify factors that were associated with this finding, the two factors identified were better methodology to prevent bias from being a factor in the trial (trials with ‘low risk of bias’) and the use of vitamin A. In fact, when the trials with low risks of bias were considered separately, the increased mortality was even more pronounced (1.04 times as likely to die as were the controls). The potential damage from vitamin A disappeared when only the low risks of bias trials were considered. The increased risk of mortality was associated with beta‐carotene and possibly vitamin E and vitamin A, but was not associated with the use of vitamin C or selenium. The current evidence does not support the use of antioxidant supplements in the general population or in patients with various diseases.

Do antioxidant vitamin pills help people live longer?

Rationale
Many people take antioxidant pills. These include beta-carotene and vitamins A, C, and E. They also include selenium. Makers say these pills block harm to our cells.

Some lab and animal tests looked good. Some human reports looked good, too. Other human reports found no help or even harm. People want to know the truth.

The big question was simple. Do these pills help people live longer? Or do they do harm? The team updated a past review to test this.

This study matters for many groups. It matters for healthy people who take daily pills. It matters for people with long-term illness who hope pills may help. It also matters for doctors who give advice.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. A review like this looks for all good trials on a topic. The team then sums up the results. They use set rules to do this.

All the trials were random. That means people got pills or no pills by chance. Some got a “placebo.” That is a dummy pill with no vitamin. Others got no extra pill at all.

The review looked at 78 trials. In total, 296,707 people took part. The pills were beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium. The team then compared them with placebo or no pill.

Twenty-six trials had healthy people. These trials had 215,900 people. Fifty-two trials had people with long-term, stable illness. These trials had 80,807 people.

The long-term illnesses were of many types. They included gut, heart, brain, eye, skin, joint, kidney, hormone, or not stated. Ages and gender were not given here. How long each trial ran was not given here.

Results
The main question was life or death during the trials. In the pill groups, 21,484 of 183,749 people died. In the no pill groups, 11,479 of 112,958 people died. The team then combined the results.

How you combine trials can change the answer. The trials were similar enough to combine in the usual way. With that method, the pill groups did worse. People on the pills were 1.03 times as likely to die.

The team also looked at trial quality. Some trials had better methods. These trials tend to give more true answers. In those higher quality trials, the harm looked a bit stronger.

In the better trials, people on the pills were 1.04 times as likely to die. The team also looked at each vitamin. Beta-carotene linked to more deaths. Vitamin E and vitamin A may also link to more deaths. Vitamin C and selenium did not link to more deaths.

The team took one more hard look. They checked the better trials for vitamin A. In those better trials, the vitamin A harm was not seen. But the total signal of harm from the pills stayed.

What does this mean for you? These pills did not help people live longer. In fact, people who took them were a bit more likely to die. This was true for healthy people. It was also true for people with long-term, stable illness.

This big review is key for care. It pulled in results from many trials and many people. The results were steady across the better trials. The answer is clear.

The study team gave a firm view. The current proof does not support these pills for most people. This includes healthy people. It also includes people with many long-term illnesses.

Talk with your doctor before you start any pill. Ask about your goals and your risks. Ask if a pill helps you live longer or feel better. Based on this work, these antioxidant pills do not help you live longer. They may do harm.","Antioxidant supplements for prevention of mortality in healthy participants and patients with various diseases

10.1002-14651858.CD013229.pub2,"Background
Smoking is a leading cause of disease and death worldwide. In people who smoke, quitting smoking can reverse much of the damage. Many people use behavioural interventions to help them quit smoking; these interventions can vary substantially in their content and effectiveness. 
Objectives
To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effect of behavioural interventions designed to support smoking cessation attempts and to conduct a network meta‐analysis to determine how modes of delivery; person delivering the intervention; and the nature, focus, and intensity of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation influence the likelihood of achieving abstinence six months after attempting to stop smoking; and whether the effects of behavioural interventions depend upon other characteristics, including population, setting, and the provision of pharmacotherapy. 
To summarise the availability and principal findings of economic evaluations of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation, in terms of comparative costs and cost‐effectiveness, in the form of a brief economic commentary. 
Methods
This work comprises two main elements. 1. We conducted a Cochrane Overview of reviews following standard Cochrane methods. We identified Cochrane Reviews of behavioural interventions (including all non‐pharmacological interventions, e.g. counselling, exercise, hypnotherapy, self‐help materials) for smoking cessation by searching the Cochrane Library in July 2020. We evaluated the methodological quality of reviews using AMSTAR 2 and synthesised data from the reviews narratively. 2. We used the included reviews to identify randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation compared with other behavioural interventions or no intervention for smoking cessation. To be included, studies had to include adult smokers and measure smoking abstinence at six months or longer. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. We synthesised data using Bayesian component network meta‐analysis (CNMA), examining the effects of 38 different components compared to minimal intervention. Components included behavioural and motivational elements, intervention providers, delivery modes, nature, focus, and intensity of the behavioural intervention. We used component network meta‐regression (CNMR) to evaluate the influence of population characteristics, provision of pharmacotherapy, and intervention intensity on the component effects. We evaluated certainty of the evidence using GRADE domains. We assumed an additive effect for individual components. 
Main results
We included 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which 312 randomised controlled trials, representing 250,563 participants and 845 distinct study arms, met the criteria for inclusion in our component network meta‐analysis. This represented 437 different combinations of components. Of the 33 reviews, confidence in review findings was high in four reviews and moderate in nine reviews, as measured by the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool. The remaining 20 reviews were low or critically low due to one or more critical weaknesses, most commonly inadequate investigation or discussion (or both) of the impact of publication bias. Of note, the critical weaknesses identified did not affect the searching, screening, or data extraction elements of the review process, which have direct bearing on our CNMA. Of the included studies, 125/312 were at low risk of bias overall, 50 were at high risk of bias, and the remainder were at unclear risk. Analyses from the contributing reviews and from our CNMA showed behavioural interventions for smoking cessation can increase quit rates, but effectiveness varies on characteristics of the support provided. There was high‐certainty evidence of benefit for the provision of counselling (odds ratio (OR) 1.44, 95% credibility interval (CrI) 1.22 to 1.70, 194 studies, n = 72,273) and guaranteed financial incentives (OR 1.46, 95% CrI 1.15 to 1.85, 19 studies, n = 8877). Evidence of benefit remained when removing studies at high risk of bias. These findings were consistent with pair‐wise meta‐analyses from contributing reviews. There was moderate‐certainty evidence of benefit for interventions delivered via text message (downgraded due to unexplained statistical heterogeneity in pair‐wise comparison), and for the following components where point estimates suggested benefit but CrIs incorporated no clinically significant difference: individual tailoring; intervention content including motivational components; intervention content focused on how to quit. The remaining intervention components had low‐to very low‐certainty evidence, with the main issues being imprecision and risk of bias. There was no evidence to suggest an increase in harms in groups receiving behavioural support for smoking cessation. Intervention effects were not changed by adjusting for population characteristics, but data were limited. Increasing intensity of behavioural support, as measured through the number of contacts, duration of each contact, and programme length, had point estimates associated with modestly increased chances of quitting, but CrIs included no difference. The effect of behavioural support for smoking cessation appeared slightly less pronounced when people were already receiving smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. 
Authors' conclusions
Behavioural support for smoking cessation can increase quit rates at six months or longer, with no evidence that support increases harms. This is the case whether or not smoking cessation pharmacotherapy is also provided, but the effect is slightly more pronounced in the absence of pharmacotherapy. Evidence of benefit is strongest for the provision of any form of counselling, and guaranteed financial incentives. Evidence suggested possible benefit but the need of further studies to evaluate: individual tailoring; delivery via text message, email, and audio recording; delivery by lay health advisor; and intervention content with motivational components and a focus on how to quit. We identified 23 economic evaluations; evidence did not consistently suggest one type of behavioural intervention for smoking cessation was more cost‐effective than another. Future reviews should fully consider publication bias. Tools to investigate publication bias and to evaluate certainty in CNMA are needed.

Which kinds of support help people quit smoking?

Rationale
Smoking harms health and shortens life.  
Quitting can undo much of the harm.  
Many support types exist. Some work better than others.  
Behavior help means help with habits, like counseling or text tips.  
We wanted to find which types help most, and if costs differ.

Trial Design
We used trusted health reviews called Cochrane Reviews.  
We pulled data from many quit studies.  
We looked at adults who smoke.  
We checked if they had quit six months or more later.  
We compared many kinds of behavior help at once.

We found 312 trials with over 250,000 people.  
These trials tested 38 parts of support programs.  
Parts included counseling, guaranteed money rewards, and text tips.  
We also looked at who gave the help.  
We checked if people also used stop‑smoking medicine.

We also looked at how the help was given, like by text or email.  
We checked how strong and fair each trial was.  
Some trials were strong. Others were less clear.  
This helps judge how sure we can be.  
We rated how sure the effects were.

Results
Behavior help made more people quit than little or no help.  
We saw no extra harms from getting this help.  
Counseling had the best proof of benefit.  
Money rewards that were guaranteed also helped people quit.  
These results stayed true in stricter studies.

Text message help likely works.  
Tailored advice for each person may help.  
Programs with strong motivation parts may help.  
Programs that teach how to quit may help.  
But these need more good studies.

Email or audio help may help. More study is needed.  
Help from trained lay helpers may help too.  
More or longer sessions may help a little.  
But we are not sure about the size of the effect.  
Using stop‑smoking medicine slightly reduced the extra boost from behavior help.

Who took part did not change results much.  
But data on this were limited.  
These findings lined up with past reviews.  
We did not see more side effects in support groups.  
This adds to trust in the results.

We found 23 cost studies.  
No one support type was clearly the best value.  
Some types may cost more in some places.  
Others may cost less.  
More cost work would help health plans choose.

Many reviews had weaker methods.  
Missing or hidden studies can tilt results.  
Future work should check for this risk.  
We also need better tools for these large study types.  
This will make the results even more sure.

In sum, behavior help helps people quit for six months or more.  
It is safe based on the studies we saw.  
Counseling and guaranteed money rewards stand out.  
Text tips and tailored advice also look helpful.  
More high‑quality studies can show how to use them best.

What does this mean for people who smoke?  
Adding counseling can raise your chance to quit.  
Money rewards tied to quitting can also help.  
Text or email help may give extra support.  
Medicine to quit plus support can still help you, too.

These results can guide care and programs.  
Clinics and health plans can use them to plan services.  
Better studies and cost checks will help next.  
This may help more people quit for good.  
Quitting brings health gains at any age.","Does behavioural support help people to stop smoking?
Key messages 
Behavioural support can help more people to stop smoking for six months or longer, without causing unwanted effects. 
Some types of support appear to work better than others. More studies are needed to identify the best ways to support people who are trying to stop smoking, and to identify the best people to support them. 
Stopping smoking 
The best thing people who smoke can do for their health is to stop smoking.
Most people who smoke want to stop, but many find it difficult. People who smoke may use medicines to help them stop. Behavioural support provides an alternative – or additional – way to help people stop smoking. Sometimes behavioural support can be combined with nicotine replacement or other medicines to help people stop smoking. 
Types of behavioural support can include: advice and counselling on ways to make it easier to stop smoking; information about why or how to stop; or a combination. Behavioural support can be given in group sessions or one‐to‐one. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out:
– which types of behavioural support work best to help people stop smoking;
– the best ways to give behavioural support (including the best people to give it); and 
– what aspects of behavioural support help someone to stop smoking.
We also wanted to know if behavioural support can cause any unwanted effects.
What did we do? 
We searched for Cochrane Reviews of behavioural support to stop smoking, to identify relevant studies of adults who smoked. We then compared the studies with each other, to find out how well the different types of behavioural support helped people to stop smoking. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to July 2020. 
What we found 
We found 33 Cochrane Reviews, from which we identified 312 relevant studies in 250,503 adults (aged 18 to 63 years) who smoked cigarettes. The studies investigated 437 different combinations of ways to stop smoking. 
Most studies were conducted in the USA or Western Europe; 115 studies took place in healthcare settings and 195 took place in the community. On average, people taking part in the studies were followed up for 10.5 months. 
The studies compared the effects of behavioural support with:
– no behavioural support;
– usual or standard care;
– less‐intense forms of the behavioural support; or other approaches.
We compared all treatments with each other using a mathematical method called network meta‐analysis. 
What are the main results of our review? 
Compared with no behavioural support it was clear that some types of behavioural support increased people's chances of quitting for six months or longer, including: counselling and giving them money for successfully stopping smoking. More people stopped smoking with these types of support whether or not they were also taking medicines to help them stop smoking. 
Behavioural support by text messages probably helped more people to stop smoking than no support. 
Compared with no support, tailoring behavioural support to the person, or group of people, trying to stop smoking probably slightly increased how many of them stopped smoking, as did support that focused on how to stop smoking. 
Increasing the intensity of the support given, such as contacting people more often or having longer sessions, modestly increased how many people stopped smoking. 
We are uncertain about:
– the effects of other types of behavioural support, including hypnotherapy, exercise‐based support, and entering competitions; and 
– the effect of who gives the behavioural support.
Only some studies reported results for unwanted effects; in these, behavioural support did not increase the numbers of any unwanted effects. 
How confident are we in our results? 
We are confident that counselling and rewards of money help people to stop smoking; we do not expect that more evidence will change these results. 
We are less confident in our results for other types of behavioural support, and about who gives the support and how. We found limitations with some of the studies, including how they were designed, conducted, and reported. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. More studies are needed.

The advent of medical abortion has improved access to safe abortion procedures. Medical abortion procedures involve either administering mifepristone followed by misoprostol or a misoprostol‐only regimen. The drugs are commonly administered in the presence of clinicians, which is known as provider‐administered medical abortion. In self‐administered medical abortion, drugs are administered by the woman herself without the supervision of a healthcare provider during at least one stage of the drug protocol. Self‐administration of medical abortion has the potential to provide women with control over the abortion process. In settings where there is a shortage of healthcare providers, self‐administration may reduce the burden on the health system. However, it remains unclear whether self‐administration of medical abortion is effective and safe. It is important to understand whether women can safely and effectively terminate their own pregnancies when having access to accurate and adequate information, high‐quality drugs, and facility‐based care in case of complications. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of self‐administered versus provider‐administered medical abortion in any setting.

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE in process and other non‐indexed citations, Embase, CINAHL, POPLINE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and Google Scholar from inception to 10 July 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies with a concurrent comparison group, using study designs that compared medical abortion by self‐administered versus provider‐administered methods. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently extracted the data, and we performed a meta‐analysis where appropriate using Review Manager 5. Our primary outcome was successful abortion (effectiveness), defined as complete uterine evacuation without the need for surgical intervention. Ongoing pregnancy (the presence of an intact gestational sac) was our secondary outcome measuring success or effectiveness. We assessed statistical heterogeneity with Chi2 tests and I2 statistics using a cut‐off point of P < 0.10 to indicate statistical heterogeneity. Quality assessment of the data used the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. 
Main results
We identified 18 studies (two RCTs and 16 non‐randomized studies (NRSs)) comprising 11,043 women undergoing early medical abortion (≤ 9 weeks gestation) in 10 countries. Sixteen studies took place in low‐to‐middle income resource settings and two studies were in high‐resource settings. One NRS study received analgesics from a pharmaceutical company. Five NRSs and one RCT did not report on funding; nine NRSs received all or partial funding from an anonymous donor. Five NRSs and one RCT received funding from government agencies, private foundations, or non‐profit bodies. The intervention in the evidence is predominantly from women taking mifepristone in the presence of a healthcare provider, and subsequently taking misoprostol without healthcare provider supervision (e.g. at home). 
There is no evidence of a difference in rates of successful abortions between self‐administered and provider‐administered groups: for two RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.01; 919 participants; moderate certainty of evidence. There is very low certainty of evidence from 16 NRSs: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.01; 10,124 participants. 
For the outcome of ongoing pregnancy there may be little or no difference between the two groups: for one RCT: RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.41 to 7.02; 735 participants; low certainty of evidence; and very low certainty evidence for 11 NRSs: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.49; 6691 participants. 
We are uncertain whether there are any differences in complications requiring surgical intervention, since we found no RCTs and evidence from three NRSs was of very low certainty: for three NRSs: RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.80 to 5.71; 2452 participants. 
Authors' conclusions
This review shows that self‐administering the second stage of early medical abortion procedures is as effective as provider‐administered procedures for the outcome of abortion success. There may be no difference for the outcome of ongoing pregnancy, although the evidence for this is uncertain for this outcome. There is very low‐certainty evidence for the risk of complications requiring surgical intervention. Data are limited by the scarcity of high‐quality research study designs and the presence of risks of bias. This review provides insufficient evidence to determine the safety of self‐administration when compared with administering medication in the presence of healthcare provider supervision. 
Future research should investigate the effectiveness and safety of self‐administered medical abortion in the absence of healthcare provider supervision through the entirety of the medical abortion protocol (e.g. during administration of mifepristone or as part of a misoprostol‐only regimen) and at later gestational ages (i.e. more than nine weeks). In the absence of any supervision from medical personnel, research is needed to understand how best to inform and support women who choose to self‐administer, including when to seek clinical care.

Abortion pills at home or in a clinic: how well do they work?

Rationale
Some people end a pregnancy in the first weeks with pills.
This is called a medical abortion.
It uses one pill first, then a second pill.
These pills can end a pregnancy without surgery.

Many people must travel far to see a nurse or doctor.
There may not be enough clinic staff.
Home use of the pills may help with this gap.
Home use may also give people more choice and control.

But we need to know if home use is safe and works well.
We also need to know if people still need surgery after.
This study looked at both questions.
It also looked at whether people accept this way of care.

Trial Design
This was a review of many studies, not one new trial.
The team looked for all studies up to July 10, 2019.
They used large health science libraries and trial lists.
They grouped results from the studies they found.

The review found 18 studies from 10 countries.
Two studies used chance to pick each person’s group.
Sixteen studies used other fair compare methods.
Over 11,000 people took part in all the studies.

All studies looked at early abortion, up to nine weeks.
Most people took the first pill with a provider.
They then took the second pill on their own, often at home.
The review did not list people’s ages or gender mix.

The review did not tell how long each person stayed in a study.
It did not report how often visits or checks took place.
It did not report how people got advice at home.
It did not rate pain care the same way in all studies.

Results
The main measure was a “successful abortion.”
This meant the pregnancy ended without surgery.
Across the studies, home use worked as well as clinic use.
In short, both ways ended the pregnancy at about the same rate.

The review also looked at “ongoing pregnancy.”
This means the pregnancy was still there after the pills.
Ongoing pregnancy seemed rare in both groups.
There was little to no clear difference between the groups.

The review tried to compare bad effects.
One bad effect is a problem that needs surgery.
There were not enough strong studies for this point.
So we cannot tell if the risk is the same or not.

The review team also looked at how sure we can be.
For success of abortion, we can be fairly sure.
For ongoing pregnancy, we are less sure.
For problems that need surgery, we are not sure.

Most studies used one shared plan for the pills.
People took the first pill with a provider.
Then they took the second pill on their own.
So, the results apply best to that plan.

We do not know as much about full home care for both pills.
We also do not know about use after nine weeks.
We do not know if one pill alone works the same at home.
More good studies need to answer these points.

What does this mean for patients?
Home use of the second pill can work as well as clinic use.
This may help people who live far from a clinic.
It may give more choice and control over timing and place.
It may also ease the load on clinics.

But we still need more facts on safety.
We need facts on full home care for both pills.
We need facts on care after nine weeks of pregnancy.
We need to learn the best way to give clear home advice.

In summary, both ways worked about the same to end pregnancy.
Ongoing pregnancy was rare and similar in both groups.
We cannot say if serious problems were the same or not.
Better studies can help answer safety questions.","Self‐administered versus provider‐administered medical abortion (review)
Review question 
The aim of this review was to compare whether women taking abortion drugs on their own without healthcare provider supervision can do so as successfully and safely as women who take the drugs in the presence of trained healthcare providers. 
Background 
Medical abortion used to end pregnancies has been successful and safe when women have access to appropriate information and resources. In provider‐administered medical abortion, drugs are taken in the presence of trained healthcare providers. Access to medical abortion drugs has increased and has given women more control over their abortion procedures through self‐administration. In self‐administered medical abortion, the woman takes the drug(s) without the supervision of a healthcare provider after receiving appropriate information and resources. This is the first review of the published evidence on whether self‐administration of medical abortion is a safe and successful way to end pregnancies. We compared the success and safety of self‐administered medical abortion versus provider‐administered medical abortion. 
Study characteristics 
We included 18 studies (two randomized controlled trials and 16 prospective cohort studies) covering 11,043 women undergoing early medical abortion (up to nine weeks gestation) in 10 countries that compared self‐administered medical abortion to provider‐administered medical abortion, after an initial clinic visit. Most studies (16) were conducted in low‐to‐middle resource settings and two studies in high‐resource settings. The evidence described in this review is from studies published before 10 July 2019. 
Key results 
Women who self‐administer medical abortion drugs in early pregnancy (up to nine weeks gestational age) experience similar rates of completed abortion as women who undergo provider‐administered procedures in low‐to‐middle and high‐resource settings. Evidence about safety is uncertain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence for the success of self‐administered medical abortion compared to provider‐administered medical abortion was of moderate certainty, due to low‐certainty studies. The evidence for the safety of these interventions was very low, due to low‐certainty studies.

10.1002-14651858.CD013316.pub2,"Background
Glioblastoma is an aggressive form of brain cancer. Approximately five in 100 people with glioblastoma survive for five years past diagnosis. Glioblastomas that have a particular modification to their DNA (called methylation) in a particular region (the O6‐methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter) respond better to treatment with chemotherapy using a drug called temozolomide. 
Objectives
To determine which method for assessing MGMT methylation status best predicts overall survival in people diagnosed with glioblastoma who are treated with temozolomide. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index to December 2018, and examined reference lists. For economic evaluation studies, we additionally searched NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED) up to December 2014. 
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were longitudinal (cohort) studies of adults with diagnosed glioblastoma treated with temozolomide with/without radiotherapy/surgery. Studies had to have related MGMT status in tumour tissue (assessed by one or more method) with overall survival and presented results as hazard ratios or with sufficient information (e.g. Kaplan‐Meier curves) for us to estimate hazard ratios. We focused mainly on studies comparing two or more methods, and listed brief details of articles that examined a single method of measuring MGMT promoter methylation. We also sought economic evaluations conducted alongside trials, modelling studies and cost analysis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently undertook all steps of the identification and data extraction process for multiple‐method studies. We assessed risk of bias and applicability using our own modified and extended version of the QUality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. We compared different techniques, exact promoter regions (5'‐cytosine‐phosphate‐guanine‐3' (CpG) sites) and thresholds for interpretation within studies by examining hazard ratios. We performed meta‐analyses for comparisons of the three most commonly examined methods (immunohistochemistry (IHC), methylation‐specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and pyrosequencing (PSQ)), with ratios of hazard ratios (RHR), using an imputed value of the correlation between results based on the same individuals. 
Main results
We included 32 independent cohorts involving 3474 people that compared two or more methods. We found evidence that MSP (CpG sites 76 to 80 and 84 to 87) is more prognostic than IHC for MGMT protein at varying thresholds (RHR 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.71). We also found evidence that PSQ is more prognostic than IHC for MGMT protein at various thresholds (RHR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.84). The data suggest that PSQ (mainly at CpG sites 74 to 78, using various thresholds) is slightly more prognostic than MSP at sites 76 to 80 and 84 to 87 (RHR 1.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.48). Many variants of PSQ have been compared, although we did not see any strong and consistent messages from the results. Targeting multiple CpG sites is likely to be more prognostic than targeting just one. In addition, we identified and summarised 190 articles describing a single method for measuring MGMT promoter methylation status. 
Authors' conclusions
PSQ and MSP appear more prognostic for overall survival than IHC. Strong evidence is not available to draw conclusions with confidence about the best CpG sites or thresholds for quantitative methods. MSP has been studied mainly for CpG sites 76 to 80 and 84 to 87 and PSQ at CpG sites ranging from 72 to 95. A threshold of 9% for CpG sites 74 to 78 performed better than higher thresholds of 28% or 29% in two of three good‐quality studies making such comparisons.

Choosing the best lab test to guide care in glioblastoma

Rationale
Glioblastoma is a fast, hard to treat brain tumor.
Only about five in 100 people live five years.
This tumor often comes back after care.
Doctors use a drug called temozolomide to treat it.
Some people gain more from this drug than others.

A gene called MGMT can change how this drug works.
MGMT helps fix damage to DNA in tumor cells.
Small “methyl” marks on the MGMT gene can turn it down.
When MGMT is turned down, the drug may work better.
So, lab tests for these marks can help guide care.

Many lab tests can check MGMT in a tumor.
Some look for the MGMT protein in cells.
Some look for the methyl marks on the MGMT gene.
We need to know which test best shows who may live longer.
This study asked which test gives the best guide.

Trial Design
This was a review of many past studies.
The team searched large health science data lists.
They looked at studies up to late 2018.
They also checked cost study lists up to 2014.

The team chose studies with adults who had glioblastoma.
All had care with temozolomide.
Some also had surgery or brain radiation.
Each study had a lab test for MGMT in tumor tissue.
Each study tracked how long people lived after care.

The review compared three common test types.
1) A protein stain test: it looks for the MGMT protein in tumor cells.
2) A DNA yes/no test: it checks if methyl marks are present on the MGMT gene.
3) A DNA amount test: it measures how much of those marks are present.

Two team members checked each step to lower errors.
They judged study quality with a standard tool.
They then compared test types within the same groups of people.
They also pooled results when it was fair to do so.

In total, they found 32 study groups.
These groups included 3,474 adults.
They also listed 190 papers that used only one test.
This review used past data.
There was no set time in the study for each person.

Results
What did the review find?
The two DNA tests gave better guides than the protein stain test.
Said in plain words, tests that read DNA marks did better.
Tests that look only for the MGMT protein did worse.

More detail:
- The DNA yes/no test did better than the protein stain test.
- The DNA amount test also did better than the protein stain test.
- The DNA amount test may be a bit better than the DNA yes/no test.
- But this last point is not very strong.

The review also looked at how the DNA amount test was done.
There are many ways to run this test.
The results did not point to one best way.
But one clear theme stood out.
Tests that check more than one DNA spot worked better than tests that check one spot.

The review also looked at cut-off points for the DNA amount test.
A cut-off near nine in 100 worked better than higher cut-offs.
Those higher cut-offs were 28 in 100 or 29 in 100.
This was true in two of three good studies that made this direct check.
So, a lower cut-off may help more than a higher one.
But the best exact cut-off still needs more proof.

What does this mean for patients?
If your care team must choose a test, a DNA test may guide them best.
A DNA test can help tell how well temozolomide may work.
This can help plan care and set real hopes.
It may also help pick the right trial for you.

What does this mean for doctors and labs?
Try a DNA based test when you can.
If you use a DNA amount test, read more than one DNA spot.
Be careful with very high cut-offs.
A lower cut-off near nine in 100 may work better.
But we still lack strong proof on the one best set-up.

What are the limits?
This review used many cohort studies, not one big trial.
Ways to run tests were not the same across labs.
Not all studies had the same quality.
So, we should use care when we read the fine points.

Bottom line from the team
DNA based tests for MGMT give better guides than protein stain tests.
Among DNA tests, the DNA amount test may be a bit better.
But the edge is small, and proof is not strong.
We still do not know the one best DNA spot set or cut-off.
Tests that check many DNA spots seem to do better than tests that check one.
A lower cut-off near nine in 100 may help in some set-ups.

Why this review matters
Better tests can help match care to each person.
They can help doctors and patients plan what comes next.
They can guide who may gain from temozolomide.
This can lead to care that has more good and less harm.","Which method of determining MGMT promoter methylation best predicts survival in people with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide? 
What was the aim of this review? 
Glioblastoma is a very aggressive type of brain cancer. People with glioblastoma are usually treated with surgical removal of the tumour followed by radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both. The standard chemotherapy is a medicine called temozolomide. Some glioblastoma tumours have a particular modification in their DNA (which contains the genetic code of organisms), and knowing whether a person has this modification is useful to predict how long the person may live after their diagnosis with cancer and how they may respond to temozolomide. The modification is known as 'methylation of the MGMT promoter region' and it can also affect MGMT protein expression (the way MGMT is made and modified). There are many ways to work out whether a tumour has this modification. In this review, we attempted to work out which method is best. 
What we found 
We identified 32 studies comparing different ways to measure whether the MGMT promoter region is methylated. The main three methods were called 'methylation‐specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR),' 'pyrosequencing' (both of which look directly at the MGMT promoter region) and 'immunohistochemistry' (which looks at MGMT protein expression). We found that methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing are better at predicting overall survival than immunohistochemistry. Methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing can be carried out by targeting different parts of the tumour DNA. Pyrosequencing can be performed using different cut‐off thresholds to determine whether a tumour is methylated or unmethylated. We did not identify very clear signals in terms of the best parts of the DNA to target or which are the best cut‐off thresholds. 
How reliable are results of the studies in this review? 
We rated our confidence in the evidence as 'moderate' for our conclusions about methylation‐specific PCR, but as 'low' for pyrosequencing. Although there were many studies, they all looked at different variants of the methods, so it is difficult to work out exactly which variant is best. 
What are the implications of this review? 
Our review indicates both methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing provide better predictions of survival than immunohistochemistry. There is some evidence that pyrosequencing may be better than methylation‐specific PCR at predicting overall survival, depending on the DNA targets and cut‐off thresholds used. We documented the most frequent DNA targets used in methylation‐specific PCR and pyrosequencing. We described cut‐off thresholds used in pyrosequencing, although it is unclear which of these is best.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, life‐limiting, multisystem disease affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF suffer with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which if left untreated, leads to a poor nutritional status. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has been shown to be effective in improving nutritional status and subsequently associated with improved lung function. However, the timings of PERT administration in relation to a meal are subjective and not standardised, meaning that variations in the timing of PERT dosing persist. 
Objectives
The primary objective of the review is to compare the efficacy (fat absorption) and effectiveness (nutritional status, lung function and quality of life) of different PERT dosing strategies in terms of timing of administration for treating dietary malabsorption in all individuals with CF. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
Date of last search: 24 June 2021.
We also searched ongoing trials registers on 09 July 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over RCTs with a minimum washout period of two weeks, and quasi‐RCTs of PERT dosing regimens in people (of any age) with CF. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed and screened the studies identified from the searches. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for our pre‐specified critical outcomes, but we did not identify any eligible studies. 
Main results
No studies met the eligibility criteria and therefore we did not include any in this review. The excluded studies were either cross‐over in design (but lacking a sufficient washout period between treatments) or did not assess the timing of PERT. One study which was terminated early is awaiting assessment pending further information. 
Authors' conclusions
We were unable to determine whether one dosing schedule for PERT is better than another since we identified no eligible RCTs. While the introduction of PERT to people with CF can improve their nutritional status, there are a limited number of studies which address this review question, and none met our eligibility criteria. Since malnutrition and adverse gastrointestinal symptoms remain a common feature in CF, the assessment of the relative performance of dosing schedules may provide evidence to improve outcomes in people with CF who are pancreatic insufficient. 
Further research is needed to fully evaluate the role of dosing schedules for PERT in fat absorption. Research should also establish reliable outcome measures and minimal clinically important differences. While RCTs with a cross‐over design may have advantages over a parallel group design, an adequate washout period between intervention periods is essential.

When should people with cystic fibrosis take enzyme pills?

Rationale
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life‑long lung and gut disease. It comes from changes in a gene. More than seventy thousand people live with CF in the world. Many people with CF do not make enough enzymes in the pancreas. Enzymes are tiny helpers that break down food. Without them, the body cannot take in fat well. This can cause belly pain, loose stool, and low weight. It can also harm lung health over time.

Doctors give enzyme pills to help. These pills are called pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, or PERT. PERT can help the body use fat from food. Better food use can link to better growth and better lung health. But we do not yet know the best time to take PERT. Some people take it before a meal. Some take it during a meal. Some take it right after. A clear plan could help people feel better, grow better, and have fewer gut signs.

This study asked a simple question. Does one time for PERT work better than the others? The team thought that timing might change how much fat the body can use. They also thought timing might change weight, lung health, and day‑to‑day life. We need strong tests to guide care. Clear advice can help people and families plan each meal with less stress.

Trial Design
This was not one trial. It was a review of trials. The team looked for high‑quality trials. These are trials that use random choice to put people into groups. Some trials use a “cross‑over” plan. In that plan, people try one way first, then switch to another way. There is a break in between. That break lets the body reset.

Who were they looking for? People of any age with CF who need PERT. This means boys and girls, men and women. The plan was to compare when to take PERT with meals. The team wanted to see which timing gave the best fat use. They also planned to look at weight and height, lung health, and how people feel and live.

The team searched a CF trial list and big data sites. They also checked past papers and meetings. The last search was in late June of the year 2021. They also checked trial lists for work still in progress in early July of that year. Two team members checked each study on their own.

They set rules for which trials to include. Trials had to be random. Cross‑over trials had to have at least a two‑week break between test times. Trials had to test timing of PERT with meals. The review itself did not put people in a trial. So we cannot say how long a person would have been in a trial. The time would have been set by each trial.

Results
The team did not find any trial that fit all the rules. Some studies looked at PERT, but did not test timing. Some used a cross‑over plan, but the break was too short. One study stopped early. The team is still waiting for more facts on that one.

What does this mean for people with CF? We still do not know the best time to take PERT. We cannot say that “before the meal” is best. We cannot say that “during” or “after” is best. Right now, people and care teams must choose based on habit or on what feels right.

We do know this. PERT helps many people with CF use food better. But timing may also matter. A good test could show if timing changes fat use or gut signs. It could show if timing helps weight gain or lung health. It could show if timing makes life day to day feel better. These are the things that matter to people.

This review shows a gap. We need strong trials that test timing head‑to‑head. Trials should use clear and simple goals. For fat use, they should use a measure that is steady and fair. Trials should also set the smallest change that matters to people. That means the least change in a score that people can feel in real life.

A cross‑over trial could work well for this question. In that kind of trial, each person tries more than one timing. This can cut the number of people needed. But the break between test times must be long enough. People need time to go back to their usual state. The break helps make results fair and clear.

In short, this review did not find the proof we need. The team cannot tell people the best time to take PERT. But the review does point to what we should do next. We should run fair, clear trials that test timing. We should use outcomes that matter to people with CF. The goal is simple. Help people take PERT in the way that works best for their bodies and their lives.","Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy timings in cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the different timings of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in people (of any age) with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Background 
CF is an inherited condition affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF are not able to produce enough pancreatic enzymes to breakdown and absorb fat, protein and fat‐soluble vitamins from food. This can lead to fatty stools (poo) and weight loss. It is thought that if fat is not digested properly, it could contribute to a higher risk of developing constipation or other serious gut complications such as distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. 
PERT provides the enzymes required to breakdown fat and the dosage is based upon the fat content of a meal or the person's body weight. PERT has been shown to improve weight and is associated with improved lung function. Despite current dose guidance, there are differences in PERT doses and there is no set guidance for when the therapy should be taken in relation to a meal (i.e. before, during or after eating). 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 24 June 2021.
Study characteristics 
We did not find any studies where PERT was given to people with CF who were pancreatic insufficient at different timings relative to their meals. We excluded nine studies. Four of these assessed the timing of PERT administration, but they had a cross‐over design where participants had one intervention and then swapped to the second intervention. We excluded these studies because they did not leave enough time between the different interventions to be sure that the effects of the first intervention were not affecting the results from the second intervention. Four studies did not look at the timing of PERT and one study evaluated a new educational program for PERT. One study was terminated early and we will assess this again at the first update of this review if we are able to obtain more information from the investigators. 
Key results 
No studies met the eligibility criteria. Further research is needed to work out the best time to take PERT in relation to a meal.

10.1002-14651858.CD013365.pub2,"Background
Diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer of the lymphatic system. About 30% to 40% of people with DLBCL experience relapse and 10% are refractory to first‐line treatment usually consisting of R‐CHOP chemotherapy. Of those eligible for second‐line treatment, commonly consisting of salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem‐cell transplantation (ASCT), around 50% experience relapse. With a median overall survival of less than six to 12 months, the prognosis of individuals who relapse or are refractory (r/r) to advanced lines of treatment or of those who are ineligible for ASCT, is very poor. With the introduction of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell therapy, a novel treatment option for these people is available. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cell therapy for people with relapsed or refractory (r/r) DLBCL. 
Search methods
An experienced information specialist performed a systematic database search for relevant articles on CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase until September 11th, 2020. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of identified studies up to this date. All search results were screened by two authors independently and a third author was involved in case of discrepancies. 
Selection criteria
We included prospectively planned trials evaluating CAR T‐cell therapy for people with r/r DLBCL. We had planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and we flexibly adapted eligibility criteria to the most reliable study designs available. We excluded studies involving fewer than 10 participants with r/r DLBCL and studies with a proportion of participants with r/r DLBCL below 70%, unless data were reported separately for this subgroup. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data and performed risk of bias ratings independently. A third author was involved in case of disagreements. As our search did not yield any completed RCTs, prospective controlled non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) or prospective observational studies with a control group, we did not meta‐analyse data and reported all results narratively. We adopted the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for prioritised outcomes. 
Main results
We identified 13 eligible uncontrolled studies evaluating a single or multiple arms of CAR T‐cell therapies. We also identified 38 ongoing studies, including three RCTs. Ten studies are awaiting classification due to completion with no retrievable results data or insufficient data to justify inclusion. The mean number of participants enrolled, treated with CAR T‐cell therapy and evaluated in the included studies were 79 (range 12 to 344; data unavailable for two studies), 61 (range 12 to 294; data unavailable for one study) and 52 (range 11 to 256), respectively. 
Most studies included people with r/r DLBCL among people with other haematological B‐cell malignancies. Participants had received at least a median of three prior treatment lines (data unavailable for four studies), 5% to 50% had undergone ASCT (data unavailable for five studies) and, except for two studies, 3% to 18% had undergone allogenic stem‐cell transplantation (data unavailable for eight studies). 
The overall risk of bias was high for all studies, in particular, due to incomplete follow‐up and the absence of blinding. None of the included studies had a control group so that no adequate comparative effect measures could be calculated. The duration of follow‐up varied substantially between studies, in particular, for harms. Our certainty in the evidence is very low for all outcomes. 
Overall survival was reported by eight studies (567 participants). Four studies reported survival rates at 12 months which ranged between 48% and 59%, and one study reported an overall survival rate of 50.5% at 24 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on overall survival. 
Two studies including 294 participants at baseline and 59 participants at the longest follow‐up (12 months or 18 months) described improvements of quality of life measured with the EuroQol 5‐Dimension 5‐Level visual analogue scale (EQ‐5D‐5L VAS) or Function Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Lymphoma (FACT‐Lym). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on quality of life. 
None of the studies reported treatment‐related mortality.
Five studies (550 participants) reported the occurrence of adverse events among participants, ranging between 99% and 100% for any grade adverse events and 68% to 98% for adverse events grade ≥ 3. In three studies (253 participants), 56% to 68% of participants experienced serious adverse events, while in one study (28 participants), no serious adverse events occurred. CAR T‐cell therapy may increase the risk of adverse events and serious adverse events but the evidence is very uncertain about the exact risk. 
The occurrence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was reported in 11 studies (675 participants) under use of various grading criteria. Five studies reported between 42% and 100% of participants experiencing CRS according to criteria described in Lee 2014. CAR T‐cell therapy may increase the risk of CRS but the evidence is very uncertain about the exact risk. 
Nine studies (575 participants) reported results on progression‐free survival, disease‐free survival or relapse‐free survival. Twelve‐month progression‐free survival rates were reported by four studies and ranged between 44% and 75%. In one study, relapse‐free survival remained at a rate of 64% at both 12 and 18 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on progression‐free survival. 
Thirteen studies (620 participants) provided data on complete response rates. At six months, three studies reported complete response rates between 40% and 45%. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cell therapy on complete response rates. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence on the benefits and harms of CAR T‐cell therapy for people with r/r DLBCL is limited, mainly because of the absence of comparative clinical trials. The results we present should be regarded in light of this limitation and conclusions should be drawn very carefully. Due to the uncertainty in the current evidence, a large number of ongoing investigations and a risk of substantial and potentially life‐threatening complications requiring supplementary treatment, it is critical to continue evaluating the evidence on this new therapy.

CAR T cell therapy for hard-to-treat large B cell lymphoma: what we know

Rationale
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, is a fast growing blood cancer. It starts in the lymph system, which helps fight germs. Many people do well with first chemo. But about 3 to 4 out of 10 have the cancer come back. About 1 out of 10 do not get better with first chemo.

When cancer comes back, doctors may give more chemo and a stem cell transplant. This is called ASCT and uses a person’s own stem cells. Even then, about 5 out of 10 have the cancer come back. Life can then be short, often less than one year. So, new care is needed.

CAR T cell therapy is one new choice. It uses a person’s own T cells. These are immune cells. In a lab, the cells get changed to spot and attack the cancer. This therapy may help when other care fails.

Trial Design
This study is a review of many studies. The team looked for all studies on CAR T in this cancer. They searched several large medical databases. They looked at papers up to September 11, 2020.

They planned to include the best study type first. That is a study that compares two groups by chance. They did not find any of those. So they used other planned studies that followed people over time. None had a control group for direct compare.

The review found 13 studies that fit the plan. Most studies had people with this cancer. Some also had people with other B cell blood cancers. Each study had between 12 and 344 people. Many people had at least three past lines of care.

Some had a stem cell transplant before. The share was from 1 out of 20 to 1 out of 2. A few had a donor stem cell transplant. The time people stayed in each study was not the same. Some results went out to one or two years.

The team checked the strength of the proof. They used set rules to do this. All studies had a high risk of bias. There was no blinding. Many people were lost to follow up. The team judged the proof as very weak.

Results
Survival
Eight studies, with 567 people, told how long people lived. Four studies gave results at one year. About 5 to 6 out of 10 people were alive at one year. One study gave results at two years. About 5 out of 10 people were alive at two years. We cannot be sure how much CAR T helped. There was no compare group.

Quality of life
Two studies looked at how people felt and functioned. These had 294 people at the start. Only 59 people had the longest follow up. Some scores got better over time. People had better day to day function or well being. But the number of people was small at the end. The proof is very weak.

Side effects and safety
No study said a person died due to the treatment. Five studies, with 550 people, shared side effects. Almost all people had some side effect. That is about 10 out of 10. Bad side effects, like grade 3 or more, were common. Between 7 and 10 out of 10 had these in some studies.

Three studies, with 253 people, told of serious side effects. Between 6 and 7 out of 10 had a serious side effect. One small study with 28 people found none. These numbers varied a lot. We cannot be sure of the exact risk.

A reaction called cytokine release syndrome, or CRS, was common. CRS is a strong body reaction. It can cause high fever and low blood pressure. Eleven studies, with 675 people, told about CRS. Five studies used the same scale. In those, about 4 to 10 out of 10 people had CRS. Grading rules were not the same in all studies. So the true rate is not clear.

Cancer control
Nine studies, with 575 people, told how long the cancer stayed in check. This is called time with no growth of cancer. At one year, about 4 to 8 out of 10 had no growth in four studies. One study found 6 to 7 out of 10 had no return at one year and at 18 months. These numbers also varied a lot.

Thirteen studies, with 620 people, told how many had a complete response. A complete response means no sign of cancer on scans or tests. At six months, three studies found about 4 to 5 out of 10 had a complete response. We do not know how this compares with other care. There was no control group.

What this means
CAR T may help some people with hard-to-treat DLBCL. Some lived one year or more. Some felt and functioned better. Many had no signs of cancer for a time. But the proof is weak. The studies did not compare CAR T to other care. Follow up times were not the same. Many people had strong side effects. Some were serious and needed more care.

Doctors and patients should weigh pros and cons with care. We need strong compare studies. Three such trials were in progress at the time of the search. More results will show who will benefit most. They will also show how to lower harms. Until then, we should be careful how we read these early results.","CAR T‐cell therapy for people with diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma which returns after treatment or no longer responds to treatment 
Background 
Diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a fast‐growing cancer of the lymphatic system, an important part of the immune system. It affects blood cells that produce antibodies to fight infections. 
DLBCL is potentially curable. Most people with DLBCL respond well to initial therapies such as chemotherapy. For some people, the disease becomes refractory, which means it no longer responds to treatment, or it relapses, which means it returns after treatment. As a second‐line treatment, people with DLBCL can receive chemotherapy coupled with stem‐cell transplantation, but not all people are candidates for this therapy. From those who are, around 50% experience relapse after treatment. People who relapse or are refractory to advanced lines of treatment and those who are not candidates for a stem‐cell transplant have a very poor prognosis: Only half of them survive longer than six to 12 months. 
A promising treatment for these people is 'chimeric antigen receptor' (CAR) T‐cell therapy, which utilises the body's own immune cells (T‐cells) to fight DLBCL. T‐cells are removed from the person's blood, equipped with so‐called 'chimeric antigen receptors' (CARs), that help to recognise and destroy the cancer cells, in the laboratory and then delivered back into the person's blood. 
What was our aim? 
We wanted to explore whether CAR T‐cells are an effective treatment for people with DLBCL that returns after treatment (relapses) or no longer responds to treatment (is refractory). We also wanted to explore the frequency of unwanted effects associated with CAR T‐cell therapy. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all available clinical studies on treatment with CAR T‐cells for people with relapsed or refractory DLBCL to summarise the current evidence. We also evaluated the risk of bias in included studies and rated our confidence in the evidence. 
What did we find? 
We found 13 studies with information on 679 participants (who had received several prior lines of therapy) that received CAR T‐cell therapy. None of the studies had a control group. This means CAR T‐cells were not compared with another treatment. We decided not to meta‐analyse the study results and reported all results narratively. We also found 38 ongoing studies. 
What are the key results? 
Eight studies with 567 participants evaluated overall survival. After 12 months, around half of participants were alive in four studies. In one study, around half of participants were alive after 24 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on survival. 
Two studies (294 participants at study start; 59 participants at study end) reported that quality of life improved over time. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on quality of life. 
Deaths related to the therapy were not reported.
Five studies (550 participants) reported on adverse events. Almost all participants (99% to 100%) experienced some kind of adverse event (including mild events). Between 68% and 98% of participants had adverse events that were severe. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of adverse events but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
In three studies (253 participants), 56% to 68% of participants experienced serious adverse events, while in one study (28 participants), participants had no serious adverse events. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of serious adverse events but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
Eleven studies (675 participants) reported on the frequency of 'cytokine release syndrome' (CRS), an overreaction of the immune system that is typically seen in CAR T‐cell therapy. It includes fever and can include symptoms such as chills, muscle pain or dizziness. Several scales were used across the studies to describe CRS. In five studies using the same scale, between 42% and 100% of participants had CRS. CAR T‐cells may increase the risk of CRS but the evidence about the exact risk is very uncertain. 
Nine studies (575 participants) reported when DLBCL relapsed (returned) or progressed (got worse). Four studies reported that, at 12 months, DLBCL did not progress in 44% to 75% of participants. In one study, 64% of participants did not relapse at both 12, and 18 months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on DLBCL relapse or progress. 
Thirteen studies (620 participants) reported how many participants had a complete response (all signs of cancer disappeared). In three studies, between 40% and 45% of participants experienced a complete response at six months. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CAR T‐cells on complete response. 
What does this mean? 
The evidence on CAR T‐cells in the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL is very uncertain. This is mainly because, today, there are no direct comparisons of CAR T‐cells with other treatments. People who receive CAR T‐cells can have severe adverse events that require additional treatment. We identified many ongoing studies and some of them compare CAR T‐cells with standard care. We will keep evaluating the evidence on this novel therapy. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to September 2020.

10.1002-14651858.CD002948.pub2,"Herbal therapy for rheumatoid arthritis
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of herbal therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
The review shows that in people with RA:
‐ Evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil (containing gamma‐linolenic acid (GLA)) probably improve pain; may improve function; and probably does not increase adverse events (unwanted side effects). 
‐ Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F may improve some symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and higher doses (180 mg ‐ 350 mg daily) may be more effective than lower doses (60 mg daily). There are some adverse events associated with Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. 
‐ We are uncertain of the effects of other herbal therapies because only single studies were available, or important features of RA, such as changes in the number of swollen and tender joints, were not reported. 
Often we do not have precise information about side effects and complications, particularly for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects associated with Triperygium wilfordii Hook F may include painful periods in women, decreased fertility in men, insufficient urine excretion, and increased rate of infections. Possible side effects associated with GLA sourced from evening primrose oil include headache, nausea, and diarrhoea, and rare complications include allergy and seizures. 
What is rheumatoid arthritis and what is herbal therapy? 
When you have RA, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes your joints swollen, stiff and painful. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually affected first. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis at present, so treatments are used to relieve pain and stiffness and improve your ability to move. 
Herbal interventions are defined as any plant preparation (whole, powder, extract, standardised mixture) used for medicinal purposes. Historically, many herbal therapies have been used to treat RA. Like conventional non‐herbal drugs, many herbal therapies are believed to act by blocking the activity of these immune cells and substances and reducing inflammation in the joints, and some people believe they have fewer side effects.  
Best estimate of what happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis:  
Pain (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain):
‐People who took eveing primrose oil, primrose oil, borage seed oil, or blackcurrent seed oil (wih the active ingredient GLA) rated their pain to be 33 points lower (9 to 56 points lower) on a scale of 0 to 100 after 6 months of treatment (33% absolute improvement). 
‐People who took placebo rated their pain to be 19 points lower after treatment.
Physical function (higher score means greater disability):
‐People who took GLA rated their disability 16% better.
‐People who placebo rated their disability 5% better.

Plant oils and herbs for rheumatoid arthritis: what this review found

Rationale
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long term joint disease. The body’s defense system attacks the joints. This causes pain, stiff joints, and swelling. Small joints in the hands and feet often hurt first. There is no cure yet, but care can ease pain and help you move.

Many people ask about herbs for RA. Herbs are plants used as medicine. Some herbs may calm the body’s defense system. This can lower joint swelling. People also hope herbs cause fewer side effects.

This study looked at how well herbs help RA. It asked three things. Do herbs ease pain and help daily life? Are they safe? Which herbs seem to work best?

Trial Design
This was a review of many past trials. It is called a Cochrane review. The team put the results all together. This helps us see the big picture.

The trials looked at people with RA. They tested plant treatments against a dummy pill or no herb. The herbs included plant oils with gamma linolenic acid (GLA). GLA is a kind of fat from some plant oils. The trials also studied a plant called Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. Many call it thunder god vine.

Time in each trial was not the same. Some results were measured at about six months. Not all trials checked the same things. Some trials were small. Some herbs had only one trial.

Results
GLA plant oils: what they can do
GLA is found in evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, and blackcurrant seed oil. People who took these oils felt less pain. After about six months, they rated pain 33 points lower on a 0 to 100 scale. People who took a dummy pill rated pain 19 points lower. So, the GLA oils eased pain more than the dummy pill.

GLA may also help daily function. People who took GLA felt about one sixth less disabled. People on the dummy pill felt about one twentieth less disabled. This means GLA helped more, but only by a small amount.

GLA safety
In the trials, GLA did not cause more side effects than the dummy pill. But side effects can still occur. Some people had headache, sick stomach, or loose stools. Rare problems can include allergy or seizures. Very rare harms may not show up in small trials. We may not see uncommon but serious harms yet.

Thunder god vine: what it can do
Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, or thunder god vine, may improve some RA signs. In the trials, higher doses, about 180 to 350 mg a day, may have worked better. A lower dose, about 60 mg a day, seemed to help less. But the best dose is not known.

Thunder god vine safety
Thunder god vine has known risks. Women may have painful periods. Men may have lower fertility. Some people may pass little urine. Infections may happen more often. These risks are a concern. You should weigh the risks and gains with your care team.

Other herbs
For other herbs, we do not know enough. Most had only one small trial. Or the trials did not report key signs. For example, they did not count tender or swollen joints. With so little proof, we cannot say if they help or harm.

What this means for people with RA
This review gives the best proof we have right now. GLA plant oils probably help with pain. They may help function a little. The oils did not show more side effects than a dummy pill in the trials. Thunder god vine may help symptoms. But it has clear risks, and higher doses may work more than low ones.

The review also shows what we still need. We need more and larger trials. We need longer follow up. We need better safety checks. This is key for rare but serious harms. We also need trials that measure the same things. That way we can compare results.

How to use this information
If you think about herbs for RA, talk with your doctor. Share what matters most to you. Pain relief, daily function, and safety all count. Do not stop your RA drugs on your own. Herbs can affect other drugs. Your care team can help you plan.

Conclusion
Plant oils with GLA can ease pain for some people with RA. They may help daily life a little. They did not show more side effects in these trials. Thunder god vine may help, but it has real risks. For many other herbs, we do not yet know. More high quality, long term trials are needed. This review helps patients and doctors make informed choices now.","Herbal therapy for rheumatoid arthritis

10.1002-14651858.CD005974.pub5,"Are oral homeopathic medicinal products effective and safe to prevent and treat acute respiratory tract infections in children? 
Review question 
We investigated whether oral homeopathic medicinal products are effective and safe to prevent or treat acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children compared with an inactive (placebo) treatment or other medicines. 
Background 
Most respiratory infections resolve without treatment, but sometimes symptoms persist after the initial infection has gone. Treatment is therefore aimed at relieving symptoms. Respiratory infections are commonly caused by viruses, especially colds and flu, though some lung and ear infections are caused by bacteria. It may be difficult to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections, and they may coexist. Antibiotics are often prescribed for respiratory infections even though they are ineffective against viruses. 
Children have on average three to six respiratory tract infections annually. Although most are mild and treatable, they sometimes require hospital treatment, and very rarely result in death. 
Homeopathy may treat respiratory infections with few side effects, but its effectiveness and safety has not been well researched. 
We assessed evidence from randomised controlled trials (studies that allocate people by chance to receive treatment), which is the best way to assess the safety and efficacy of medical treatments. 
Search date 
Our evidence is current to 27 November 2017.
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies involving 1562 children that compared oral homeopathic treatment to either placebo or standard treatment to prevent or treat respiratory infections in children. All studies investigated upper respiratory tract (from the nose to the windpipe (trachea)) infections, but one combined reporting of upper and lower respiratory tract (from the windpipe to the lungs and pleura (membranes covering the lungs)) infections, so the numbers of children with upper or lower infections is unknown. 
Study funding sources 
Three studies received funding from homeopathy manufacturers; one reported support from a non‐government organisation; two received government support; one was cosponsored by a university; and one did not report funding support. 
Key results 
Studies investigated a range of interventions for various illnesses and populations using different outcome measures, so only a small number could be combined for analysis. All moderate‐quality studies (low risk of bias) showed little or no beneficial effects for homeopathic medicinal products, whether individualised by a trained homeopath or a standard, non‐individualised commercially available therapy. Where results could be combined, there was probably little or no difference in benefit on short‐ or long‐term cure, or in prevention of ARTI. 
Two low‐quality studies (unclear or high risk of bias) showed some benefit of homeopathic medicinal products for a limited number of outcomes. One study showed a reduction in disease severity for the homeopathy group at some time points. The other study showed a reduction in number of respiratory infections over the following year in the treatment groups, although more than a quarter of participants were not accounted for in the results. There was no difference between homeopathy and placebo groups for parents' time off work, antibiotic use, or adverse effects. Consequently, there is no convincing evidence homeopathic medicinal products are effective in treating ARTIs in children. We are unsure about safety because data on adverse events were poorly reported. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated evidence as moderate or low quality for most outcomes. Three outcomes provided very low‐quality evidence because study populations and results differed significantly among studies; there were significant limitations in study design and reporting; and sample sizes were small.

Do homeopathic pills help prevent or treat colds and other breathing infections in kids?

Rationale
Colds and other breathing bugs are common in kids. Most kids get three to six each year. These illnesses are often mild and pass on their own. Still, some last longer and can be hard on families.

Most of these bugs are from viruses. Some ear and lung infections come from bacteria. It can be hard to tell which germ is the cause. Doctors often use antibiotics, but these do not work on viruses.

Many families try homeopathy. Homeopathy uses very weak (dilute) drops or pills. A homeopath may pick a remedy just for the child. Some remedies come as set mixes you can buy. People hope these may help with few side effects.

We need fair tests to see if they work. The idea was that homeopathy might prevent these bugs. Or it might shorten illness and ease signs like cough or pain. This review set out to test that idea.

Trial Design
This was a review of past clinical trials. The team looked for the best type of test. In these tests, children are put by chance into groups. One group gets the study treatment. Another group gets a fake pill, called a placebo, or usual care. This helps give fair results.

The search looked at studies up to 27 November 2017. The team found eight studies. These studies had a total of 1,562 children.

Most studies looked at upper breathing infections. These affect the nose, throat, and windpipe. One study mixed in lower infections, which affect the lungs.

The studies compared homeopathic pills or drops to a placebo or to standard care. Some children got a remedy picked for them by a trained homeopath. Others got a set mix sold for common colds and flu.

How long a child stayed in a study was not the same in all trials. Some looked at cure over a short time. Some looked at cure later on. One study counted how many new infections a child had over the next year.

Who paid for the studies also varied. Three got funds from makers of homeopathy. Two got funds from the government. One had support from a school. One had support from a non‑profit group. One did not list funding.

Results
The studies did not all ask the same questions. They also used different ways to measure results. This meant the team could only combine a few results.

The better run studies showed little or no benefit from homeopathy. This was true for custom picked remedies. It was also true for set mix remedies sold in stores.

When results could be pooled, the story stayed the same. Homeopathy made little or no change in short‑term cure. It made little or no change in long‑term cure. It also made little or no change in stopping new infections.

Two weaker studies did report some gains. In one, children on homeopathy had milder illness at some times. In the other, children on homeopathy had fewer new infections over the next year. But more than a quarter of those children were not in the final count. This makes the result hard to trust.

Parents missed about the same time from work in both groups. Children used about the same amount of antibiotics in both groups. Side effects were about the same in both groups too. But many studies did not report side effects well. So we are not sure about safety.

The strength of the proof was mixed. For many results it was low to medium. For some results it was very low. Reasons include small study size and poor reporting. Studies also used different tools to judge cure or change.

What does this mean for families and doctors? Based on these trials, homeopathic pills or drops do not seem to help much. They do not seem to prevent or cure these infections in kids. We also do not have clear proof they are safe, since reports on harm were poor.

This review helps guide choices about using homeopathy for a child’s cold or flu‑like illness. It shows where the proof is weak or missing. It also shows what future studies should do better. We need larger and clearer trials. These trials should track cure, new infections, side effects, and use of other drugs.

Most breathing infections in kids get better on their own. If your child seems very sick, seek care right away. This summary can help you talk with your child’s doctor. Together, you can decide what care is best for your child.","Are oral homeopathic medicinal products effective and safe to prevent and treat acute respiratory tract infections in children?

10.1002-14651858.CD011391.pub2,"Key‐hole (laparoscopic) versus standard access (open) abdominal operation for people with pancreatic cancer 
Review question 
How does key‐hole (laparoscopic) abdominal surgery compare with standard access (open) abdominal operation for people with pancreatic cancer? 
Background 
The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen that secretes pancreatic juice that aids digestion and contains cells that produce important hormones such as insulin. The pancreas can be divided into the head of the pancreas (right part of the pancreas) and the body and tail of the pancreas (left part or distal part of the pancreas). Distal pancreatic cancer is cancer of the body and/or tail of the pancreas. Removal of distal pancreatic cancer by surgery (distal pancreatectomy) is the preferred treatment for people with distal pancreatic cancers limited to the pancreas who are likely to withstand major surgery, because no other treatments have the potential to cure pancreatic cancer. Cancer can be removed through an abdominal operation, either laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy or open distal pancreatectomy. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is a relatively new procedure as compared with the well‐established open distal pancreatectomy. In operations on other parts of the body, laparoscopic surgery has been shown to reduce complications and length of hospital stay as compared with open surgery. However, concerns remain about the safety of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy in terms of complications after operation (postoperative complications). In addition, it is not clear whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy achieves the same amount of cancer clearance as is attained by open distal pancreatectomy. It also is not clear whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is better than open distal pancreatectomy in terms of earlier recovery after operation. We sought to resolve this issue by searching the medical literature for studies on this topic until June 2015. 
Study characteristics 
No randomised controlled trials have examined this topic. Randomised controlled trials are the best studies for finding out whether one treatment is better or worse than another because they ensure that similar types of people are receiving the treatments being assessed. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, we sought information from non‐randomised studies. We identified 12 non‐randomised studies that compared laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy in a total of 1576 patients. One of these studies did not provide results in a useable way. Thus, we included 11 studies in which a total of 1506 patients underwent distal pancreatectomy. Some 353 patients underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, and 1153 patients underwent open distal pancreatectomy. In all studies, historical information was collected from hospital records (retrospective studies). In general, historical information is less reliable than newly collected (prospective) information and findings of randomised controlled trials. 
Key results 
Differences in short‐term deaths, long‐term deaths, percentage of people with major complications, percentage of people with a pancreatic fistula (abnormal communication between the pancreas and other organs or the skin), recurrence of cancer at final time of follow‐up of participants, percentage of people with any complications and percentage of patients in whom cancer was not completely removed were imprecise. Average length of hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group than in the open group by about two days. However, this is not relevant until we can be sure that cancer cures are similar between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery. No studies have reported quality of life at any point in time, short‐term recurrence of cancer, time to return to normal activity, time to return to work or blood transfusion requirements. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was very low, mainly because it was not clear whether similar types of participants received laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy. In many studies, people with less extensive cancer received laparoscopic surgery, and those with more extensive cancer received open surgery. This makes study findings unreliable. Well‐designed randomised controlled trials are necessary if we are to obtain good quality evidence on this topic.

Small cuts or one big cut for cancer in the pancreas tail

2. Rationale
The pancreas is an organ in the belly. It makes juice to help digest food. It also makes hormones like insulin. The body and tail are the left side of the pancreas. Cancer can grow there.

Surgery can remove this cancer. Surgery is the only chance for a cure. Doctors can use small cuts with a camera. This is called key‑hole or laparoscopic surgery. Or they can make one large cut. This is called open surgery.

Key‑hole surgery helps people heal faster in some other operations. It can mean less pain and a shorter stay. But doctors still ask if it is as safe for this cancer. They also ask if it removes all the cancer.

This study looked at those two ways to do the surgery. The main idea was to see which way worked best. The team wanted to know about safety and cure. They also wanted to know about recovery after surgery.

3. Trial Design
This was a review of past studies. The team looked for studies up to June 2015. They found no trials that put people in groups by chance. These are called randomized trials. Those trials give the fairest test.

So the team used other kinds of studies. They found 12 non‑randomized studies. One did not give usable results. They used 11 studies in the review.

These 11 studies had 1,506 people in total. Of these, 353 had key‑hole surgery. A total of 1,153 had open surgery. All the studies looked back at hospital charts. This type is called a retrospective study.

The people were adults with cancer in the body or tail. All had surgery to remove that part of the pancreas. The reports did not say how long each person was followed. Time in the study was not the same for all. Some reports did not give those details.

It is important to know who got which surgery. In many reports, people with smaller tumors got key‑hole surgery. People with larger tumors got open surgery. That can make the results unfair.

A randomized trial puts people in groups by chance. That helps make the groups alike. Then we can compare them better. That is why such trials are needed.

4. Results
The team looked at many outcomes. These included deaths soon after surgery. They also looked at deaths after a longer time. They looked at major problems after surgery. They looked at a leak called a fistula.

A fistula is a leak or tunnel from the pancreas. It can go to an organ near it. It can also go to the skin. It can cause pain and slow healing. It can be serious.

The team also looked at cancer coming back. They looked at whether the surgeon removed all the cancer. They looked at any problems after surgery. These are all key results for patients.

What did they find? The hospital stay was shorter with key‑hole surgery. It was shorter by about two days. This can matter to patients and families. It can lower costs and stress.

But the other results were not clear. They could not tell if one way had fewer deaths. They could not tell if one way had fewer major problems. They could not tell if one way had fewer leaks. They could not tell if one way removed all the cancer more often.

No study shared quality of life results. We do not know how people felt day to day. No study told us how fast people got back to normal life. No study told us when people went back to work. No study told us how often people needed blood during surgery.

Why were the results not clear? The studies were not randomized. Doctors often chose the surgery based on the cancer. People with less spread often had key‑hole surgery. People with more spread often had open surgery. This choice can make one way look better when it is not.

The authors said the evidence was very weak. They could not make a firm call on safety. They could not make a firm call on cure. The shorter stay with key‑hole surgery was real. But it may not matter if cure is not the same.

What does this mean for patients? Key‑hole surgery may help you leave the hospital sooner. But we do not know if it is as safe as open surgery. We also do not know if it removes all the cancer as well. We need better studies to know.

What should happen next? We need randomized trials. In those trials, people go to a group by chance. The groups should be alike at the start. The trials should track cure and quality of life. They should also track time to return to work and normal life.

Until then, talk with your care team. Ask about their skill with each type of surgery. Ask about your tumor and your health. Ask about risks and recovery for you. Your team can help you choose what fits you best.","Key‐hole (laparoscopic) versus standard access (open) abdominal operation for people with pancreatic cancer 
Review question 
How does key‐hole (laparoscopic) abdominal surgery compare with standard access (open) abdominal operation for people with pancreatic cancer? 
Background 
The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen that secretes pancreatic juice that aids digestion and contains cells that produce important hormones such as insulin.

What is the aim of this review? 
This review aims to determine benefits and harms of all‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in addition to chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone for adults with AML. We did not evaluate participants with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found eight studies. 
Key messages 
The addition of ATRA to chemotherapy did not show relevant differences in terms of overall survival (OS), but the subgroup analyses showed that there is potential benefit for ATRA in combination with a certain chemotherapeutic called decitabine , for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who already had successful chemotherapy and now receive therapy for maintenance. We assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate for OS, disease‐free‐survival and on‐study mortality. 
Rates of toxicities were low, therefore certainty of evidence is 'very low' to 'low' for the adverse events diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting and cardiac toxicity. For the adverse event infection, we judged the certainty of evidence as moderate. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events with additional ATRA are comparable to chemotherapy only. 
Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.
What was studied in this review? 
Acute myeloid leukaemia is a life‐threatening type of cancer that starts in the blood‐forming cells of the bone marrow and can cause many different signs and symptoms. It is classified into several subtypes, of which one subtype, acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is treated differently to the other subtypes. 
Almost 60% of patients are older than 65 years at the time of diagnosis. Because of advanced age and accompanying diseases an intensive therapy with high‐dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation often is not possible or is accompanied by high risks for serious adverse events and treatment‐related mortality. For these reasons it would be important to know a less intensive and dangerous therapy for older patients. 
All‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an intermediate product of vitamin A, had been integrated into treatment regimens for APL by the end of the 1980s. It is administered orally and is generally well tolerated but can induce a severe, life‐threatening complication called differentiation syndrome, which includes breathing difficulties and fever. 
The literature provides contradictory data about the benefit of ATRA for patients with AML. It has been reported to increase the sensitivity of AML cell lines to chemotherapy by reducing one protein, which is associated with poor response to chemotherapy and therefore is related to a poor prognosis.These reports have led to the assumption that ATRA added to chemotherapy may improve outcomes and might replace or reduce the intensity of chemotherapy for patients with AML. 
What are the main results of this review? 
We found eight relevant studies with almost 4000 patients in total, conducted in the UK, Germany and France. These studies compared chemotherapy in combination with ATRA with chemotherapy alone in adult patients (over 18 years) with AML. All the included trials used different chemotherapy schedules, as there are several types of chemotherapy regimens for AML. Only in one trial did participants receive a newer drug, decitabine, which has been licensed for the treatment of AML since 2012. 
Adding ATRA to chemotherapy probably makes little or no difference to OS. ATRA may be potentially beneficial in combination with decitabine, for older patients (over 60 years) and for patients who receive therapy for maintenance, but these findings need to be explored by further research. 
For disease‐free‐survival, complete response rate and on‐study mortality there was probably no or little difference between treatment groups. 
The combination of ATRA probably did not lead to a higher infection rate. Regarding cardiac toxicity and diarrhoea, the certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low, so we are uncertain whether the addition of ATRA is beneficial. 
Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials.
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to July 2018.

Does adding a vitamin A type drug to chemo help adults with AML?

Rationale
Acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, is a fast blood cancer. It starts in the bone marrow. That is the soft part inside bones that makes blood cells. AML can cause fever, tiredness, and more infections.

Many people with AML are older. A lot are over age 65 when they learn they have it. Some cannot take strong chemo due to age or other health issues. So we need safe add‑on drugs that can help.

All‑trans retinoic acid, or ATRA, comes from vitamin A. It is a pill. It helps a different type of leukemia, called APL. Some lab work says ATRA may make AML cells easier to kill with chemo. It can also cause a rare, bad problem. That is called “differentiation syndrome.” It can cause fever and hard time to breathe.

The goal of this review was clear. The team asked if ATRA plus chemo helps adults with AML that is not APL. They also asked if it harms them. They looked at time people lived, if the cancer stayed gone, and side effects. They also looked for signs it may help older adults.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team found and joined the results from many trials. They found eight trials in all. These trials took place in the UK, Germany, and France. The last search for trials was in July 2018.

All people in the trials were adults age 18 or older. All had AML that was not APL. Some got ATRA plus chemo. Others got chemo alone. The chemo drugs were not the same in each trial. One trial used a newer drug called decitabine.

The trials had almost 4000 adults in total. The mix of men and women was not stated. The time each person stayed in a trial was not clear in the report. The trials used set plans to see who lived longer. They also checked who stayed free of cancer.

Results
Adding ATRA to chemo made little or no change in how long people lived. In short, time alive was about the same. This is also called “overall survival.” The strength of proof for this was fair.

ATRA may help some groups. It may help when used with decitabine. It may help people over age 60. It may help as upkeep care after chemo works at first. Upkeep care means care to keep cancer from coming back. But we need more trials to be sure of this.

Adding ATRA made little or no change in how long people stayed free of cancer. This is also called “disease‑free survival.” The chance that tests found no signs of cancer was also about the same. This is also called a “complete response.” Deaths during the trial were also close in both groups.

Side effects were like those seen with chemo alone. The risk of infection was about the same in both groups. That proof was fair in strength. The rates of belly upset, like nausea or throwing up, were low. The rates of loose stool were low. The proof here was weak. So we cannot say if ATRA changes those risks. Heart side effects were also low. The proof here was weak as well.

Some people on ATRA can get a rare, bad problem. It is called differentiation syndrome. It can cause fever and trouble breathing. The report did not say how often this happened in these trials. So we cannot judge the risk here from this review.

The trials did not report on daily life and well‑being. This is called “quality of life.” So we do not know if people felt better or worse day to day. We also do not know if ATRA cut time in the hospital.

What do these results mean? For most adults with AML that is not APL, ATRA plus chemo did not help people live longer. It did not help people stay free of cancer for longer. It did not seem to raise the risk of infection. For belly and heart side effects, the proof was too weak to judge. The few signs of gain were in small groups. These were people over age 60, people on upkeep care, and people who got decitabine. But we need more good trials to be sure.

Talk with your care team about these results. Ask if ATRA has a role in your care plan. Ask about risks, gains, and other choices. Your age, health, and past care all matter. This review can guide care, but it does not set it.

In sum, ATRA plus chemo did not show clear gain for most adults with AML that is not APL. It may help in some cases. The side effect risk looked close to chemo alone. We need more research to know who, if anyone, should get ATRA with chemo.","Treatment with all‐trans retinoic acid in addition to chemotherapy for adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (non‐APL)

10.1002-14651858.CD013837.pub2,"Background
Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is the third leading cause of neonatal mortality globally constituting 13% of overall neonatal mortality. Despite the high burden of neonatal sepsis, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. Possibly due to the diagnostic challenges of sepsis and the relative immunosuppression of the newborn, many neonates receive antibiotics for suspected sepsis. Antibiotics have become the most used therapeutics in neonatal intensive care units. The last Cochrane Review was updated in 2004. Given the clinical importance, an updated systematic review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis is needed. 
Objectives
To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase Ovid; CINAHL; LILACS; Science Citation Index EXPANDED and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science on 12 March 2021. We searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis. We included participants from birth to 72 hours of life at randomisation. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcome was all‐cause mortality, and our secondary outcomes were: serious adverse events, respiratory support, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, necrotising enterocolitis, and ototoxicity. Our primary time point of interest was at maximum follow‐up. 
Main results
We included five RCTs (865 participants). All trials were at high risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence according to GRADE was very low. The included trials assessed five different comparisons of antibiotics. 
We did not conduct any meta‐analyses due to lack of relevant data.
Of the five included trials one trial compared ampicillin plus gentamicin with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin plus tazobactam with amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with piperacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin with ampicillin plus amikacin; and one trial compared ceftazidime with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin. 
None of the five comparisons found any evidence of a difference when assessing all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity, neurological developmental impairment, or necrotising enterocolitis; however, none of the trials were near an information size that could contribute significantly to the evidence of the comparative benefits and risks of any particular antibiotic regimen. 
None of the trials assessed respiratory support or ototoxicity.
The benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens remain unclear due to the lack of well‐powered trials and the high risk of systematic errors. 
Authors' conclusions
Current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. Large RCTs assessing different antibiotic regimens in early‐onset neonatal sepsis with low risk of bias are warranted.

Antibiotics for early blood infection in newborns: what we know now

Rationale
Sepsis is a blood infection. Newborns can get it in the first three days of life. This is called early-onset sepsis. It can make a baby very sick. It can even cause death.

Sepsis is a top cause of death in newborns. It is the third leading cause worldwide. It makes up about one in eight newborn deaths. This is a big health burden for families.

It can be hard to tell if a newborn has sepsis. Many babies get antibiotics just in case. Antibiotics are drugs that kill germs. They can help, but they can also cause harm, like kidney or hearing problems.

Doctors use many drug plans, or “regimens.” We do not know which plan works best. The last big review on this was old. So the team did a new review to update the facts.

Trial Design
This study is a “systematic review.” That means the team looked at all the good trials they could find. They asked one main question. Which antibiotic plan works best for early sepsis in newborns?

They looked for trials that put babies into groups by chance. This is called randomization. Babies were from birth to 3 days old at the time of joining. They had early sepsis or doctors thought they might have it.

The team searched many science data sets. They last searched in March 2021. They also checked trial lists and the text of papers. They looked for randomized and “quasi-randomized” trials.

They found five trials. In all, there were 865 babies. The trials tested different antibiotic plans. The reports did not share gender details.

Some trials used two drugs in a pair. Many plans paired a penicillin-type drug with another drug. Examples include ampicillin plus gentamicin. Other plans used drugs like piperacillin, ticarcillin, or ceftazidime.

Each trial watched babies for outcomes over time. The main outcome was death from any cause. The team also looked at bad effects. These include kidney harm, brain or nerve harm, severe gut disease, and heart support needs.

The time in each trial was not the same. The summary did not give one set time for all. The team looked at results up to the last follow-up in each trial. They planned to combine data, but could not.

Results
The review found no clear winner. No plan worked better than another for saving lives. No plan showed fewer bad effects than another. This was true across all five comparisons.

One trial compared ampicillin plus gentamicin with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin. One trial compared piperacillin plus tazobactam with amikacin. One trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with piperacillin plus gentamicin. One trial compared piperacillin with ampicillin plus amikacin. One trial compared ceftazidime with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin.

Across these trials, there was no clear drop in deaths. There was no clear change in serious bad events. There was no clear change in kidney harm, brain or nerve harm, or severe gut disease. The need for heart and blood flow help did not change in a clear way.

No trial looked at breathing help needs. No trial looked at hearing harm. These are key safety issues. We still lack facts in these areas.

The trials were small. The design of the trials had limits. This means the results can be off. The team judged the proof as very weak.

Because of this, the team could not pool the data. They could not run a meta-analysis. There were not enough strong, similar data. So we still cannot say one plan is best.

What does this mean for patients and families? Doctors now use many safe, common antibiotic plans. Based on this review, no plan stood out as better or worse. This may guide care when choices are close. But we still need better proof.

What should happen next? We need big, well-run trials. These trials should test drug plans head-to-head. They should track key harms, like hearing and kidney harm. They should follow babies long term.

In short, this review shows a gap. It helps set the next steps for research. It tells us that, for now, no single antibiotic plan is proven best for early sepsis in newborns. More strong trials can give clear answers and help save lives.","Antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis
Review question 
We reviewed available evidence on different antibiotic regimens for newborns (from birth to 72 hours of life), with early‐onset sepsis (as defined by trialists). 
Background 
Sepsis in newborns is a severe and potential lethal condition, caused by the body's response to an infection. Neonatal sepsis is the third leading cause of neonatal death globally. Despite the high burden of sepsis in newborns, high‐quality evidence in diagnosis and treatment is scarce. This Cochrane Review was originally published in 2004. To identify the most appropriate antibiotic policies for neonatal sepsis, there is a need to base these policies on an updated well‐conducted review. Given the clinical importance, such a review assessing the effects of different antibiotic regimens for early‐onset neonatal sepsis is needed. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to August 2020. We included five trials randomising 865 participants. The included trials compared five different antibiotic regimens. 
Key results 
We included five trials: one trial compared ampicillin plus gentamicin with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin plus tazobactam with amikacin; one trial compared ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid with piperacillin plus gentamicin; one trial compared piperacillin with ampicillin plus amikacin; and one trial compared ceftazidime with benzylpenicillin plus gentamicin. 
None of the five comparisons showed any difference when assessing death from all causes, serious adverse events (i.e. major complications), respiratory support, circulatory support, nephrotoxicity (toxicity in the kidneys), neurological developmental impairment (disabilities in the functioning of the brain that affect a child's behaviour, memory, or ability to learn), necrotising enterocolitis (tissues in the gut become inflamed and start to die), or ototoxicity (toxic to the ear). Current evidence cannot confirm or reject one antibiotic regimen being superior to another. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence behind our conclusions is very‐low quality. The five trials had high risk of bias (i.e. the trials were conducted in a way that may have skewed results to the positive side). In addition, the five trials included few participants, making the results of this review imprecise.

Respiratory disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF), and many different therapies are used by people with CF in the management of respiratory problems. Bronchodilator therapy is used to relieve symptoms of shortness of breath and to open the airways to allow clearance of mucus. Despite the widespread use of inhaled bronchodilators in CF, there is little objective evidence of their efficacy. A Cochrane Review looking at both short‐ and long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF was withdrawn from the Cochrane Library in 2016. That review has been replaced by two separate Cochrane Reviews: one on long‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF, and this review on short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for CF. For this review 'inhaled' includes the use of pressurised metered dose inhalers (MDIs), with or without a spacer, dry powder devices and nebulisers. 
Objectives
To evaluate short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators in children and adults with CF in terms of clinical outcomes and safety.

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books on 28 March 2022 and searched trial registries for any new or ongoing trials on 12 April 2022. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs that looked at the effect of any short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator delivered by any device, at any dose, at any frequency and for any duration compared to either placebo or another short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator in people with CF. We screened references as per standard Cochrane methodology. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. Where we were not able to enter data into our analyses we reported results directly from the papers. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 11 trials from our systematic search, with 191 participants meeting our inclusion criteria; three of these trials had three treatment arms. Eight trials compared short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to placebo and four trials compared short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists to placebo. Three trials compared short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists. All were cross‐over trials with only small numbers of participants. We were only able to enter data into the analysis from three trials comparing short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists to placebo. 
Short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus placebo 
All eight trials (six single‐dose trials and two longer‐term trials) reporting on this comparison reported on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), either as per cent predicted (% predicted) or L. We were able to combine the data from two trials in a meta‐analysis which showed a greater per cent change from baseline in FEV1 L after beta‐2 agonists compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 6.95%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 12.02; 2 trials, 82 participants). Only one of the longer‐term trials reported on exacerbations, as measured by hospitalisations and courses of antibiotics. Only the second longer‐term trial presented results for participant‐reported outcomes. Three trials narratively reported adverse events, and these were all mild. Three single‐dose trials and the two longer trials reported on forced vital capacity (FVC), and five trials reported on peak expiratory flow, i.e. forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF25-75). One trial reported on airway clearance in terms of sputum weight. We judged the certainty of evidence for each of these outcomes to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. 
Short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists versus placebo 
All four trials reporting on this comparison looked at the effects of ipratropium bromide, but in different doses and via different delivery methods. One trial reported FEV1 % predicted; three trials measured this in L. Two trials reported adverse events, but these were few and mild. One trial reported FVC and three trials reported FEF25-75. None of the trials reported on quality of life, exacerbations or airway clearance. We judged the certainty of evidence for each of these outcomes to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. 
Short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists  
None of the three single‐dose trials reporting on this comparison provided data we could analyse. The original papers from three trials report that both treatments lead to an improvement in FEV1 L. Only one trial reported on adverse events; but none were experienced by any participant. No trial reported on any of our other outcomes. We judged the certainty of evidence to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists compared to short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. 
Authors' conclusions
All included trials in this review are small and of a cross‐over design. Most trials looked at very short‐term effects of inhaled bronchodilators, and therefore did not measure longer‐term outcomes. The certainty of evidence across all outcomes was very low, and therefore we have been unable to describe any effects with certainty.

Do quick‑relief inhalers help people with cystic fibrosis breathe better?

Rationale
Cystic fibrosis, or CF, is a life‑long disease. It makes thick, sticky mucus in the lungs. This mucus can block the airways and make breathing hard. It can also lead to cough, chest pain, and lung flare‑ups.

Many people with CF use quick‑relief inhalers. These drugs relax the muscles around the airways. The goal is to open the airways fast and help move out mucus. These inhalers may ease shortness of breath.

There are two main kinds of quick‑relief inhalers. One kind is called a beta‑2 agonist. It relaxes airway muscles in one way. The other kind blocks a signal that tightens the airways. Doctors call that type a muscarinic blocker. Both are taken by breath.

We need clear proof that these inhalers work in CF. We also need to know if they are safe. This study looked at all the trials it could find. It asked if these inhalers help children and adults with CF.

Trial Design
This was a review of medical trials. The team used strict Cochrane methods. They looked for trials where people with CF got a quick‑relief inhaler or a fake inhaler. A fake inhaler is called a placebo. The team also checked trials that compared the two types of quick‑relief inhalers.

They searched medical lists and trial sites up to April 2022. They chose only trials where people were put into groups by chance. That is called randomization. They also checked the quality of the trials.

The review found 11 small trials. In total, 191 people with CF took part. The trials included children and adults. Both males and females could join. Most trials gave a single dose and then tested breathing very soon after.

All the trials used inhaled drugs. People took the drug with a pressurized spray inhaler, a dry powder device, or a nebulizer. A nebulizer is a small machine that turns liquid medicine into a mist you can breathe in. Some trials used the beta‑2 agonist type. Some used the muscarinic blocker type, such as ipratropium bromide.

Most trials lasted one visit. Two trials lasted longer than one dose. Many trials used a “cross‑over” plan. In that plan, each person tried more than one option at different times. This helps compare the options in the same person.

Results
What did the trials measure? Many looked at lung function. A key test was FEV1. This means how much air you can blow out in one second. Some trials also looked at FVC. That means the total amount of air you can blow out after a full breath in. A few looked at how fast air moves in the middle part of the breath. One trial weighed mucus (sputum) to check airway clearance.

Beta‑2 agonist inhalers versus placebo: In some single‑dose trials, people blew out more air in one second soon after using the drug. This means FEV1 went up a bit after the beta‑2 agonist, compared to the fake inhaler. Two trials gave the drug for longer than one dose. Only one of those longer trials looked at flare‑ups, like hospital stays or extra antibiotics. One longer trial asked people how they felt. Side effects were mild in the trials that reported them.

Muscarinic blocker inhalers versus placebo: These trials used ipratropium bromide. The dose and device were not the same in all trials. Some trials showed changes in breathing tests after a dose. Side effects were few and mild in the trials that reported them. No trial in this group reported on day‑to‑day life, flare‑ups, or mucus clearance.

Beta‑2 agonists versus muscarinic blockers: In single‑dose trials that compared the two, both types seemed to raise the one‑second blow test. Only one trial reported on side effects, and none were found there. The trials did not report on other key outcomes, like how people felt or flare‑ups.

Across all the trials, the number of people was small. Most trials tested only one dose and ended the same day. The review team judged the overall certainty of the results to be very low. This means we cannot be sure about the true effect. We also cannot tell how long any benefit might last or who benefits most.

What does this mean for people with CF? Quick‑relief inhalers may help some people breathe out more air right after a dose. But we do not know if they help with symptoms over time. We also do not know if they cut hospital stays, reduce extra antibiotic use, or improve day‑to‑day life. Side effects, when reported, were mild in the short term.

This review shows a clear gap. We need larger, longer trials in children and adults with CF. Future trials should track what matters most: symptoms, daily life, lung flare‑ups, lung function, mucus clearance, and side effects. Trials should also report results in ways patients can use.

What should you do now? If you or your child uses a quick‑relief inhaler, do not stop on your own. Some people feel better with these drugs. Talk with your CF team about your goals and your plan. Ask how to use your inhaler the right way. Ask if the dose and device fit your needs.

In short, quick‑relief inhalers may give short‑term help after a dose. But we still lack strong proof for clear, lasting benefits in CF. More and better trials are needed to guide care.","Short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators for cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for using short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators (treatments which widen and open the airways, making it easier to breathe) in people with cystic fibrosis. Short‐acting bronchodilators take effect quickly and generally last 4 to 6 hours. We were interested in any type of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator, given at any dose, and by any type of device (inhalers or nebulisers). 
Both nebulisers and inhalers deliver medicine. Nebulisers turn liquid medication into an easily‐inhaled mist. They vary in type but need a power source, e.g. a rechargeable battery, to function. Inhalers deliver short bursts of medicine (as an aerosol or dry powder) via a manual handheld device. The most common type of inhaler is a metered‐dose inhaler. Inhalers can be used with spacers (empty tubes, usually made from plastic that slot onto the mouthpiece of the inhaler).  
Inhaled bronchodilators are used by many people with cystic fibrosis to help them breathe, and to make it easier to clear mucus from their lungs. We wanted to know if these treatments were better than a placebo (dummy) treatment or another type of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 28 March 2022.
Trial characteristics 
The review included 11 trials with 191 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 5 and 40 years of age. Trials compared two different types of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator (beta‐2 agonists such as salbutamol or albuterol, and muscarinic antagonists such as ipratropium bromide) against a placebo substance which contained no medication, or a different short‐acting inhaled bronchodilator; three of the trials had three comparison groups ‐ beta‐2 agonists versus muscarinic antagonists versus placebo. All trials were cross‐over trials, so all of the people included in the trial received both treatments at different times, and the order that they received the treatments was random. The trials lasted from a single‐dose trial to 6 months. Eight trials looked at the effects of short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists versus placebo, four trials at the effects of a short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist versus placebo, and three trials looked at the effects of a short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonist with a short‐acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist. 
Key results 
All trials looked at the effect of short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators on lung function, measured as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), but this was reported in different ways and at different time points.  
We are uncertain whether any of the short‐acting inhaled bronchodilators have an effect on FEV1 compared to placebo. The trials were too small and there were not enough data to show if there was an effect or not. 
Only six of the 11 trials reported on harmful effects of treatment: one trial reported no harmful effects and five trials reported mild tremors, dry mouth and fatigue. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence across all trials was very low. All trials used a cross‐over design where the participants are given one treatment and then swapped to the other treatment with a washout period (the length of time for a drug to be eliminated from the body) in between. It is possible that the clinical status of participants was not the same at the beginning of the first treatment phase as at the beginning of the second treatment phase. The trials were also very small and were carried out more than 10 years ago.

10.1002-14651858.CD013400.pub2,"Physical activity interventions for people with congenital heart disease
Review question
This review aimed to gather evidence for the use of any physical activity intervention for people with congenital heart disease. We aimed to compare interventions including exercise training, physical activity promotion or lung training with no intervention (usual care). 
Background
Congenital heart disease is the term used for a range of birth defects that affect how the heart works. People with congenital heart disease have reduced life expectancy, physical fitness and quality of life. However, due to better prenatal diagnoses, surgical procedures (often performed in the early years of life) and earlier interventions, the survival rate for those born with this disease has improved dramatically, such that most people will now live into adulthood. Exercise training and physical activity interventions are known to improve fitness, physical activity, survival and quality of life in healthy people, but it is not clear how effective these programmes are for people with long‐term medical conditions. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies in September 2019 and identified 15 studies involving 924 participants. The studies used three main types of interventions, including programmes designed to increase physical activity, aerobic fitness and health‐related quality of life and compared physical activity intervention and control interventions in people with congenital heart disease.  
Key results
We included 15 trials with 924 participants. Half of the participants were female. Of the 15 trials, 5 used a total of 500 young people (less than 18 years of age) and 10 trials used a total of 424 adult participants. We found that physical fitness and physical activity may slightly increase but we are very uncertain about quality of life. There is currently no data to say if this small increase in fitness will result in fewer visits to the hospital. But there were no recorded deaths or serious events that were related to participation in physical activity. 
Quality of evidence
Using a validated scientific approach (GRADE), the certainty in the evidence base was moderate for fitness, low for physical activity and very low for quality of life. Most outcomes were limited due to small study participant numbers and poor reporting of study details.

Do exercise programs help people born with heart defects?

Rationale
Some people are born with a heart that did not form in the usual way. This is called congenital heart disease, or CHD. CHD can make it hard to be active. It can also lower fitness and shorten life.

Care has improved a lot over time. Many people with CHD now live into adult years. But many still feel tired and weak. Daily life may be hard. They may also worry about being active.

Exercise can help people without long term illness. It can raise fitness and mood. It can also help people live longer. But we do not know if this is true for people with CHD.

This review asked a clear question. Do exercise and activity programs help people with CHD? Are they safe? The team wanted to see if these programs can raise fitness. They also looked at daily activity and life quality.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team looked for trials up to September 2019. They put results from many trials together. This helps us see the full picture.

The review found 15 trials. In all, 924 people took part. About half were female. Five trials had 500 young people under 18 years. Ten trials had 424 adults.

The trials used three types of programs. Some taught exercise or gave a set plan to train. Some helped people move more in daily life. Some taught ways to train the lungs, like breathing training.

Each trial had a group that did a program. Each trial also had a group that did not do a program. We call that group “usual care” or control. Usual care means normal care from the clinic.

People in the trials had CHD. They were girls and boys, women and men. The trials did not list all other health issues. Time in the trials was not stated in the abstract. So we do not know how long each plan lasted.

The team checked how strong the proof is. They used a common method to rate this. This method asks, “How sure can we be?” It looks at study size and design.

Results
The review found small gains in fitness. People in the programs could do a bit more. They also moved a bit more in daily life. This may help some people feel better day to day.

We do not know if life quality improved. Life quality means how you feel and live each day. It includes mood, energy, and the joy of life. The trials did not give clear proof for this.

We also do not know if people went to the hospital less. The trials did not give data on this. So we cannot say if the small gains in fitness led to fewer visits.

The trials did not report any deaths from the programs. They also did not report any serious events due to the programs. This is good news. It means the plans looked safe in these trials.

How sure are we about these results? For fitness, the proof was moderate. That means we are fairly sure. For daily activity, the proof was low. That means we are not very sure. For life quality, the proof was very low. That means we are not sure at all.

Why are we not more sure? Many trials were small. Some did not report details well. This can make results less clear. It can also hide good or bad effects.

What do these results mean for people with CHD? These plans may help a bit with fitness and daily movement. The plans also looked safe in these trials. But we still need better trials to know more.

What should researchers do next? They should run larger, clear trials. They should track life quality in a simple way. They should also track clinic visits and safety in detail. This will show who gains most and how.

In short, exercise and activity plans may help some people with CHD. They may raise fitness a little. They also looked safe in these trials. But we still have gaps to fill. More and better trials can guide care in the future.","Physical activity interventions for people with congenital heart disease

10.1002-14651858.CD013756.pub2,"Background
Implanted spinal neuromodulation (SNMD) techniques are used in the treatment of refractory chronic pain. They involve the implantation of electrodes around the spinal cord (spinal cord stimulation (SCS)) or dorsal root ganglion (dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS)), and a pulse generator unit under the skin. Electrical stimulation is then used with the aim of reducing pain intensity. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness, adverse events, and cost‐effectiveness of implanted spinal neuromodulation interventions for people with chronic pain. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Web of Science (ISI), Health Technology Assessments, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry from inception to September 2021 without language restrictions, searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SNMD interventions with placebo (sham) stimulation, no treatment or usual care; or comparing SNMD interventions + another treatment versus that treatment alone. We included participants ≥ 18 years old with non‐cancer and non‐ischaemic pain of longer than three months duration. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were disability, analgesic medication use, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and health economic outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened database searches to determine inclusion, extracted data and evaluated risk of bias for prespecified results using the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Outcomes were evaluated at short‐ (≤ one month), medium‐ four to eight months) and long‐term (≥12 months). Where possible we conducted meta‐analyses. We used the GRADE system to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included 15 unique published studies that randomised 908 participants, and 20 unique ongoing studies. All studies evaluated SCS. We found no eligible published studies of DRGS and no studies comparing SCS with no treatment or usual care. We rated all results evaluated as being at high risk of bias overall. For all comparisons and outcomes where we found evidence, we graded the certainty of the evidence as low or very low, downgraded due to limitations of studies, imprecision and in some cases, inconsistency. 
Active stimulation versus placebo  
SCS versus placebo (sham)  
Results were only available at short‐term follow‐up for this comparison.
Pain intensity 
Six studies (N = 164) demonstrated a small effect in favour of SCS at short‐term follow‐up (0 to 100 scale, higher scores = worse pain, mean difference (MD) ‐8.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐15.67 to ‐1.78, very low certainty). The point estimate falls below our predetermined threshold for a clinically important effect (≥10 points). No studies reported the proportion of participants experiencing 30% or 50% pain relief for this comparison. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
The quality and inconsistency of adverse event reporting in these studies precluded formal analysis. 
Active stimulation + other intervention versus other intervention alone  
SCS + other intervention versus other intervention alone (open‐label studies)  
Pain intensity 
Mean difference  
Three studies (N = 303) demonstrated a potentially clinically important mean difference in favour of SCS of ‐37.41 at short term (95% CI ‐46.39 to ‐28.42, very low certainty), and medium‐term follow‐up (5 studies, 635 participants, MD ‐31.22 95% CI ‐47.34 to ‐15.10 low‐certainty), and no clear evidence for an effect of SCS at long‐term follow‐up (1 study, 44 participants, MD ‐7 (95% CI ‐24.76 to 10.76, very low‐certainty). 
Proportion of participants reporting ≥50% pain relief  
We found an effect in favour of SCS at short‐term (2 studies, N = 249, RR 15.90, 95% CI 6.70 to 37.74, I2 0% ; risk difference (RD) 0.65 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.74, very low certainty), medium term (5 studies, N = 597, RR 7.08, 95 %CI 3.40 to 14.71, I2 = 43%; RD 0.43, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.73, low‐certainty evidence), and long term (1 study, N = 87, RR 15.15, 95% CI 2.11 to 108.91 ; RD 0.35, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.49, very low certainty) follow‐up. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
Device related  
No studies specifically reported  device‐related adverse events at short‐term follow‐up. At medium‐term follow‐up, the incidence of lead failure/displacement (3 studies N = 330) ranged from 0.9 to 14% (RD 0.04, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.11, I2 64%, very low certainty). The incidence of infection (4 studies, N = 548) ranged from 3 to 7% (RD 0.04, 95%CI 0.01, 0.07, I2 0%, very low certainty). The incidence of reoperation/reimplantation (4 studies, N =5 48) ranged from 2% to 31% (RD 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.21, I2 86%, very low certainty). One study (N = 44) reported a 55% incidence of lead failure/displacement (RD 0.55, 95% CI 0.35, 0 to 75, very low certainty), and a 94% incidence of reoperation/reimplantation (RD 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07, very low certainty) at five‐year follow‐up. No studies provided data on infection rates at long‐term follow‐up. 
We found reports of some serious adverse events as a result of the intervention. These included autonomic neuropathy, prolonged hospitalisation, prolonged monoparesis, pulmonary oedema, wound infection, device extrusion and one death resulting from subdural haematoma. 
Other  
No studies reported the incidence of other adverse events at short‐term follow‐up. We found no clear evidence of a difference in otherAEs at medium‐term (2 studies, N = 278, RD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.06, I2 0%) or long term (1 study, N = 100, RD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.02) follow‐up. 
Very limited evidence suggested that SCS increases healthcare costs. It was not clear whether SCS was cost‐effective. 
Authors' conclusions
We found very low‐certainty evidence that SCS may not provide clinically important benefits on pain intensity compared to placebo stimulation. We found low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence that SNMD interventions may provide clinically important benefits for pain intensity when added to conventional medical management or physical therapy. SCS is associated with complications including infection, electrode lead failure/migration and a need for reoperation/re‐implantation. The level of certainty regarding the size of those risks is very low. SNMD may lead to serious adverse events, including death. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of DRGS for chronic pain.

Do implants that send small pulses to the spine help long‑term pain?

Rationale
Long‑term pain can last for months or years. It can limit sleep, mood, work, and daily life. Many people still hurt even after pills, shots, or therapy. They need new options.

One option is spinal cord stimulation, or SCS. A surgeon puts small wires near the spine. A small battery sits under the skin. The device sends weak pulses to try to cut pain signals.

Some doctors also place wires near a single nerve root. This is dorsal root ganglion stimulation. We call these kinds of care “implanted nerve pulse” care. This review asked if these devices help and if they are safe.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. The team looked for fair tests called randomized controlled trials. In these trials, people get one care or another by chance. The team gathered all such trials up to September 2021.

People in the trials were adults with pain for more than three months. They did not have cancer pain or pain from low blood flow. The trials tested SCS alone, or SCS plus usual care, like pills or therapy. Some trials compared SCS with a “sham,” which is a device set to not give real pulses.

In all, 15 trials were found. They had 908 people. The team also found 20 trials still in progress. No published trials tested dorsal root ganglion stimulation.

The trials checked pain, side effects, daily limits, use of pain pills, life quality, and costs. They looked at short term (up to one month), middle term (four to eight months), and long term (one year or more). One small study followed people for five years.

Results
First, the team looked at SCS versus sham at short term. Pain on a 0 to 100 scale fell a small amount with SCS. The drop was less than 10 points. The team judged this small drop may not feel important to a person.

There were no sham results for middle or long term. The trials did not report how many people got at least half less pain in this group. Side effects were not well reported in these short tests. So we cannot say much on harms in this group.

Next, the team looked at SCS added to other care versus other care alone. At short term, pain fell a lot more when SCS was added. At middle term, pain also fell more with SCS. At long term, one small study did not show a clear edge for SCS.

More people got at least half less pain when SCS was added. This was true at short, middle, and long term. But the long‑term data came from one small study. So we should be careful about that result.

Side effects did occur. In the middle term, wires could move or fail. This happened in about 1 to 14 out of 100 people. Infections happened in about 3 to 7 out of 100 people.

Also in the middle term, 2 to 31 out of 100 people needed another surgery. At five years in one small study, wire problems were in about 55 out of 100 people. Re‑operation or a new implant was needed in about 94 out of 100 people. We do not know if these high long‑term numbers apply to all.

Some serious harms did occur. A few people had nerve control problems or weakness in one limb. Some stayed in the hospital longer. One had fluid in the lungs. One had bleeding around the brain and died. These events were rare, but they did happen.

Costs may be higher with SCS. The review could not tell if the higher cost is worth it. It is not clear if SCS saves money later. We need better cost studies.

How sure are these results? The trials had limits. Many were small. Some did not blind people well. The team judged that we are not very sure about the size of the benefits or harms.

What does this mean for patients? SCS alone did not beat sham by a clear, felt amount in the short term. SCS added to pills or therapy helped pain more in the short and middle term. Long‑term help is not clear. Device problems and repeat surgery can occur. A few serious harms can also occur.

We found no good studies of dorsal root ganglion stimulation for this kind of pain. In short, SCS may help some people when added to usual care. But there are real risks, and we still lack strong, long‑term proof. Talk with your care team about your goals, other options, and your risk of harm.","What are the benefits and risks of electrical spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain in adults? 
Why this question is important 
Persistent (chronic) pain is a common problem that affects people from all walks of life. It can be the result of a wide range of different medical conditions and is sometimes unexplained, but it often causes substantial suffering, distress and disability and can have major impacts on a person's quality of life. 
Implanted spinal neuromodulation (SNMD) interventions involve surgically implanting wires (electrodes) into the space around nerves or the spinal cord that are connected to a ""pulse generator"" device which is usually implanted under the patient's skin. This delivers electrical stimulation to the nerves or spinal cord. It is thought that this stimulation interferes with danger messages being sent to the spinal cord and brain with the goal of reducing the perception of pain. Once implanted with a SNMD device people live with the device implanted, potentially on a permanent basis. We reviewed the evidence to find out whether these interventions were effective at reducing pain, disability and medication use, at improving quality of life and to find out the risk and type of complications they might cause. There are two broad types of SNMD: spinal cord stimulation (SCS), where electrodes are placed near the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) where electrodes are placed near the nerve root, where the nerve branches off from the spinal cord. 
How we identified and assessed the evidence 
First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed the certainty of the evidence. We considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we rated the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. 
What we found 
We found 15 published studies that included 908 people with persistent pain due to a variety of causes including nerve disease, chronic low back pain, chronic neck pain and complex regional pain syndrome. All of these studies evaluated SCS; no studies evaluated DRGS. 
Eight studies (that included 205 people) compared SCS with a sham (placebo) stimulation, where the electrodes were implanted, but no stimulation was delivered. Six studies that included 684 people compared SCS added with either medical management or physical therapy with medical management or physical therapy on its own. We rated the evidence as being of low, or very low certainty. Limitations in how the studies were conducted and reported, the amount of evidence we found and inconsistency between studies in some instances means that our confidence in the results is limited. 
The evidence suggests the following.
Compared to receiving medical management or physical therapy alone, people treated with the addition of SCS may experience less pain and higher quality of life after one month or six months of stimulation. There is limited evidence to draw conclusions in the long term of one year or more. It is unclear whether SCS reduces disability or medication use. 
Compared to a sham (placebo) stimulation, SCS may result in small reductions in pain intensity in the short term that may not be clinically important, but this is currently unclear. There is no evidence at medium or long‐term follow‐up points. 
SCS can result in complications. These include movement or malfunction of the electrode wires, wound infections and the need for further surgical procedures to fix issues with the implanted devices. We also found instances of serious complications that included one death, nerve damage, lasting muscle weakness, lung injury, serious infection, prolonged hospital stay and the extrusion of a stimulation device through the skin. 
Very limited evidence around the costs and economics of SCS suggested that SCS increases the costs of healthcare. It was not clear whether SCS was cost‐effective. 
What this means 
SCS may reduce pain intensity in people with chronic pain. It is currently not clear how much of this effect is due to the SCS itself and how much is due to so‐called ""placebo"" effects, which are the result of the experience of undergoing the procedure and the person's expectations that it will help them. Receiving SCS does present a risk of relatively common complications and less common serious complications. We are currently unsure of the precise degree of this risk.

Cataract surgery is the most common incisional surgical procedure in ophthalmology and is important in ophthalmic graduate medical education. Although most ophthalmology training programs in the United States (US) include virtual reality (VR) training for cataract surgery, comprehensive reviews that detail the impact of VR training on ophthalmology trainee performance are lacking. 
Objectives
To assess the impact of VR training for cataract surgery on the operating performance of postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, measured by operating time, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, supervising physician ratings, and VR simulator task ratings. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 June 2021. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing VR training to any other method of training, including non‐VR simulation training (e.g., wet laboratory training), didactics training, or no supplementary training in postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodology. Primary outcomes were operating times in the operating room and intraoperative complications. Secondary outcomes were operating times in simulated settings, simulator task ratings, and supervising physician ratings, either in the operating room or simulated settings. 
Main results
We included six RCTs with a total of 151 postgraduate ophthalmology trainees ranging from 12 to 60 participants in each study. The included studies varied widely in terms of geography: two in the US, and one study each in China, Germany, India, and Morocco. Three studies compared VR training for phacoemulsification cataract surgery on the Eyesi simulator (VRmagic, Mannheim, Germany) with wet laboratory training and two studies compared VR training with no supplementary training. One study compared trainees who received VR training with those who received conventional training for manual small incision cataract surgery on the HelpMeSee simulator (HelpMeSee, New York, NY). Industry financially supported two studies. All studies had at least three domains judged at high or unclear risks of bias. We did not conduct a meta‐analysis due to insufficient data (i.e., lack of precision measurements, or studies reported only P values). All evidence was very low‐certainty, meaning that any estimates were unreliable. 
The evidence for the benefits of VR training for trainees was very uncertain for primary outcomes. VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had shorter operating times (mean difference [MD] −17 minutes, 95% confidence interval [CI] −21.62 to −12.38; 1 study, n = 12; very low‐certainty evidence). Results for operating time were inconsistent when comparing VR and wet laboratory training: one study found that VR relative to wet laboratory training was associated with longer operating times (P = 0.038); the other reported that two training groups had similar operating times (P = 0.14). One study reported that VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had fewer intraoperative complications (P < 0.001); in another study, VR and conventionally trained trainees had similar intraoperative complication rates (MD −8.31, 95% CI −22.78 to 6.16; 1 study, n = 19; very low‐certainty evidence). 
For secondary outcomes, VR training may have similar impact on trainee performance compared to wet laboratory and greater impact compared to no supplementary training, but the evidence was very uncertain. One study reported VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training had significantly reduced operating time in simulated settings (P = 0.0013). Another study reported that VR‐trained relative to wet laboratory‐trained trainees had shorter operating times in VR settings (MD −1.40 minutes, 95% CI −1.96 to −0.84; 1 study, n = 60) and similar times in wet laboratory settings (MD 0.16 minutes, 95% CI −0.50 to 0.82; 1 study, n = 60). This study also found the VR‐trained trainees had higher VR simulator ratings (MD 5.17, 95% CI 0.61 to 9.73; 1 study, n = 60). Results for supervising physician ratings in the operating room were inconsistent: one study reported that VR‐ and wet laboratory‐trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings for cataract surgery (P = 0.608); another study reported that VR‐trained trainees relative to those without supplementary training were less likely to receive poor ratings by supervising physicians for capsulorhexis construction (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.57). In wet laboratory settings, VR‐trained trainees received similar supervising physician ratings compared with wet laboratory‐trained trainees (MD −1.50, 95% CI −6.77 to 3.77; n = 60) and higher supervising physician ratings compared with trainees without supplementary training (P < 0.0001). However, the results for all secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution because of very low‐certainty evidence.  
Authors' conclusions
Current research suggests that VR training may be more effective than no supplementary training in improving trainee performance in the operating room and simulated settings for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees, but the evidence is uncertain. The evidence comparing VR with conventional or wet laboratory training was less consistent.

Can virtual reality help train eye surgeons for cataract surgery?

Rationale
A cataract is a cloudy lens in the eye. It can make vision blur or dim. Cataract surgery can fix this. It is one of the most common eye surgeries.

Surgeons must train to do this surgery well and safe. Good training can help cut time in surgery. It can also lower the chance of harm.

Many training tools exist. One tool is virtual reality, or VR. VR lets a trainee “practice” surgery on a screen. It feels close to real life, but it is not on a real eye. Another tool is a “wet lab.” In a wet lab, a trainee practices on model eyes or animal eyes.

This study asked a simple question. Does VR training help eye surgery trainees do better? The team looked at time in surgery, problems during surgery, and ratings from senior doctors. They also looked at how trainees scored on the VR tool.

The study is needed to guide training plans. If VR helps, it could make care safer. It could help new surgeons gain skill before they treat you.

Trial Design
This was a review of past trials. The team searched many medical sites for trials up to June 14, 2021. They did not limit by date or by language.

They only used a certain kind of trial. In these trials, trainees went into groups by chance. One group used VR to train. Other groups used a wet lab, lectures, or no extra training. This “by chance” step helps make fair groups.

The review found six trials. In all, 151 eye doctor trainees took part. Each trial had 12 to 60 trainees. Trials took place in the United States, China, Germany, India, and Morocco.

The people in these trials were postgraduate eye doctor trainees. The trials did not state age or sex. The trainees learned types of common cataract surgery. Names in the papers include “phaco” and “manual small cut” surgery. Two trials got money from VR tool makers.

The trials measured:
- Time in the real operating room
- Problems during surgery
- Problems after surgery
- Ratings from senior doctors
- Scores on tasks in VR or lab settings

How long each trainee stayed in a trial was not stated in the abstract.

Results
What did the review find? The results were mixed. Also, the proof was weak. The team could not combine the data across all trials. Many trials were small. Many did not share full numbers. The review judged the proof as very low in certainty. That means we should be careful in how we read it.

Here is what the trials showed.

Operating time in the real operating room:
- One small trial found that VR training cut time in real surgery. Trainees who used VR finished about 17 minutes faster than those with no extra training.
- When VR was compared with wet lab training, results were not the same across trials. One trial found VR took longer than wet lab. Another trial found no clear time difference.

Problems during surgery:
- One trial found fewer problems during surgery for the VR group than for the no extra training group.
- Another trial found similar problem rates for VR and usual non‑VR training.

Problems after surgery:
- The trials planned to look at problems after surgery. The abstract did not give clear results on this point.

Time and scores in practice settings:
- One trial found that VR training made practice runs faster than no extra training.
- Another trial found that VR training led to shorter times in VR practice than wet lab training. In the wet lab itself, both groups took about the same time.
- In that same trial, the VR group had higher scores on the VR tool.

Ratings from senior doctors:
- In the real operating room, one trial found that VR and wet lab groups got similar ratings. Another trial found that the VR group was less likely to get a “poor” rating on a key step than those with no extra training.
- In practice settings, VR and wet lab groups had similar ratings in the wet lab. The VR group had higher ratings than the no extra training group.

How should we read this?
- VR training may help more than no extra training. It may save time. It may lower harm during surgery. It may boost ratings and scores.
- When we compare VR with wet lab training, the results do not agree. Some favor VR. Some favor wet lab. Some show no clear gap.
- The proof is weak. The trials were small. Some got money from VR makers. The methods had limits. Many did not report full data. So we cannot be sure.

What does this mean for patients?
- Training before real surgery helps new surgeons. VR is one way to train. Wet lab is another. Both may help.
- Early signs say VR may help more than no extra training. But we need better trials to know if VR is better than wet lab training.
- For now, training plans may use both VR and wet lab tools. The goal is the same: safer, faster care for people who need cataract surgery.

Investigator conclusion
VR training may help eye surgery trainees, more so than no extra training. But when we compare VR with wet lab training, results are mixed. Better, larger, and clearer trials are needed.","Can virtual reality training for cataract surgery supplement or replace other training methods for ophthalmology trainees? 
Key messagesWe did not find enough evidence to show that virtual reality (VR) training improves cataract surgery performance among ophthalmology trainees compared to wet lab or conventional training. 
What is virtual reality training?VR training uses computer technology to simulate a three‐dimensional interactive environment. 
How does cataract surgery training work in ophthalmology trainees?Most postgraduate ophthalmology trainees in the United States (US) transition gradually from performing specific cataract surgery (replacing the cloudy lens inside the eye with an artificial one) steps in a wet laboratory (practicing on cadaver or artificial tissues) or using VR simulators to performing cataract surgery in the operating room. 
Why is this question important?VR training is becoming increasingly common in postgraduate ophthalmology training, but comprehensive reviews of the impact of VR training on trainees’ cataract surgery performance are lacking. 
What did we want to find out?The primary aim of this review was to determine whether VR training improved operating room performance (measured by operating time in the operating room, intraoperative [during the operation] complications, or postoperative [after the operation] complications) in cataract surgery for postgraduate ophthalmology trainees. The secondary aim was to identify the impact of VR training on operating time in simulated settings, supervising physician ratings in the operating room or simulator settings, or VR simulation task ratings. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence?We searched for studies that compared VR training to other training methods such as traditional wet laboratory training or no supplementary training in a postgraduate ophthalmology trainee population. 
What did we find?VR relative to conventional or wet laboratory training did not impact operating times, the rate of intraoperative complications, or supervising physician ratings in the operating room. However, compared to trainees without supplementary training, VR‐trained trainees received higher supervising physician ratings in the operating room. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. 
What does this mean?VR training is a promising intervention for teaching cataract surgery, but more rigorous, evidence‐based studies are needed to gauge its impact on key outcomes such as intraoperative and postoperative complications.  
How up‐to‐date is the evidence?The evidence is current up to 14 June 2021.

10.1002-14651858.CD013817.pub2,"Background
Glaucoma is a group of optic neuropathies characterized by progressive degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells, axonal loss and irreversible visual field defects. Glaucoma is classified as primary or secondary, and worldwide, primary glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Several subtypes of glaucoma exist, and primary open‐angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common. The etiology of POAG is unknown, but current treatments aim to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP), thus preventing the onset and progression of the disease. Compared with traditional antiglaucomatous treatments, rho kinase inhibitors (ROKi) have a different pharmacodynamic. ROKi is the only current treatment that effectively lowers IOP by modulating the drainage of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal. As ROKi are introduced into the market more widely, it is important to assess the efficacy and potential AEs of the treatment. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of ROKi with placebo or other glaucoma medication in people diagnosed with open‐angle glaucoma (OAG), primary open‐angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). 
Search methods
We used standard Cochrane methods and searched databases on 11 December 2020.
Selection criteria
We included randomized clinical trials examining commercially available ROKi‐based monotherapy or combination therapy compared with placebo or other IOP‐lowering medical treatments in people diagnosed with (P)OAG or OHT. We included trials where ROKi were administered according to official glaucoma guidelines. There were no restrictions regarding type, year or status of the publication. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias by using Cochrane's RoB 2 tool.  
Main results
We included 17 trials with 4953 participants diagnosed with (P)OAG or OHT. Fifteen were multicenter trials and 15 were masked trials. All participants were aged above 18 years. Trial duration varied from 24 hours to 12 months. Trials were conducted in the USA, Canada and Japan. Sixteen trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies, and one trial provided no information about funding sources. The trials compared ROKi monotherapy (netarsudil or ripasudil) or combination therapy with latanoprost (prostaglandin analog) or timolol (beta‐blocker) with placebo, timolol, latanoprost or netarsudil. Reported outcomes were IOP and safety. Meta‐analyses were applied to 13 trials (IOP reduction from baseline) and 15 trials (ocular AEs).  
Of the trials evaluating IOP, seven were at low risk, three had some concerns, and three were at high risk of bias. Three trials found that netarsudil monotherapy may be superior to placebo (mean difference [MD] 3.11 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.59 to 3.62; I2 = 0%; 155 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Evidence from three trials found that timolol may be superior to netarsudil with an MD of 0.66 mmHg (95% CI 0.41 to 0.91; I2 = 0%; 1415 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Evidence from four trials found that latanoprost may be superior to netarsudil with an MD of 0.97 mmHg (95% CI 0.67 to 1.27; I2 = 4%; 1283 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).  
Evidence from three trials showed that, compared with monotherapy with latanoprost, combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost probably led to an additional pooled mean IOP reduction from baseline of 1.64 mmHg (95% CI −2.16 to −1.11; 1114 participants). Evidence from three trials showed that, compared with monotherapy with netarsudil, combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost probably led to an additional pooled mean IOP reduction from baseline of 2.66 mmHg (95% CI −2.98 to −2.35; 1132 participants). The certainty of evidence was moderate. One trial showed that,  compared with timolol monotherapy, combination therapy with ripasudil and timolol may lead to an IOP reduction from baseline of 0.75 mmHg (95% −1.29 to −CI 0.21; 208 participants). The certainty of evidence was moderate. 
Of the trials assessing total ocular AEs, three were at low risk, four had some concerns, and eight were at high risk of bias.  
We found very low‐certainty evidence that netarsudil may lead to more ocular AEs compared with placebo, with 66 more ocular AEs per 100 person‐months (95% CI 28 to 103; I2 = 86%; 4 trials, 188 participants). We found low‐certainty evidence that netarsudil may lead to more ocular AEs compared with latanoprost, with 29 more ocular AEs per 100 person‐months (95% CI 17 to 42; I2 = 95%; 4 trials, 1286 participants).  
We found moderate‐certainty evidence that, compared with timolol, netarsudil probably led to 21 additional ocular AEs (95% CI 14 to 27; I2 = 93%; 4 trials, 1678 participants). Data from three trials (1132 participants) showed no evidence of differences in the incidence rate of AEs between combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost and netarsudil monotherapy (1 more event per 100 person‐months, 95% CI 0 to 3); however, the certainty of evidence was low. Similarly, we found low‐certainty evidence that, compared with latanoprost, combination therapy with netarsudil and latanoprost may cause 29 more ocular events per 100 person‐months (95% CI 11 to 47; 3 trials, 1116 participants). We found moderate‐certainty evidence that, compared with timolol monotherapy, combination therapy with ripasudil and timolol probably causes 35 more ocular events per 100 person‐months (95% CI 25 to 45; 1 trial, 208 participants). In all included trials, ROKi was reportedly not associated with any particular serious AEs. 
Authors' conclusions
The current evidence suggests that in people diagnosed with OHT or (P)OAG, the hypotensive effect of netarsudil may be inferior to latanoprost and slightly inferior to timolol. Combining netarsudil and latanoprost probably further reduces IOP compared with monotherapy. Netarsudil as mono‐ or combination therapy may result in more ocular AEs. However, the certainty of evidence was very low or low for all comparisons except timolol. In general, AEs were described as mild, transient, and reversible upon treatment discontinuation. ROKi was not associated with any particular serious AEs. Future trials of sufficient size and follow‐up should be conducted to provide reliable information about glaucoma progression, relevant IOP measurements and a detailed description of AEs using similar terminology. This would ensure the robustness and confidence of the results and assess the intermediate‐ and long‐term efficacy and safety of ROKi.

Do newer eye drops help lower eye pressure in glaucoma?

Rationale
Glaucoma harms the nerve of the eye. It can steal sight for good. The most common type is open‑angle glaucoma. Some people also have high eye pressure without damage. Doctors call that ocular hypertension.

High eye pressure can speed damage. Lowering pressure can slow or stop harm. Many drops lower pressure. But they work in different ways. We need to know which work best and are safe.

Rho kinase blockers are newer drops. Doctors shorten this to ROKi. They help the eye’s main drain work better. This may lower pressure in a new way. We need to learn how well they work and if they cause problems.

Trial Design
This study was a review of many trials. It looked at 17 trials with 4953 adults. All had open‑angle glaucoma or high eye pressure. Trials took place in the United States, Canada, and Japan. Time in a trial ranged from one day to one year.

People used newer drops or standard drops. The newer drops were netarsudil or ripasudil. Some got these alone. Some got them with latanoprost or timolol. Others got dummy drops with no drug. Many trials hid who got which drops.

Most trials took place at many sites. Most trials had company funding. Men and women took part. All were age 18 or older. The main goal was to see eye pressure and side effects.

Results
Eye pressure is measured in “mmHg.” Think of this as pressure points. Lower points mean lower eye pressure. That is the goal in glaucoma care.

Netarsudil alone lowered pressure more than dummy drops. It lowered pressure by about three points. This means it helped compared to no drug. But it did not beat the best older drops.

Timolol lowered pressure a bit more than netarsudil. The gap was about one point. Latanoprost also lowered pressure more than netarsudil. The gap there was about one point too. These gaps were small but real.

Using two drops together helped some more. Netarsudil plus latanoprost lowered pressure more than latanoprost alone. The extra drop was about one to two points. Netarsudil plus latanoprost also beat netarsudil alone by about two to three points.

One small trial tested ripasudil with timolol. The mix may lower pressure less than one point more than timolol alone. We do not know if that small gain is sure. We need more and longer trials to be clear.

More people had eye side effects with netarsudil. This was true versus dummy drops. It was also true versus timolol or latanoprost. The review did not list the exact types in detail.

The good news is about how bad they were. The trials said these side effects were mild. They went away after people stopped the drops. The review found no clear rise in serious harm with ROKi.

What does this mean for you? Netarsudil can lower pressure. But latanoprost and timolol lower it a bit more. Using netarsudil with latanoprost lowers pressure more than either alone. That mix may help when one drop is not enough.

Safety matters too. More eye side effects happened with netarsudil. Most were not serious and did not last. Still, you should tell your eye doctor if you feel eye problems.

How strong is the proof? Some results were strong. Some were not as strong. Many trials were short or had design limits. Company funding was common. All this means results may change with new trials.

What should happen next? Longer and larger trials should test these drops. They should track sight over time. They should also use the same words for side effects. This will make the results easy to compare.

Bottom line for patients: Lowering eye pressure helps protect sight. Older drops like latanoprost and timolol work well. Netarsudil helps too, but a bit less when used alone. Adding netarsudil to latanoprost can lower pressure more. Side effects with netarsudil are more common but usually mild. Talk with your eye doctor about which plan fits you best.","Rho kinase inhibitors for primary open‐angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension
Question 
What are the benefits and risks of rho kinase inhibitor eye drops to treat people with either glaucoma or increased eye pressure? 
Key messages 
Antiglaucomatous eye drops such as latanoprost and timolol may reduce the eye pressure more compared with treatment with a rho kinase inhibitor, but the difference with timolol is small. When combining rho kinase inhibitors with different types of medicine, the eye pressure may be reduced more. People treated with a rho kinase inhibitor experience more adverse events (side effects) compared with other treatments. Future research in this area should focus on reporting disease progression (how the glaucoma gets worse over time). 
What is glaucoma? 
Glaucoma is a sight‐threatening eye disease that can lead to blindness if left untreated. There are different types of glaucoma and the most common is called primary open‐angle glaucoma. High eye pressure is a known risk factor for developing glaucoma.  
Medical glaucoma treatment 
There are different types of eye drops that can be used to treat glaucoma. All medical treatments of glaucoma work by reducing eye pressure. Latanoprost and timolol are two glaucoma medications, and one of the new types of glaucoma medicine is called a rho kinase inhibitor.  
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to examine whether the effectiveness and safety of rho kinase inhibitor eye drops were better or worse than other medicines. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared:
‐ rho kinase inhibitor with placebo (a treatment with no therapeutic effect);
‐ rho kinase inhibitor with other types of glaucoma treatments (latanoprost and timolol).
Search date  
We searched medical databases on 11 December 2020.
What did we find? 
We found 17 studies examining 4953 people aged at least 18 years diagnosed with primary open‐angle glaucoma or high eye pressure and treated with a rho kinase inhibitor. The studies varied in treatment duration from 24 hours to 12 months. They were conducted in the USA, Canada and Japan. Of the studies, 16  were funded by pharmaceutical companies and one did not provide information about potential funding sources. The effect of treatment was evaluated by measuring the eye pressure and assessing the adverse events of treatment. 
The studies did not report data disease progression, but they reported data on the lowering of the pressure within the eye and adverse events. Treatment with latanoprost may be better than rho kinase inhibitor. Treatment with timolol may be slightly better than treatment with rho kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, treatment with both rho kinase inhibitor and latanoprost or timolol probably reduces the eye pressure even more. Overall, the studies reported adverse events very differently. More people treated with rho kinase inhibitors may have experienced eye‐related adverse events; however, we are not very certain about these findings. There were no serious adverse events reported for treatment with rho kinase inhibitor. 
Main limitations of the evidence 
The studies did not report all the outcomes that we were interested in. The studies focused on specific outcomes such as eye pressure and adverse events, whereas we wanted to answer other questions as well. The current evidence was based on few studies. Some studies were conducted in a way that may have introduced errors into the results. Studies varied in the way they measured the outcomes and thus may not be comparable to each other.

Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is a widely used method to treat renal and ureteral stone. It fragments stones into smaller pieces that are then able to pass spontaneously down the ureter and into the bladder. Alpha‐blockers may assist in promoting the passage of stone fragments, but their effectiveness remains uncertain.  
Objectives
To assess the effects of alpha‐blockers as adjuvant medical expulsive therapy plus usual care compared to placebo and usual care or usual care alone in adults undergoing shock wave lithotripsy for renal or ureteral stones. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive literature search of the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, several clinical trial registries and grey literature for published and unpublished studies irrespective of language. The date of the most recent search was 27 February 2020. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials of adults undergoing SWL. Participants in the intervention group had to have received an alpha‐blocker as adjuvant medical expulsive therapy plus usual care. For the comparator group, we considered studies in which participants received placebo. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion/exclusion, and performed data abstraction and risk of bias assessment. We conducted meta‐analysis for the identified dichotomous and continuous outcomes using RevManWeb according to Cochrane methods using a random‐effects model. We judged the certainty of evidence on a per outcome basis using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 40 studies with 4793 participants randomized to usual care and an alpha‐blocker versus usual care alone. Only four studies were placebo controlled. The mean age of participants was 28.6 to 56.8 years and the mean stone size prior to SWL was 7.1 mm to 13.2 mm. The most widely used alpha‐blocker was tamsulosin; others were silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin and alfuzosin.  
Alpha‐blockers may improve clearance of stone fragments after SWL (risk ratio (RR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.23; I² = 78%; studies = 36; participants = 4084; low certainty evidence). Based on the stone clearance rate of 69.3% observed in the control arm, an alpha‐blocker may increase stone clearance to 80.4%. This corresponds to 111 more (62 more to 159 more) participants per 1000 clearing their stone fragments. 
Alpha‐blockers may reduce the need for auxiliary treatments after SWL (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00; I² = 16%; studies = 12; participants = 1251; low certainty evidence), but also includes the possibility of no effect. Based on a rate of auxiliary treatments in the usual care arm of 9.7%, alpha‐blockers may reduce the rate to 6.5%. This corresponds 32 fewer (53 fewer to 0 fewer) participants per 1000 undergoing auxiliary treatments. 
Alpha‐blockers may reduce major adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.80; I² = 0%; studies = 7; participants = 747; low certainty evidence). Major adverse events occurred in 25.8% of participants in the usual care group; alpha‐blockers would reduce this to 15.5%. This corresponds to 103 fewer (139 fewer to 52 fewer) major adverse events per 1000 with alpha‐blocker treatment. None of the reported major adverse events appeared drug‐related; most were emergency room visits or rehospitalizations. 
Alpha‐blockers may reduce stone clearance time in days (mean difference (MD) –3.74, 95% CI –5.25 to –2.23; I² = 86%; studies = 14; participants = 1790; low certainty evidence). We found no evidence for the outcome of quality of life. 
For those outcomes for which we were able to perform subgroup analyses, we found no evidence of interaction with stone location, stone size or type of alpha‐blocker. We were unable to conduct an analysis by lithotripter type. The results were also largely unchanged when the analyses were limited to placebo controlled studies and those in which participants explicitly only received a single SWL session. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on low certainty evidence, adjuvant alpha‐blocker therapy following SWL in addition to usual care may result in improved stone clearance, less need for auxiliary treatments, fewer major adverse events and a reduced stone clearance time compared to usual care alone. We did not find evidence for quality of life. The low certainty of evidence means that our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

Do relaxer pills help pass stone bits after shock wave treatment?

Rationale
Kidney and ureter stones are hard lumps. They block the flow of urine. They can cause bad pain. They can send people to the ER.

Shock wave care breaks a stone into small bits. Doctors call this shock wave treatment. It sends pulses from outside the body. The small bits then can pass out in the urine.

But some bits still get stuck. This can lead to more pain and more care. People may need another visit or another stone fix.

Alpha‑blockers are relaxer pills. They relax the muscle in the urine tube. This tube links the kidney to the bladder. A loose tube may help stone bits slip out.

The goal of this work was clear. The team asked if these pills help after shock waves. They asked if the pills speed stone pass. They asked if the pills cut the need for more care. They asked if the pills lower bad events.

We need this study for a simple reason. Stones are common and hurt a lot. A safe, cheap pill may help many people. If it works, life may be a bit better.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials. It pulled facts from 40 trials. These trials had 4,793 adult people. All had shock wave care for a kidney or ureter stone.

In these trials, people got pills by chance. Some got an alpha‑blocker plus usual care. Some got only usual care. In four trials, some got a fake pill.

The most used pill was tamsulosin. Some trials used other alpha‑blockers. These were silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin, and alfuzosin.

People were about 29 to 57 years old. They had stones in a kidney or in a ureter. The trials did not state how long each person was in a trial.

The team checked set end points. They looked at how often stones cleared. They looked at time to clear stones. They looked at the need for extra care. They looked at bad events. They looked for any clear harm from the pills.

Results
The pills may help more people pass stone bits. With usual care, about 693 of 1000 people cleared. With a pill, about 804 of 1000 cleared. That is about 111 more people out of 1000.

The pills may cut the need for more stone care. With usual care, about 97 of 1000 needed more care. With a pill, about 65 of 1000 needed more care. That is about 32 fewer people out of 1000. But the team says this result could also be no change.

The pills may lower big problems. With usual care, about 258 of 1000 had a big problem. With a pill, about 155 of 1000 had a big problem. That is about 103 fewer people out of 1000. Big problems were things like ER visits or a new stay in the hospital. These did not seem due to the pill.

The pills may speed up stone pass. People on the pill cleared in about four fewer days. Faster stone pass may mean less pain and less time off work.

The team did not find facts on life quality. We do not know if people felt better day to day. We also do not know the best dose or the best time to start the pill.

They looked at stone spot and size. They looked at type of alpha‑blocker. They saw no clear change in results for these groups. Results were much the same in stricter trials too.

What does this mean for you? If you have shock waves for a stone, a relaxer pill may help. It may raise your chance to pass the bits. It may cut your chance to need more care. It may lower your chance of a big problem. It may help you pass the bits a few days sooner.

But there is a key note of care. The proof here is low strength. The true effect could be more or less than shown. More strong trials would help us be more sure.

Talk with your doctor if this fits your case. Ask about alpha‑blockers after shock wave care. Ask about risks, side effects, and other pills you take. Together, you can pick what is best for you.

In short, alpha‑blockers look helpful for many people. They seem safe in these trials. They may help pass stone bits after shock waves. But we still need better proof to be sure.","After using shock waves to break up kidney stones, do medicines called alpha‑blockers help to get rid of the stone fragments? 
What are kidney stones? 
Waste products in the blood can sometimes form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. These can build up over time to form a hard stone‐like lump, called a kidney stone. 
Kidney stones can develop in both kidneys especially in people with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain medicines, or if people do not drink enough water or fluids. Stones can cause severe pain, fever and a kidney infection if they block the ureter. 
Treatments for kidney stones 
Most stones are small enough to pass out in the urine: drinking plenty of water and other fluids will help. Larger kidney stones may be too big to pass out naturally and are usually removed by surgery. 
Shock wave lithotripsy is a non‐surgical way to treat stones in the kidney or ureter. High energy sound waves are applied to the outside of the body to break kidney stones into smaller pieces. After shock wave treatment, medicines called alpha‐blockers are sometimes given to help the stone fragments pass out naturally. 
Alpha‐blockers work by relaxing muscles and helping to keep blood vessels open. They are usually used to treat high blood pressure and problems with storing and passing urine in men who have an enlarged prostate gland. Alpha‐blockers may relax the muscle in the ureters, which might help to get rid of kidney stones and fragments.              
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
We wanted to find out how well alpha‐blockers work to help kidney stone fragments pass out in the urine. We also wanted to find out about potential unwanted effects that might be associated with alpha‐blockers. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at giving alpha‐blockers to adults, after shock wave treatment, to clear kidney stone fragments. 
We looked for randomized controlled studies, in which the treatments that people received were decided at random, because these studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to 27 February 2020. 
What we found 
We found 40 studies including 4793 people who had shock wave treatment to break up their kidney stones. Most of the studies were done in Asia; some were in Europe, Africa and South America. Most studies did not report their sources of funding. 
The studies compared giving an alpha‐blocker with giving a placebo (dummy) treatment or usual care (could include antibiotics, painkillers and fluids given by mouth or through a drip). 
Tamsulosin was the most commonly studied alpha‐blocker; the others were silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin and alfuzosin. 
What are the results of our review? 
Compared with usual care or a placebo treatment, alpha‐blockers may:
clear kidney stones in more people: in 111 more people for every 1000 people treated (36 studies); 
clear stones faster: by nearly four days (14 studies);
reduce the need for extra treatments to clear stones: in 32 fewer people for every 1000 people treated (12 studies); and 
cause fewer unwanted effects: affecting 103 fewer people for every 1000 people treated (seven studies). 
Most unwanted effects were emergency visits to hospitals, and people going back into hospital for stone related problems. Unwanted effects were more common in people who had usual care or a placebo treatment than in people given alpha‐blockers. 
None of the studies looked at people's quality of life (well‐being).
How reliable are these results? 
We are uncertain about these results because they were based on studies in which it was unclear how people were chosen to take part; it was unclear if results were reported fully; some results were inconsistent and in some studies the results varied widely.  Our results are likely to change if further evidence becomes available. 
Conclusions 
Giving an alpha‐blocker after shock wave treatment to break up kidney stones might clear the fragments faster, in more people and reduce the need for extra treatments. Alpha‑blockers might cause fewer unwanted effects than usual care or a placebo.

10.1002-14651858.CD002779.pub3,"Interventions for treating burning mouth syndrome
Review question 
Which treatments help to relieve symptoms for people with burning mouth syndrome (BMS)?
Background 
BMS is a common painful condition. Symptoms include burning, dryness or uncomfortable sensations in the mouth and changes to taste, with no obvious underlying medical or dental cause. BMS is usually persistent and suffered long term, and can lead to a reduced quality of life (QoL). Currently, scientific research suggests that BMS is caused by underlying damage to the nerves. There are many treatments available including drugs for anxiety, other psychological conditions and increasing saliva production, protective barriers and treatments applied to the mouth surface amongst others. 
Study characteristics 
This review of studies was carried out through Cochrane Oral Health, and the evidence is current up to 31 December 2015. 
We found 23 studies (assessing 1121 people; 83% were women), published between 1995 and 2015 to include in this review. Twenty‐one studies assessed short‐term (up to three months) symptom relief, and four studies assessed long‐term (from three to six months) symptom relief. Seventeen studies provided information about side effect occurrence, seven studies assessed a measure of QoL, and two studies assessed changes in taste and feeling of dryness. 
All of the 23 treatments included in this review were compared to a placebo (fake treatment): antidepressants and antipsychotics (two studies), antiseizure drugs (one study), types of tranquillisers (four studies), saliva stimulants (one study), dietary supplements (12 studies), directed energy waves (one study), physical barriers (one study), psychological therapies (one study), and treatments applied to the mouth surface (five studies). 
Key results 
Short‐term symptom relief  
We found evidence of short‐term symptom relief for directed energy waves (one study, 58 participants), a type of tranquilliser used topically (that is held in the mouth before being removed, and which also acts as an antiseizure drug) called clonazepam (two studies, 111 participants), thin plastic tongue covers (one study, 50 participants), and an antiseizure drug called gabapentin (one study, 100 participants). 
There was no difference in short‐term symptom relief found for antidepressants, saliva stimulants, and another type of tranquilliser used systemically (one that is swallowed) also called clonazepam. We were unable to show whether dietary supplements or treatments applied to the mouth surface provide symptom relief in the short term or not. 
Short‐term relief was not reported for the single study that assessed a psychological therapy. 
Long‐term symptom relief  
We found evidence of long‐term symptom relief for psychological therapy (one study, 30 participants), chili pepper mouthrinse (one study, 18 participants) and the topical tranquilliser called clonazepam (one study, 66 participants). 
We found there was no difference in long‐term symptom relief for dietary supplements or treatments applied to the mouth surface. 
Studies which assessed antidepressants, directed energy waves, saliva stimulants, antiseizure drugs, or physical barriers did not evaluate long‐term symptom relief. 
Change in QoL  
There was evidence of short‐term improvement in QoL for directed energy waves (one study, 58 patients), although no difference was found for antidepressants, tranquillisers, dietary supplements and physical barriers. No study assessed long‐term QoL changes. 
Change in taste or feeling of dryness  
A few studies assessed short‐term change in taste or feeling of dryness (none evaluated these outcomes long‐term), but there was not enough evidence to judge the effects of treatment on these outcomes. 
Side effects  
Side effects were more likely to be experienced with antidepressants (dizziness and drowsiness more likely: one study, 37 people), and with a dietary supplement called alpha lipoic acid (also known as ALA) with or without other ingredients (headaches more likely: two studies, 118 people; and upset stomachs more likely: three studies, 138 people). 
Quality of the evidence  Overall, we found very low‐quality evidence for each short‐ and long‐term outcome we investigated (symptom relief; changes in QoL, taste and feeling of dryness; and side effects) in all types of assessed treatment: antidepressants and antipsychotics, antiseizure drugs, types of tranquillisers, saliva stimulants, dietary supplements, directed energy waves, physical barriers (except side effects, which was assessed as low quality), psychological therapies, and treatments applied to the mouth surface. As we found so few studies at low risk of bias, we are currently unable to prove or disprove the effectiveness of any treatments for managing BMS.

What treatments can help with burning mouth pain?

Rationale
Burning mouth syndrome, or BMS, causes mouth burn, dry feel, or odd taste.
Doctors do not find a clear cause on exam.
It can last a long time and harm daily life.
Many experts think it comes from nerve damage.

People try many ways to ease the pain.
These include mood drugs, calm drugs, and seizure drugs.
Some use mouth rinses, gels, thin plastic tongue covers, or talk therapy.
Some take diet pills or use energy aimed at the mouth.

But which ways truly help, and for how long?
We also need to know about harms from each way.
This study brings past trials together to guide care.
It helps show what may work and what does not.

Trial Design
This was a review of many trials.
A review means the team read and summed up all good studies.
They looked for studies up to the end of 2015.
The work came from Cochrane Oral Health.

They found 23 studies with 1,121 people.
About five in six people were women.
The studies ran from 1995 to 2015.
All people had burning mouth syndrome.

Most studies looked at short term relief up to three months.
A few studies looked at longer relief from three to six months.
Some studies checked side effects and daily life impact.
A few checked taste or dry mouth changes.

All treatments were matched with a fake treatment.
A fake treatment looks real but has no active drug.
The team grouped treatments by type.
They also noted how each treatment was used.

Types were:
- Mood or mind drugs.
- Seizure drugs.
- Calm drugs, used by mouth or held in the mouth.
- Saliva boosters.
- Diet pills, like alpha lipoic acid.
- Energy waves aimed at the mouth.
- Thin plastic tongue covers.
- Talk therapy.
- Treatments put on the mouth surface.

Results
Short term relief had some signs of help for a few options.
Energy waves showed relief in one study with 58 people.
A calm drug called clonazepam helped when held in the mouth.
This was seen in two studies with 111 people.

Thin plastic tongue covers helped in one study with 50 people.
A seizure drug called gabapentin helped in one study with 100 people.
No short term relief was seen for mood drugs.
No short term relief was seen for saliva boosters.

Swallowed clonazepam did not help short term.
We could not tell if diet pills helped short term.
We could not tell if surface mouth treatments helped short term.
The one talk therapy study did not report short term relief.

Longer relief had signs of help for a few options.
Talk therapy helped in one study with 30 people.
A chili pepper mouth rinse helped in one study with 18 people.
Held-in-the-mouth clonazepam helped in one study with 66 people.

For long term relief, diet pills did not help.
Surface mouth treatments did not help long term.
Other types did not test long term relief.
So we do not know their long term effects.

Daily life scores had one helpful finding.
Energy waves helped daily life in one study with 58 people.
Mood drugs, calm drugs, diet pills, and tongue covers did not help.
No study checked daily life at long term.

Taste and dry mouth change were rarely checked.
A few studies looked at them for the short term.
The data were too small to judge real change.
No study checked them for the long term.

Some treatments had more side effects than fake treatment.
Mood drugs caused more dizzy and more sleepy feelings.
This was seen in one study with 37 people.
A diet pill called alpha lipoic acid caused more headaches and upset stomach.

Headaches were seen in two studies with 118 people.
Upset stomach was seen in three studies with 138 people.
For tongue covers, harms were not more than fake treatment.
For other types, harms were not clear.

How strong is this proof?
The proof we have is very weak.
Many studies were small or had weak methods.
So we cannot be sure these results will hold.

What does this mean for you?
A few options may help for a short time.
These include energy waves, held-in-the-mouth clonazepam, tongue covers, and gabapentin.
For longer help, talk therapy, chili rinse, and held-in-the-mouth clonazepam may help.
But we need larger, better trials to be sure.

If you have BMS, talk with your care team.
Ask about short term and long term goals.
Ask about side effects and how to use each treatment.
Pick a plan that fits your needs and values.

More high quality research is needed.
Future trials should run longer than six months.
They should track daily life, taste, and dry mouth.
They should also track side effects well.","Interventions for treating burning mouth syndrome

10.1002-14651858.CD015270,"Background
Vaccines are effective in preventing severe COVID‐19, a disease for which few treatments are available and which can lead to disability or death. Widespread vaccination against COVID‐19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. In addition, new and vaccine‐resistant mutations of SARS‐CoV‐2 may be less likely to develop if the spread of COVID‐19 is limited. Different vaccines are now widely available in many settings. However, vaccine hesitancy is a serious threat to the goal of nationwide vaccination in many countries and poses a substantial threat to population health. This scoping review maps interventions aimed at increasing COVID‐19 vaccine uptake and decreasing COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy.  
Objectives
To scope the existing research landscape on interventions to enhance the willingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID‐19, increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy, and to map the evidence according to addressed populations and intervention categories.   
Search methods
We searched Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index), WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, PsycINFO, and CINAHL to 11 October 2021.  
Selection criteria
We included studies that assess the impact of interventions implemented to enhance the willingness of different populations to be vaccinated against COVID‐19, increase vaccine uptake, or decrease COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised studies of intervention (NRSIs), observational studies and case studies with more than 100 participants. Furthermore, we included systematic reviews and meta‐analyses. We did not limit the scope of the review to a specific population or to specific outcomes assessed. We excluded interventions addressing hesitancy towards vaccines for diseases other than COVID‐19. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were analysed according to a protocol uploaded to the Open Science Framework. We used an interactive scoping map to visualise the results of our scoping review. We mapped the identified interventions according to pre‐specified intervention categories, that were adapted to better fit the evidence. The intervention categories were: communication interventions, policy interventions, educational interventions, incentives (both financial and non‐financial), interventions to improve access, and multidimensional interventions. The study outcomes were also included in the mapping. Furthermore, we mapped the country in which the study was conducted, the addressed population, and whether the design was randomised‐controlled or not.  
Main results
We included 96 studies in the scoping review, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. We did not identify any relevant systematic reviews. For an overview, please see the interactive scoping map (https://tinyurl.com/2p9jmx24).   
Studies with published results 
Of the 61 studies with published results, 46 studies were RCTs and 15 NRSIs. The interventions investigated in the studies were heterogeneous with most studies testing communication strategies to enhance COVID‐19 vaccine uptake. Most studies assessed the willingness to get vaccinated as an outcome. The majority of studies were conducted in English‐speaking high‐income countries. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. Populations that were addressed were diverse. For example, studies targeted healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, at‐risk patients, or the general population.  
Ongoing studies 
Of the 35 ongoing studies, 29 studies are RCTs and six NRSIs. Educational and communication interventions were the most used types of interventions. The majority of ongoing studies plan to assess vaccine uptake as an outcome. Again, the majority of studies are being conducted in English‐speaking high‐income countries. In contrast to the studies with published results, most ongoing studies will not be conducted online. Addressed populations range from minority populations in the USA to healthcare workers or students. Eleven ongoing studies have estimated completion dates in 2022.   
Authors' conclusions
We were able to identify and map a variety of heterogeneous interventions for increasing COVID‐19 vaccine uptake or decreasing vaccine hesitancy. Our results demonstrate that this is an active field of research with 61 published studies and 35 studies still ongoing. This review gives a comprehensive overview of interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake and can be the foundation for subsequent systematic reviews on the effectiveness of interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake.  
A research gap was shown for studies conducted in low and middle‐income countries and studies investigating policy interventions and improved access, as well as for interventions addressing children and adolescents. As COVID‐19 vaccines become more widely available, these populations and interventions should not be neglected in research.

Ways to help people choose the COVID-19 shot: what research shows

Rationale
COVID-19 can cause severe illness. It can lead to long term harm or death. Safe shots can keep people from getting very sick. But some people still wait or say no to the shot.

Some people fear side effects. Some do not trust the system. Some lack clear facts in plain words. This wait or doubt is called “hesitancy.”

When more people get the shot, fewer people get sick. It may also slow new virus changes. That can help protect people who cannot get the shot yet.

This study asked a simple question. What actions help people say yes to the COVID-19 shot? The team also asked which groups these actions help. They looked for gaps. They hoped this map of actions could guide next steps.

Trial Design
This was a “scoping review.” That means the team did not test a new drug or shot. They did not enroll patients. They looked at many other studies. They set out to map what kinds of actions were tried.

The team searched major study lists to October 11, 2021. They looked for studies that tested ways to raise shot rates. Or to raise the will to get the shot. Or to lower doubt about the shot. They did not limit by age, sex, or health status.

They included many study types. These were randomized trials, non-random trials, and other study forms. A randomized trial means the team uses a fair draw to put people in groups. A non-random trial does not use a fair draw. They also planned to include review papers. But they did not find relevant review papers.

The team also grouped the actions. They placed each action into a clear type. These types were: clear talk, policy rules, education, rewards, help with access, and mixed plans. They also noted who the studies aimed to help, where they took place, and what results they checked.

There was no time in a study for a person here. This is because this scoping review did not enroll people. It only mapped what others had done.

Results
The team found 96 studies. Of these, 61 had results to share. In those, 46 were randomized trials. Fifteen were not randomized. Thirty five studies were still in progress.

Many studies tested clear talk. Clear talk means messages that explain the shot in simple ways. Some used email, texts, or web posts. Many took place online. Many were done in rich countries where most people speak English.

The studies looked at many groups. Some aimed to help health staff. Some aimed to help people in the USA who are from minority groups. Some aimed to help students, soldiers, or people at higher risk. Some asked the public at large.

Most studies checked if people were willing to get the shot. Fewer checked if people went on to get the shot. Among new studies, many plan to check actual shot rates. Many new studies will take place face to face, not online.

The team used six action types. Clear talk was common. Education was also common. Policy rules were rare. Steps to make access easier were also less common. Rewards used money or no money gifts. Mixed plans used more than one step at once.

The study found a big gap. Few studies came from less wealthy countries. Few studies tested policy rules or steps to ease access. Few studies focused on kids or teens. As shots spread, these areas need more work.

What does this mean for patients? This map shows that many teams are trying to help people choose the shot. It shows what kinds of steps they use. It shows which groups they aim to help. It shows where we still need more proof.

This map can guide next steps. It can help plan strong trials. It can help leaders pick the best steps to test next. It can help health teams choose clear words that build trust.

The team did not judge which action works best. That was not the goal here. The goal was to show the range of actions and where they were tried. The team says that next, we need full reviews that test how well each action works.

In short, this is an active field. There are 61 studies with results and 35 more on the way. Many test clear talk and education tools. More work is needed on rules, access, kids, and less wealthy places.

Better plans can help more people feel ready to get the shot. That can keep more people safe from severe COVID-19. It can help protect our homes, schools, and towns. This review helps point the way.","Interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake 
Background 
Vaccines are effective in preventing death or severe illness from COVID‐19, a disease for which few treatments are available. Widespread vaccination against COVID‐19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. However, many people do not want to get vaccinated against COVID‐19. This can put them at increased risk of severe disease and death. 
What was our aim? 
We wanted to find out which interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake have been or are currently evaluated.  
Methods 
We searched medical databases and trial registries until the 11 of October 2021. We included all studies investigating interventions to increase COVID‐19 vaccine uptake. We excluded studies looking at other vaccines, for example, measles. We included all forms of studies as long as they had more than 100 participants.  
Once we found the studies, we categorised the interventions into the following groups: communication interventions, policy interventions, interventions to improve access, educational interventions, incentives, and multidimensional interventions. We summarised the results in an interactive scoping map. Furthermore, we mapped the study outcomes, the country in which the study was conducted, the study population, and the study design. 
Results 
We included 96 studies in evidence mapping, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. The interventions tested in these studies are very diverse. Many studies used communication strategies to convince people to get vaccinated against COVID‐19.  Interventions that included information on vaccination or a mixture of different strategies were also often used.  
A majority of studies were conducted in English‐speaking countries of the global north, for example, the USA. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. The populations addressed varied across the studies. For example, studies addressed healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, villagers, at‐risk patients, or the general population.  
For an overview, please see the interactive scoping map (https://tinyurl.com/2p9jmx24).   
Conclusion 
We identified a large number of studies that investigate how COVID‐19 vaccine uptake might be increased. However, more studies are needed focusing on lower‐middle‐income countries and on children. Future research should compare the effectiveness of different interventions to improve COVID‐19 vaccine uptake.
